"gogoschka-1","REVISITING PROMETHEUS","11 March 2018","It appears many film fans - particularly fans of the ALIEN franchise - dislike PROMETHEUS with a passion, and some of the criticism the film gets is certainly justified. My own issues with PROMETHEUS are mostly script related; several characters seem surprisingly bland or underwritten, which could be due to the many rewrites the script went through, or because some scenes and dialogue that would have been important for the audience to understand the characters' motivations were cut from the final film for time. So PROMETHEUS undoubtedly has its share of problems, but I'm not interested in listing those; there are already whole blogs and even websites dedicated to PROMETHEUS' flaws. Instead, I would like to try to make a case for the things the film does well, because I believe there are some really nice ideas and concepts in PROMETHEUS that deserve to be appreciated. Once you disregard the science aspects (which are presented in such an annoyingly over-simplified way that they appear laughable), and instead approach PROMETHEUS as a sci-fi/mystery/monster movie - which, by the way, is how I view all ALIEN films - with some smarter than average twists, it delivers. Now before you start yelling at me, please hear me out.

The first thing I would like to talk about - also because it's the aspect I love the most about PROMETHEUS - is how the ancient Greek saga about the creation and evolution of humankind is woven into the story. I've often wondered why so many people who dislike the film claim to do so on the grounds of it not giving any answers, when it so clearly does: they may not be spelled out in detail, but in broad strokes, they are (nearly) all there in the title. In Greek mythology, Prometheus was the titan who created (or ""engineered"") mankind. But he did much more than that; he became mankind's greatest benefactor and protector; he visited his creation again and again and helped the humans evolve by bringing them knowledge (which he did against the will of the gods) - and he ultimately even stole the secret of fire from the gods and gave it to humankind, which is the moment in their mythology/history that the ancient Greeks saw as the dawn of civilization.

In the ancient tale, Zeus was so enraged by Prometheus' betrayal - and mankind's greatest gain in knowledge - that he subsequently wanted to wipe Prometheus' creation from the face of the earth. His elaborate plan on how to achieve that goal involved sending a certain box to the humans - the infamous Pandora's Box - which, once opened, would unleash hell upon humankind. In the film PROMETHEUS it is implied that the creation of humankind is something the ""engineers"" (aka the gods) also regret - most likely because in a similar story beat as in the Prometheus saga, the engineer ""monks"" we witness at the beginning of the film help mankind attain too much knowledge (which, as our species' shockingly violent history proves, we humans ultimately always end up using to build weapons to murder one another in ever greater numbers). So consequently, for reasons Zeus would probably understand, the engineers end up declaring humankind as a failed experiment that needs to be terminated: and what better way to do that than with bio-weapons sent to Earth that function like little ""Pandora's boxes""?

Another strong similarity between PROMETHEUS' engineers and the ancient Greek gods - in addition to the fact that the engineers obviously look very much like Greek statues of Greek gods - is that both are portrayed as being just as flawed as the humans. The gods in Greek mythology have all the character traits of ordinary people: they fight, they lust, they hate - and they make mistakes. What I absolutely loved in PROMETHEUS (because I found it darkly funny too) is that the engineers ultimately are no better than we are. They create bio-weapons they don't really know how to control: and they eff up big time before they get to destroy the humans, and they get wiped out by their own weapons. Their technology may be very advanced, but they haven't exactly reached a state of wisdom and transcendence, and the big question doctors Shaw and Holloway want to ask them will not get a satisfying answer for that very reason. This is something the android David instantly understands (which is another smart idea in the film), because he was created by humankind, and HE certainly never got a satisfying answer from us why HE was created, which is something he remarks upon to Holloway.

And David is also very aware that the humans don't treat him, their creation, as their equal; they are either condescending towards him or treat him with contempt: so why should the engineers feel and behave any different towards the humans? And knowing his human creators doesn't seem to have inspired a lot of respect for them in David, and he clearly isn't in awe of them - on the contrary; David actually sees himself as the superior being. This is hinted at when Holloway insensitively remarks: ""They're making you guys pretty close (to humans), huh?"" to which David responds with an icy smile: ""Not too close, I hope."" And yet, because David was created in the image of the humans (just like the humans were created in the image of the gods aka ""the engineers""), he is so very much like them. David may lack human empathy and a conscience, but we learn early in the film that he is every bit as curious in his own way as Shaw and Holloway are. Only where Shaw is naive, he is reckless; like a child exploring the world around him, he wants to know how everything functions, but his quest for knowledge is not hindered by ethics or a strong moral compass. So it shouldn't surprise us that in the next darkly ironic twist, David, very much like the humans who created him and the engineers who created the humans, conducts his own little experiment. He too wants to create something new ""just because he can"".

And in the last (and perhaps meanest) twist of the film, we learn how right David was in his assessment of the engineers' probable mindset regarding humankind, when the last surviving engineer is revealed to have nothing but contempt for the ""things"" his kind has created. Instead of giving them answers, he just swipes them away like bothersome flies. So, upon closer inspection, the film is actually almost beat for beat a retelling (or darkly funny modern continuation) of the Prometheus saga, - as well as a clever exploration of the dynamics between creator and creation - and in that regard the film works surprisingly well.

On a side note, there's another story element in the film that is worth mentioning (although it will probably only be appreciated by film geeks and sci-fi nerds such as myself), because it's one that's virtually identical to a very important part of the narrative in another sci-fi film by Ridley Scott. In PROMETHEUS, Peter Weyland's life-span is nearing its end, and so he's travelling through space in a desperate attempt to find his creator and ask him for more life. Sound familiar? Of course it does: in Ridley Scott's BLADE RUNNER (1982), a group of androids (in the film they are called ""replicants"") who are used as slaves off-world, manage to escape to Earth. They're led by Roy Batty (played by Rutger Hauer) whose life is about to end. By design, the life-span of replicants is limited to only a couple of years, so Roy Batty is desperate to find his creator, Eldon Tyrell, to ask him for more life. Now in PROMETHEUS, Ridley Scott and Damon Lindelof cleverly reverse the situation and put the human character in the unfortunate position the replicants from BLADE RUNNER find themselves in. And it's not just any human character who has to share the fate of the androids from the earlier film: Weyland is a creator of artificial life much in the same way Eldon Tyrell is in BLADE RUNNER: he is his exact counterpart in the ALIEN franchise. That story element seems to be a clear nod to Scott's cyberpunk classic, which is another little detail I liked in the film.

So, to conclude my musings in defense of this often derided film: the way I see it, PROMETHEUS' biggest mistake (apart from the uneven character work in the script) is pretending to be straight ""hard"" sci-fi, which it clearly isn't. What it is, though, is a beautiful looking sci-fi/mystery movie which plays with some very clever concepts, but remembers a little late in the story that it also wants to be a monster movie. And while it may be a flawed film, it's full of interesting ideas and certainly more original than 95% of the sci-fi/mystery/monster films that came out over the last 25 years - plus on a purely visual level, it's a feast. As far as I'm concerned, it deserves another look.

P.S. For those who are interested, this review was a much abbreviated version of an in-depth look at the film (which also provides answers to its most prominent questions), and you can find the full piece here: reelhounds.com/prometheus-revisited

"BJBatimdb","Where no idiot has gone before","5 June 2012","Prometheus is the story of a trillion-dollar mission to discover the origins of human life on a distant planet. Basically, this is supposed to be the greatest exploration undertaken in the history of mankind.

So who do they send? A gaggle of fractious goons whose collective scientific nous is rivalled only by that of the Three Stooges. Within minutes of touching down (conveniently beside the only 'man-made' structures on the planet, a'la 1960s Star Trek) the 'scientists' are yanking off their helmets, on the basis of 'it seems fine to me', dipping their fingers into strange organic ooze, and lugging a severed alien head back to an unquarantined spaceship in a sandwich bag.

Once there, they speedily discover the meaning of life. Then, while one of them gets a bit drunk, his two female companions decide it would be useful to stimulate the head electrically to reanimate it. They don't say why. They give it a bit too much juice, then too little,then dither over too much or too little like a couple of schoolgirls fiddling with a dicky bunsen burner, while the most important scientific discovery in human history waggles its ears and rolls its eyes - before eventually blowing up like a frog in a microwave.

Are the scientists abashed? Is the man angry? Do they all calm down and remember they have degrees in clever things, not diplomas in macramé? Do they heck.

The WHOLE MOVIE is a litany of ludicrous so-called science, schoolboy errors, and pseudo-profundity about the origin of species. Ironic really, when none of the crew would have a chance in hell in any sort of contest governed by Darwinian rules.

Crass stupidity is rampant in every department. Hi-tech helmets record every heartbeat - apparently until anything worth recording happens; stranded crewmates are abandoned to their fate in favour of a quick shag, and the spaceship door is opened to anyone who comes a-knocking. Although, after hitting the 'welcome' button, Idris Elba does do a double take and go 'Hold on a second!' but that might have just been an involuntary ad lib at his own character's baffling idiocy.

There is spectacular cinematography and effects, but not one iota of originality has been squandered on plot, subtext, tension or characters - which are as shallow as the Prometheus's muddy little gene pool.

Ridley Scott is a hero of mine, but Prometheus is not the intelligent, emotionally satisfying prequel that Alien deserves. It's a derisory, empty experience - and anyone who loved Alien is surely too old and too smart to be fobbed off with something this bad just because it's shiny.","1"
"SnakesOnAnAfricanPlain","Prometheus (2012)","13 September 2012","Prometheus seems to have disappointed many viewers. Luckily for me I had no expectations, despite being a Scott film set in the same universe as the Alien franchise. The ship Prometheus goes looking for the beginning of mankind and what created us. It's a rather ambitious idea and the film should be given credit for trying to have some kind of theological and scientific debate. Unfortunately, the script also feels as though it has to give us the scares and frights that we associate with the Alien films. The majority of the film is intriguing but for every positive there is a negative. We get fascinating characters such as David, Vickers, and Janek. But they are mostly pushed aside to focus on the stupid scientist characters. Did the writers not realise how bad their work was? Rapace refuses to let one character take weapons on an expedition because it is a ""scientific"" mission. I call BS on that. No scientist would be so stupid as to explore a new planet, with no information on said planet, without a bit of protection. Characters decide to do stupid stuff, such as approach viscous looking new species etc. and it is here where the film annoyed me. The set design was beautiful, and I enjoyed the quieter moments the film had to offer, such as David's trying to understand emotions etc. The most interesting ideas the film has are delivered in single lines of dialogue, but are never explored. It's head and shoulders above many science fiction films of late, but it also needs a few sequels to clear things up. Unfortunately, that means it wasn't so great as a stand alone film.","7"
"danielcereto","Prometheus extended version","7 May 2020","I just rewatched Prometheus after watching previously the four Alien movies and I enjoyed more than the first time. The reason is because the extended version of 2 hours 31 minutes it's far better that the theatrical cut. More answers are shown and overall the movie script is better. So, if you want to give it a second chance to this, go for it. You won't regret.","8"
"michael-albertsen","Ridley Scott forgot everything about great movies except for the craft","31 May 2012","I'm really sorry, but this a major disappointment.

No, I didn't expect miracles or something close to the original Alien. I've been following Scott for 30 years - and it's clear that he has been on the decline since Gladiator and Black Hawk Down.

I liked a few of his later movies like A Good Year - but most have been rather flat and uninspired.

One thing I've noticed, is that he's gotten increasingly complacent with his own ""point of view"" in terms of historical facts and how things work in reality. It's like he has a complete disregard for plausible motivations or factual information about how things work.

Case in point - there's a scene in the movie where a certain character has to have an operation performed on her body - and it involves slicing directly through the skin and muscle-tissue of her abdomen. After the procedure, she's simply ""stitched together"" by metal clips in like 3 seconds - and with a bit of local anesthetic, she continues to move and jump about with some moaning. Ehm, you CAN'T have any kind of normal movement with your muscle tissue completely severed - and there was absolutely no healing involved. Just one of a series of ridiculous events.

The plot is entirely juvenile and cliché stuff with ""profound"" questions like who created us. For some reason, the beings who created us also want to kill us - and it seems to involve incredibly elaborate genetic engineering that also happened to kill most of them in their remote ""lab facility"". They're CLEARLY much more powerful than we are - and they could just bomb the hell out of us, or do it in a thousand simpler ways. But no, they seem to want to utilize excessively elaborate and dangerous genetic modification or infestation - that they can't even control.

They also like to record recent events with some kind of holographic recorder device that is unable to render clear images, only some cool ghostly images that I bet Scott loved to play with. But they're quite flexible in how they let you play recordings of their security procedure - so you can access their systems without effort.

Characters are void of personality and growth, they're REALLY stupid - and they like to freak out for no reason, and they like to stay calm and playful when there IS a reason - like when encountering a nasty looking cobra-worm - an alien - for the first time in history.

Among these faceless people - we have some willing to gleefully commit suicide by ramming an alien ship, because they like their captain, and they're required to do so because he ""can't fly worth a damn"" - despite him being the primary pilot hired by a billionaire to do nothing but fly the ship.

We have a religious scientist who concludes that she's found our creators, based on: ""It's what I choose to believe"".

Then we have the very same religious scientist look at an alien ""head"" they brought back - and she notices some strange growth on it. She then spends 2 seconds thinking and concludes that this is obviously some kind of ""foreign cells"" (impressive deduction, I must say) - and she decides to stimulate the cells with electricity - just to see what happens. No research - no caution - no nothing.

We have people who decide to open the door to their ship, seemingly with no thought process, despite having just faced complete chaos by extremely hostile alien forces - because one of their crew mates seems to be lying in front of the door. This while other crew mates have just been taken over by some kind of alien infestation.

Then we have the boyfriend of said religious scientist (a douche) who decides that the air in an alien environment is safe to breathe because his device tells him it is - and he immediately removes his helmet. A classic Hollywood scientist moment, and clearly there's no need to worry about biological contaminants in a place like that.

This movie is FULL of this kind of utterly implausible behavior and random decisions.

It has a couple of ""for effect"" gore scenes - but Scott manages to include ZERO tension along with them. As a result, they're mildly disgusting - but they have no lasting effect whatsoever.

The ""aliens"" that are a part of this movie all look like plastic - because of overly smooth and pale skin. They look like Lovecraft creatures without a much-needed paint-job.

We have a horribly predictable, pointless and wasted twist involving Guy Pearce and a certain other cast member.

We have an android, well-acted by Fassbender, who seems to be fully random in his decisions and motivations. Few actions made sense in any context - not to me anyway.

The music was overwrought and didn't fit with the mood of the film, and it seemed like one theme being repeated endlessly. A surprise, given Scott's usual flair for good music.

I think Lindelof is a complete and total hack - who only got the job because he was the ""yes-man"" who could match Scott's ego. This is pretty obvious in interviews - where Lindelof always manages to publicly kiss Scott's behind.

1 Star for Fassbender's performance.

1 Star for the amazingly detailed visuals.

1 Star for how the above combine to form the excellent beginning.

Now, it's just a matter of leaning back - musing over a thousand different people coming up with a thousand different explanations - each being the ""correct"" interpretation of this deep and thought-provoking masterpiece.

Going by the IMDb rating, I can do nothing but stay mesmerized by how efficient it is to rely on the ""Emperor's New Clothes"" effect and let hype do the rest. Stay real Scott, Lindelof and Hollywood.","3"
"nogodnomasters","Plot Spoiler review. I tell you why....I think.","27 February 2018","The writers intended this to be an ""Alien"" prequel by incorporating ""Chariots of Gods"" into the film, although some might question the timeline. They concentrated on creating a special effects film, putting science facts on the back burner. It's basically 60's science fiction with great special effects.

Earth has been visited by aliens who created us, and leave a calling card. Instead of traveling to a moon of Jupiter like in 2001, we travel to a distant ""galactic system"" to a moon of a planet that looks like Saturn. The year is 2091, the crew is placed in suspended animation for a trip that takes 3 years, nearest star is 4.5 light years away. Sirius is the star frequently indicated as that ""ancient"" alien connection. It is 11 light years away. The writers needed to do the math.

In this ""2091: A Space Odyssey"" tale, HAL is replaced by an android named David (Michael Fassbender) who like HAL has his own orders. When they get to the planet it turns into a special effects sci-fi horror as man tries to find his ""creator."" Noomi Rapace provides us the only decent human performance in this film. In fact she was so good at one point they called her character, Dr. Elizabeth Shaw, ""Noomi"" in the film. They are either paying tribute to the famous Carrie Fischer ""Star Wars"" blooper, or their film editor is Ed Wood.

The dialogue was written in such a way that it lacked entertainment value. It needed to be lighter. The theme of creating life, so that it is not special, bogged down the film. In case you are unaware, the earliest common human language was believed to be a form of ""click"" language. I waited for Fassbender to start clicking when he spoke the alien language to show me the extensive research the writers did. It didn't happen.

Why is there always some idiot who takes off his helmet to test the air in these films? It's not the oxygen, its the foreign microbes, stupid!

Great movie to let the teens go see. Yes, I liked the film, but the writers were a let down. The good news is we can gut part of the voice track and do over the text and make it science fiction presentable without any re-shooting. Heck we might even add a joke or two... ""These two earthlings, one an android, land on this alien planet and say, ""Why did you create us?""....

SPOILER: And if you haven't figured it out from watching 3 movies...the reason why we were created is to generate a species genetically similar to the ""creators"" so they could test their biological weapons out on us, i.e. those alien critters.

Parental Guide: 1 f-bomb, 2 people in bed, near sex, no nudity, brief hot chicks. This would easy have been a 5 star movie had the writers did their homework. BTW, I just removed my own appendix, I am going out now to do some dirt biking.","6"
"Rob_Taylor","It's official....scientists of the future are stupid!","4 June 2012","I had high hopes for this movie. Ridley Scott, Alien, yada yada. It all seemed so promising. Perhaps the highlight of the scifi movie calender this year.

Oh well, more hopes dashed.

First, the good things. The cinematography, acting, special effects and everything to do with the film-making process are all better than average or excellent.

The writing, however, is entirely another matter. Those who have read even a few of my reviews know I hate one thing above all else. Insulting the intelligence of the audience.

Prometheus, sadly, does this again and again.

Having been sent off into space on an expedition (which most of the crew and scientists don't even know the purpose of - how did they sell that to them? Sign on for this expedition without knowing what you're getting into!) our heroes are briefed on arrival in a scene that was almost a copy of the marines briefing from Aliens, right down to the barracking and disbelief of the listeners.

I don't know about you, but being told I might find the creators of our own species would get me excited, not lead to pour scorn on the speaker. But anyway, our scientist heroes duly land on the planet and find an alien structure. On going in and finding the air breathable, the first thing a supposed intelligent scientist does (on an alien world, remember.) is take their helmet off. FAIL!

After having mapped the majority of the structure remotely, two scientists then get lost on their way back to the ship and never once think to ask for directions, or call out for assistance, even though their comms devices are working just fine. EPIC FAIL!

Later on these two discover a small alien creature. Their first reaction. To go up and prod at it with their hands. DARWIN AWARD FAIL!

You see where I'm going with this? All of the above takes place within forty minutes or so. And it doesn't get much better for the rest of the film.

Remember, these aren't clueless freighter jocks as in Alien. They aren't dumb grunts as in Aliens. They aren't dumb-enough-to-get-caught criminals as in Alien 3 and they aren't gung-ho pseudo-mercs as in Alien Resurrection. They are supposed to be intelligent scientists.

I'm not saying the writing is bad. I'm saying it is pitiful! It's like when you watch a horror movie of the slasher variety. You know the characters are going to do dumb-ass stuff like this. But you don't expect it in a scifi movie to this extent. Especially not one helmed by Ridley Scott.

It's a shame, because everything else about the film is beautifully done. But the writing is inept and insulting, forcing characters to do ridiculous actions for the sake of the plot. Here's an idea Damon Lindelof.... how about you write the plot around the actions of the characters, and not the other way around! Thanks for taking a somewhat off-the-wall franchise and tarring it mercilessly with the Hollywood action-blockbuster brush of sloppiness! As far as the franchise goes, I'd actually rate this below both Alien 3 AND AVP, though not below AVP2, which remains the shitty mud at the bottom of the celluloid rain-barrel.

In short then, a wasted opportunity ruined by abysmal writing and characterization. Watch it for the pretties and try REALLY hard not to think about it too much.","7"
"yogsottoth","You too, Ridley?","3 June 2012","SUCKED BIG TIME! The story was all over the place, most of the characters were completely unnecessary and underdeveloped, and there were no creatures to talk about really. I wasn't even tensed up for a second, let alone being scared.

Can you imagine a biologist guy, signed up for a mission to explore a different race, shitting his pants and literally leaving the scene at the first sight of an alien body that's been dead for 2000 years? Well, Ridley Scott could. However, the same guy goes ape schit over a real, moving alien cobra-thing and wants to cuddle her! Perfectly consistent character writing! And what the hell was that android guy trying to do with his plots and schemes? What was your plan? Who actually did you serve? And Shaw who did nothing to fill in Ripley's shoes... She attacks the crew, performs a surgery -I'm not even gonna touch that one- that probably overthrows a plan in motion, comes out covered in blood and no one even says ""Hey! What the heck?"" and they go on another expedition together? And what was that space jockey's problem!? Relax, dude!! I mean you have to be a really mean bastard, consumed with rage to come out of a crashed ship and go after a woman you missed the chance to beat up before.

The final suicide mission could easily be completed with 1 guy.

I will never understand what Shaw hoped to achieve by going after ""our creators"" to ""find the answers"". What answer are you gonna find with a beheaded android by your side from a race that clearly thrives on rage and hostility? And finally, this was the most UNNECESSARY use of Guy Pearce ever in a movie.

Making fun of a Ridley Scott movie... Wow, I thought THAT would never happen.","1"
"tarekali-19909","eminently rewatchable film that provides new layers of meaning with each repeat visit","28 February 2021","Prometheus is an eminently rewatchable film that provides new layers of meaning with each repeat visit. How often does a master filmmaker get to revisit their original oeuvre and recreate an even bigger world around and about it? The myth of the engineers and their world changing experimentation is absolutely romantic, compelling and terrifying at the same time. It hurts even more to see how badly utilized this new mythos was in the follow up Covenant. The true mark of success that Ridley Scott achieved was igniting years of debate around the origin and nature of the engineers and their creations. Deep connections to established historical finds on earth make this origin story even more personal - the myth of alien astronauts, benevolent or cruel giants from the stars with incredible, magical technology - creators and destroyers of worlds. Getting back to the film itself - such gorgeous cinematography and production values. I recently rewatched in 4k format and developed a greater appreciation for small clues hitherto unseen - for example navigation hologram destinations in a reactivated ship of mass destruction. David is himself a conundrum and a polarizing figure. Was his programming to blame, or the algorithmic output of his treatment at the hand of cruel masters. The android is a central theme in the alien mythos, an expression of creation and self awareness. The only criticism I have of Prometheus and the sequel Covenant is the proliferation of human stupidity. Predecessor films did not showcase human hubris and blundering to such a great extent - protagonists always took calculated risks. If anything the buffoonery of crews almost seems to justify their fate and reduces sympathy accordingly. Ridley Scott may still have time to catapult his mythos to legendarium, if his subsequent sequels after Covenant retain purity of spirit with his expanded universe. I for one look forward to seeing more of this wondrous unravelling and exposition.","9"
"Scrooge-3","It's like they deliberately screwed up the science","17 June 2012","I can forgive the unanswered questions about the motives and biology of the aliens in Prometheus. After all, they're aliens! What I can't forgive is the awful, awful protocols shown by the human scientists, technicians, and spaceship crew throughout the movie.

To begin with, a legitimate scientific expedition would have started by releasing weather and observation satellites to orbit the planetoid for weeks, perhaps months before Prometheus ever landed. This would determine the most likely places to hunt for aliens, rather than just luckily finding alien structures. Then, the small, remote-controlled probes would be sent into the alien installations to map them thoroughly and take air and soil samples. When pictures of the dead aliens came back, the scientist would spend many hours determining likely scenarios and procedures to avoid a similar fate before setting a foot inside.

The biggest mistake the movie makes, though, is something I haven't seen discussed anywhere. People have written about the folly of the crew taking off their space suit helmets without checking for microbes or other contaminants. It's not just the air quality that could cause illness or injury. What hasn't been mentioned is the danger of the humans contaminating the alien environment. Good scientists are concerned to the point of paranoia about destroying a pristine environment and invalidating their results. This is why Mars rovers are sterilized before they leave Earth. Once an alien planet is contaminated, there's no way to know what's alien and what's not. The crew of Prometheus would have to undergo rigorous decontamination procedures both when exiting the ship and on their return.

Another question that I haven't seen discussed elsewhere is why would an expedition as well-financed and equipped as Prometheus not have more than one robot? Weyland would want to have as much redundancy as possible to maximize success. Moreover, the humans would need to be cross trained, just as astronauts are now, so that in case of injury or illness there would be someone to fill in the gaps. This goes for the scientists, flight crew, security, and every other function.

Wouldn't Prometheus be crewed with the absolute best people in every role? People who knew what the mission was and who had trained together for months before leaving Earth. There is no excuse for second-best in a first-contact mission that's exploring a dangerous alien world.

It's one thing to have a haunted-house movie filled with naïve teenagers, but it's quite another to see supposed top scientists do dumb things. With a little more thought, Prometheus could have addressed the plot holes I and others have noted, and as a result been a tighter film with more tension and surprises.","4"
"TheLittleSongbird","Not in the same league as 'Alien' and 'Aliens', while heavily flawed it was still better than expected","10 June 2017","'Alien' is still to this day a tense, shocking suspenseful and frightening masterpiece, one of my favourites of the genre. The bigger and bolder 'Aliens' is one of those rare sequels that is every bit as good as its predecessor. Both are two of my favourite films and the character of Ripley is one of the most iconic female characters in film.

To be honest, there were initial doubts about 'Prometheus'. Ridley Scott, as especially proved with 'Alien', 'Blade Runner' and 'Thelma and Louise' has shown that he has a lot of talent as a director, though his filmography is hit and miss. So that he was back on board as director and that there is a great cast promised much. There were worries however as well, due to some negative reception amongst audiences who criticised the script, story and notorious ""plot holes"".

Watching 'Prometheus' finally, it was a better film than expected though nowhere near in the same league as 'Alien' and 'Aliens'. That said, it was heavily flawed and there are criticised personally agreed with, though it doesn't deserve the 1/2/10 ratings which indicate that the film had no redeeming qualities at all which is not the case.

'Prometheus' best asset is the visuals. The settings look tremendous, of sheer beauty and with a real eeriness, the cinematography complements it perfectly and often powerfully arresting and the special effects are a feast for the eye. Scott's direction has moments where it is superb, if more in the visuals and spectacle than the narrative.

More than up to the level of the quality of the visuals is the cast. Noomi Rapace is an authoritative lead, and Michael Fassbender is even better in one of his best performances to date. Charlize Theron and Idris Elba also prove how talented they are as performers. Most of the rest are more than up to their level.

While the story is very problematic, it does have its moments. There is some tension, especially in the last act, parts are thought-provoking and there are some thrills. The music is suitably haunting.

However, there is a good deal that doesn't work. The script is often very weak, often rambling, clichéd and not very logical with some stupid decision making. The story does suffer from too many concepts not explored enough, some leaden pacing and at times a lack of cohesiveness.

Characters are also not particularly well-written, they seemed underdeveloped and there are too many of them, the decision making of some are a cause for extreme frustration. Not to mention lapses in logic, ridiculous science and parts that don't make as much sense as ought.

In conclusion, better than expected but heavily flawed and one may question the point of it. 6/10 Bethany Cox","6"
"j-mparkin","IMDb members – you're such a jaded lot!","15 September 2013","Where's your sense of wonder,adventure, excitement, innocence?? I feel I have to respond the deluge of haters on IMDb for this film, and no, I'm not trolling, I genuinely LOVED this film – and find no fault with it whatsoever! I can't believe such negative opinion and vitriol for this film! I've read and re-read the same criticisms over and over again, and for me they don't hold water.

It looks like 99.9% of people have made their minds up, but he's my thoughts on the film, and if you'll indulge me, I'd like to try and change the world.

The Prometheus mission is classified TOP SECRET. Even the development of the ship would be done without publicity of any kind. Potentially, they are onto the discovery of a lifetime – like Howard Carter didn't broadcast to his competitors that he was going to go looking for Tutankhamun and where he was going to go looking for it. Weyland would not risk allowing their main rival Yutani to get there first. The ""Magic Eye"" viral posted prior to the film's release supports this, and suggests that Yutani, are constantly using covert means to spy on their competitor, stealing secrets, poaching technology – so as well as this mission being secret, the crew of scientists would NOT be briefed on mission specifics beforehand, or introduced to each other prior to the mission in order to maintain secrecy. Consequently, Weyland would probably not go directly to the scientific community, but rather hire people who could be sworn to secrecy, and their silence bought. Fifield's attitude confirms this, remember the 'scientific mission' is only a smoke screen. This mission is primarily to extend Weyland's life. Period. Science is secondary, it's just that Shaw and Holloway don't know that. That's why the 'scientists' are such a motley crew. Even beyond Weyland's motives, this is a commercial venture, first and foremost – Vickers pretty much spells this out to Shaw and Holloway.

In no particular order The nature of panic. When Vickers and Shaw are fleeing the Juggernaut, they are in BLIND PANIC – like when you are running away from a foe and likely run straight towards it. They don't have time to look at the orientation, they see the thing falling, see the huge shadow (remember the Jugernaut is B I G! and blindly run. Even if they ran to the side, that thing is falling heavily, they still might not get out of the way cos it's the size of two football fields!

Modern instrumentation in the 21st century When everyone takes their helmets off, they have A LOT of correlating info to support the absence of pathogens, and the presence of oxygen. That's how airline pilots don't need to see out of the window to fly planes. YOU RELY ON YOUR INSTRUMENTS!! So they know they can safely remove their helmets, because the area has been terraformed using engineer technology. Same thing with the head – the instruments indicate no pathogens, and the re-animating procedure would have been successful, but unbeknown to Shaw and Ford, it's the presence of the mutation that causes the head to be in distress and the molecular implosion is the result.

And the Pauling Medi Pod is expensive for a reason – don't compare it to a human surgeon, as well as the cutting being ultra fine and precise, besides the staples the machine sprays several fast-healing/flesh-bonding chemicals into the wound, Shaw does stagger for a few hours, but you're up and walking in a matter of hours.

Ridley decided to use Guy Pierce in old man makeup rather than hire an old actor in order to maintain continuity with the TED Talk Viral. Everyone says how terrible the makeup is, but I think it's because Weyland is VERY old so his appearance will be that more exaggerated.

When Milburn 'pets the snake' he's frightened to death – an analogy would be like when you chance upon a Doberman – you might say outstretch your hands, say ""nice doggy"" – fruitless, but you're trying to handle a difficult situation under extreme duress.

And this business with accelerated growth. In the original A L I E N –accelerated growth is shown right from the alien birthing from John Hurt, a few hours later it's ""the size of a man"", so it follows that the Progenitor(s) have this same characteristic. It's also possible that the black goo causes this acceleration/mutation.

And David's motives are for the most part not ambiguous, but rather pretty clear – he is first and foremost programmed to work towards the objective of Peter Weyland, all other considerations are secondary. His deliberate poisoning of Holloway is to use him as a guinea pig to observe the effects of the black goo before he advises Weyland on whether to ingest it or not, what exposure to it does etc.

And the Pauling Med Pod is programmed for the one person on the ship who might need a heart op bypass, this person is likely to be old - there is only one person who fits the bill, (and he's male!), so it's OBVIOUS the unit is set up for Weyland - the notion that it's for Vickers is laughable – she's shown to be tip-top fit with the push ups. It's just happens to be located in her room.

I think Weyland is on Prometheus in secret because no-one would insure a man of his age and condition to go into space, in fact the shareholders would probably forbid it, he would never pass the medical, so the only solution would be to go there in secret.

99.9% of people wanted a retread of Alien or Aliens – I didn't, so I wasn't disappointed.

And for those of you who want to bash Lindelof – read Jon Spaight's original script – everything that you blame Lindleof for is in Spaight's original script!","10"
"roystephen-81252","Really thought-provoking, despite the flaws","10 February 2016","I am personally glad that Ridley Scott took a different direction and not just gave us another typical Alien movie. I like the whole von Daniken-like premise of the film because it leads us to truly grand questions about the very core of humanity. And I found it surprising (in a good way) how strongly Prometheus is tied to Alien: Resurrection, the beautiful bastard of Alien movies, both visually and thematically, from scene references (David playing basketball) to colour palette (green and yellow).

Although most of the characters act weird and stupid a lot of times (which might have been the point all along, with every single character failing mostly in their very professions - but I may be stretching it too far), the movie does raise intriguing questions that stay with you long after you left the cinema.

It is interesting to note, how many visionary artists have recently turned to the question of origins, of human dichotomy, our true nature and purpose in life, faith and most of all, the quest for immortality. These are central themes in several great movies, from George Lucas's very profound but much misunderstood Star Wars prequels to the Harry Potter saga. They alone make Prometheus a movie worth watching and thinking about.

Add to that Michael Fassbender's fantastic performance as David, Marc Streitenfeld's haunting music, and the outstanding visuals (I still have yet to see a movie that surpasses Prometheus in this regard - apart from the giant proto-facehugger that seems half-finished in a couple of shots, a shame), and you have a really good movie. No, it's not Alien-level of perfection, it often leaves you in the dark, and some of the characters act so dumb they become truly irritating, but it does make you think about the great mystery of life, in a way very few movie have in the last 10-15 years.","8"
"dbborroughs","Looks great but the plot is a mess","4 June 2012","Visually stunning but completely ludicrous tale of scientists going to look for god or at least man's creator on a far off planet.

Shades of Wizard of Mars and Star Trek 5. Of course there are monsters, but mostly there are some really stupid people doing some really stupid things in order to drive the plot.No one behaves like a normal person anywhere in this film with the result being that the film is driven forward simply because people refuse to do the rational thing.

I saw this at a sneak preview at Lincoln Center and at no point did anyone jump. The only reaction were applause at references to Ridley Scott's Alien and laughter in the final half hour as things got more and more silly.

That the film works at all is thanks to a some odd set pieces that seem to be operating in a vacuum and to an incredible visual style that keeps the audience interested even when any rational person would have walked out.

"harryplinkett14","Bad film","3 June 2012","The irony is that while 'Alien' was a film with a modest budget that desperately tried to use the available resources to pull off the look of an A-film, 'Prometheus' is a film with a monstrous budget that doesn't even seem to aspire to rise above the B-movie level - with the exception of special effects.

Alas, 3-D glasses can never compensate for one-dimensional characters, and an experienced director cannot fix a poorly written script that makes every screen writing error imaginable.

I guess what it comes down to is that god is a bald bodybuilder who never says anything but instead punches everyone he meets straight in the face. Don't mess with him!

By the way, the aliens in this film verge on silly. You don't want that in a horror film, much less in a film that wants to explain human origins. Can anyone explain the stupidity of the characters?","1"

PROMETHEUS Plot holes AND IRRITATIONS ***SPOILERS***

1. The dreams sequence. David can watch Shaw's dreams. Amazingly this technology also cuts from scene to scene like a movie camera...Please. No one dreams like that.

2. How did they randomly find the temple so quick? This is an entire planet surface!

3. Why was the landing so soft and easy?

4. Why does Fifield start screaming at Shaw like that? Calm down mate..jeez..And later on with an Alien cobra he is cool as ice.

5. Why does that moron Buddy Holly scientist try and touch the cobra alien? not once....not twice...but 3 TIMES!!!

6. Why on earth would a scientist remove their helmets in a possibly infected temple? I am just a civilian and even I understand the concept of VIRUS CONTAMINATION ON AN ALIEN FRIGGIN PLANET. They then have the cheek to talk about Shaw's strict quarantine fail-safe procedures...please

7. What does this Black Goo do exactly? Accelerate worm growth? Infect crew members? Cause pregnancies? Create life? Pick one and stick to it please

8. Why does Ford straight away start giving the head electricity for kicks? Do they not have procedures? What is this fun with Frankenstein?

9. Why does the head explode?

10. Why are the medical staff so damn careless with a possibly disease ridden and bacteria infested decapitated head? I swear they didn't even wear plastic gloves.

11. How did Shaw know the Jockey was heading to Earth to destroy it? Pretty big assumption from a couple of punches thrown.

12. How does David know the Space Jockey is heading to kill Shaw on the Medical Bay?

13. How does Shaw know her baby will attack the Jockey?

14. i was really amazed that Shaw has this 'baby' but fails to mention the horrific and super extraordinary situation she had just been through. ''oh hey guys, ha ha, nearly forgot. FYI, you won't believe what just happened to me on the way here''....''i just gave birth to an alien..'' ''yeah, i know CRAZY right, considering i had sex only 10 BLOODY HRS AGO!!''

15. -The whole Vickers' Star Wars 'Father' line...

16. -The 'bet' between the co-pilots was cringe-worthy

17. HUGE ONEHow the hell does Shaw walk after abdominal surgery? If abdominal muscle is cut you can NOT walk, the muscle needs to be sewn backBut no, a few staples and she is good to go

18. Why does the tentacle creature have tentacles from the evil Planet X?

19. Why do the space jockeys allow any old tramp to walk in an use their security systems?

20. Why does the space jockey want to kill, kill and killYou'd think an advanced race would be a little civilised?

21. What was the point of Guy Pearce as Weyland? Why was he even there? So he just assumed this temple would contain a fountain of life..right.I guess he 'chose to believe' toof**k me

"claudio_carvalho","It Is not What I Expected","30 September 2012","In December 2093, after two years of hibernation of the seventeen crew members, the scientific spaceship Prometheus arrives in an unknown planet expecting to find the Enginners that have created mankind on Earth.

The scientists Elizabeth Shaw (Noomi Rapace) and Charlie Holloway (Logan Marshall-Green) are sponsored by the corporation of the millionaire Peter Weyland (Guy Pearce) and travel with a team including the android David (Michael Fassbender) and Weyland's daughter Meredith Vickers (Charlize Theron). Sonn they find that their discovery is not what they expected and the human race may be destroyed by their creators.

I had the greatest expectations with ""Prometheus"" based on the hype around it, but I found it an overrated and flawed mess. Despite of that, if the viewer turns off his or her brain, he or she may like it despite the confused and boring story with silly existentialistic questions; stupid characters and unreasonable situations, but excellent cinematography and special effects.

The writers could have worked a little harder and avoid imbecilities in the plot such as: (a) How could a trillion-dollar scientific expedition be supported by a thesis based on what the scientist has chosen to believe? (b) How could a scientist tell to the member responsible for the security to bring no weapons with him in an unknown environment since they are a scientific expedition? (c) How could scientists remove a helmet from a being without wearing masks despite the device has been submitted to a decontamination procedure? (d) Why should a scientist stay drinking in a room where an important research is carried out? (e) How could two scientists act like morons with an unknown creature with a snake form? (f) How could a woman be submitted to a cesarean procedure run and jump stapled pretty after the surgery? (g) Why the crew members open the spaceship gate to a member assumed dead without any previous investigation? (h) Why sometimes to create it is necessary to destroy? (i) The heroic act of the captain's officers is typical from Hollywood movies. My vote is six.

"evanston_dad","Don't Let Fanboys Convince You That You're Stupid if You Don't Like This Movie","27 June 2012","Wow, over 1300 user comments makes it seem almost pointless to add one more, but here are my thoughts (I'll keep them brief).

To anyone who's a fan of the ""Alien"" series, ""Prometheus"" will probably supply some at least modest fun, as there are enough tie-ins to the earlier films to keep you engaged. To others, it might seem like an esoteric and obscure sci-fi film that fades instantly from memory after it's over.

The slavering fanboys will have you believe this is the most profound movie ever made. It's not. The fact that it tries to be and fails is only one of its problems. It would have been much better if it had not tried quite so hard; the beauty of the first two ""Alien"" movies is that neither had great ambitions to be anything other than fiendishly entertaining horror/action movies, and they both succeed tremendously on their terms. ""Prometheus"" wants to be something more, but it plays like something conceived in great detail in Ridley Scott's head but only put down on film in vague outlines. There are all sorts of questions the movie raises that it doesn't answer. Fanboys will tell you that that's the sign of a brilliant movie and that you're a dolt if you can't answer the questions on your own. But there's a difference between purposeful ambiguity that serves a narrative purpose and ambiguity that results from bad writing. When you ask the audience to fill in too many blanks on their own, you're just being lazy.

""Prometheus"" seems like a good movie while you're watching it (though even then it really starts to fall apart in its second half), but the more you think about it later, the worse and worse it seems.

Grade: B","6"
"billygoat1071","An Intriguing Incomplete Story","6 June 2012","Prometheus was meant to be another great Sci-Fi film by Ridley Scott, but this one is trying to be grander than Alien. It does succeed to be grand, but it doesn't reach its greatness. There is a good concept in this film. Everything looks beautiful and the world is quite fascinating. But it stumbles when we go to the script, storyline, and the characters. It's still worth watching and quite intriguing, but I don't think it will be as classic as his other Sci-Fi film.

There is an interesting story behind Prometheus. The plot is indeed intriguing. The visuals look beautiful and it will spellbind you. Unfortunately, the script is not as fascinating as the visuals and the expected plot. It's disappointing because instead of answering the film's main question, it rather ends with a ridiculous climax and opened it for a sequel. It also suffers with weak character development. It looks like the soulless character of the film, Android David, has more soul than the human characters.

It may not be a classic, but it still had some great memorable moments. Like the scenes with David. Michael Fassbender once again shines in a splendid role. All of his scenes made the film much more interesting. The violence can be somewhat fun and completely terrifying. Also the planet that is set in looks magnificent. These are the element that keeps the viewers entertained. It helps the film for being worth a watch.

Prometheus can still be pretty good, but it could have been much more than great visuals and ridiculous suspense. It ends questionable. The characters are not that appealing, except David. It's definitely not as superior as Ridley Scott's classic Alien movie. Scott sure did a well job directing this but he's muddled with this script and this incomplete story. But like I said, it's worth watching for the visuals and the interesting concept, but in the end, it will make you wait for the possible sequels. It's still fascinating and recommendable.","8"
"Marta","I don't have the words for how bad this is...","21 October 2012","Yet I'm going to try. The script was a complete mess; I would think Ridley Scott would have been embarrassed to release a film with so many plot holes. Who writes major scripts like this and worse, who would green-light such a disjointed piece of garbage? I literally felt like every other scene had been removed or thrown out, because of the way the story jumped ahead with no coherence.

I found nothing to care about in any character in the film; they had no compelling dialog and were not presented to us as real people. They were stock characters put in place to build the story around, what there was of it. You could have gotten rid of 99% of them and still had the same film.

What the characters did do made no sense. Seasoned space travelers freak out at the site of a decapitated body, yet they wander around inside a completely unknown space for hours. They find an unknown life form and practically pick it up and cuddle it. People seem to teem in the background, yet we have no idea of their character or motivation and are given no idea of their place in the story.

Noomi Rapace has zero charisma, as did her fiancé, whomever he was. Anyone could have played Guy Pearce's role, since he wasn't allowed to act behind all that makeup. I suspect someone fell in love with the idea of a robot fascinated by Lawrence of Arabia, because there was no other reason to include it in the script; it was a completely extraneous bit of business. Michael Fassbender is a great actor but even he can't carry an entire film, though it might have been better if he had tried. Charlize Theron hardly had more than seven or eight lines.

The effects were good, but without a story to support them it was all smoke and mirrors. I was upset that I'd wasted 2+ hours that I'll never get back. I certainly didn't think that after ""Alien"" or ""Gladiator."" I think if Scott is going to make a sequel to this, he'd better focus on the script first and worry about the effects later, because I'm not wasting more money or time if this is the best he can do today. I definitely don't recommend anyone see this film.","1"
"wordclock","Not what I was hoping for","17 June 2012","It's good to see that Ridley Scott still has the same vision for stylistic sets and atmospheric lighting.Lots of dripping water and eery shadows as one might expect from the old master. The special effects are impressive, the CGI is great, the technology is plausible for the turn of the next century. But - and I'm afraid it's a big but - the plot is disjointed, the characters two dimensional and the script is, well, not the best. Far too many things happen which simply make no sense at all, or just don't tally with ""what we know already"" about the Alien universe. Far too many plot mechanisms, bits of tech and even shots and scenes are borrowed from other films - Serenity, independence day, The Mummy, Indiana Jones and the Crystal Skull, Pitch Black, X- Files. I won't go into detail because I can't do that without using spoilers, but try it yourself. Watch the film and see how many ripped off bits you can spot. Spectacular, yes. A great film? No. sadly not.",NA
"sarastro7","Hopefully, there's much more on the Blu-ray...","29 May 2012","I caught one of the earliest press screenings of Prometheus, which was a grand experience, as I am a complete and utter sci-fi nut. Prometheus was one of my two most anticipated movies of the year (the other being The Avengers), and there is not much doubt that it will go down as one of the, if not the, best science fiction movie of 2012.

Prometheus is a bona-fide and direct prequel to the original 1979 Alien movie, giving us a portion of the story behind the space jockey; the alien pilot of the derelict spaceship that contained the alien eggs.

Are the classic Giger aliens actually in this movie? No, but their precursors are. The aliens, after all, have always been evolving, taking on new shapes almost every time they incubate in a new host.

Effectswise, action-wise, technically, visually and in terms of sense-of- wonder, this is exactly the movie we all hoped it would be. The whole set-up for the Weyland company is perfect and serves the first two original Alien movies (the good ones) extremely well. I would love to mention more, but it would be spoiling.

The movie does have imperfections, though. Some salient points of the plot are never revealed (but left for a sequel, which, again, I hope gets made, as it will make a big difference as to how much sense this movie ends up making), and the motivation of the robot also remains enigmatic. The part I found most disappointing, however, is that there isn't much depth to the characters. The onslaught of the action doesn't leave them the necessary time to become properly human to us, and their various beliefs are not at all described in sufficient detail - although we do hear a bit about Shaw (Rapace's character). Besides her, and David, Idris Elba's captain is the best character; he is human, he has failings (yes, I count smoking as a failing!), he's a charmer, he can think and he understands sacrifice. Most of the other significant characters are scientists (finally, a sci-fi movie with more than one of those!), but, sadly they don't act like it. One is depressed and drinking for no good reason, one is just obnoxious, and one is apparently not interested in his own field of science. But, of course, they are all punished for their bad attitudes - which is something, I guess.

But, I am hoping that various extra bits and bops on the disc release will rectify many of these little shortcomings, because, as it is in the movie's theatrical release, none of the characters live up to those of the first two Alien movies.

It's still a great and brilliant movie, though, and one I know I will be going back to the cinema for, and get on Blu-ray as soon as it comes out, and rewatch many times. Most definitely a classic of the genre.

(EDIT: The Blu-ray is out, and it has lots of extras, including some that make the salient points of the story more clear. I am very satisfied!)

(EDIT II: Half a decade on, I think this movie holds up as one of the most distinctive and thought-provoking science fiction movies of the 2010s. It has so many beautifully filmed scenes, and so many amazing and mysterious ideas that I have upped my rating of it from 9 to 10 stars.)

10 stars out of 10.","10"
"onepotato2","Incompetent as both story-telling and film-making","11 June 2012","Alien was a game changer when it came out. The reason you would want the director of that movie to resume after 30 years, is that he would being his extremely high standards to what has become a pretty bad franchise. Aggravatingly, all we see on every front (score, narrative, structure, imagination) is the lowest of low standards. Prometheus is not a game-changer. It's even worse than the lesser Alien movies, which makes it something like ""Attack of the Laser Squids from Planet Terror!!!""

The two good entries in the Alien series did thoughtful things with the form (Alien, Aliens). The others had no idea what to do, so they just threw things at the screen (Alien 3, Alien Resurrection, AvP, Alien goes to the Suburbs). Having abandoned the high quality of his youth, Ridley Scott now embraces half-assed scripts like those later titles. Scott cashed in - all his effort for Prometheus went into becoming a showman; working the pre-release ballyhoo to generate a big payday. The short vids that were made to promote this suggested something unusual. Instead it's desperately 'usual.' It's his George Lucas self-destruct moment. This hackneyed dreck was not even worth filming.

The title spaceship is not interesting. The threat here is not interesting. It has the most laughable aging make-up I've seen in 50 years. The characters are a complete slate of bellicose dopes. And the climax is the usual ""We don't have a climax so why don't we just film nine rotten clichés in a row?"" I can't believe Scott thinks viewers waited 33 years for answers this feeble. Geiger's alien was elegant / thoughtful. For the first time, when a movie finally showed the alien, it was awesomely horrible and did not disappoint. Here we're back to stupid aliens from 1950s throwaway drive-in date movies. The alien gestation makes no sense anymore (as with Alien 3). A snake, apparently issuing from drops of black oil will attack you and kill you, and then you grow larger, gain superhuman powers and become aggressive (!) . If you ingest a drop of the black oil you will become the host of an alien that bursts out your head (!!!). If you make love to a human who is symptomatic, you will get knocked up with an alien squid. That alien squid will grow into a tentacled dumb thing that has nine mouths on the underside, which in turn gives birth to sharkhead (!!!!!). There is no reason to spend any more time describing the lousy, cut-rate path this horrible movie takes. Every answer it provides is a dumb one.

Having no good ideas on where to take the series, Ridley Scott steals ideas from the X Files movie, Species, Splice, AVP and Contact. It's big idea, seen in countless movies since 2001, is now being thoroughly exhausted on the laughable TV show, Ancient Aliens. A father/daughter shocker is lifted straight from an Angela Lansbury movie from 1948 (State of the Union). The horny and dumb level of the proceedings is like watching ""Temptation Island"" the gutter level reality show. And Laurence of Arabia is included for no reason whatsoever.

Prometheus does not summon up the quality of Alien in any way. Instead it reminds a viewer mostly of two rotten pieces of low-grade schlock: Event Horizon (1997) and Super Nova (2000), movies that started by asking interesting questions, but then retreated into asinine developments, due to terrible writers looking for cop-outs.

Prometheus deserves to be as little known as those two clunkers. The test of whether this is a worthy product to associate with Scott's original alien film, lies in asking the question: On its own, could this movie have ever generated as much buzz/response as the original? The answer is a resounding No. This rotten, rotten movie will influence nothing. Put Scott out to pasture where he can graze on his greenbacks. The best thing you can say about this irritating, stupid movie is that it will be gone from theaters in 3 weeks.","1"

"MaxBorg89","In the beginning, there was Alien...","31 May 2012","Prometheus was always going to be a double-edged sword: on the one hand, you have Ridley Scott returning to the genre (and the franchise) that made his name, and pre-release info - be it trailers or the riveting viral videos hinting at important plot elements - suggested it would be a most welcome return; on the other, the Alien franchise has had a rather difficult life for the best part of two decades, due mainly to the disappointing Alien: Resurrection, which, ironically, killed the official series, and the mediocre Alien vs. Predator films, which tarnished the brand's legacy in much worse ways. In other words, this prequel (which isn't really a prequel) has a tough job to pull off.

After a spellbinding prologue, we find ourselves in the year 2093, on the scientific exploration spacecraft Prometheus. The ship is headed to a planetoid called LV-233, based on findings by archaeologists Elizabeth Shaw (Noomi Rapace) and Charlie Holloway (Logan Marshall-Green), who believe the human race was created by an alien species they refer to as Engineers (i.e. the creature Alien fans call the Space Jockey). With funding provided by the presumed dead Peter Weyland (Guy Pearce), the expedition's goal is to find evidence of the existence of the Engineers. However, problems arise on two fronts: given the Weyland Corporation's involvement, company representative Meredith Vickers (Charlize Theron) and android David (Michael Fassbender) may have a hidden agenda; and the Engineers might not be as peaceful as expected.

Originally conceived as a straightforward prequel to Alien, the script of Prometheus was subsequently reworked into a standalone effort that remains set in the same universe. This is the film's smartest idea, as it ditches the usual prequel shortcomings (namely knowing exactly how it's going to end) and establishes its own identity, whilst retaining references to the larger franchise, and Scott's original contribution in particular. It is also, however, the movie's biggest flaw, in that the screenplay, credited to both Jon Spaihts (who wrote the first, more prequel-like draft) and Damon Lindelof (who revised the story and mythology), is an uneven affair. The general plot structure is solid, but occasional snippets of dialogue are cringe-worthy, one scene in particular is dramatically pointless and some characters are underdeveloped. Forgivable in a run-of-the-mill monster movie, perhaps, but less so in a film that downplays the horror angle - the tag-line ""In space, no one can hear you scream"" would feel out of place this time around - in favor of bigger ideas and themes.

This isn't to say, though, that smarts and scares can't coexist. In fact, Scott, ever the talented visionary, constructs imagery that is both breathtakingly beautiful (the aforementioned prologue, which is among the finest sequences in the director's career) and quite shocking, notably a much talked-about surgery sequence that is every bit as intense (and somewhat disgusting) as one would expect from the original Alien man. Prometheus may look more polished than its predecessors, but that doesn't reduce the film's stark visual impact, which is a suitable complement to the deeper themes at play, combining leftover ideas from the established franchise (the deleterious role of corporations) with a new, bold look at the essence of human nature.

Which leads to the movie's greatest achievement: the character of David. A mixture of Pinocchio and Roy Batty, childishly curious and inhumanly lethal at the same time he's a gratifyingly complex and intriguing creation, played to unsettling perfection by Fassbender, who is the standout in the cast. The other performances are a bit hit-and-miss (due to the writing), but equally deserving of mention are the most un-Ripley-like Rapace, the delightfully cold Theron and a remarkable Pearce, whose extended cameo requires him to play a man more than twice his age. In the end, though, the real star of the show is Scott, whose untarnished cinematic eye, enhanced by a clever use of 3D, ensures that the journey will be worthwhile. There are a few bumps (including a final scene that is little more than gratuitous fan-bait), but overall this is a decent rebirth for the Alien saga, laying the ground for what could be an interesting extension of the franchise.","7"
"rooee","Prometheus has landed with a plop","2 June 2012","I just came out of the cinema and then watched the trailer for Prometheus for the first time and I can safely say that you might as well stick with the trailer. It's the entire film in fast-forward.

This is an origin story in the most fundamental sense, claiming to offer profound insight regarding our distant beginnings. But rather than raising questions about the meaning of existence and the notion of creation, you'll be asking some searching questions about the quality of what you just saw.

The Alien universe has been hijacked in recent years by twaddle like AVP and its execrable sequel. The seams began to fray back in 1993 when a rookie David Fincher was hired to direct a script that came across like a clone gone wrong, and it was followed by the woefully misguided comedy-horror Alien Resurrection. So upon hearing that Ridley Scott, director of the original Alien – a B-movie elevated to art – was planning a return to the series, I was genuinely excited.

The result is a narrative disaster with an embarrassing script, which is further undone by some irrational casting choices.

The Prometheus mission must represent the most reckless, impatient, unprofessional scientific expedition in the history of mankind. Biologists prod and poke with gay abandon while geologists go wandering like they're kids exploring an abandoned farmhouse. Why not perform a meteorological survey before leaving the ship, so that you aren't cut off by a biblical storm? Why are you getting blazing drunk just after making the most important discovery in the history of mankind? Why are you, captain, allowing this crew-member, pronounced dead moments earlier, back onto the ship without the merest whisper of quarantine? All sense of wonder or intrigue is stolen by baffling motivations, incongruent characterisation, and infuriating plot holes.

Ridley Scott, even at his worst, usually makes movies that are undeniably his own, with distinctive production design. But Prometheus, sadly, could have been envisioned by any talented hack. It looks more like Brian De Palma's garish flop Mission to Mars; a far cry from the artistic gleam of JJ Abrams' Star Trek or the convincing grubbiness of Duncan Jones' Moon. Perhaps it's the over-reliance on CG, or the insistence upon 3D, but Prometheus is tainted by that uniquely modern sheen: a blandly precise computerised look, like an uncanny aura that surrounds all the human beings and steals any sense of immersion, locking us out of the frame.

For some reason Noomi Rapace was chosen to play the part of Englishwoman Elizabeth Shaw, and while she's fine for the physical stuff (including a brilliantly conceived operation-from-hell) she delivers her lines poorly. Charlize Theron is eminently watchable but like many of the characters she often acts in a somewhat contradictory manner. Guy Pearce was presumably chosen for the part of the extremely elderly Weyland for the sake of his viral promo – he simply looks like a young man in make- up. Michael Fassbender, as the robot David, is the star of the show, building on the sinister twitches that made Bishop (Lance Henrikson) and Ash (Ian Holm) so subtly menacing in the first two films.

I'm struggling to find positives. There is the occasional effective set- piece, such as the storm sequence, some icky first encounters, and the aforementioned invasive operation, but the characters are so inconsistent and/or underdeveloped that all sense of threat is undone by audience indifference.

Now I'm going to watch Alien and Aliens, back-to-back, and then perhaps, grudgingly, Alien 3. I'm starting to think that's all we ever needed.","3"
"jacklmauro","Trash of the Titan","27 June 2012","For over 30 years, I've believed that no worse movie could be made than 'Can't Stop the Music'. I was wrong. And it breaks my 'Alien'-loving heart. WHO WROTE THIS GARBAGE, and what were they smoking? Listen up: I'm perfectly ready to suspend disbelief, esp. when it comes to sci-fi. I was also not wanting or expecting another 'Alien', as superb as it was. But this thing is, to quote Dorothy Parker, not just bad. This is fancy. A huge, huge problem is borrowing 'Alien' motifs when they do not at all apply. For instance, the crew of motley, disgruntled folks of Prometheus. Such a crew was perfect for a mining ship coming back from a dull and long job; when it's mankind's first, trillion-dollar search for life in the universe, a team seemingly pulled out of a Hooter's Happy Hour seems inappropriate. Similarly, we get the 'Alien' captain, here bad-ass but still just out to earn a paycheck. On THIS mission? It's as though Scott so valued these elements, he had to re-use them even when they utterly do not belong. Then. There's the helmets-off idiocy on the alien moon, prompted by a computer reading that the air is OK, nicely ignoring that maybe scientists would nonetheless by wary in so unknown an environment/atmosphere. There's the wretched cliché of the ancient trillionaire. There's about an hour of exposition featuring the evil gay robot who, after plainly sabotaging the womb of Dr. Shaw, is buddied up to by her not long after. Best of all are the oddly redneck two scientists, stranded, and a coaxing of an alien cobra-like creature as though it were a kitten. This is so ghastly, I felt sorry for the actor, as I did for the geologist, setting foot on a new moon and angry that he's expected to take any interest in the proceedings. This goes to an even larger flaw, in that, aside from a few, requisite gasps, everyone is reacting to this extraordinary find as though they stumbled into a funky part of town. To that end, and more horrifying than the scientist-kitten, is Holloway's pouty, drunken angst because, gee, there weren't no daddy aliens to explain why man exists. He has found an incredible alien civilization and proof of humanoid life but, like a true scientist, he can't get past not getting his boyish dream fulfilled. Also; he awakes to discover a creeping worm in his freaking eye, tells no one, and simply goes off on the day's mission? Who wrote this garbage? Last issue: there is NO momentum. There is no tension or suspense. There isn't even a second- rate 'Alien' prequel, because this thing would have to work real hard to be second-rate.","1"
"AdrenalinDragon","Standalone, prequel, or reboot? It doesn't matter, good job!","1 June 2012","It is hard to say too much about Prometheus without spoiling it. First of all, those expecting to see the original Aliens are not seeing this movie for all the right reasons. Yes, it is part of the Alien universe and set before the first movie, but it doesn't feature those Aliens and instead tells a brand new story of merging the two worlds together.

With Ridley Scott back to directing, Prometheus used the similar setup of making researchers explore an alien world, only this time there is a longer setup and more suspense driven to events unfolding. The ship in this movie is very reminiscent of the one in Alien, although it is different in design and has some new interesting gadgets and pieces of technology we haven't seen before. There's no denying that there are things people will pick up relating to Alien, and I'm really glad they didn't tone down the violence for 12/PG-13 rated audiences. Either way, you can watch Prometheus first before the other Alien movies.

On the acting side of things, I found Michael Fassbender's Android character David to be the standout for the movie. I also liked the protagonist Noomi Rapace and the supporting cast of Logan Marshall-Green, Charlize Theron, and Idris Elba. All strong performances, but perhaps if there's only one small complaint I could think of, is that maybe the supporting characters didn't get enough development time. Thankfully, Scott and the team keep the movie going at a very good pace with emotional depth at the right moments.

Overall, Prometheus on first viewing was what I expected, a movie using it's original base movie Alien as a structure to produce a new story with new characters/lifeforms to lead up to other Alien story lines. It is highly likely the references will become more obvious in sequels to this, but Prometheus manages to bring a story that works as a standalone but also a prequel at the same time, which is good for all viewing audiences, and I think Scott was trying to bring the grisly/dark atmosphere movies of Alien without being too in your face, which I thought was the right direction for this movie.","8"
"Elder_Yautija","The mistaking of technicality for creativity by the modern-age moviegoer and its disastrous consequences. *SPOILERS*","3 June 2012","*WARNING: THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS!*

Someone in the message boards said, in defense of Prometheus (which was being bashed by a poster): ""Thank God art is subjective!""

Well, you said it: ART is subjective, so this commercial, intentionally crowd-pleasing sh#t doesn't qualify.

At the premiere in Amsterdam there wasn't a single clap after this turd was over, only laughter and ""MEH""'s said out loud. You want to hear a fact? This is pure vomit in film form. THAT is a fact.

I can't even begin to imagine what sort of mushroom-fueled hallucinogenic trip one must be on to call this ""art"". Why, cause it's computer generated images? So what? Only cause ""Avatar"" managed to be visually arresting doesn't make any 3D/CGI-fueled piece of cr#p an artistic accomplishment. ""Hercules in New York"" could be remade tomorrow, in 3D with CGI special effects, and it would still be a turd. Why the comparison? Simple. Here's a list of things that these two movies share:

1) A childish story, with as much depth as my bathtub but painted black so it looks deeper and darker, but then eventually unfolds like it could have been written by the 13-year-old mongoloid cousin of my neighbor. This movie can be watched only with the law of probability firmly stamped in your forehead.

2) Religious references that are so needed in the plot as a growth under my armpit. That Christian faith reference was so laughable and unnecessary that every time they showed that cross-shaped necklace I had cramps in my belly. I thought I was gonna throw up.

3) Characters which aren't characters, they're merely guest appearances. Faces that are there, but could easily not be there and you wouldn't miss, or, even worse, faces that make you happier once you know they're gone. Remember the one with the punk haircut? Remember the Asian dude? And the guy with the beard? Wait a second... what guy with the beard???

4) Acting from the school of Howard The Duck in almost every scene, even from those actors you would never expect it from. ""Will that be all?"" - ""Yes... FATHER!"" - Shoot me in the face, please.

5) Dialogues that seem like they've been written by a 10-year-old with Alzheimer after he's had a ""Growing Pains"" 48-hour marathon... (Read the above point for a reference, then watch the movie for a real good laugh)

6) The shameless use of every cliché one can possibly come up with. A sterile woman (whom we find out is sterile in a scene that's meant for tears but finally works for laughs) eventually gets pregnant; the old, powerful guy behind it all, who's supposedly dead but then it turns out he's not; the cold, heartless robot who places science above human life in his priorities list; the hidden (yet obvious and totally expected) family relation between characters... the list can go on forever.

7) The most important for me: INVOLUNTARY COMEDY... that was painful. I actually felt embarrassed to be in that theater, at moments. Like the scene where Shaw gets a computerized-midwife for a quick abortion. I won't give anything out, but I promise: you're up for laughs! The whole theater laughed their butts off in that scene, so don't forget your pop- corn! Oh, wait... what do you mean it wasn't meant for laughs???

The list could go on, but I haven't got all day.

If one can overlook these details, Prometheus could be seen as a case of ""nice-try-sucker"" film-making from a once brilliant director. But that's not the truth. The truth is: this is A BAD MOVIE, and if you don't see it through the smokescreen, then your brain must be dead. Or at least in a coma.

So what's the big deal about this two hour long raping of my sight, so that it gets 8.3 on IMDb? I guess people want to force themselves to like it, cause it's Scott, cause it's related to Alien, cause the expectations were high and everyone hates having to admit that they've been let down and that they wasted their money. I would hate to have to admit it. But I had no expectations and went in for free, so I don't have to.

My friends, who I went with to watch Prometheus said to me, after the mess was over: ""I wanted to like it, I really wanted to!"". But they just couldn't. How can you possibly be a movie lover, know Scott's classics, NOT be brainwashed and still like this stain of puke?

I hated every minute of it (except for the opening sequence, hence the 2 star rating), and so did the other 600 people in the theater. Think about it and be honest to yourself. Just cause trailers, teasers, movie connections, big names and companies make you think you have to like it, you don't really have to, do you?","1"
"stevelovell","Typically flawed and over hyped but enjoyable nonetheless.","1 June 2012","So I saw the long awaited ""Prometheus"" tonight. Overall, rather good, but the characters annoyingly and jarringly flaunted so many basic health and safety regulations regarding potential contamination, infection, quarantine and exposure to physical injury from not wearing adequate safety equipment in an unfamiliar extra-terrestrial environment etc. Maybe we're just supposed to be careless or stupid in about 80 years' time. Tsk! Also, while not being pro-god or creationist as such, it did kind of take a dump on Darwinism and the role of evolution in our existence.

Being in 3D was fairly pointless. I even had to check that it was by taking the glasses off. It was, but barely noticeable.

Gorgeous sets and imagery, but I wasn't too happy about what the Engineers or ""Space Jockeys"" look like under their bio-mechanical suits.

It was plagued by thoroughly unbelievable and rather unprofessional characters as well. Dumb scientists and ship crew lacking the professional integrity you'd expect from a trillion dollar mission. Oh, and the old Weyland guy was a bit rubbish. Just Guy Pearce with lame prosthetic wrinkles. How about using an actual old man actor with an actual old bone structure? He stuck out like a sore thumb. Anyway, I have to pick fault, but it's very much worth a watch and most people aren't as picky as me I guess.

I still wish they'd stop making films as if we're all dumb 15 yr old kids without any real intelligence though. And it should have been purposely made to be an 18 certificate (in the UK at least).","1"

"Movie_Muse_Reviews","A fascinating sci-fi exploration of the 'Alien' universe","8 June 2012","A return to the ""Alien"" universe from the man who originally envisioned it? Hard not to sign up for that adventure, even knowing that ""Prometheus"" appears to be quite far from an ""Alien"" movie. This film dares to ask bigger questions about creation and the purpose of life while thrusting us into an un-fathomable sci-fi mystery rather than a moody horror opera set in space. Yet for every way it is different, ""Prometheus"" also feels like director Ridley Scott's homage to his own work, as if he too was fascinated with the lore he helped create.

""Prometheus"" begins with the slow unraveling of a world that despite the irony of phrase, feels vaguely familiar with all kinds of technology, stasis pods and the on-foot exploration of an unknown planet. The film completely propels itself on fascination, hoping that its audience has a strong scientific curiosity and a nose for wonder and imagination. The impact of ""Lost"" writer Damon Lindelof on the script is apparent, as with more knowledge comes more questions, questions that sometimes get in the way of themes and character building, but never stop awing.

The Prometheus (the ship) expedition is essentially launched on a hunch. Scientists and archaeologists Elizabeth Shaw (Noomi Rapace) and Charlie Holloway (Logan Marshall-Green) have discovered ancient drawings of a giant man pointing to a star cluster in ancient civilizations all over the world that couldn't possibly be connected unless they referred to a creator. They believe a race of ""Engineers"" live on this planet (a moon, specifically), LV-223. Dying billionaire Peter Weyland (Guy Pearce) funded their quest in hopes of unlocking the greatest discovery in human history.

Unlike the Nostromo, Prometheus has a much larger crew, so there are many more stories to focus on and people to care about. In addition to Shaw and Holloway, there's the ship captain (Idris Elba), the resident android, David (Michael Fassbender), and Weyland Industries overseer Meredith Vickers (Charlize Theron) among others. As they explore the pyramid-like structure they've discovered it becomes clear that there are multiple agendas going on here, which anyone who's seen ""Alien"" would be prone to suspect.

The scope and scale of ""Prometheus"" and the way that this world is silently explored at the beginning echoes ""Alien"" rather closely, except that rather than narrow into a story of a dangerous alien on board a ship, the scope of ""Prometheus"" only continues to grow, with questions mounting on how these films — 33 years apart — ultimately connect. The answers are more exciting than profound, but the tension makes the ride worthwhile.

Like Ripley, it's not until the final act that Shaw truly emerges as the main character we want to root for. From start to finish, it's really David who fascinates the most. Fassbender gives another brilliant performance. His obvious hidden agenda complicates his character in our eyes, and for his cold and calculating manner, there's still a creepy amount of internal processing going on. You get the sense that things interest him, that he's driven by the same quest for knowledge of his human counterparts, and it makes him eerily human. He is, in a sense, a microcosm of the greater idea at play of mankind meeting his maker, as he is a creation of his peers, who look for answers about their creation. There's a brilliant exchange between him and Holloway about how we create because we can — no other reason — yet as a sentient creation, it's a maddening explanation for existence.

""Prometheus"" should age well with these questions, as repeat viewings will eliminate the seemingly endless quest to figure out what's going on and temper the abundant flaunting of production design and visual effects that can at times disorient the viewer. Without those distractions, the script's brighter moments and thoughts will shine through much more.

There are no chinks, however, in the visual spectacle that is ""Prometheus."" Everything is so believable, pristine and fascinating. Whereas ""Alien"" left so much to the imagination, ""Prometheus"" just keeps feeding it, and that's the fundamental difference in the film as far as tone and genre. ""Prometheus"" goes into much more high-concept science fiction whereas ""Alien"" is predominantly horror. As such, those who loved ""Alien"" for its horror qualities will likely be the group most disappointed by ""Prometheus."" Both films, however, contain lasting and memorable visual imagery.

Why so much comparison between the films? Well, ""Prometheus"" invites it. After all, the letters of the title appear line by line almost exactly as they did in '79, first thing in the film. You can call it ""Alien DNA"" if you like (based on comments made by Scott and Lindelof), but story-wise it's truly a prequel as it sets up/provides and explanation for the beginning of ""Alien."" The reason Scott and Lindelof have avoided the direct nature of the word ""prequel"" is because of the tonal difference in their film and how ""Prometheus"" is driven by different (and much bigger) questions.

It seems that over the last three decades, Scott's curiosity about the universe he and H.R. Giger designed in 1979 only grew. Rather than return to the ""Alien"" world to re-invoke the moody and atmospheric tone, he returned to it in hopes of expounding upon the lore that he had left so wide open with the fallen ship and the Space Jockey.

Pardon me for going way meta right now, but Scott's journey back is for similar reasons to the characters of this film: a desire to understand its origins. His results are not all that different from their discoveries either, as ""Prometheus"" is striking, daunting, tense and messy, yet the prevailing drive of it all is a never-ending fascination.

"Troy_Campbell","Thought-provoking and visually sumptuous, if not classic.","7 June 2012","Judged as the long awaited return to the sci-fi genre by Ridley Scott, or as the ""spin-off prequel"" to Alien, then Prometheus will no doubt be deemed a disappointment. Shed those lofty expectations however, and an exceptional sci-fi thriller remains. Setting the tone early with a disintegrating death to a sorta-human-sorta-alien creature, writers Damon Lindelof and Jon Spaihts revel in ambiguity for the first two acts – drip-feeding information here and there, often in subtle ways requiring maximum attention from the audience – before unleashing a more mainstream finale that feels slightly bloated, although never-the-less captivating thanks to the sublime visuals. And it's with the memorable images that this motion picture scores highest; every frame is littered with something impressive to look at, subsequently immersing the viewer into this world entirely and gliding over the occasional odd character decision or plot contrivance. Ridley has clearly not lost his nerve when it comes to confronting scenes either, a key sequence featuring a nerve-wracking emergency operation is chillingly effective and possibly the standout moment in the film. As for the cast, they are all given their moment to shine and no-one lets the team down (although Guy Pierce is covered in so much elderly make-up it becomes distracting), however Michael Fassbender is in a league of his own as the eerie and highly-affecting droid David. Prometheus may not be Alien's modern-day equal, but it's a thought-provoking, visually sumptuous tale that deserves to be seen on the big screen.","8"

I don't know how they will connect this to the original Alien is beyond me.

The octopus like creature didn't make any sense if u like the original Alien 1 n 2.

Here the black liquid is shown to mutate organisms, so basically the facehuggers are mutated worms in this movie.

Facehuggers enter hosts n then a chestburster pops out n grows very very rapidly into an aggressive n violent Xenomorph.

"Leofwine_draca","Not bad, but surprisingly superficial","15 December 2012","Who would have thought that, after all the endless hype and speculation, PROMETHEUS would turn out to be run-of-the-mill? It turns out to be nothing more than a completely traditional, paint-by-numbers sci-fi movie with crew members of a spaceship getting killed off messily by some nasty parasitic alien things. As this is a prequel, there are few ties to the original Alien other than some slavish moments where things have to be set up ready to tie in to the beginning of that movie (same with THE THING prequel).

Ridley Scott seems to be impossible to gauge sometimes. He can make genuinely amazing movies, like GLADIATOR , and badly flawed movies like this and ROBIN HOOD. Sure, these latter films are entertaining on a superficial level, but they're the kind of work that a journeyman director would produce, not a supposed visionary like Scott. The best thing about PROMETHEUS isn't the direction, which is nondescript, but the calibre of the special effects, which truly are special. There are SFX here we've never seen the likes of before, with some of the best use of CGI I've witnessed.

A shame, then, that the aliens are so mundane, a simple riff on a thematic alien enemy that popped up on THE X-FILES fairly regularly over a decade ago. Surely with all the effects and imaginative minds involved they could have gone for something genuinely startling, instead of a type that's been done to death? The script is nothing to write home about either, with character models too obviously based on successful types in earlier movies and a general lack of depth for everyone involved. All too often the characters act in stupid ways that hasten their deaths, just the same as in a cheesy slasher sequel.

Noomi Rapace feels particularly awkward, especially given the effectiveness of her work in the MILLENNIUM trilogy. She stumbles and stammers her way through the film, too busy trying to enunciate to give us to time to sympathise or even like her. A particularly uninteresting Ripley clone, then. Michael Fassbender, unsurprisingly, gives the best turn as an android, and cast-wise that's as good as you're going to get. I did like Idris Elba, but why Guy Pearce is wandering around in some distracting old-man makeup I have no idea. As with many things in PROMETHEUS, it's a bit of a mystery!","6"
"ocacia","Awful, terrible script, incoherent, multi themes going no where","8 June 2012","As part of an experiment I once watched a film called Two headed Shark attack (or something like that) but what I learned was even the worse B film can master tension and follow some sort of believable plot. This film failed so bad I cannot believe Ridley Scot did it. 15 minutes into the film the first issue was the dialog and the jumping from theme to theme. It didn't flow, it didn't transition. It didn't sit to explain the universe in which the film was to be born into.

Now unlike most people I did a few course in script writing. And i would love for someone to tell me this script was good. There is no tension, none. I actually stopped caring why the aliens want to destroy Earth Maybe to destroy Hollywood from making anymore films like this.

Please tell me you invested in those empty unrealistic characters, apart from The robot and Theron I really cant remember one person. have no idea who did the casting. Compare the African American to the original African American in Alien. Compare Weavers role in 1-4 (and I complained about 4). You see where I am going. The film has in too many unresolved unexplained, unrealistic themes. Two many aliens, mismatch of boring parts from far too many places, too many motives. Then the last 14 minutes they reveal some silly motive which makes no sense whats so ever. And the film rushes to deal with the threat, what do they do? Get a 1/2 interested captain to grow some deep spirituality (not previous developed in the character) and...Well See independence Day collision for the 20th time in Sci-Fi history.

Someone noted that there was a scientist who didn't behave or speak like a scientist there were too many stretches. Boring love affairs, alien implantation, late term abortions, crazy Giant Alien, Father- Daughter inheritance theme, the black oil from X-Files, Captain and Boss booty call, Catholic religious themes, redundant details, redundant scenes and focus (which did not develop) random.com theme, Waste my time theme Help me * ""The alien air is breathable so I will take of my helmet"" * I will get drunk 2nd day of the mission, alcohol available on a mission Tell NASA * They took off their helmets, where did they put them * A glitch, but the captain wants to get laid * They camp/sleep in a nest full of suspicious egg bombs * For no reason Robot poisons guy, wants alien baby, but also wants woman hero to be safe *Post operation she is fitter than Serena Wiliams.

Visuals are good, 3D not needed (took off my glasses 1/2 way)

Now lets deal with the dead dialog. Who seriously wrote those lines? It pops out of the script and makes no sense 1/2 the time. ""I am not here to be your friend I am here for the money""-- how does this fit the theme. How is that continued (as in the case of Alien 1 with the money issue for shares (which is properly introduced to add motive to the film?). Strange bunch of disjointed people who look mostly like heroin addicts. Too much things not quiet right to have to have faith with. Aliens create humans who want them to come to there WMD site to knock of their heads? Sorry maybe my Mother wasted her money on my education but I don't follow. non sequitur.

Fans of the original will be wanting to learn more about the alien world of the the original but you won't find that here. There are too many questions that are never answered. There is absolutely not one original sci-fi idea in the script. I am so upset by how bad this film is that I want to write to Ridley Scott himself.

"dharmendrasingh","Curiosity killed the Crew","8 July 2012","This needed a second viewing, just to see if not being awestruck was my fault. Sir Ridley Scott's unintended (but obviously linked) prequel to his 1979 classic, 'Alien' is a hugely ambitious film; but is, in a word, meretricious.

The story is profoundly compelling, and is an example of why sci-fi can be the most noble of all genres. It's not afraid to ask the big questions – Where do we come from? What is our purpose? What happens when we die? – but cowers into the nearest black hole when it comes to answering them (or at least the last two of those). No film I have seen has handled analogous material better than Kubrick's '2001', and 'Prometheus' could have ensured similar stardom if it chose epiphany over escapist entertainment.

The year is 2093. Discovery of a recurring ancient cave painting has prompted a space expedition. A vessel called Prometheus carries a crew of 17 to a destination where it is believed the answers to human origin lie. Interweaving an alien story with the central plot is a major strength, a double-whammy concept. But the delivery is all devilry; pure Hollywood compromise.

Despite the voluptuous visuals, stunning production design and preference of manual over computer effects (including a memorable alien abortion sequence), what ruined it for me was the handling of this precious material. Perhaps it was inevitable. Between them, the two writers (Jon Spaihts and Damon Lindelof) have a limited repertoire which has space for the execrable 'Cowboys and Aliens' and equally distasteful 'The Darkest Hour'.

Discoveries are anti-climactic. When the crew discover something of importance, i.e. everything, they are remarkably insouciant. The effect on me was a mutual disinterest. All the elements for suspense are here: dark passages, inexplicable noises, prolonged moments of inactivity; yet there is a lack of the kind of suspense which gave Scott's 1979 film its reputation.

One saving grace is Michael Fassbender's David, the onboard android. He gives everyone an acting lesson; one that ship captain, Janek (Idris Elba) doesn't heed, choosing instead to remain impassive throughout. Guy Pearce (in heavy make-up) cameos as the CEO of the company funding the venture. He has only a few days of life left and presumes they will find a merciful rather than noxious God, and further presumes that he will be able to barter for an extension.

Other principal players are Doctors Elizabeth Shaw (Noomi Rapace) and Charlie Holloway (Logan Marshall-Green), and expedition manager, Meredith Vickers (Charlize Theron), who raises her voice to remind everyone who's boss (an interesting discussion point, evoking Scott's 'Blade Runner', is whether she's another android).

Once Darwinism has been negated, the crew, particularly Shaw, desperately seek other answers. This is where I felt cheated. Yes, speculation is often more enticing than revelation, but this film is fuelled by its revelations. We're not given the answers, ostensibly to add mystery. But I feel that the script writers had no more to offer. David asks Shaw why she so badly wants to know more. Her response is risible: 'Maybe it's because I'm human and you're a robot'.

The conclusion is impetuous and insipid. It is not too distant in tone and style than – I'm serious – 'Armageddon'. The best bit of the film probably won't even be talked about. It's established that Prometheus has actually landed on an installation, where aliens were being manufactured by our 'Engineers' (Gods) to create WMD. Their intention was to use these weapons to destroy Earth, but the aliens escaped captivity and massacred them. What a concept! If you were going to compromise, which this film does, why not show that story? Maybe they will in another prequel.

"IMPAwards","Perhaps the dumbest ""intelligent"" film ever made","19 July 2014","I am a fan of Ridley Scott and a fan of the Alien series. I had heard a few negative reviews of the film but was completely unprepared for just how absolutely awful the film was.

I am tempted to fill this review with a lengthy spoiler-filled rant picking apart all of the ridiculous story elements but you're probably better off watching the ""Honest Movie Trailer"" for the film instead.

It's always painful to watch movies about scientists that were written by people who have no concept of what science is all about. Throughout the entire film it is obvious that the writers have complete contempt for their audience, populating this scientific mission with the stupidest crew in the universe. The writers can then hide their own incompetence behind the incompetence of their moronic characters.

Nothing makes sense in this movie. The story is one giant heap of plot contrivances that shouldn't have even made it into a rough first draft. How such a mess could've been made by such talented filmmakers (and actually praised by major critics like Roger Ebert and Leonard Maltin) baffles me. Don't waste your time with this film unless you are prepared to pause it every few minutes to yell at the screen.","1"
"ekveland","Oh (literally) God.","6 June 2012","Ah, the dumb blonde of movies. So so pretty, but so so stupid. Stop thinking about the intellectually insulting plot, the lackluster ""scares"" and just enjoy the scenery. It's only for one night, and you can dump her tomorrow. After all she is so so pretty.

But let's face it, if you just want to look at pretty things while your brain takes a vacation, there's Avatar. If you want to be insulted by this assault at common sense, hate the protagonist and roll your eyes at hackneyed dialog and telegraphed plot point with subtext as subtle as a sledgehammer to the vagina. Well, then there's Prometheus.

I'd kid about how Alien Resurrection was scarier, but frankly so was that episode of Muppet Show with Vincent Price. It's just the god-awful Erich von Dänicken meets creationist theory plot that sucks the soul out of this impossibly beautiful looking sci-fi. Well, anyway eff the SCI! Hey dumb darwinist quipper, guess who's going to die first. Spoiler: It's you! Creationism is true, let's meet our engineers. Spoiler: THEY HATE US!

I honestly can't think who this film was set out to p!ss off more, atheists or creationists? Is Ridley Scott just trolling us all? Is it another elaborate Scientology ad? Because it sure as hell reminds me of Battlefield Earth. (But so so pretty).

Anyway, please avoid this film unless you are really just waiting to see what tenuous connection it has to a pretty darn good eighties space-horror which spawned at least one good sequel and OH LOOK OVER THERE, there's the Star Wars prequels!

So yeah, what the hell Ridley Scott? The 1984 Apple commercial had a better plot than this. So much wasted talent, so many wasted pixels, so many (well a few) good actors delivering lines like: ""FATHER!"" while we involuntarily roll our eyes back into our skulls for the seventh time. And so many characters wasted for this review, I am a twitter person dammit! (Spoiler: Jesus is a Xenomorph).

"stevenfreekin","Ridley Scott restores his Alien Legacy with the discovery of the origins of Mankind","6 August 2014","WOW. This film was a breath of fresh air and a great restoration of the Alien universe. The franchise took an early hit in its line of succession with Alien 3, 4, and then somebody had a bright idea of mixing it with Fox's dead franchise, Predator. Well, we know how that went.

Anyway, Prometheus was over hyped and there was a lot of ""oh it's a prequel, oh it's not a prequel"" talk leading up to its release. Well, I saw the film opening night and I was amazed at how stunning the film was and how philosophical, spiritual, adventurous, captivating the story was. I just recently watched again on bluray and the film is very layered and complex than most people believe. The characters are well developed and have depth. The film is actually both a prequel but not at the same time. It has the same DNA as Alien and it doesn't really connect until the last 30mints but then it doesn't. Confused? Well, that's why you should checkout this syfy masterpiece.

A lot of people complain at how slow the movie was and yet they claim to be Alien fans. Hmmm I guess they never saw the first movie and they don't know Ridley Scott. If your a fan of the Alien Films, especially the first two, and have a great understanding of Greek mythology and have an open mind to asking the question of where we came from then I think you will definitely enjoy this movie like i did.","10"
"108YearsOld","PoopMehThus","8 December 2021","Apart from the unintelligent scientists and amateurish space travelers, the most nonsensical is the basic theme of the story, that is:

If the human civilization is wicked and thus disappointing enough to be destroyed by the creators, the engineers, why would the creators do so by creating a whole new level of wicked beasts that are substantially far more dangerous, uncontrollable, in turn capable of overpowering and destroying the creators themselves? Even the inferior humans have nuclear bombs being able to wipe out the planet earth in no time?

So you see, the director was actually not the sole reason for making Alien (1979) great, this prequel just proved that because the original script writer passed away long time ago.

4 stars for the production value, minus 3 stars for the nonsensical flaws. A nonsensical prequel that ultimately ruined the whole movie series, simply a disgrace.","1"
"xenomorph_uk","Please let there be a director's cut...","2 June 2012","I'm pretty sure there's at least 30-60 minutes worth of missing footage. It's the only explanation I have for Scott making such an average sci-fi. Look, I know there's debate, is it a prequel or not. That doesn't matter, what does is the quality of this movie versus the rest of the Alien genre.

I remember the sheer thrill of Alien 1979 version. The highly original Xenomorph stalking its human prey throughout the dark confines of the Nostromo. The incredible sequence as Ripley sets the vessel on self-destruct only to find her path to the escape boat blocked by the vicious alien. Then the mad terrifying scramble to deactivate the fusion plant followed by an even more intense attempt to reach the lifeboat for a second time. Then after all that, the Xenomorph had sneaked on-board anyway! Weaver's utterly convincing terror as she slips into the spacesuit and blows the airlock. Just incredible! Horror/Sci-fi at its very finest and best. True ""On the edge of your seat"", stuff.

My point... Prometheus had none of this... not a shred! Sure, Prometheus was beautifully shot and visually stunning, but the movie was full of poor editing, plot holes and flawed acting. I just can't imagine Scott allowing the film to be created this way and I'm convinced the Editing Room and writers are responsible for the disjointed nature of the movie. I won't delve into the many plot holes or describe the childish nature of the script/plot devices as you've no doubt read many other reviews by now.

Despite its flaws it's still a worthwhile sci-fi and deserves the price of a cinema ticket. You'll be blown away by Fassbender's performance and also Raprace's to a point. The CGI really is beautiful and there's some pretty neat ideas about how the Xenomorph evolved. It's definitely a movie that'll find its way into my blu-ray collection in a few months time.","6"
"deny-966-237037","Ridley Scott must have directed the entire movie drunk","24 June 2012","I'm a huge sci-fi fan and also an admirer of Scott's work, but I'm probably not going to watch a movie solely because it was directed by him anymore. This was probably one of the worst movies I've seen in the past few years, including a few that were made for TV.

The screenplay seems to have been written by a 13 year old school kid. The plot has so many holes it's ridiculous, I was annoyed and deviated from the movie to the plot holes less than 10 minutes into the watching it, which is saying something. Here are some of the highlights that weren't mentioned in the reviews I've read:

1. It's a trillion dollar mission and basically no one in the crew knows what the hell they're doing there until after they reach their destination.

2. As soon as the crew gets out of their suspended animation chambers, one of the members starts showing an attitude towards mission command during their first briefing. Not in a million years would anyone with a dysfunctional personality be allowed in the most trivial space mission, let alone an important one.

3. It's important to decontaminate a specimens collected from the surface of the planet while in the lab, but the ""scientists"" don't wear their helmets while collecting it making the decontamination in the lab completely useless.

4. The reasons / motivations for basically anything in the movie are not plausible or believable leading to deep annoyance and boredom during the torture that is watching this movie.

5. The characters have either idiotic or psychotic personalities, some times both. Even in real life astronauts are usually extremely intelligent and able to cope with and keep their cool under stressful situations.

6. The plot development is painfully slow and a lot of the time doesn't make enough sense to be sufficiently believable that the spectator can get into it and forget about the plot holes.

My advice is, honestly, stay away from this movie at all cost. I know a lot of people won't be able to, and out of curiosity will watch this monstrosity anyway. But remember: you have been warned.","1"
"rzemph","Skidley Rott does it again","22 May 2022","Simply put, this film is ordure. An open insult to anyone with half a brain. The plot is bad enough -- a trite rehash of a million other sci-fi plots out there -- but the characters and dialogue are where this mess really plumbs the depths of rubbishness, being so abysmal as to beggar belief. How can anyone in their right minds have dished out good money to produce such utter rot? And how can anyone with a modicum of understanding have watched this travesty and not turned away in disgust?

None of the characters has a mental age above fourteen. The premise is that a huge expensive mission has been mounted to explore the origin of life, but we are asked to believe no one told these ""scientists"" on the spaceship where they were headed or why. And they are all a bunch of ignorant, immature morons. The entire film consists of preposterous scenes of these cardboard people speaking and behaving like snotty kids at a school outing. In fact, the whole thing sounds like it was written by a bunch of snotty kids.

And if the production is expensive, the thrills are still as cheap as they come. Take the storm near the beginning. Really? Is that the best Skidley Rott can do?

"Munin75","Impressive watch","30 May 2012","Ridley Scott's Alien is my all time favorite movie so I've been anticipating Prometheus ever since the prequel was announced. Since I couldn't resist the wait, I saw it early this morning the day of its official release in my country.

First of all, the trailers showed it, the cinematography is fantastic. Ridley Scott nailed that aspect like a genuine master. The entire movie is basically a succession of grandiose shots which surely will have other directors blush in shame. The cinematography is accompanied by great sets and fantastic special effects for which Prometheus should receive a bunch a nominations.

The acting is flawless, except perhaps for a few minor characters. Special praise goes to Noomi Rapace, Michael Fassbender and Charlize Theron whose characters are also extremely well written and convincing. Noomi especially deserves applause for her flawless acting. There are a good number of scenes where her character is understandably very disturbed and terrified, and Noomi's acting is so genuine I wanted to scream out ""just throw her a damn Oscar already!"". One refreshing aspect of her character is that, contrary to what one might expect, she's not like Ripley from Alien. Ripley was from the start a pretty strong woman, close to a tomboy. Noomi's character, Elizabeth Shaw, is much more impulsive, insecure and feminine. She grows stronger as her situation becomes desperate, but she remains endearing and delicate enough that the extremely shocking things she must endure are genuinely heartbreaking.

The plot for Prometheus is where I have more reservations. The attempt at making some characters seem like scientists, including Noomi's character, made me cringe at times. It's typical Hollywood scientists, by that I mean not very believable. How a teenager would imagine science-speak to be like. The build up for the climax was somewhat disappointing in comparison to the first two Alien films, and to me lacked a distinct atmosphere so essential for a horror film. The action and horror scenes were genuinely good and exciting, sometimes shocking, however I wasn't scared any time, but perhaps I've just grown insensitized to horror by now. I'll also add that if you thought the classic Alien life cycle (queen lays egg, which hatches facehugger, which plants embryo in host, which grows into a xenomorph) was a stretch, wait till you see what Prometheus has to offer, which I find makes little sense and I'll probably be wondering more about that than anything else. Obviously, the creatures in Prometheus are some forms of ancestral or primitive types which may evolve into what we know from the Alien franchise. Regardless, Prometheus offers some very pleasing surprises throughout, and it's great to discover this universe which will surely become a franchise. Ridley Scott wished it, and the end of the movie shamelessly confirms it, to the point that one could expect a ""To be continued..."" before the credits. Also many questions remain painfully unanswered, which is somewhat cheap.

Anyway, Prometheus remains an impressive watch and paves the way to what could be a grand new mythology. It doesn't match the first two Alien films in quality, and one shouldn't expect it to or he will be sorely disappointed. I will probably go see Prometheus again, because the first time was somewhat overwhelming. I wouldn't be surprised if Prometheus is the kind of film which gets better after a few viewings. I'll add that the ending of Prometheus announces an epic sequel, probably much better, so I'm pretty hopeful for one to happen.","8"
"fletchy-57354","True mystery and adventure","24 March 2021","A great sci fi movie that gives you the scares of Alien and the mystery of Indiana jones. Underrated and slated for some small plotholes. You could rip breaking bad and godfather to pieces with nitpicking if you wanted to.","9"
"Cinnyaste","Not Only Brainless But Reprehensible","8 June 2012","Welcome to Ridley Scott's lobotomy.

There's a quaint notion plot points introduced in the first minutes are paid off by end credit's roll. (Introduce a gun in the First Act, use it by the Third.) Three Act structure: venerable, tested, Beginning, Middle, END. It is reported with great sadness this concept perished in the still-birth of ""Prometheus."" Fine. Great films sometimes toss away cinematic tradition to frame an intriguing story in a new way. ""Prometheus"" is not one of them. This film is an anti-cinematic conceit whose sole purpose is who knows. Maybe to get your ass in a seat for the next. Mr. Scott and his band of merry pranksters should have inserted the title, 'Coming Soon, Prometheus II'. Add a zoom out from infinity to wring the most of 3D.

It's difficult to fathom why anyone without good knowledge of the Alien films would care about or understand this flaccid prequel. (Or even care if you do.) The Alien Quadrilogy left many to wonder about the aliens. They're obviously intelligent yet incredibly hostile. Why? Who are they? Where do they come from? ""Prometheus"" offers a tease but few answers. Instead there's obfuscated storytelling with the clarity of thick Mississippi mud. However, fans of the Alien films will immediately recognize references to the earlier films.

The brass tacks.

This rust bucket lurches into many ports along its ill-fated two hour tour. There's mankind's unquenchable thirst to know his place in the Universe. A narcissistic quest for God by a pseudo Jesus. Corporate greed and dirty dealings. The strained relationship between Fathers and Daughters. Guns blazing action. Beware! If this cocktail be tasteth it will puckereth the mouth with bittereth confusion and droppeth the IQ by fourscore points.

Dialogue so bad the ears ache. Characters you could give a damn about ready to do anything to fulfill unspoken agendas. Characters 'assigned' inane personalities in order to act out equally inane, unmotivated behavior. Even the hapless lead, the excellent Ms. Rapace, appears to have walked into the middle of a lecture about Astrophysics that's well above her head. And, Ms. Theron trips into the space carpet and is never heard from again. A signpost for trouble dead ahead always arrives in the form of a film within the film. In this case, Michael Fassbender, the android David, adopts Peter O'Toole's fey behavior after watching (a 3D) ""Lawrence of Arabia."" From 1962. How many will get this, and other, smarmy references tossed ascreen by lazy writers who are also incapable of writing and instead plug in emotion and theme from other sources.

HAL: I'm sorry, Dave. I can't do that.

Of Mr. Fassbender, his light shines brightest. Like the murderous HAL in ""2001: A Space Odyssey,"" this artificial David intrigues. He's Mary anointing Jesus' feet; the perfect, cocktail shaking man-servant; corporate bad guy; keeper of the (unspoken) secrets of secrets; murderer; Dr. Frankenstein. Nice work, Mr. Fassbender, but see also Ian Holm, Ash, ""Alien,"" 1979.

Mostly, the cast just bumps into each other on the expensive sets and vast, exotic landscape.

Mr. Scott called this mess, ""2001 on steroids."" Kubrick is doomed to spin eternally in his grave.

C'mon! It must have thrills and chills. Wrong, Bucko. There are painfully few heart-racing moments. Sure, here's a highpoint; an inexplicable Zombie attack by the greedy Brit, Fifield, Sean Harris, who died after his face was burned off by the molecular acid coursing in alien veins. Nice work, Mr. Harris, but see also Yaphet Kotto, Parker, ""Alien,"" 1979. Minus the Zombie, of course.

The writer's laptops should be immediately confiscated and incinerated. The ashes should then be sealed in a titanium urn, encased in a ton of concrete and dropped into the Marianas Trench. Wait! James Cameron could possibly retrieve them. (Yes, that's a dig at Cameron.)

Tech credits are top notch as is the 3D. Too bad all that effort resulted in a stupid, pointless and muddled-beyond-belief film.

If given to mythology, Prometheus endowed humans, formerly clay, with the spark of life. He should have been hired as a technical consultant for this DOA, namesake film. Maybe he could ask Zeus to send down a thunderbolt or two to fry the master hard drives upon which the ill-arranged bits and bytes of ""Prometheus"" reside. (If they were on speaking terms after that fire thing.)

"kaefab","What went wrong","14 June 2012","I have been waiting for a year to see this movie ever since i heard about it and Ridley Scott directing it.

I got to see it last night and all hell broke loose.

From the very first frame of the alien on earth drinking who knows what and dying into that water fall, to the almost none existing character development, to the awful story.

At least in AVP they recruited the team, in Prometheus everyone is inside the ship within 5 minutes of the movie, for a 2 and a half trillion dollar mission to find out where we come from.

The casting for the movie is incredible, that makes it a lot worst. Charlize Theron was amazing has the bad women, Fastbender also. Noomie Rapace (strike 2 for her in American soil, her role on Sherlock Holmes games of shadow was terrible), did what she could with what she was given.

For me Prometheus has no emotion, no scares, absolutely nothing going for it to relate it to an Alien prequel.

A part from the special effects the rest is terrible and a great disappointment.

Stop the alien ship or we won't have a planet to go back too, (that simple phrase was enough to convince the captain and 2 other pilots to crash the Prometheus into the alien space ship).

Elisabeth Shaw gets an abortion, she got infected by an alien parasite, she gets into an operating machine and 3 minutes later she is up and running like nothing happened.

At this point nothing can save Prometheus and its up there with my list of worst movie ever.","5"
"ViktorDrake","Shockingly Poor","15 June 2012","*** SPOILERS AHEAD ***

Most of what I have to say about this film has already been covered by numerous reviewers here already. However I will still do this review if for no other reason than to do my bit to try to rectify the (currently) appallingly high rating of 7.7 on here. This film doesn't deserve such a high rating.

Like many others here I am a huge fan of the first Alien movie (and Jim Cameron's superb sequel), so when I heard that Ridley Scott himself was returning to the Alien universe to shoot a prequel (of sorts) I was suitably excited and drooling with anticipation. I was even pleased when I heard the new movie wasn't even going to include the Alien as we know it, as in my opinion this actually serves to expand the Alien universe far better than just rehashing the original movie(s) over and over again.

I could merrily talk about the many failings of the lofty and yet simplistic creationist basic plot, the nonsensical cod-scientific rubbish about DNA, the instant healing after the ridiculous caesarean section performed on Dr Shaw, but I won't. And the reason I won't is because at the end of the day, this is sci-fi and while most sane people would PREFER things to make at least a little sense, the sci-fi genre is one where you can get away with utter nonsense slightly more than most.

Instead of that, I'll concentrate on the human elements of the movie, and it is here that this film really looks like amateur hour to me. The simple fact is that none of the people are remotely believable in their attitudes, their actions, or their speech - and this is absolutely unforgivable in my opinion. Are we really supposed to believe that the greatest, and no-doubt most expensive, mission in human history will be undertaken by such a combined collection is imbeciles and weirdos? The first scene with them all together in the hanger (before they see the hologram of Guy Pierce pretending to be old), they all look like a bunch of petulant teenagers, slouching around in their hoodies trying to look all cool and tough. In the real world the geologist, Fifield, wouldn't be trusted with the TV remote let alone a multi-million pound trip to another planet. The rest of them were the usual stereotypes of cowards, ""tough-guys"", and dysfunctional weirdos that only ever inhabit movies like this.

But the big problem is that none of the ""scientists"" do or say remotely believable things. For example (and there are MANY examples to choose from) –

1. Taking their helmets off in an alien environment on no more than a quick computer scan (that failed to pick up either the presence of the worms, or the dead aliens on site).

2. Fifield constantly freaking out about absolutely nothing. In the real world the guy would be in an asylum, but no - here he's the obvious choice.

3. ""Scientists"" immediately touching alien creatures with no care at all.

4. Other ""scientists"" getting blind drunk literally minutes after making the greatest discoveries in the history man.

5. David opening up a ""black oil"" ""bomb"", snapping bits off it and pulling bits out (despite never having seen one before), like he's a child dismantling a Lego house.

6. The lack of Shaw even mentioning to anyone she just gave birth to an alien squid - and then managing to not kill it.

7. The complete lack of any hint of proper quarantine procedures. Ludicrous.

8. The attempt to re-animate the alien head - why they do this is never explained - which then causes it to blow up (again, why this happens is never explained).

And so it goes on and on and on

Now I can forgive films of the past that fell down as a result of special effects technology being inadequate to fully realise the director's vision as long as the script and characters are believable. This film is the complete opposite - superb visuals coupled with pathetic characters and appalling script-writing. I honestly can't believe that Mr Scott sat down at the end of making this movie, watched the finished cut, and said, ""YES! That's exactly the film I wanted to make"". If so, he needs to be pensioned off and banned from ever getting behind a film camera again. The line from the film, ""Every king has his reign and then he dies"", has never been more apt with Mr Scott's movie-making career.

Lastly, what was the point of having Guy Pierce doddering about rather unconvincingly in rather unconvincing old-man-makeup? Simply employing an older actor would've made far more sense. But then again, very little about this movie makes any sense. Yes we can all look really REALLY hard and try to draw religious parallels to this movie in exactly the same way that if we stare at the sky long enough we might be able to make out the face of Father Christmas in the clouds, but frankly I think that's overlooking the blindingly obvious fact that this film is just a bit rubbish really. (I remember people spending hours discussing The Matrix Revolutions, looking for hidden meaning and hidden depth, before everyone finally realised that it was actually just a load of junk. So it will be with Prometheus).

Never mind, at least there are two good Alien films out there. For me the Alien mythology starts with the Nostromo in Alien, and ends with Ripley, Hicks and Newt sailing off in the Sulaco at the end of Aliens.

Save your money folks, and if you really feel the need to contribute to Mr Scott's pension fund, buy Alien on Blu Ray instead.","1"
"kosmasp","Different beast","1 August 2012","First of all you shouldn't compare this too much with the original Alien. It is actually a good thing that this is different. I wouldn't like it any other way. The fact that Mr. Damon Lindelof co-wrote the script might be an indicator that you're not going to get all the answers here. On the other hand, it was stated that this might be the beginning of a new trilogy or at least ""saga"".

Another thing that has been criticized is the scientific accuracy of the movie. But apart from the fact, that this is another society that might have other values, other standards than we know. Even if not, this is still a movie and things happen in here that are not ""true"" to what we know (especially in genre like Science Fiction!).

Onto the positive things. Visually this is more than stunning. Especially the beginning left me wide eyed. That was incredible. You may not like the movie as it is, but can't fault the technical achievements. I liked the acting too and I for once also liked the story. It isn't a genius concept, but it works more than nicely for the movie.

One of the most memorable scenes from ""Alien"" gets mirrored here and it has to be seen to be believed. It really has a similar impact. Another kind of beast this is indeed, but it still is a very great one","9"
"Ryan_MYeah","Ambitious, but misleading.","22 June 2012","Ridley Scott. Does the name ring a bell? It should. Scott is the cinematic mastermind behind classic movies like Alien, Blade Runner, and Gladiator. He's also the unfortunate creator of recent clunkers like A Good Year, Body of Lies, and Robin Hood. Which category does his latest movie Prometheus - an ambitious indirect prequel to the Alien franchise he started 33 years ago - belong to? Hard to say, simply because the movie is just that divisive. This really is one of those love it/hate it movies, and I can certainly see the points of both sides of the argument. Despite well intentions and big visual style, I just cannot get nearly as enthusiastic about this movie as many fellow movie-goers.

Dr. Elizabeth Shaw (Noomi Rapace) and her boyfriend Charlie Holloway (Logan Marshall-Green) find what they believe to be clues to mankind's creation all over Earth, and lead a team of space soldiers, along with the secretive Captain Vickers (Charlize Theron), to a small planet that they believe will answer questions of theirs. If you've ever seen an Alien movie, you know this is a bad idea. Even though the team finds the answers they're looking for, they've also indirectly started a chain of events that could affect the world as we know it.

Allow me to break out of my usual review format and split my thoughts on the film into what worked, and didn't work for me.

WHAT WORKS: Without a doubt, Prometheus is a seriously impressive example of spectacle. Dariusz Wolski's claustrophobic cinematography, Arthur Max's chilling production design, the epic visual effects by supervisor Robert Stammers, and the surrounding sound mix and design are all vital to enhancing the ambiance and atmosphere of this strange planet, making it feel completely believable. Also impressive, for the most part, is the talent. Noomi Rapace makes for a strong, emotionally involving, and compelling hero, making Shaw a worthy successor to Ellen Ripley. The most fascinating aspect of Prometheus, oddly enough, is the perplexing and curious android David, played with calm nuance by Michael Fassbender. Sprinkling David with a Peter O'Toole vibe, delightful comic details, and subtly captivating mannerisms, Fassbender adds another powerful performance to his résumé.

WHAT DOESN'T WORK: The screenplay by John Spaihts and Damon Lindelof (the latter a former writer of LOST) plays a big job in the mysterious nature of Prometheus, but it also turns out to be a downside to the film. You can definitely detect the subtext of creation and religion that the writers were going for, and the film poses some very mind provoking questions, but it also fails to answer many of them, and the writers just can't bring the themes together properly. The movie just adds up to a confusing whole with numerous loose ends, made worse by mixing in horror techniques that worked for Alien, but doesn't quite fit here. Early on, it's easy to tell that many of the characters are merely here as human bowling pins waiting to get knocked down, so nothing ever really comes as a surprise. Also, despite an even first half, the second half's rhythm is off, undone by serious pacing and length issues.

But maybe there's something more to it. Maybe it'll get better with a re watch. Maybe it'll get better with a sequel, which the film not so subtly hints that there will be. However, as of right now, it's just not up to par as an overall, singular product.

"OverThereDB","A vast, epic, underrated, and ORIGINAL sci-fi film.","5 July 2015","Prometheus is one of the most underrated and misunderstood science fiction movies in recent memory. Do NOT view this as a prequel to Alien. It is part of the same universe, but while the first 4 are action/horror films, Prometheus is a sci-fi adventure that explores the origins of mankind. This concept is something I've always wanted to see put to screen, and Prometheus delivers so well that I'm enthralled by it no matter how many times I watch it. The cinematography and score are Oscar worthy, and the direction and visuals are near perfect. I believe Prometheus would be much higher rated if more people went into it with an open mind. The first Alien did have mixed reviews upon initial release, and now it is an all time classic. I really think that one day Prometheus will have the same status, and I hope the sequels are more appreciated.","7"
"michal-dudek","Good special effects, poor, poor writing","3 June 2012","I must admit that the special effects and overall scale of the film is epic. But for crying out loud the plot is thin as paper and the writing is very very bad. None of the characters are acting in a logical way. There is no explainable motivations behind their actions and the story behind the alien race contradicts itself. After watching it I have a feeling it's just a collection of cool ideas put together without any logic to link them. The film pretends to raise some philosophical questions but it's done in a very childish way and in the end you can ""choose to believe"" whatever you want despite the evidence to the contrary.

**************************SPOILER*****************************

They come to this alien planet (not Alien alien, just extraterrestrial) and decide to land immediately without any surveillance from the orbit. Luckily out of the whole planet the place they happened to fly over had alien structures so they land there. Only then the scientists learn from the mission director what they are allowed to do. They go to this alien structure with their hi-tech equipment and an android. The android presses all the buttons he can find like 5 year old and nobody's surprised that he doesn't explain anything. Apparently he mastered a couple of ancient earth languages but that's no explanation to why he understands alien writings. The guy operating the hi-tech probes that map the structure suddenly flips out when he sees an alien corpse while everyone else is cool, decides to go back to the ship and gets lost in the tunnels. In the structure they decide that the air is breathable on the basis of it's chemical composition and take off their helmets. Who in their right mind exposes oneself to an alien environment. You don't know what can be in this air especially that you're looking for alien life. Then out of nowhere a sand storm appears as if triggered by their actions. So they retreat and they take the alien head with them to the ship while the geo-expert most competent on finding his way back gets lost in the structure. In the ship they do decontamination of the alien head but they fail to decontaminate their own heads after the exposure to the alien environment. And now the best happens: The paleontologist/archaeologist suddenly becomes an expert on alien physiology and just by looking at the head decides that there are some new cell outgrowths on the forehead. They decide to reanimate a 2000(?) year old head by using electroshocks after which the head explodes. (What was the point of that scene? To show their incompetence?) Then they examine the alien DNA under the microscope(!) and the analysis tells them it matches human DNA. (Wow really? After millions of years of evolution of human species it's still the same? Oh wait, you can ""choose to believe"" so. Yet the opening scene of the alien committing suicide and dispersing in the water with cool particle effects suggests that he initiated all the life on the planet. But then again the ancient cultures worshipped the solar system the alien structures were on. So maybe we are their direct descendants. But it's not where the alien race comes from. It's just a storage place for biological weapon. Why would the aliens leave an ""invitation"" to their military base?) Meanwhile the android opens one of the vases they found in the structure like he knew exactly what he's doing. All in his room without any secure containment. He brakes open a vial of unidentified liquid which for all he knows could be kryptonite or cool-aid and decides to roofie one of the scientist with it. Meanwhile the guys that were afraid of the alien corpse and got lost in the structure decide to make friends with a snakelike life form that emerged from a puddle and get raped by it. The roofied scientist gets sick but before that he manages to have sex with his colleague (Elizabeth) and impregnate her with an alien life form. Then the android scans the Elizabeth on the next day like he knew what he was looking for and tries to restrain her so she will give birth to an alien. (Why would he want to do that???) She escapes and uses automated surgical chamber to remove the alien from her belly. The procedure cuts through her whole abdomen and then staples it back together. From now on she runs around in all action scenes with her severed abdominal muscles. (The least they could do is show some hi-tech quick healing procedure or something.) She escapes and finds Wayland to be on the ship and he's looking for cure to old age. No one is surprised she has a gushing wound across her abdomen and they embark on another trip to the alien structure which turned out to be a spaceship. They revive one of the alien crew members which goes on a killing rampage after a chat with the android (no explanation why) and decides to fly the spaceship to eradicate life on earth. Fortunately after a quick chat with the female protagonist the pilots enthusiastically decide to go kamikaze on the alien spaceship and die with smiles on their faces. Then there is the nerve wrecking scene of the doughnut spaceship rolling and chasing Elizabeth and Meredith in a straight line when all they had to do to avoid it was to step aside. The alien pilot somehow survives the crash and comes back with a revenge on his mind. It is defeated by the foetus Elizabeth gave birth to which grew to a gigantic size on absolutely nothing in a matter of hours closed in the operation chamber. In the end Elizabeth joins forces with the android who poisoned her lover and tried to kill her as well and they fly off to find the home planet of the alien race.","6"

"jaxbubba","Pro-LAME-us","16 June 2012","A more appropriate title to this crapfest would be ""Pro-LAME-us"". Ridley Scott's prequel to his highly successful Alien franchise is just pure rubbish. A team of explorers venture to a far away planet in hopes of finding the answers to the origins of mankind. Believing that the secrets to the origins of mankind have been mapped out in ancient cave drawings, an aging gazillionaire has ponied up $1,000,000,000 (One Trillion) to fund this expedition.

Two scientists on board the Prometheus, adamant believers that humankind is direct decedents of this alien race, have been selected to head the team into the alien fortress. As our researchers continue to scourer the alien fortress in hopes to make ""first contact"" it becomes quite apparent that some huge catastrophe has taken place at this site almost 2,000 years prior.

The team comes in contact with a room filled with cylindrical containers, filled with organic matter. And is in the previously films, they are far too stupid to leave these containers alone, and after nearly 62 minutes of watching this long drawn out film, we finally get some action. However, it's too little too late.

The film trudges along at a snail's place, and Ridley Scott brings nothing new to this film. All the common elements are here: (1) the crew is to stupid not to know that alien snake-like creatures might attack, (2) if a company pays $1,000,000,000 for an expedition, there might be ulterior motives involve, and (3) NEVER TRUST THE CYBORG!!!!! I hated this film, it's an atrocity to the franchise (and I thought Alien 4 was about as bad as it could get); however, I WAS WRONG!!!!!! Avoid this film at all cost, or you will be just pissing your hard earned money away!!!!!! Trust me on this one!!!! And please DO NOT get me started on the ending!!!!!!

"markwoo","A truly awful film - moronic!! Avoid like the plague","5 June 2012","From the incomprehensible opening (that never gets explained) one descends into a morass of witless clichés with a plot line that leaves one in a state of disbelief that such a rubbish script ever made it to the screen. No amount of special effects could lift this turkey off the runway for me. There is no explanation as to why some aging mega-mogul is driven to fund a one trillion dollar expedition just to ask where we come from. The first time we meet the scientific team the geologist turns out to be a tattooed aggressive money chaser. By any normal standards, a team like this would have done plenty of familiarisation before departing on such a mission so they would all know each other extremely well. The idea of introducing yourself at the end of a two-year sleep was just so hopelessly unbelievable and set the tone for a downward spiral of further stupidities thereafter. The lack of any sort of contamination/contagion protocols was also totally stupid – why do filmmakers seem to believe we are such idiots. Then there is the android re-run (see Alien for all you need to know about this witless and unbelievable addition to the plot). Once again, it is completely incredible to think that humans would allow any android the degree of freedom accorded to the one here. There would always be some sort of 'off' switch. The other fundamental flaw to the android plot line, is what was he doing for the mega-mogul? Then there was the only slight improvement in the weapon systems (over those portrayed in Alien), some rifles and better flamethrowers. Do me a favour and recognise what a horribly untrusting species we are and know that we would not venture into hostile and unknown space without carrying every conceivable weapon we could devise. Equally laughable and sadly pathetic was the automatic operating theatre. Programmed only for males – how crass. In addition, no one is going to believe that Noomi Rapace's character could recover so soon from her operation. The final scenes are the last nail in the coffin of a travesty of a film that was so unintelligent as to defy belief. Firstly, how on earth are the android head and Noomi Rapace going to survive the journey to some unknown planet and just to deliver the alien humanoids own biological weapon back to their home planet. So we are to accept that a scientist goes from wanting to know where we came from to setting out to destroy where we came from? Come on scriptwriters – surely you can be more inventive than that. Secondly, how did that silly little squid grow into such a monster without food? Why does the squid offspring then turn into an alien? Utter biological nonsense.","1"
"Laight","Please Read This Before Watching the Movie","1 June 2014","I was going to review this movie after having seen it last night -- but then I saw that scores of other people have already reviewed it, saying basically the same things I was going to say. Prometheus may have more plot holes than any other movie in history. Whoever wrote the script didn't seem to care about characters, action, continuity, structure, or anything else that makes a movie work. If you're interested, read the other reviews, all with spoilers, that point out these dozens and dozens of mistakes. But otherwise my advice is: Don't watch this movie!!... or you will waste two hours of your life and then spend the next day thinking about the ridiculousness you have just seen... as I am doing now... I want my two hours back!!!!","1"
"Michael-Hallows-Eve","Brilliant Prequel!","12 September 2012","This movie is brilliant. I was enthralled from start to finish. The effects (as usual for a Ridley Scott film) were great. The story was well done as it ties in to the original films. I was like a kid at a candy shop watching this as it took me back to when I saw 'Alien' for the first time. The cast work well together also, and their roles all work for me. There are couple of parts in the film that were exciting for me as they tie the other films together (can't say too much as it may spoil things for others who have not seen it). So in summary, this is a top notch film. Highly recommend it. Can't wait for more (if you've seen it you'll know what I mean). 9 out of 10.","9"
"dutchchocolatecake","brilliant on so many levels","10 June 2012","This is the movie that officially killed Guillermo Del Toro's ""At the Mountains of Madness"" so if anyone should be holding a grudge against this movie, it should be me.

It goes without saying - this movie is absolutely stunning. Everything from visuals to music to acting to special FX. They really rolled out everything to make this movie good and I'm glad they did because it's absolutely fantastic. I started watching this fully expecting to hate it, and I went away with my breath taken away and my mind reeling.

This movie will NOT passively entertain you. If you're the type that disengages their brain when the lights go out, this movie is NOT for you. This movie is science fiction/thriller. I would go on to say it's probably more speculative science fiction, because it leaves a lot to the viewer to interpret/discover on their own. I have no problem with this, because I absolutely love puzzling stuff out. If you don't, or if you hate TV shows like Lost, this is NOT the movie for you.

The intense emotional response to this movie tells me that a lot of people don't like thinking about the consequences of human behavior. ""Prometheus"" is about many things - but IMO the most important is how we act as a society and how our behavior affects others. Ironically, the people raging against this movie are the ones who need to understand this the most.","10"
"a666333","An expensive, pretentious waste of time","1 July 2012","Prometheus is almost without any redeeming characteristics. It is a recycled, old hat, extremely pretentious waste of money and talent relying on a mix of attempted but misguided gross-outs and pseudo-intellectual babble.

Despite the money spent on state-of-the-art effects, the visuals do not generate suspense or awe. It is all tired and since they are not added to a satisfying storyline or great characters, they just coldly glide past the viewer.

The supposedly big original thought about humans being engineered by extra-terrestrials is not new. It is a very old idea but they wanted to add something new to the Alien franchise. Ridley Scott himself has alluded to the fact that he wanted to make something original rather than a straight prequel. I think they would have been better off with a straight prequel. The twist they add to the Alien universe is forced and a let down. They just had to bring in that theme even if it meant permanently messing up a conceptual framework that had worked.

The dark, shadowy atmosphere of Alien is there but it is really tired and over done here. It seems to be there just to be there rather than contributing to anything in particular and also to confirm that, lest there be any doubt, this is part of the Alien franchise.

We get some action and gore as expected but again, it seems just to be there because it has to be. It is not suspenseful or interesting and it gets very cartoonish at times.

A word about the acting; these people had little to work with and were being directed in a context that went nowhere, so they cannot be blamed. Some of them had to physically work hard so you can say they tried.

As for the dialogue. Well, I am shocked that there are people who actually think the drivel in Prometheus is interesting, significant or insightful. Is this what we have come to? My heart is sinking.

The more I think of it, my rating of 3 is perhaps too high but given the production talent and money spent, some viewers might find that worth something and it could have been even worse so a 1 would be unfair.","3"
"phd_travel","Story doesn't make much sense","14 October 2012","THe story doesn't make enough sense. Things don't seem to add up or lead to anything with lots of red herrings.

What was the opening scene's creature relationship to the rest of the story? Why did David the android infect Holloway? Why were there all these different kinds of alien creatures the bald human like creature, the squid baby, the snake? Generally the characters were not interesting except the android played by Fassbender was interesting to watch. The Cesarean scene was quite morbidly fascinating.

The effects are grand but too much was in darkness.

Charleze was too good for this movie. Noomi is an interesting heroine, not too pretty and not too tomboyish.

Overall it doesn't make much sense - don't bother. Even the Aliens series had a better story.","2"
"paul_haakonsen","Quite impressive...","9 September 2012","I had heard a lot of good things about ""Prometheus"", but also heard equally many bad things. And yes, the movie does have some big shoes to fill out. And now having seen this movie, I somehow fail to see the views and the dismay of the nay-sayers. I found ""Prometheus"" to be a very good movie, and a great way to kick off the series of prequel movies to the original ""Alien"" movie.

As in the first ""Alien"" movie, the atmosphere in ""Prometheus"" was really great, lots of super cool details and it really had that surreal alien-like touch to it, thanks to Giger's fantastic design, but also to Ridley Scott's great vision. As for a prequel this early in the universe of the ""Alien"" movies, there was a good amount of references that lets us fans get a look at things that were before and do our own adding up to the franchise's movies. And I am sure that the following movies to ""Prometheus"" will be equally great and add more good stuff to the lore of the ""Alien"" universe.

The people cast for the roles were doing great jobs. I especially enjoyed Noomi Rapace (playing Elizabeth Shaw) and Michael Fassbender (playing David); they were really putting on great performances.

I really enjoyed all the detail in the movie, I mean, both the alien ship and the human ship was full of great visual effects, both small and big. And they had really managed to build up a believable setting for both ships, giving it a very futuristic appearance (on the human ship) and a very dark, sinister (and very Gigerish) appearance to the alien ship.

And speaking of effects, the scene with the acid sprayed on the mask of the environmental suit was just amazing.

The creatures were also very nicely made. The concept of the parasite organisms was good and gives room (for obvious) evolution into the creatures that we have come to know from the older movies in the ""Alien"" franchise. Great creature concept and visuals, and they really came off as realistic creatures and also as very alien creatures. As for the 'engineers', that was just mind-boggling, so human and yet so alien. I loved those, and enjoyed the back-story that we came to learn about them in this movie, and hope to get more in the upcoming movies. I remember hearing nay-sayers complaining about the creatures in ""Prometheus"", but come on, it takes place a long time before the original ""Alien"" movie, and like humans have, why wouldn't (or shouldn't) these creature evolve as well?

And the storyline in the movie was also nice, although fairly confined in its aspect. But for a starting movie for a series of sequels, it did a good job. And I was thoroughly entertained from start to end.

I am a fan of the franchise, and I think that ""Prometheus"" really did a great job on expanding on already well-established lore. It did really give me a sense of closure to stuff from the very first ""Alien"" movie, and I am really excited about seeing the follow-up movies. Ridley Scott really delivered with ""Prometheus"". A well worthy addition to the ""Alien"" franchise, and a definite must watch for fans of the franchise.","8"
"contact-387-790891","Ridiculous nonsense.","3 June 2012","WARNING: LOTS OF SPOILERS.

Synopsis: Two archaeologists find some old drawings of an alien and a star map. They ""choose to believe"" that the aliens created human life. So they travel to the planet identified in the drawings. When they arrive at the planet, the members of the expedition all work against each other even though they all want the same thing. Each member then repeated does really stupid things until most of them are dead. The film ends before we see the final stupid decision actually kill the last surviving members.

Nothing the characters did made any sense:

> The robot without feelings falls in love with a woman.

> The robot then risks her life because he wants to preserve the parasite inside her. Why? No reason.

> The expedition is searching for life, but the biologist wants to return to the ship when they find a 2000 year old corpse.

> The geologist also wants to return to the ship rather than look at rocks.

> The geologist then gets lost despite being in charge of the mapping device.

> The top boss pays for the expedition, but pretends he's dead and hides on the ship. Why? No reason.

> The leader of the expedition refuses to cooperate with either the robot or the archaeologists - even though they all want the same thing.

> The alien tries to kill everyone, so the surviving characters decide to go to the alien's home planet to talk to them.

Another issue that kept annoying me was the inaccurate terminology used. There was no reason for it - it was just wrong. For example, at one point the archaeologists talk about abiogenesis and the biologist weirdly starts talking about evolution. Later on, a head exploded (like in Scanners) and the scientist says ""Why did that head combust?"". I don't expect screenwriters to have degrees, but they should at least look up words in the dictionary.

The CGI is good and the acting would be fine if the actors had been given something worthwhile to do. But every other aspect of the film was a disappointing waste of time.

"robin-hectors","Sci Why?","30 May 2012","OK this is a lame title for a review, but prometheus kind of deserves a lame intro.

The move opens up very promising, with epic landscapes and a beautifully done intro and epilogue. Then there's a scene where we see David doing his every day chores and keeping himself busy while the rest of the crew is still in cryo-sleep. This scene is utterly genius and should'v really set the tone for the rest of the movie, but all what comes after is really disappointing.

the films builds up quite nice, but until half of the movie it slips away in to unnecessary dialogs. probably to cover up the major plot holes. I was sitting in the theater just asking myself: why are they doing that? Why is this character stereotype in the movie? How did they find this place so fast? Why in the hell do they have a switchboard that turns on holograms about what happened last time and who put them there? What is up with the zombie??? and so on.

If all these questions were compensated with raw action, or tongue in cheek humor, i could have just waved it away; But the film propagates itself as an intellectual, epic adventure about the beginning of mankind.

For a guy who made brilliant films such as Alien, Bladerunner, Gladiator etc. You have to wonder, why is he satisfied with a lame sci fi movie that any other director could have made...

"ntvnyr30","Another Scott Masterpiece","21 June 2014","I remember going to the theaters to see ""Alien"" when I was a kid. I was scared witless at this xenomorph from another planet.

Thirty-three years later, Sir Ridley Scott has created another fascinating world in his prequel ""Prometheus"". I have read many hateful messages and reviews directed at this film because ""it doesn't answer questions"". Why can't people just enjoy this film on its own merits, of which there are many?

The cast is stellar. I frankly never heard of Noomi Rapace before this film, but her performance was spot on. Michael Fassbender steals the show as the android David. I can't believe this is the same actor who was in ""Inglorious Basterds"". David knows all about his shipmates for while they were all in cryosleep during the arduous voyage, he was watching their dreams. He is especially infatuated with Dr. Shaw's (Rapace) dreams and with her unshakable belief in God. Later in the film he cons her into taking off the cross. Does David have religious prejudices too? Is he able to be insulted as when Logan Marshall-Green calls him ""boy""? David exacts revenge later in the film on Green, but was it David's idea or someone else's? Without going into too much detail, the part that will have everyone on the edge of his seat is the machine performed emergency operation on Dr. Shaw. This is one of the most squirm-inducing scenes I have ever seen in recent years.

The rest of the cast are wonderful: Idris Elba, Guy Pearce and Charlize Theron. Theron does a great job as the leader of the expedition. She slinks around the ship in such an eerie way you might think she was another android.

This is the most visually stunning film in recent memory, especially in HD. This reminds me of the original ""Star Wars"" in that the special effects were used to underscore the action, not replace the actors with a bunch of CGI which is what happened in the ""Star Wars"" prequels. I think this is one of the best science fiction films of all time, right up there with ""2001"", ""Star Wars"" and ""Alien"". Another great job from Sir Ridley Scott!","10"
"Jinn","The Gods are ANGRY. Very Angry Especially Prometheus.","29 January 2013","It is told in the ancient legends that the Greek Titan Prometheus gave mortals fire (and was punished by Zeus.) Perhaps Prometheus can once again light a torch for humanity, but before he does so, place the torch near his titanic arse and let loose a thunderous fart on this travesty of his namesake.

Not for the first time I'm wising IMDb had negative stars. 1=awful. -10=GODawful. Don't you *hate* it when a preview looks interesting, then gets predictable and when you finally see said movie out of that spark of interest it turns out to be even more shite than you expected? Thy name was Prometheus. The movie, that is, not the Titan who thought having his liver pecked out every night was preferable to this stuffed turkey which pecked out his brain (someone also said that in their review about their own liver.) The movie soon went to Tartarus, then went further. Last seen heading rapidly even more south.

Perhaps that very same eagle or aliens ate Ridley's brain? Oh well they say you're not a director unless you've made at least one flop, 'cept this ""soufflé"" didn't just flop, it was burnt to a crisp and had to be put out with a fire hydrant (courtesy of Prometheus), set those accursed beeping smoke alarms off and stunk the house out for days.

Another reviewer mentioned a stab at Scientology. I'd believe that. If it'd starred Tom Cruise I would have checked out (or not checked in in the first place) Good thing I hired it on DVD and like when I watched ""Cloverfield"" (another predictable godawful sci-fi travesty,) spent more quality time cutting out pictures for my vision board. And they promote the DVD had extras, sit through it AGAIN with a commentary?!?! *Squeals with laughter* A crying shame the whole damned moved wasn't a ""deleted scene"" or was that a goof? When I first started watching, I thought it was a pathetic Alien/Event Horizon rip-off, not a great prequel. The one redeeming thing was Fassbender was great as David and it was Liam Neeson I believe who said you're not an actor unless you've done one major flop. The movie's only other saving grace was it was a clear warning against biological weapons. The rest of the cast, wooden and boring and Noomi although pretty and an somewhat interesting and naive, but also boring character is a poor actress - some scenes she's supposed to be crying and she looks like she's giggling like a schoolgirl. And who runs about like a mad sale shopper after a Cesarean, even if it is set in the future with more advanced equipment? And poor Charlize? Her character was a b!tch, but surely didn't deserve that!! To see Pro-meep-theus had 120 pages of bad reviews at the time I wrote this, doesn't make me feel so bad. The fact it had 59 pages of good reviews is staggering to any intelligent life-form. And there's a SEQUEL I hear??!?! What the feck??!! You gotta be sh!ttin' me! What in all the worlds is sci-fi coming to? The real Prometheus has left the building! Sorry, but sometimes something must be said. This movie was an obvious, lame attempt to frighten people of ""what's out there"" and ooo! If we search for answers 'out there,' look what eeeevil, nasty horrors await us!! We'd better pick up our crosses, grab our bibles and go to church! The religious connotations may have been subtle for some, but for me, stuck out like bulldog balls.

Truth is, the unknown should always be approached with caution, but approached nonetheless as if it were not, we'd still think the Earth was flat and everything revolved around us. The church came up with those too Nuff said? (When the ancient Greeks, Egyptians and Celts knew the Earth was round (and according to 8000 years old Indian and Greek texts that we lived in a 9 planet solar system, though the planets were not named until much later and I doubt the Greeks would have had the hubris to debunk Pluto.) Exploring (our external and internal world) is how we learn and grow.

Perhaps almighty Zeus can send eagles to peck out the livers of the producers of this piece of primordial goop and give real writers and unfairly impoverished artists a chance to shine with their intelligent creative endeavours.

Sh!t, I've NaMoWriMo'd stuff heaps better than this! And have ideas for movies that leave this for dust!","1"
"ssvikas","Totally confused plot that leaves you yawning!","13 June 2012","In theory, 'Prometheus' should have been an engaging sci-fi film. It had none less than Ridley Scott, the creator of the original 1979 'Alien' and it sought to find answers to intriguing questions about humanity's origins and had talented actors like Michael Fassbender and Charlize Theron. But alas, the result is totally unimpressive.

The film opens with a sequence where a proto-humanoid alien drinks a mysterious potion and disintegrates into a waterfall just as a spacecraft hovers away. Cut to late 21st century, archaeologists discover a cave painting of a star map. Cut to two years hence, we are aboard a spaceship named 'Prometheus' in search of a superior race on a mysterious planet as they believe that these aliens 'engineered' humans.

Funded by a rich old man Peter Wayland (Guy Pearce) and under the watchful eye of Meredith Vickers (Charlize Theron) the chief crew members are archaeologist and lead character Elizabeth Shaw (Noomi Rapace), Pilot Captain Janek (Idris Elba) and a curious android David (Michael Fassbender). What happens to the crew when they land on a mysterious satellite to a planet forms the plot of the film.

While the thought of traveling through space is an exciting proposition in itself, the crew members of ""Prometheus"" seem so disinterested. They wear an expression as if they were woken up from a night long bus journey from Mumbai to Hyderabad. What's worse is that nobody remembers a thing about why they are on that trip till the briefing!

And who are these crew members? They are a motley bunch of 17 so called specialists who aren't introduced to one another despite being on an expensive inter-galactic project. Were they recruited in 'stasis' mode? And there's a guy who snaps back when a crew member says a customary 'Hello'. Would someone really behave so badly when they are a small isolated team light years away from earth?

Logically, any expedition is bound to follow certain protocols and chain of command. But here, we have people who behave like school kids on a picnic and a couple of them want to walk back to the ship! If they are so disinterested, why did they sign up in the first place? We're talking about a geologist who is not bothered about alien rocks and a biologist who wants to pet an alien snake-like thing and gets killed doing so!

The mother of all goofs is when Shaw undergoes abdominal surgery in an automated machine. One moment, she is writhing in pain having her wounds stapled like paper and within no time is up and running all over the place! How can that be even remotely possible? Even when she shows up with blood all over, the remaining crew members are not surprised at all and are not even bothered to ask what happened.

The only saving grace is some good acting by Fassbender. The scene where the sentient robot passes time reading dreams of those in stasis, learning languages, playing solo games, etc., is simply fascinating. While it portrays loneliness in space, it effectively introduces the spaceship to the audience. It is the film's best scene. But the promising start withers away when the crew wakes up from stasis.

One may argue that movies are all about entertainment and one must leave their brains back home in a freezer. Such assumptions hold true for bollywood's assembly line comedies. But, logical inconsistencies are unpardonable when the creator of 'Alien' series is the one wielding the megaphone. Just what were you thinking Ridley Scott? C'mon, stereoscopic 3D cannot make up for a poor script. It's a let down.","2"
"Misss25","I sort of enjoyed it","9 February 2022","The movie tells upon a story about a group of curious people who wanted to know their origin or can say what created them. They collected all the signs which showed them a way to follow and to find out. As they planned, they reached their desired destination. They found a breathable environment and source of life too .But everything doesn't go according to their plan. The more deep they are exploring the planet, the more they are getting killed. Something is killing them. David which is a robot design to go along with the mission found something in the cave and surprisingly it was turned out to be an alien which was alive but was in pod and David tried to communicate with it.

Were they able to communicate with the alien?

What was killing them?

Who left signals for them?

Were they able to complete the mission?

At last, it will keep you wondering and you can not but watching the 2nd part of this movie.

I love alien movies that why I choose to watch it. And it comes out to be thrilling for me. The visuals are awesome, though the alien looked bit creepy :3 I have to watch the 2nd part now ''Alien: covenant'' to understand the entire story.","7"
"cablooie","poor alien concepts, silly script for a special effect-dense movie","25 September 2012","Sometimes I am dumbfounded by how poor the concept behind such a rich production effort can be.

Is it possible that all the great Ridley Scott himself could come up with to portrait brand new alien species was an anaemic bodybuilder (The Thing From Another World, 1951), a few small inchworms, a grey rubber hosepipe and a giant octopus?

The highlight of the movie was Noomi Rapace giving birth to a squid shaped pokemon.

I honestly felt sorry for her, she really poured 200% of her extraordinary talent in this CGI action-packed movie. She forcedly ended up being the spine of a weak story. I only recall Elizabeth's name, the others are gone forever (I doubt I'll give this film another go) and yet I still remember Ripley, Jones the cat, Bishop, Vasquez, Hudson, Apone, Frost, even Newt etc...Everybody else could get mauled anytime, I couldn't care less.

The quality of special effects is technically indisputable, the movie is visually beautiful, but all the rest is dreadful.

Drab characters, silly behaviour, scientific inconsistence everywhere. Storyline is stolen from old low budget movies from the 60's. I will post the whole script.

PROMETHEUS

Elisabeth: Let's go to a distant planet and see if we can find aliens.

(The crew flies to the distant planet, then start introducing themselves to one another. They ignore why they left earth. A sociopath refuses to shake hands)

Elisabeth: There is only 1 alien and heck does he punch, let's get the hell outta here.

Alien Bodybuilder: AARRGGHH!! RAAAAWWWRRRGHH!! (translation: no, I will punch you, because your clothes look funny and I resent that.)

(A squid-shaped pokemon makes out with the bodybuilder who gives birth to Pinocchio)

END

The android (safe the very first effectively sinister minutes) looks and acts like a random lunatic without a sensible motivation, Charlize Theron is absolutely pointless, the rest of the crew is barely present apart from getting lost in a straight tunnel despite hi tech 3d mapping devices and a certain common habit of sticking their fingers in every goo they see.

Prometheus even manages to be boring at times, and that's inexcusable on a stellar budget movie. All I saw was the promise of a sequel in which one day we might see something actually new, like an interesting alien creature or a decent storyline.

Ridley, next time either you hire a decent concept designer and source a good script or stay home watching TV and eating your Doritos, at least you don't waste our spare time with poorly put together junk.

Poor Carlo Rambaldi, he really had gone in the right direction with his first Alien creation. He passed away a few days after Prometheus' premiere, I can see an omen in that. Good job he had no chance to see and comment on the grey rubber hosepipe snake with grey bow tie to match, the squid shaped pokemon and the pale punching bodybuilder replacing his cool alien concept. God rest him in peace, he must have laughed his head off, up there.","1"
"Mitiori","I Want My Money Back. I Want Those 2+ Hours Back, Too","25 June 2012","This movie brings to mind the South Park episode, ""The Passion of the Jew"" where the kids go to Hollywood to demand their money back from a deranged (portentously) Mel Gibson. This is what I want to do to Ridley Scott.

Even more than demanding my money back, I want to smack him. Then send him to go live with George Lucas who did the same damage to his Star Wars legacy with substandard prequels.

The first two Aliens movies were great. Scary. Fun.

I wouldn't be surprised to find out that he entered a bunch of information into a writing software program that generated this horrible script.

All of the characters were one-dimensional, except for the robot. ALL of the characters did not act consistently from scene-to-scene. None of them acted like the professions they were supposed to me.

For example, in 1 scene we discover that the punk white trash dude is a geologist, yet he and biologist have no interest in exploring the alien planet, the rock structure, and the alien corpses. Instead of being interested in what they traveled 2+ years to find, they walk away scared of the dead alien. Then, the geologist who is in charge of mapping gets them lost and for some reason they never contacted anyone to tell them and get help - until it was too late. Then, they find an unidentified substance where there was none previously and decide to touch it and find a LIVING alien snake to be ""beautiful."" Seriously.

Then the Christian(?) archaeologist is suddenly a genetic scientist who can identify foreign matter on the alien corpse head on sight. And her archaeologist partner and boyfriend is getting drunk for no reason. Meanwhile, she and the other woman, presumably a scientist but it was never explained, is really bad at her job, too, and do inexplicably dangerous and stupid things with their retrieved alien head.

Who the aliens were, what the biological weapon was, why their ship didn't take off, why the other aliens were killed but the biological substance's effect was dormant for thousands of years, why the alien at the beginning willingly drank the biological substance, what the biological substance was, why the substance was created, why they didn't kill the humans on Earth in the first place or give them technology, what the cave paintings really meant, and any other substantive question you can think of with respect to this mythology is never answered.

Neither is it answered why and how they convinced this fake elderly benefactor that he could be saved by going to this planet. Nor is it answered what the deal is with his daughter and why she bothered to come if she wanted to take over the company - with him traveling to another planet and on the verge of death seems like a good time for her to stay home and control the company. And why he lied about being dead and ""snuck"" on board is never explained.

Nor is it explained why the robot fed the boyfriend the alien substance. Nor is it explained how the woman who apparently could not get pregnant ends up pregnant from the alien infect sperm her boyfriend now apparently carries.

That's just a taste of the stupidity that runs rampant in this movie.

On top of that, there are interesting relationship tidbits and character background hinted at, but never explored. Nothing of any substance is developed in this movie - not space travel, not the mythology, not the characters, not the plot.

The dialogue is almost without exception annoying and pointless. Which sums up this movie. Annoying and pointless. I want my money back.","1"
"rparham","Prometheus a solid, if not great, film","10 June 2012","Over the last year or so, fandom has been awash in hope and desire that Prometheus, the new film from Ridley Scott, and his return, if perhaps somewhat peripherally, to the Alien franchise he began in 1979 would be a welcome return to form for that series after a spiraling set of latter sequels and the infantile spinoffs in the form of the odious Alien vs. Predator films. Well fans, rejoice to some extent: Prometheus is certainly a fair sight better than the above mentioned films. It, however, will leave those who are expecting both a horror film and a very Alien-centric picture disappointed to a large extent, as Prometheus uses only the framework of the Alien universe to tell a wholly new tale, one that is more interested in asking questions than in giving you shocks.

Opening in 2089 on Earth in Scotland, archeologists Elizabeth Shaw (Noomi Rapace) and Charlie Holloway (Logan Marshall-Green) have discovered a similar pictorial representation of a star system at multiple scientific digs. Using this information, they have convinced aging wealthy industrialist Peter Weyland (Guy Pearce) to fund an expedition to the star system depicted in the images in the hopes of making contact with what Shaw and Holloway refer to as the ""Engineers"", aliens they think may have helped engineer the beginnings of life on Earth. Once they arrive on the planet, the team discovers large structures that contain various chambers and artifacts, mostly small canisters, as well as one decapitated alien body. In the course of engaging in their research and exploration, they find themselves hampered at times by the limitations placed on them by their corporate boss, Vickers (Charlize Theron), and are also helped by android David (Michael Fassbender). But, as things unfold, the motivations of some of the crew begin to come into question, and the things they discover on the planet make them begin to wonder if it was a trip that was wrong to make.

Prometheus is very interested in tackling some ""big"" issues: the origin of mankind, the mix of faith and science and the search for immortality. Unlike many other modern science-fiction films, it isn't all slam-bang, hyper edited action. In fact, much of Prometheus is comprised of scenes of dialogue and moments of characters pondering what they have discovered. Science fiction movies with a degree of wonder and introspection are a rare creature these days, so the fact that Prometheus seems genuinely interested in exploring some of these themes is impressive in and of itself.

Prometheus doesn't completely skimp on the scare quotient. While I would hardly describe it as a full on horror film, Prometheus has more than its share of jumps, tension and squirms, albeit these moments are often secondary to other elements in the film, but they deliver when necessary. Prometheus definitely benefits from impressive visual design and cinematography from Arthur Max and Darius Wolski, respectively. It also does an exceptional job of revisiting the designs of H.R. Giger that were originally crafted for Alien. While there isn't much new design material here from Giger, seeing his ideas on screen again reminds you of what a unique and interesting designer he truly is.

Where Prometheus falls down, largely, is in the character department. Almost none of the main characters are really developed or given more than a cursory amount of personality. They are not neglected completely, but the audience doesn't really connect with them. Most of the development is given to Shaw and her search for answers about man's creation, but almost all the rest are provided with enough dialogue to serve the plot, and not a lot else. One of the most interesting characters in the film is actually the android David, who vacillates between being a helpful assistant to some of the humans to also having ulterior motives that may or may not be in the best interest of the crew. Fassbender does an exceptional job of making David have the outer appearance of warmth and congeniality, while hiding a cold, calculating core beneath the surface. David is a fascinating at times, and proves one of the more memorable elements in the film.

For those who are looking for Prometheus to give them some Alien action, they will have to make do with the suggestion of the film setting up some of the material of the first entry in that franchise. Prometheus does borrow some of the feel of the first Alien at times, especially in some middle scenes involving secondary crew members whose curiosity gets the best of them, but this film is not really an Alien movie, but a prequel in the truest sense of the word: it sets the table, but leaves before the meal is served.

Prometheus is a good, if unspectacular, science fiction film from director Scott that wants to play in the field of ideas and not just the space fantasy that many other films seem to be only interested in doing. While the lack of depth to the characters can at times keep the viewer at arm's length, in terms of look and feel, Prometheus delivers the goods. May Ridley Scott not wait another 30 years to re-enter the science fiction realm.","7"
"lale-ba","''There's nothing out there. We were so wrong!''","23 June 2012","These two sentences maybe best describe the feeling you get when you leave the cinema after watching one of two of the year's most anticipated flicks - ''The Prometheus'' (other being the ''The dark knight rises''). Sir Ridley Scott returns to the crime scene, 33 years after he helped redefine SF-horror. Task is difficult, but full of opportunities: give the background and scientific explanation to the ''Alien'' classic, while simultaneously starting a brand new franchise in deep space using unlimited budget, computer technology, solid young actors. In the script, a brand new world, two spaceships, new alien monsters, silicate storm, Engineers, their domes, etc. This was the task. What did we get? First of all, ''Prometheus'' is one straight, flat line, with a spectator forced to run through series of short events, without having the time to think, relate or comprehend any of them. Characters are shallow, artificial and without any development. Teron and Pearce are completely redundant, as is the most of the sidekicks. Scenario is really, really unconvincing, even for a SF standards. Plot, if there was any, completely collapses after the med-pod scene, turning into a simple trash movie. Visual effects, production, 3D, camera, editing, music bring nothing new and revolutionary, due to short cuts of holograms, scenery and spaceships. Parallels to Alien are so frequent, that they become tragicomic, with an ending insulting to all the fans of the Giger's xenomorphs. There is a clear lead-in to the sequels, and the very thought of that is disturbing. This was one of THE most expected movies of my life and surely, the biggest disappointment. To give you the short version, Ridley filmed 100 times better movie on the very similar subject 33 years ago, with tight budget and no computers. ''Prometheus'' will surely end up on the graveyard of aborted SF/horror sequels and prequels, alongside with ''Matrix 2/3'', ''Transformers 2/3'', ''Predators''...","1"
"WasiReviews","Thought Experiment","12 August 2020","This movie really takes an aim at a lot of deep things like our fascination with God, creation, human nature and religion.

When the creatures emerge and the plot thickens the movie intensifies and becomes awesome. With a crew that for the first time in a long time aren't dumb, this is most certainly the best Alien movie since Aliens.

"IonicBreezeMachine","Promises of a greatness that were never delivered in the serviceable final product","9 June 2022","Archeologists and lovers Elizabeth Shaw (Noomi Rapace) and Charlie Holloway (Logan Marshall-Green) have discovered several pictographic records from across the Earth's civilizations dating back 35,000 years detailing worship by ancient peoples of giant humanoid beings with shared star maps. Peter Weyland (Guy Pearce) the late billionaire founder and CEO of Weyland Corp. Finances an expedition on board the ship Prometheus to LV-223 detailed in the ancient star maps under the direction of Meredith Vickers (Charlize Theron), Synthetic humanoid David (Michael Fassbender), and a team of scientists to locate the ancient alien species known as ""The Engineers"". Upon arrival, the crew find remnants of the Engineers which may prove to be more dangerous than any of them imagined.

Prometheus' origins date back almost 10 years prior to its final release where James Cameron and Ridley Scott had jointly pitched a fifth Alien movie following Sigourney Weaver's hesitance to return as Ripley that would serve as a prequel to the series and examine the origins of the spaceship and the ""space jockey"" that had long captured the fandom. These plans were put on hold when Fox decided to prioritize the crossover Alien vs. Predator which both Cameron and Scott aw as undermining the validity of the series putting the proposed prequel on a shelf. Following the negative reception of Aliens vs. Predator: Requiem, Fox began salvage attempts for each franchise with Robert Rodriguez making the film Predators and Scott given development resources for the Alien prequel. There was a conscious effort on Scott's part to make the film its own story relatively independent of Alien with more focus paid to building the mythology around the Space Jockey rather than the Xenomorphs themselves. The film was undoubtedly one of the most anticipated films of the 2012 Summer movie season with the direction by Scott and a promised R-Rating seeing as a welcome return to form for both the Alien series as well as a welcome return by Scott to the Sci-fi genre after not having directed such a film since Blade Runner in 1982. While the movie received solid enough reviews upon release, a good number of critics had expressed disappointment with the handling of certain elements of the material with the screenplay by Jon Spaihts and Damon Lindelof garnering a lot of criticism for its feeling of raising more questions than answers. When I first saw Prometheus 10 years ago I think I tried to tell myself that I liked it because there are moments of wonder and majesty in the film that are sights to behold, but I also felt this feeling of ""something wasn't quite right"" that's only gotten more pronounced with time.

To start on a positive note, Prometheus starts out of the gate feeling like a true epic. From Marc Streitenfeld's sweeping score to Dariusz Wolski's awe inspiring cinematography Prometheus is a film whose sheer enormity in both scale and tone leaves the viewer with a strong sense of grandiosity that serves to make them feel dwarfed by comparison. The movie also features a fantastic performance by Michael Fassbender as David the synthetic humanoid and the opening stretch where he goes around the Prometheus by himself tending to all the ship's functions while keeping himself occupied is one of the best character moments in the film and he becomes something of a core to this movie that holds it together even during its weaker moments.

Unfortunately the movie makes a number of missteps in other areas, particularly in its characterizations and story beats. The movie features way too many characters for the kind of movie it is with 17 crewmembers in total on board the Prometheus and many of them just being glorified ""red shirts"" to pad out the body count. What characterization we are given isn't particularly compelling with Sean Harris and Rafe Spall playing a geologist and biologist who not only carry an out of place pessimism that feels ill fitting for this story, but end up doing some really boneheaded decisions that don't make sense in context of what the movie presents us. There's a large number of moments in this film where characters make terrible decisions that don't make sense from trying to pet clearly dangerous wildlife, getting obvious infections and then telling no one about it, or justifying decisions with tired adages like ""because it's what I choose to believe"" that parts of the movie veer off into unintentional comedy with how nonsensical characters act. We also have Guy Pearce in some really unconvincing ""old man"" make-up as Peter Weyland that was apparently only done because the script called for scenes in the past with Weyland as a young man, but those scenes were dropped during re-writes so we're just supposed to accept this on face value. The movie tries to build its own mythology with the Engineers from the space jockey established in the first Alien film and given Scott's professed distain for the AVP series it's rather ironic that he went with the ""ancient astronauts visiting Earth"" stuff that was featured prominently in those films as a backbone for Prometheus (not a spoiler by the way, all this is seen in the first 3 minutes).

If you're a fan of Alien then you'll probably find a lot of value in Prometheus with its production design, grand scope, and performance by Michael Fassbender solid points to appreciate, but the dangling plot threads begging for sequels, characters lacking in brain cells, and some really stupid justifications for faith that feel like flowery nonsense. I know this movie has an audience that likes it, but I unfortunately can't count myself among that audience despite my best attempts.","6"

1) So these Engineers came to earth, hundreds of millions of years ago, and somehow seeded life. Okay fine. So how would ancient humans know about them, and why would they know their language and why did they leave? 2) Were are the female Engineers, or are there only muscular male Engineers? 3) Why did they try to destroy humans? Why would they need biological weapons to destroy primitive humans, when it would be easy to destroy them without powerful weapons? 4) Why would they leave humans a map to a planet where they create their weapons of mass destruction? 5)If the aliens have another home-world and aren't extinct, why would they not check on their important military base were they create weapons? 6) For what reason was the alien at the end in a hurry to destroy the earth after hibernating for 35000 years? 7) There are a million other why's.

8) Why would a rich man spend 1 trillion to get eternal life, when he could simply spend much less on a stasis chamber and sleep for a few centuries until humans could stop the aging process, why take a long shot on a dangerous journey half-way across the universe to talk to unknown aliens?","1"
"KineticSeoul","Seems more like a sequel to ""Mission to Mars""","29 June 2012","This movie just seemed more like a hands on approach to ""Mission to Mars"" than a prequel to ""Alien"". In fact it has almost nothing to do with the Alien movies. It wasn't a boring movie but for all the hype it got, it's sort of disappointing. This movie just lacked the tension and intensity that I was expecting. It just wasn't horrifying or anything like that, despite some of the mystery surrounding the planet the characters are in. This movie is more about the ultimate question when it comes to mankind and their conviction than anything else. But has more of the sci-fi elements thrown in. The CGI and everything from the surrounding looks realistic and cool to look at. Even the technology doesn't seem far-fetched at all and very believable, despite one technology that allows you to view other people's dreams. This movie keeps going with the build up without much payoff at the end. Some of the characters in this movie has conviction and wants answers and most audiences as well. Even if it is make belief by the makers of this movie it would be more satisfying to know what the makers of this movie's vision is. Maybe they just didn't have one or saving it for the sequel if there is one, but it was still disappointing. Also these character are probably suppose to be very intelligent people, since trillions of dollars went into the mission they are on. But they make the most stupid mistakes that even average people know better not to do. The casts for this movie is right on target and fit their roles really well. Michael Fassbender and Charlize Theron comes to mind but it feels like there could have been more done with those characters. Guy Pearce is alright despite him being in this movie for just a short while and him being almost unrecognizable. Anyways it's worth a watch to see the realistic looking world that Ridley Scott has created but almost everything else seemed a bit weak. Even when planning for a sequel a good ending is when the audience is left satisfied and yet wanting more. That just isn't the case for this and it gives the audience almost nothing. Also the plot holes for this movie is just way too obvious and really stands out.

Laughing.","28 September 2012","'Had heard so many bad things about this one but when I got the chance to watch it last night, I didn't look away. After all, at the very least it has Noomi Rapace and Charlize Theron. Anyway, five minutes after the opening sequence I decided that it was going to be a comedy, you know, the so-bad-it's-good type. After that about the first 40 minutes were so dull that I found myself dozing off at times. The 'comedy' takes over after that as the film leaps from one cliché to another, one idiotic situation to another until the very end. The caricatures, I mean 'characters' are mind-numbingly stupid. While their actions already support that, even the dialogues are incredibly dreadful (but they do provide some good much-needed comic relief, unintentionally of course). I doubt the actors can be blamed at all especially when they're given such horrendous material to work with. 'Prometheus' has no depth at all and that would have been okay if it was trying to be a cheesy sci-fi horror but that isn't the case here. The score is abysmal and creates an atmosphere of melodrama as if dictating how the viewer should feel. The special effects are okay. I wouldn't say Ridley Scott is among the best directors but in my humble opinion, this is amongst his worst. On the positive side, it's visually detailed and looks 'realistic'.",NA
"PlugInYourBrain","Dumb and Dumber go to Space","6 July 2012","CONTAINS MAJOR SPOILERS

When I saw the production poster for 'Prometheus' I was filled with awe, but I was ultimately disappointed by a weak story and a weaker script. Decent CGI and decent performances by some of the actors help, but not enough to save the movie from being an incredible disappointment.

The movie suffers from many plot holes which could have been easily filled. These have been well-documented by other reviewers, so I'll only add one one that no one else has raised: Supposedly the 'space engineer' at the beginning sacrificed his body to give DNA to start life on the planet. But look at the vegetation that surrounds him: That has the same DNA with the same building blocks. His 'sacrafice' is redundant. I know it's a movie and not a science lesson, but a science adviser could have easily corrected those sort of gaffes (for example, by suggesting they not show plants).

'Prometheus' promised answers but didn't deliver. Director Ridley Scott has in fact revealed in interviews the background story. Here it is and I warn you that it contains MAJOR SPOILERS: The space engineers seed planets with DNA to bring them to life. When we humans got too warlike they sent 'Space Jesus' to Earth to calm them down. Of course we killed him (sorry!), and for that reason the space engineers decided to wipe us out.

Scott said he didn't state this explicitly in the movie because it was over the top. But having left it out he didn't provide an alternative, making the motives of the space engineers incoherent.

Evidently the audience was supposed to guess this from the movie. To be fair the 'we did something wrong 2,000 years ago' was a pretty big clue and he left a lot of religious symbology in there (washing feet, crucifixion). But Scott's Space Jesus doesn't make sense either: The space engineers are a pretty violent bunch, as are the exterminator aliens they bred for the job. Even if they want to 'reset' life on the planet as the Android suggests, how are they going to clear out their exterminator aliens once they've done their job? Scott really should have made sure the story made sense before he started filming.

The story has enough problems, but the screenplay is worse. It is inconstant. It doesn't make sense. It lacks suspense. We don't care about the characters, because they are uniformly stupid and repeatedly ask for death by doing dumb, dumb things. How did these people get chosen for a deep-space exploration team? Compare that to the characters in the original 'Alien' and 'Aliens' who never put a foot wrong: Those that are reckless (Ash, Burke) have sound albeit immoral reasons. Now contrast this to the scene in 'Prometheus' when the idiot scientist removes his helmet with a big stupid smile. He's allowed back onto the ship without any sort of quarantine. Not only that his girlfriend brings a big, dead head which they inspect without so much as a face-mask. Compare that to the original 'Alien' where Ripley wouldn't let the infected landing party back onto the ship due to quarantine.

There was a lot of mystery to the original 'Alien'. I got glimpses of the answers behind these when I bought the original 'Alien' preproduction art book back in 1980. That mythology was far superior to what we see in 'Prometheus'. That the Space Jockey has now become a guy in a spacesuit is a real let down. Likewise the organic-look of the Derelict spaceship is now nothing more than postmodern Art Deco styling.

I do give Scott credit for not bringing back the original Xenomorph. It's literally been done to death.

I don't get Ridley Scott. He makes some great movies, but he also makes some very bad ones. His weakness is (as was the case with 'Robin Hood') is that even if the story isn't ready he starts filming anyway. Maybe he figures they can make it up as they go or fix it in editing. But as we've seen in his other failures, it doesn't always work. A stitch in time saves nine, Mr. Scott.

Being a member of the Alien franchise 'Prometheus' will make no doubt make a fortune anyway. I just hope in the obvious sequel Scott is shamed into cleaning up his act (and getting better writers!) If you're a fan of the Aliens franchise, by all means see 'Prometheus'. While disappointing, it is still watchable and the performances by Fassbender and Rapace are good. With your expectations turned to zero you may actually enjoy it. It's better than 'AVP: Requieum', but worse than 'Aliens 3' and 'Aliens vs Predator'.","5"
"LeonLouisRicci","Sophomoric Science and Frivolous Fiction","20 June 2012","Confusing at times and visually vibrant, this Alien tie-in is not going to satisfy the most serious fans of the series and will without doubt not inspire any new ones.

Relying largely on CGI cinematography and contemporary razzle dazzle while sacrificing story and character development is unfortunately a modern trend that seems to be overwhelming the focus on any sort of intellectual intercourse. There are few really sharp minds on board and the crew is made up of the now clichéd motley mess where the most interesting personality is the robot.

Taken at face value and avoiding any analysis of the should have been interesting story of ancient artifacts and human origins, one could possibly enjoy this as visually slightly interesting but sophomoric science-fiction. However, everything is shades of gray and one might ask, whatever happened to Technicolor?

There is some gruesome horror, and it all looks truly futuristic and believable, but again, it seems shallow and without a soulful purpose except ""choosing to believe"". It fails to deliver a script that is the minimum of mature material and sophisticated science.

Rather disjointed and unsatisfying, it is a letdown, to say the least, to the anticipation of a long awaited follow-up to two of the most popular and entertaining entries in the sci-fi/horror genre. There are few surprises, and fails the Darwinian mantra of evolutionary excellence.","5"
"majd_selbi","Watchout for the director's cut","9 June 2012","Prometheus has several on its side and several against it, but above all, Prometheus suffers from the ridiculously high-set expectations, being a film that was perceived as both (the long awaited prequel/spin off to ""Alien"") and (the long awaited return to Sci/Fi of Ridley Scott), add to that the breath-taking trailers, footage and viral videos, and there is no way anyone could walk out of that theater pleased.

Prometheus puts you on the edge of your seat from its first scene, where we see a humanoid looking alien creature disintegrating into nature of planet earth, and thereby its DNA starts off the chain-reactions that inevitably lead up with the creation of the man kind. And then it swiftly jumps into the future to introduce our characters and keeps building on that mystery in a perfectly paced manner, and there is so much mystery in the air that you feel it in your stomach. Add to that the overwhelming art design, scenery and VFX of the film, and the straight to the bone performances by our the cast, and especially, Michael Fassbender as ""David"", which is by far the most established and interesting character and the most outstanding performance in the film.

That being said, Prometheus is far from being perfect, as it was after all, a movie designed (and edited) more as a ""summer block buster"" than than a movie to tangle with your intellect. Just as soon as our team reaches their destination planet to uncover the truth about our creators, you start feeling the film maker loosing his grip over the film to the studio execs, the film starts jumping off from one story element to the other with no warning, paying little-to-no attention to details to the point that you cannot not notice it anymore, and the pace starts picking up so quickly that it leads to a no-more than a standard Hollywood ending :(

The film tone changes noticeably right about the third act, from the focused, mysterious character-driven plot, to something that is random, broad and grand in scale and does not give enough attention to its character's stories, most events start serving as plot devices (with more gaps between them than solid grounds) to an ending that looks to be decided by the studio board. Oh and I almost forgot, throwing in 3-D into that blend and in a movie that has a rather-dark color pallet just to sell tickets with a higher price was, as always, more annoying than anything else.

There definitely will be a director's cut release that will give us a more settled version and give the franchise fans much more of what they deserve, but this is a review of the theatrical release, and I have to say, in the end, as good as it is, was rather disappointing.","7"
"tan1415","Most disappointing movie 2012","1 July 2012","How can this movie receive such a high rating? This movie should be a sort of prequel to the whole aliens saga. Giving us extra insight to the alien universe. Instead its become the worse prequel since Star Wars 1. Matter of fact ... compared to Prometheus SW1 is a masterpiece.

The role of the heroine is a bit like a reboot of Ripley...down to how she looks, acts and what she wears. I mean couldn't Ridley Scott try to be a little more original here? Even the Plot seems eerily similar with the android with its own agenda. this plot has been used time and time again.

Anyway when the movie ended I had more questions...not because its story and plot was so great and interesting. But everything is just simply full of holes that the whole movie seems like a HUGE waste of money.

Awful movie...no logic involved in the story, plot or scenario. Serious lack of originality.

Conclusion...wait for the second movie....on Bluray, than you can watch both movies. If there is no sequel...just ignore it and you can thank me that i have saved you hours of your life that could be used for something better...like watching Star wars episode 1...using slow motion when Jar jar binks comes up.","1"
"CinemaClown","I Was Wrong... It Was So Wrong...","15 June 2012","I was wrong... It was so wrong... to think that Prometheus might be a hidden gem that will reveal more of its treasure on repeated viewings. Because watching it again only refreshed my memory of what disappointed me two years back. Is it really a prequel to Alien or is it a standalone feature that shares only strands of DNA with that horror masterpiece? As it turns out, there is still no definite answer to this question.

Set in the late 21st century & taking place in the same universe as other films of Alien franchise, Prometheus concerns a team of explorers who discover a clue to the origins of mankind on Earth in the form of a star map & embark on a journey to meet their makers. But what they actually end up discovering is a threat that could lead to the annihilation of entire human race on planet Earth.

The movie opens with some breathtaking shots of landscapes that you generally expect in a Terrence Malick film & from then on it's a journey downwards as it neither scares nor thrills. Directed by Ridley Scott, it's heartbreaking to find him ruining the very universe which guaranteed him a spot in film history and although he plays with many themes in the story, not one of them is executed properly.

The screenplay is an utter nonsense as the plot is full of loopholes and even though it raises some pretty good questions through its thematic elements, it never answers any of it & provides an excuse of an unnecessary sequel as a cover up for its lazy script. Cinematography is absolutely gorgeous, Editing could've chopped so much here, music hardly contributed anything. but Visual effects is pretty impressive & wonderfully detailed.

Coming to the acting department, the entire cast of Prometheus delivers a forgettable performance with only Fassbender & Rapace managing to impress in bits n pieces. Other than a handful of characters who didn't do much anyway, the rest are present as death fodders only & there isn't one moment that made me care about any of these dull people's lives. Even the creatures aren't scary or intriguing by any means, damn it.

On an overall scale, Prometheus isn't just a disappointing feature but is badly filmed too as almost nothing works in its favour & this wasn't expected from the director who defined this very genre with his 1979 masterpiece. The only consolation comes from its visuals but that's also useless when you don't have an engaging story to back it up. Ridley Scott's movies either work big or fail big. And Prometheus, unfortunately, belongs to the latter.",NA
"r96sk","Looks good, but feels a bit hollow to me","24 February 2022","Looks good, but feels a bit hollow to me.

'Prometheus' - which serves as a (loose) prequel to 'Alien' - didn't excite me and I didn't feel like I got anything from it. It's still a good film and it is a pleasant looking one at that, with neat special effects et al. I also like the casting for this 2012 release.

Noomi Rapace is probably the film's standout, though Michael Fassbender, Guy Pearce, Charlize Theron and Idris Elba are also involved - the latter two feel a bit underused, we get a fair bit of them both but still I wanted to watch them more - especially Theron, who feels a bit tacked on.","7"
"maddog-50","Nothing.makes.any.sense.at.all","10 June 2012","Some company finances a trillion $ mission to solve an ancient miracle, given to us by our prehistoric forefathers. The only evidence or motivation for this epic mission: In several cave paintings, a big guy is pointing to a group of stars. Some ""scientists"" then figured out ""somehow"" that there is a planet out there on which mankind will find ""answers"". This actually is the most profound ""science"" you will experience in the whole f* movie. The super-spaceship Prometheus has the super advanced technical feature of artificial gravity on board. Even in the pilot's glass cabin, there is an earth like gravity field. Q: Why a glass cabin for a 2.5 year interplanetary space flight?? A: Because at the arrival some idiots can ""see"" the target planet and than point to a landing zone which has some interesting ""lines"". The whole set design looks like a mixture of Space 1999 and 2001. There are red blinking alarm bars and pleather pads everywhere, oh and HAL, of course. Inside the ship are huge spaces just for the purpose to talk to the crew sitting on camp-chairs. Everyone of the crew would easily fit into a Goonies scheme, mostly mentally unstable and infantile. (like J.J.Abrams would mimic Spielberg). The equipment of the crew doesn't use any gravity tools at all, except some flying scanner ""balls"". Maybe they should have put some gravity generators in vehicles too, instead of driving them without any exploration or consistence test through an totally unknown rough terrain no men has been before??

The whole trillion $ mission crew all together couldn't even win a pre-nursery school science contest. After they did some very very stupid things obviously with the purpose to screw the mission so badly

so that you could tell an idiotic story about it - they are chased by some p*-off angry aliens.


One of it, a squid or so, was ""born"" by one crew member! Yeah, That's what you would expect in an ""Alien"" movie, right? So, born as a little squid, this thing crows within hours into something 500 kg menacing big by eating ... what? Furniture?? Sucking at a socket, gaining mass by e = mc² or something??? All you can tell, it hadn't any crew member for lunch, so far!

This alone is so epic moronic, that only ONE person in Hollywood could write such BS: Yes, you name it: Damon Laurence Lindelof! Ruining Star Trek is probably not enough for this hack.

Then you shouldn't scratch your head any further, when you see two of the Goonie-scientists running away from a donut-shaped space ship falling down on them and guess what, yes, they're both (!) getting hit by it. Ohh, i should mention that the alien space ship got hit by the Prometheus before, which accelerated with it's ion-rocket engine.

Yeeees, folks that's Lindelof science again. In the year 2092, we have gravity generators and ion-engines with gigantic propulsive forces. Maybe it's that technical advance that people got stupid as batsh*t meanwhile. You could continue with those Lost-like cliffhanger idiocy for every single minute in the movie or just stop it here an say: This crap doesn't deserve the big screen or any audience at all.

Seems like Scott dropped the ball completely.","1"
"mondolnz","Is CGI THE everything for these days??","6 June 2012","There is no doubt that movie is visually stunning. But then again, this has become a norm for this days for the CGI to be as good as this.

According to the movie, we genetically descend from an angry 8ft strain of a blue man group member who wants to wipe us out for no discernible reason. Depending on how you interpret the opening sequence it's possible that a rogue jockey created us by sacrificing himself to do so but you never really get to the the bottom of that.

Once the other character came out of hyper sleep the movie steadily went down hill. The dialog between the actors mostly seemed unrealistic and forced with most of the characters being a complete waste of casting as they were irrelevant throughout the movie and had zero depth.

What really made me wince were the strange decision some of them made and the movies lack of explanation as to why they did the things they did. An example of this was when Milburn and Fifield get lost in the alien temple after becoming scared when seeing a decapitated Space Jockey and decide to go back to the ship. There is no explanation as to why they become lost and a complete lack of interest from the rest of the crew as to we're they are and their safety. Despite Captain Janek stating to them via radio that Alien life has been detected, he just tells them to go to sleep, very odd!

Android David finds a vase of goo in the pyramid/mountain place. He touches it to his finger. He deliberately puts his finger into Holloway's champagne, infecting him as he ingests. Holloway gets sick. Before the symptoms become obvious he mates with his infertile lover Elizabeth. She becomes pregnant and quickly goes into labor. But she performs an abortion with the ship's robotic surgeon of some kind. And the operation performed on her body involves slicing directly through the skin and muscle-tissue of her Abdomen. After the procedure, she's simply ""stitched together"" by metal clips in like 3 seconds - and with a bit of anesthetic, she continues to move and jump about with some moaning. Ehm, this was ridiculous to show that anyone could do any kind of normal movement with their muscle tissue completely severed - and there was absolutely no healing involved. And not to mention this things that comes out of her belly she just leaves it there in the operation room. Some time later the angry Creator is attacked by the full grown hell baby and is consumed by it, to a degree, for unknown reasons. That dead Creator then births a primitive Xenomorph

Among these people with zero personality - we have some willing to gleefully commit suicide by ramming an alien ship, because they like their captain, and they're required to do so because he ""can't fly worth a damn"" - despite him being the primary pilot hired by a billionaire to do nothing but fly the ship.

Then we have a religious scientist who concludes that she's found our creators, based on: ""It's what I choose to believe"". Then we have the very same religious scientist look at an alien ""head"" they brought back - and she notices some ""strange growth"" on said head. She then spends 2 seconds thinking and concludes that this is obviously some kind of ""foreign cell stuff"" (impressive deduction, I must say) - and she decides (for kicks) to stimulate the cells with some kind of energy - just to see what happens. No research - no caution - no nothing.

I am a religious person myself but religious references were so unnecessary that it was so laughable when every time they showed that cross-shaped necklace.

Then we have the boyfriend of said religious scientist who decides that the air in a completely alien environment is breathable because his device tells him it is - and he immediately removes his helmet. A classic Hollywood scientist moment.

This movie is FULL of this kind of utterly implausible behavior and random decisions.

The convoluted nature of the evolution processes and the ridiculous speed at which that all happens. From worm to white cobra- hugger in no time at all, not to mention the rapid growth of the squiddy giant face hugger which did it without any intake of food. Everything grew fast to suit the rushed nature of the film

We have an android, well-acted by Fassbender, who seems to be completely random in his decisions and motivations. I simply didn't get what he was about or why he did what he did. It made no sense in any context - not to me anyway.

The music was overwrought and didn't fit with the mood of the film, and it seemed like one theme being repeated endlessly. A surprise, given Scott's usual flair for good music.

There was no explanation as to the motives of the Space Jockey race and their reasons to wanting to destroy Earth leaving the movie open to a sequel.

Pardon me, but that is a load of garbage. I honestly cannot believe something that ludicrous made its way into, what is essentially, an Alien movie. I keep wondering that did Ridley Scott not even watch his own movie for pointers?

I have no idea how some people here reviewing this are even suggesting to get the Oscars out. I bet these are the same people who rated the Transformers 2 & 3 highly and all they care about is CGI but nothing to do with Plot or Character Development. Speaking of character development, I actually wanted Shaw to die in the end since I couldn't care less about her!! And she is supposedly the lead character.

"Parks","Makes AVP Requiem Look Good","6 June 2012","It's not just the anticipation that explains my disappointment in this film. It's the contempt the film-makers have shown their audience in presenting this half-baked, pseudo-philosophical nonsense to the public that makes me angry.

The plot - such as it is - is stolen mainly from an X-Files long-running story-arc, shoehorned together with a bit of Van Daniken stuff from AVP, plus some gore/squish scenes to remind us that this is supposed to be a ""horror"" film. But remember how tense and mysterious the original ""Alien"" movie was? In which we couldn't be sure how the alien would behave because - well - it was an alien? Here, the potential mystery that could have been exploited is gone. We get tentacles, we get goop - lots of it - and we get lots of unconnected, pointless scenes of nastiness that contain no tension, no sense of claustrophobia, no horror. It's a ""so what"" of a horror movie.

Screenwriter David Lindeloff tries to fill the void by reminding us this is a ""deep"" film. It's about the search for god, don't you know. But as Lindeloff demonstrated in ""Lost"" he's better at promising to deliver than actually delivering. We get some trite rubbish explaining that god isn't necessarily who we want him to be. Whoop.

Then there are the characters. Cardboard cut-outs compared to the rounded characters created by Dan O'Bannon. Charlize is given nothing to do except be ""icy"" for no good reason. But undoubtedly the worst is David the android (no spoiler). He compares poorly to Ash and Bishop from the previous movies. Those androids were cool, logical and unemotional (as you'd expect). Here, for some reason, David seems to have been programmed as ""snippy and supercilious"" - prone to making sly digs at his human colleagues. He seems to resent the emotions which he is not supposed to have (other than ""resentment"" apparently). They even trot out that old android cliché, the ""Pinocchio"" reference. It's painful.

On the plus side, a lot of Prometheus is quite pretty. But it just demonstrates that Ridley Scott's movies can only ever be as good as the screenplays that inspire them. The ""Alien"" franchise needs to stop here.","1"
"Jules45","It Should Have Been A Masterpiece","3 June 2012","Where to start? It doesn't take an Alien fan, or even a film fan to know Prometheus is a big event. It's every bit as visually stunning as the trailer suggested, Fassbender is as every bit effortless as everyone has mentioned, but every problem that it suffers circulates back to its script.

The writer, Damon Lindelof, doesn't shake his typical Lost quandary of asking twice as many questions, to half as many answers meaning it is simply a starting point to a franchise. Example (spoiler-free), a 'twist' occurs towards the start of the third act involving two major characters that adds absolutely no narrative significance. It's as if Lindelof decided interjecting something, even as tenuous as this, was better than having nothing at all.

Alien seems an appropriate parallel but Alien is entirely different. Claustrophobic, tense, characters who we cared about, feared for, who spoke wonderful dialogue (my personal favourite, Ash calling the xenomorph ""Kane's son"" – simple, brilliant). None of this is in Prometheus, even the main characters are largely underdeveloped. It's a series of issues that don't evolve – Shaw's Christianity completely unchallenged, David's allegiance never really brought into light (less enigmatic, more irritating) it sets up great ideas, but ones that never formulate beyond the 'Why?' stage.

And scares? All would agree Alien maintained an unwavering level of fear by revealing so little. Prometheus has it on full display, leaving nothing to the imagination. CG may be an innovation, but is sure as hell overkilled what would have been more effective through minimalism. It's interesting that the most horrifying scene involved no extra-terrestrial life, just a person against another person.

This rant would make it seem like Prometheus is a bad film. This is not the case. But there is so much wrong with it, so much that makes six months hype evaporate within two mere hours, it's a film that should have been a reward after enduring the latter two entries of the Alien franchise. But it's muddled, often silly, and generally an upsetting experience.","4"
"badajoz-1","Glossy rerun of original that is very poor","29 June 2012","If you want exploding chests, alien pen**** penetrating human mouths, and various other third rate horror trash tricks, then this is the movie for you. A very very tired rerun of the original 'Alien' without half the spark or creepiness. In fact, the only note of tension in the whole film is whether Guy Pierce's character is going to regenerate or not, and the best moment is when Man comes face to face with his Creator (Engineer). Otherwise it is a simple story of a space exploration team coming out of hibernation to explore the potential source of the Gods who made us - cue a direct pinch from 'Stargate' with the usual idealists, pragmatists, and grasping capitalists mixed up on board. We all know horror awaits and it is delivered rather half heartedly and mostly contradictorily and in unexplained fashion - cue you get terribly bored as the film dives ever downwards in its second half. Plot holes - like why is there one of the engineers still alive? - abound, flight crews turn into planet-saving heroes, the heroine opens up her stomach in full frontal etc and we get the dreaded promise of a sequel. Sorry Ridley, I know Hartlepool can be a gray place to grow up in, but it does not excuse this poorly scripted, poorly characterised mish mash of a fifth rate horror film. And, as for the so-called big questions being asked, forget it, this is the wrong movie to try and so lazily done it insults the intelligence. Some good CGI just gets it a 2!","2"

At some point, you should do something because otherwise, we would need another Hollywood soon. Special effects is not enough, really not enough and this movie doesn't have in my opinion good special effects, and when it has plenty, the impact on the viewer is low because of the bad acting and script.

"Meckjompa","In space no one can.....make a script?","25 September 2012","First off. The 1 star i gave it is for the visuals alone(which are great), the rest of the movie doesn't deserve any stars.

I was reluctant to even see this movie, because of all the bashing it had received and because i'm a huge fan of Alien and Aliens. I was correct, i shouldn't even have watched it.

The first scene just kinda sets the tone: Let's bash 3 billion years worth of evolution and make a dissolved space jockey our ancestor. Am i supposed to believe that the Space Jockeys Engineered all life on earth? Incl. dinos that lived for 150 million years plus, then to be wiped out by a asteroid so mammals and apes can take over the planet? Man that's a bold plan.... Or did they just engineer us? At what point? Was Neanderthals part of the plan? Chimps? Gorillas?

Enter The religious Scientist...""It's what i choose to believe"". Seriously? In the 22nd century(almost)?! So much for the Scientific method i guess...

And then the crew of the ship, Oh....My....God. 1 trillion (round number that ey) dollars worth of scientists?! I guess inflation must have gone bananas because that crew isn't worth more then a fart in space. They are just stupid stupid stupid in everything they do.

Is a man created by man still a creature of God or is it a monster? Do we have the right to create meta-human life? What if we are the children of unknown fathers? For answers please consult Frankenstein. For self-important, barely comprehensible drivel please consult Prometheus.

Great direction can save poor scripts. A director seduced by CGI shooting an incredibly weak screenplay by an overrated pair of writers will not. How on Earth Lindelof and Spaihts got the gig is beyond me. There are strong writers in Hollywood and others trying to get a break that could have done a better job, a MUCH better job.

Ridley Scott, like Spielberg, has forgotten what making a raw, honest movie is like and is far too distracted with how excessive CGI can make it look pretty. Alien was a dark, cold, spartan film set in a bleak, merciless universe. The budget and effects limitations at the time meant that Scott had to use his imagination to create dread. Here he has all the money and effects he can ask for and the resulting film is the polar opposite. Less is more. A filmmaker like Scott should know that. All 4 Alien movies were filmed on a soundstage (save for one 'beach' shot in Alien 3). They were confined and claustrophobic. Prometheus is set in massive, wide-open spaces, which I assume is supposed to make us feel desolate and isolated. But when it cuts back and forth between interior and exterior so much the opposites negate each other, meaning we feel neither confined nor abandoned.

The story is set a number of years before Alien in which a bunch of expendable characters (including a lot of nobodies) travel to a distant planet (a 4-year round trip) to find the beings that created life on Earth. When they get there they discover...a load of confusing, muddled nonsense that is far from frightening and is only just barely above mildly interesting.

Alien was populated with 7 single or double-syllabled characters that felt real and authentic thanks to their quiet interactions and dialogue. We learned their names and positions quickly. Prometheus has more characters than I can count (some appear out of nowhere and quickly disappear as fast) with some of them not even being coherently named. Not that coherence is this film's strong point.

Noomi Rapace is cute as Elizabeth Shaw, the lead scientist who believes in 'The Creators' (the Space Jockey creatures), but she's very miscast. Michael Fassbender as android David is the only other character who gets a notable amount of screen time. You'll care about none of them.

Scott once said that the film wasn't a prequel to Alien (after originally announcing that it was) then changed his mind a short while later. If this was supposed to keep us intrigued it didn't work. If anything it only got the confusion going before anyone even saw the movie.

It has some lofty ambitions, and succeeds at neither of them. The opening scene of a Creator sacrificing himself at an indefinite point in history to create mankind by putting his DNA into our water is nonsense. Was disintegrating himself the only way of doing this? Could he not have just bled into the primordial soup? Did he create the dinosaurs too? Was it a scene set just after the last ice age? Did they accidentally create primates in the process? Why did they create us in the first place? How did the early civilizations learn of the Creators? Did they visit? Why did they have a star map that led to a planet that was just a testing field?

The creation of the famous Xenomorph Alien is so convoluted and preposterous. Let's see if you can follow this:

Android David finds a vase of goo in the pyramid/mountain place. He touches it to his finger. He deliberately puts his finger into Holloway's champagne, infecting him as he ingests. Holloway gets sick. Before the symptoms become obvious he mates with his infertile lover Elizabeth. She becomes pregnant and quickly goes into labor. She aborts her 'hell baby' by caesarian section but just leaves it there in the operation room. Some time later the angry Creator is attacked by the full grown hell baby and is consumed by it, to a degree, for unknown reasons. That dead Creator then births a primitive Xenomorph.

Pardon me, but that is a load of garbage. I honestly cannot believe something that ludicrous made its way into, what is essentially, an Alien movie. The original had so much purity and mythos. Did Ridley Scott not even watch his own movie for pointers? Lindelof and Spaihts have really painted themselves into a corner with that dumb ending too. When Shaw gets to the real Creator planet she will be the only human being in the film, if that is the way the speculative sequel will go.

The mystery of the Space Jockey has been completely ruined. It could have been so much better. But Scott needs to be brought back down to Earth (pun intended) and he should have chosen his writing team more wisely. Still, it was nice to hear Jerry Goldsmith's Alien theme, albeit briefly.","4"
"Hanover","Hope they had insurance...","9 June 2012","Most of the bad reviews on here pretty much sum up my feelings...especially where the leaps of logic are concerned.

I will sum up how bad this film is with one scene.

Years ago, I saw a comedy sketch where someone was about to be run over by a steam roller that was six feet away and traveling about 5mph. Instead of getting out of the way, this person just stands there screaming for the entire duration the steamroller slowly approaches and rolls over them.

There is a scene in this movie exactly like that. Yet, instead of a steamroller, its a space ship that crashes into the earth and then slowly rolls over someone as it topples over. Yes, a person gets run over by a spaceship in Prometheus. Not killed by an Alien or from exposure on an alien planet...literally squashed by a space ship.

"paul-heys-im","Time for Ridley to hang up the camera","7 June 2012","So, I finally saw Prometheus last night, and finally decided to register on IMDb to show my disgust at such an insult to the Alien franchise.

What have I got to say that hasn't already been covered? Well, they stole characters and crappy dialogue from AVP for a start. The script was poor and I couldn't keep my attention at the so called climax. It showed nothing of the origins of Alien, and they made the space jockey(something I always assumed was beyond human comprehension from the darkest, most disturbed part of the universe) into a limp copy of the tall blue guys from Avatar, albeit after a heavy dose of chemotherapy, and without the blue colouring. Michael Fassbender's performance as the android is toted as Oscar winning good, but I would rate it at just above average at best. None of the characters had any motives for what they did. The whole thing made no sense. It was that poor I don't even consider it canon to the Alien films at all. The cgi, what there was of it, was OK. But I don't know where they spent a hundred and fifty million quid! It certainly wasn't on the two low budget sets. And where was the huge black head from the posters and the trailers?

The continuity and story was slapdash at best. No consistency at all. And the plot holes were really as bad as I read. There was no gore, and not one moment of tension or horror. Even when Shaw, lead role, was having her guts opened up to give birth to a giant squid! Wtf? I had low expectations of this film but even they were not met. They stole scenes from all the other Alien movies. Yet Ridley said he discounted alien 3 and 4. So why the f*** would he use scenes from them.

The whole thing was a very poor cliché of Alien. And I mean poor. Oh, the giant squid faced hugged a jockey, and the jockey birthed an Alien. Almost exactly the same as the Alien we have seen in all the other films. So basically, it was two hours of pap, that lead up to a xeno birth.

The best I can describe this film has is a quasi parallel semi prequel.

It really is that bad. It killed any ferocity and malice the Alien creatures had. So if this is Ridleys official word on where the xeno came from, they came from humans! Wtf?

This is how bad it was. There were 17 crew member's. It showed the deaths of a few, but the rest of them just vanished, lol. Seriously. No account was given to what happened to them. One scene they were there, the next they had vanished?...

The only good thing I can say about it is that the acting was OK. Though in some scenes, it was so cheesy I felt like I was watching critters 4 or something, lol.

So, in closing, if you are a fan of the Alien movies, and don't want your precious memories of it sullied, please avoid this film like the plague, It adds nothing to the mythos, and is poorly executed. It is obvious, from the news today that it did well at the box office here, so expect countless sequels which will finish off the Alien franchise for sure.

"gigan-92","""If you go down there, you're going to die.""","25 July 2012","We've long awaited this day after Cameron's ""Aliens"" back in '86. I never really cared for ""Alien 3"", and Resurrection is one I rather enjoyed despite its flaws. Once the AVP films came around the sh*t really hit the fan. Many, including myself, thought the series was dead and buried. However, Ridley Scott himself decided to revisit the series and not only take it back to its roots but in a sense go even further.

Allow me to start with the cast; all very well chosen and great characters. Guy Pearce is pretty awesome, Idris Elba is damn good and Charlize Theron is as I expected fantastic. Noomi Rapace is excellent in her role, giving off a Ripley-style aura without going to much into it. She's still very much her own character, symbolized by her faith and ties to religion. There's some sensuality but its never overplayed and never feels out of place. Michael Fassbender is just amazing. I don't fear spoiling he's an android because it's damn obvious not but a few minutes after meeting him. He infuses a lot into his character, a mix of Rachel from Ridley Scott's ""Blade Runner"" and HAL from ""2001: A Space Odyssey"". His performance simply fascinates, and I leave it at that.

After the over-laden crapfest of directors like Paul W.S. Anderson and the Strauss Brothers brought to the series, the effects team brings dignity and dare I say class back to the gore. The creature designs are just stunning and quite sickening. They'll amaze as much as they make your skin crawl. And this movie WILL make your skin crawl. Production value in addition reminds you of the original 1979 ""Alien"" with great spaceship sets as well as eerie planet environments.

Best part of this movie is how the story is told. Some of it you'll recognize as trademarks of the sci-fi/horror genre, other aspects are things fanboys like myself have been dreaming about for decades but there's also quite a bit of philosophy and ideology weaved into it all. The origin of man, possible existence of a deity, our purpose in the universe, all are toyed around with in this film. Brilliant move it is, the movie will ask more questions than it answers, not only about the saga but about our race itself. I urge all to see ""Prometheus"".","6"
"SirBreeze","Bought the hype, got a huge disappointment","16 June 2012","This movie raises many philosophical issues: faith, humanity and its quest for understanding the origins, the reasons why, etc. It fully addresses none of those, leaves them hanging and ends up as a two-hour trailer for its sequel. And the trailers for this movie were mind-blowing, really worked up the hype and got me excited, but turned out to be the best parts of it, without any scenes being in it (especially the Weyland keynote). It's a crying shame, a tragedy, what this movie turned out to be.

I'm writing this fresh from the cinema and just can't wrap my head around the disappointment. Visually, the movie is striking and beautiful. The acting, the script, the plot holes – everything else sucks on so many levels.

To those reviewers who say the movie made them think, I say the movie does poor justice to the elemental questions of the human condition that it seems to be so eager to raise from the start. The ending leaves a bitter taste and makes you feel like the only reason this movie was made is to kick start a franchise that was over after Cameron's film.

I didn't mean to give this bottom rating, only to commend the visual style of the movie, but I just can't. I feel so disappointed and robbed of my hard earned money, and no, I won't go to see the inevitable sequel. Words fail me to express my disgust and sadness of what became of a sci-fi legend, both the movie and the director.","1"
"Sandy-99","Exactly the same as 'the original'","7 June 2012","During the mid and late 1970s, cinema took a giant leap forward in its capacity to deliver blockbusters for teenagers (or the teenager in spirit). Doubtless those raised on the cinema of earlier generations might wish to make a similar claim for the sweeping epics that drew in the crowds in the 50s and 60s, but when I went to see Star Wars, Close Encounters and Alien in consecutive years, I was sure that Hollywood could not previously have made audiences so entranced and convinced by the sci-fi experiences now being created.

Watching Alien in 1979 was, as one critic wrote at the time, a visceral experience: ghastly, scary, bloody, shocking and wholly believable. A full Odeon, Leicester Square was entranced as one.

So I suppose it was inevitable that watching Prometheus was never going to be the same kind of experience for me: cinema just hasn't made that much progress since, partly because what CGI can now give us is the extraordinary made ordinary. Doubtless there are still some teenagers who will be coming to Prometheus fairly fresh and ready to be as gripped as I was by Alien, but raised on computer games and DVDs, such a number must be very small. They won't be disappointed by the movie's visuals: much time and effort was spent on creating a new hyper-real landscape, and there are still one or two moments of grisly horror (though none that genuinely surprise or shock).

If only some time had been spent testing out the script's premise that a specially commissioned crew of experts in their fields would run around an alien landscape with no regard for their own or anyone else's personal safety, or for the success of their mission. Alien's miners could be forgiven for not knowing what they were getting into: these scientists have no excuse, yet Scott evidently decided that if he was to recreate the formula of the original, any such considerations would need to be set aside. They touch everything and seem afraid of nothing. Critics have described it as 'muddled', yet I would argue its worst crime was to attempt to revisit the same territory with an unconvincing script in the first place. The movie is, in basic structure and in a number of scenes, exactly the same as the original. (Perhaps it's me that's different.) Of the cast, only Theron, Rapace and Fassbender intrigue at all, and none matches up to the heroism of Ripley. Rapace fails to generate very much sympathy, despite her predicament - only Idris Elba offers much humanity or heroism, but he remains resolutely 2D.

Perhaps that's the point. In presenting us with a collection of distinctly unlovable and more or less disposable characters, Scott underlines the revelation about the Engineers, their purpose and their secret, and mankind's insignificant and unsavoury role in Creation. To say more would be to give away the only thought worth pondering in a movie burdened with an expectation that, for this viewer, was unfulfilled.","7"
"mecheart","Dan O'Bannon we miss you ...","20 September 2013","** I saw 'Prometheus' first June 2012 at a local 'Frank Theaters'. This review is based off my second viewing - of the Blue Ray release.

Ridley Scott's long anticipated return to the ""Alien"" universe, created by legendary (and then some) screenwriter Dan O'Bannon, is likely the most disjointed, illogical and poorly executed science fiction film ever created; it's a sloppy mess of dead-end plots and absurdly written characters sewn into a backdrop of unrivaled visual epiphany and flawlessly rendered spaceships.

Moments after act one begins on the heels of a visually immersive, intriguing prologue, the nonsensical slag that is all that will follow, hits pavement giddy feet running. Our heroes - scientists investigating a 35,000 year old cave painting of a distant star cluster - mention something about traveling ""There, to find out."" When the next scene fades in we're (sans explanation) aboard a spaceship watching an android, a higher functioning predecessor model of Ian Holm's 'Ash (from 'Alien'), fight the tedium of deep space solitude by learning dead languages, playing basketball while riding a bicycle and trimming his hair to resemble Peter O'Toole in 'Lawrence of Arabia'.

We learn android 'David' can read the dreams of crew members in hyper-sleep and experience human emotions. While I enjoyed the Asimovian flavor of David's introductory scenes, their illustration of his physical, emotional and adaptive capabilities as clearly superior to the advanced 'Ash' and 'Bishop' models of films set in the future of the universe, made no sense.

Get used to it! (things that make no sense) David wakes up the crew - largely staffed by characters we never really meet or even get to count present - and literally minutes after they shake off the hyper sleep lag with green slime meals aboard a clean, brightly lit, prettily rendered spaceship right out of Star Trek TNG, attend a corny briefing initiated by Guy Pearce (the hologram) and then descend into their target planet's atmosphere and find the spooky alien temple on the first pass.

Unlike the thickly atmospheric introductions to the instantly deep and likable crew of the 'Nostromo' and their sudden twist of fate, 'Prometheus' lighting quick brushes over a few of the crew members of its titular named spaceship with no more than a minimal smear of characterization. Who are these noisy, one dimensional stick figures, and why should we care? Not a one of them is endeared to us in the least, and the film does not care that we need (to care) in order for the whole sexy mess to mean something.

Without analysis of any kind - of the planet's surface or atmosphere, beyond a few one-liners shouted out on the way down - the anxious scientist romantic duo charge out into the alien environment after ruthless, robotic, severe and Barbie doll like 'Meredith Weyland-Vickers' (Charlize Theron) squashes the hopes they've traveled light years to realize - with a comical verbal beat down that we were supposed to take seriously.

Captain Idris Elba parked the ship a mile from the ruin so our heroes must speed to its entrance in tracked vehicles and roll cage enclosed ATVs - and later outrun a super sand storm in another scene. Oh, the drama. Once inside, the dank, eerie alien temple is easily mapped by the team's grumpy geologist and everyone finally takes off the egg shaped spacesuit helmets the prop department built after shopping at Radio Shack because (drum roll) the air is breathable. No worries about xeno bacteria or viruses or whatever. They find some dead aliens (no, not xenomorphs) but the team biologist would rather head back to the ship because they freak him out (yes, you read that correctly).

Black Goo (yes, really) ends up for no apparent motivation in the bubbly of boy wonder scientist who then - via his contaminated semen - impregnates 'Elizabeth Shaw' (Noomi) with a dolphin-octopus fetus but only after she explodes an alien head with too much voltage and reveals she's sterile. She cuts it out in a surgical pod which staples up her gut (no one notices the scar) and minutes later, she's running around the set again.

One dimensional crew and expedition members taunt one another into sex with an accordion, fry one of our heroes with a chrome plated flame thrower, battle a zombie caveman thing, die before we meet them, fall prey to an albino snake thing, get sprayed by acid blood across the kisser, and with smiles and jokes, commit suicide at the end.

The visuals are mostly unmatched. The spaceship interiors ridiculous; the crews sleep in tubes, why give them neo art deco quarters decorated with strange personal effects? Charlize Theron plays the villain like a junkyard dog grinding its teeth and there is no depth. There is no continuity. The script abruptly severs one plot line, throws us another, cuts off that one and jumps its tracks to go somewhere else. We see an Alien (ala 'Alien') on the wall of the spooky temple, but no one ever tells us why it is there. Our heroine's aborted dolphin-octopus thing evolves into a two ton face hugger, but why? Our eight foot tall blue complexioned gods crush our bones on sight, why? David the android O'Toole poisons our hero. Again, why? Where Dan O'Bannon's 1979 screenplay 'Alien' immersed us in a suffocating claustrophobic environment populated by interesting, endearing and memorable characters and then blew our minds with mist shrouded eggs, face hugging arachnids, a chest bursting alien birth and a truly demonic new monster (with loving respect to H.R.Geiger), Prometheus does none of these things yet so poorly imitates all of them that its effort comes across as blatantly shameful and feels (to die-hard fans of O'Bannon's fictional universe), like a speeding bullet of heresy.","1"
"valadas","Technically very good but the rest...","19 June 2012","Why Ridley Scott didn't use his great talent to make just a sci-fi movie instead of complicating the plot by putting its characters on a search of the origins of mankind which is a goal that would demand a philosophic and metaphysical depth that goes far beyond the scope of this kind of movie? The result is that the movie story has some gaps and illogical unexplained features that diminish its impact and chooses a simple answer to a difficult question. Besides the usual implausible scenes that we always take for granted in a sci-fi movie because of its fanciful nature this movie exaggerates on that field with some incredible scenes like the one of the mechanical surgery for instance. However this movie is one of the best ever made in technical terms. The images, sceneries and landscapes are really overwhelming and appalling and the sound track is fabulous stressing the visual effects in a prodigious way with a music that enhances the general atmosphere of the movie in a remarkable way. And the action is also overpowering indeed. So if you privilege those visual features in this kind of movies this is a good film for you.","6"
"mnjarmour","Is this a resurrected script by Ed Wood?","24 June 2012","This is not so much a review as a means for me to entertain myself and thereby derive some enjoyment from having sat through this movie.

HI, I'm Elizabeth Shaw. Late in the movie I'll run around the spaceship in my underwear covered in blood with staples across my abdomen. This is a common occurrence in 2093 because nobody will think to ask ""Hey, what happened to you?""

I'm Meredith Vickers. I'm a narcissistic battle-axe who is only in it for me. Never mind that I could have stayed on earth and run my dad's company. Seems traveling with him to experience the same unknown and potentially lethal fate was the smarter option. Did I mention that I brought this amazing piece of surgical technology, apparently for my own benefit, but that doesn't work on women? Oopsie!

I'm David. I'm an android whose condescendingly polite tone serves no other purpose than to annoy the hell out of you throughout your journey (and the movie). Said journey will be mercifully short thanks to me. I take incredibly stupid and shortsighted risks for a seemingly intelligent artificial life-form. I poison one of the crew members that my creator spent a lot of money to send up here. No matter that the introduction of alien DNA into the ship could put everyone's life at risk including the frail old guy it is my mission to serve. I'll make it all right in the end.

Hello. My name is Millburn and I'm a biologist. In the future we've forgotten the lesson of The Crocodile Hunter and Sigfried and Roy: namely that wild animals are unpredictable and potentially lethal. When I come across an unknown life-form on an inhospitable planet, naturally I'm going to approach it like a puppy at a dog pound.

I'm Fifield, a geologist. Early in the movie I introduce myself as a one-dimensional malcontent with no concerns beyond money. My social skills are such that I have no compunction about saying as much and making enemies in the process. This is a very sensitive and perilous mission where individuals will be working in close confines with one another with no contact to the outside world. I know what you are thinking: when this crew was being assembled it's a good thing somebody thought to include the borderline sociopath. I'll die and you won't care.

Here is the escape ship. It is self-contained but attached to the mother ship so there is easy entrance and exit. When it comes time to deploy don't bother walking on board, though. Just follow it in your personal jettison pod and make your way over when you can. See ya later!

Safety protocols are unusual in 2093. In the original Alien if potentially infected crewmembers are outside the ship you lock them out. Seems that's not nearly as effective as opening the loading dock and chasing everyone with a flamethrower. Yes, a flamethrower. Guns are efficient but roasting people alive is so much more dramatic. In 2093 we don't care about the risks of having burning crew members running around our cargo bay.

Strangely, the world of 2093 is far more technologically advanced than the one in the original Alien which takes place even further in the future. I can only assume that the engineers of the far future suffered a similar fate as the biologists.

The only good line in the movie comes when Meredith Vickers says that her father spent $1 trillion dollars in financing the expedition. Golly, $1 trillion dollars? It is a figure so perfectly round in number and sufficiently inflated as to succinctly summarize the imagination involved in this script.

When this movie inevitably gets re-released 20 years from now it will only be fitting if it plays alongside Plan 9 From Outer Space.","1"
"jturnbull-398-395794","Pure manure (Poopmetheous)","1 August 2012","I had the unfortunate experience of seeing this film a second time last night because my daughter, home briefly, wanted to, so I took her along. I reviewed the movie a month or so ago and gave it a 4/10 rating mostly because it was good eye candy. But on second viewing I was so disgusted I have deleted my original posting because it was far to generous. This movie stinks.

I have degrees in molecular biology and physics, but do enjoy SCI/FI movies that are not particularly sound scientifically if the story is solid and entertaining e.g. Ironman. Initially I was prepared to overlook the scientific plot holes in Prometheus, and focused upon the absolutely stupid characters, poor acting, and rubbish script. But on second viewing, the scientific plot holes are indeed just to big to ignore.

I am not going to reiterate what many others have said, but taken overall, no amount of special effects can paper over the cracks in what is a piece of manure, and an insult to anyone with any decent education, let alone an appreciation of fine film making.

I am (was?) a big fan of Ridley Scott and rank Alien, Bladerunner and Gladiator amongst my most admired movies, so I am at a loss as to how this ridiculously pompous mess came to be made. Its only saving grace is that is marginally better than Avatar.

But nothing I can write matches the Downfall parody, Hitler Hates Prometheous on Youtube. If you are the only person on the planet who has not seen this take a look. His views on Twilight are even better.

I watched Chariots of Fire the other night (as part of the lead up to the Olympics) and see IMDb gives it a similar rating to this. When I see one of the great and most inspirational films of all time lumped in with this dross I do wonder about the future of western civilization.","1"
"martinrobertson300482","I don't get it","17 June 2012","""Prometheus"" is lucky I'm being so generous. The Film seems to have divided people into two groups. Those that thought it was brilliant. And those who thought it was awful. And sadly I find myself swinging more toward the later. Though I can appreciate it for what it really is.

I Was always wary off a flick which started out as a prequel, then changed its mind, and started to describe itself as something altogether ""new."" What's the point off connecting it with ""Alien"" if it's not about ""Alien"" then? Like, really? If its something new then saying its set before ""Alien"" is just a cheap marketing ploy. Too help get noticed what is an otherwise pretty standard science fiction movie.

Now I wasn't expecting another ""Alien"" movie like some were. As it was explained ages ago that it wasn't going to be one. But the way it keeps changing its mind about how it is even connected is just irritating. I Will admit too actually kind off enjoying it too a point. But when they manage to get the one part everyone wants too see wrong (The Ending that explains the connection) then the whole thing seems rather pointless.

I Will applaud the always great Michael Fassbender in this, admit too it having an altogether unique take on the ""chest burster"" scene, and admit too it overall killing boredom for a couple off hours. But it is no work off genius.

Just because its slow and mysterious, doesn't make it the next ""2001."" Sorry!","6"
"CherryBlossomBoy","""Recycling"" is the key word here...","12 June 2012","I'd really, really like to blame the screenwriters for this atrocity but there is no doubt all the responsibility lies with the director/producer that hired them.

One must remember that by now Ridley Scott is very, very old. As most old people he becomes increasingly obsessed with two things: preaching to younger generations and making some capital masterpiece to leave as a lasting testament. That's the only way I can explain why every new film of his is a whole level more ambitious than the last one. The next story in line I think is about Moses. Surprise. Everything else with Scott keeps getting better and better but the stories he puts on the screen keep getting more ludicrous and sermon-like.

And just what does an old master of commercials and spectacles have to say to his audience? Well, nothing really clever and profound, as it appears, and ""Prometheus"" is a testament to that. Conceived as a prequel to ""Alien"", this is an odd combination of ""2001: A Space Odyssey"", ""Avatar"" and, of course, ""Alien"" itself. There is a clear ambition to use it as a vehicle for a great philosophical debate about the origin and purpose of life (an apt agenda for an aging author) - but all seriousness is down the drain as soon as one awakes the evil ghost of Erich von Daniken and attempts to explain life on Earth as some sort of extraterrestrial intervention. Just as in ""2001"", the story is founded on misconceptions about evolution, but what makes it worse, the only character that supports Darwinism (and actual science) is portrayed as a moron. Deliberately? I'm afraid so.

On the other hand, Scott puts two religious ""scientists"" in the spotlight and uses them to ask and answer all the questions that concern Scott as an author. Unfortunately (or fortunately, as far as I'm concerned), both of the actors portraying them are pretty unsympathetic and uninteresting. Logan Marshall-Green has zero screen presence and Noomi Rapace is just a cute face that is, towards the end of the film, supposed to walk in Sigourney Weaver's shoes. To be honest, they didn't have a decent script to work with either. Their dialog was disjointed, emotionless and unconvincing, saturated with religious and pseudo-scientific garbage, all to satisfy Scott's penchant for popcorn philosophy. Even if they did have something to say - ""Alien"" franchise was never about philosophy: it was about suspense and action.

Of course, they had to squeeze some action between philosophical sessions. So it's there and it's spectacular and it's well filmed. But it's also often nonsensical, self-serving and drawn-out. So is the said dialog and so is the motivation of all the main characters. The last film I sat through that was as nonsensical as this was ""Avatar"".

They also had to utilize every single cliché in the Hollywood Book of Clichés: token black guy, love story, blonde villains, two buddies with a special rapport, anti-corporate sentiment, last second escapes and what not. And there are, of course, ties with the original ""Alien"", but they are so weak and thrown in just for a good measure, that it doesn't feel like ""Alien"" franchise at all. It's just a movie with a famous ""chest-burster"".

All in all, the film opens more questions than it answers. But not of a ""why are we here?"" and ""where do we go?"" kind. It rather keeps one wondering about numerous plot-holes and inconsistencies and stupid characters. And, of course, it left me wondering who is ""Prometheus"" referring to in the first place. I'm versed enough in ancient mythologies to realize what Scott tried to do here - recycle and combine basic motives of mythological stories into a grand tale of life and death and ethos of sacrifice. He came up with a crappy sermon-movie that would have otherwise, by it's technical merit, been terrific. That it failed so miserably, despite the luxurious package, speaks volumes of the ideas it tried to sell.","1"

I'll tell you why I'm being so harsh: first of all, this is a work a very good director. But however good the director might be, if there's no, and I mean almost literally no script to work with, the movie will inevitably be bad. And it is. Painfully bad. I show you, how someone can make a movie just like 'Prometheus'. You've got to have a talented and professional cast and crew, and lots and lots of money. Now, with the bases covered, you can have the crew create some sets that resemble earlier SF movies, and now you can yell ""ACTION!"". The actors may ask: ""What should I say, it only says ""blablablablabla"" in the script!?!"" You can reply: ""Nevermind, it's not important, just make up some science-fictiony bullsh!t. The movie's gonna be full of expensive CGI crap, so most of the audience won't even try to give a damn what it's about. Besides, it's gonna be in 3D so whatever you say, they won't even be able to follow, because they're gonna be so mesmerized by the looks of the whole thing."" The actors will ask: ""But if we just make some stupid lines up, where's the plot, where's the logic? What will the whole thing mean?"" And you can dismiss them with a self-absorbed smile: no one gives a sh!t, just do as I say. We're gonna make a ton of money with this, trust me."" There was a script, and a ""screenplay"" (thanks again, Damon Lindelof, if it was up to me, the only place you would be allowed to write would be a urine-covered wall of a truck-stop crapper) and this pile of garbage was not the work of a 5 year old kid (and not a very bright one, either) but that of highly paid ""professionals"".

"md-ulus","Story ideas picked out at random by monkey flinging poop at a wall","13 June 2012","Who wrote this movie, Damon Lindelof? You mean the guy who wrote Lost? I was never a fan of Lost, I thought it was one of those illogical shows filled with contrivances to trick those of average and lower intelligence into thinking something interesting was happening...

Which not surprisingly ends up being exactly what was going on in Prometheus. Boy oh boy did Damon Lindelof outdo himself this time, wow!!

I can't even list all the absurd plot devices that come out of nowhere and have no explanation. It would physically harm my brain to try and hold that collection of ideas in my mind long enough to make sense of just how much none of it makes any sense.

It's like being transported into the mind of a chimp in a science experiment being fed liquefied crack through an IV.

What's terrifying here is that someone apparently thought this movie made enough sense to spend many millions on it creating some of the best 3D effects I have ever seen. THAT is freaking scary.

On top of the absurd plot devices, things that would embarrass most comic book writers, the acting is largely atrocious. I don't know who the two bit, bit players they dug up for this movie are, but they were embarrassingly bad at times. Was it their fault, was it the script, was it the directing? I have no idea. The only bright spot is Michael Fassbender, who well and truly nails his role as the android. Fassbender and the effects are the only two saving graces, otherwise this movie would have been a total waste.

Also, that was Guy Pierce as the old man?? I loved Guy Pierce in Memento and I think he's someone who could have brought something more to this movie, but he has a meaningless role in heavy old man makeup.

This is one of those movies that just doesn't know what it wants to be, the writer doesn't have the ability to tell a story and get secondary meanings across, it's all ham handed and an insult to the intelligence of sci-fi fans everywhere. The cinematography, effects, sets were all pretty strong. But there were a few set pieces that looked like something out of an old Star Trek episode.

"mark-southwell-385-725850","Sigh","1 June 2012","Oh the hype. I cannot recall anticipating a movie so much. Matrix Reloaded may have come close, and the feeling of disappointment is all too familiar.

This is the first time I have been compelled to write a review on this site, mainly because most of my friends haven't seen it yet and I just have to vent my feelings somewhere. But before I begin that cathartic release let me say that this is no way a bad movie. I never once had the urge to walk out and I expect I will watch it again some months down the line. I don't feel the anger I experienced after Matrix 2 or Indy 4 but I certainly don't have the buzz of having just watched a truly great movie.

Lets start with the storyline. I think anyone going to watch this is fully aware by now that this is q prequel to Alien, and trust me, you'll have been slapped so hard in the face with this fact by the end of the film that your cheeks will be stinging. Time spent on plot background is over in a matter of seconds. If you've seen the trailers then you've pretty much seen the reason they're off to another planet. From there the storyline follows the usual tried and tested Alien(s) method, i.e. They find stuff, it ain't good and people start dying. What's wrong with that? You cry. Nothing is wrong with that but from then on in in you can't help yourself comparing it to the other two films. And that's where the wheels start falling off.

The first two Alien movies were filled with strong characters who acted and behaved as you felt they should when their friends and colleagues start dying around them. In Prometheus however they may well have all been androids as Rapace apart, they were all taking death and destruction remarkably in their stride. Even one of the best scenes in the whole movie (Rapace's DIY Cesarean) is just glossed over like it didn't happen when . She escapes quarantine, removes a baby squid from her stomach and then runs into the others covered in blood only to be mocked for lacking scientific fibre. Theron may just have well not been there for all she adds and will someone please tell me why they felt it necessary to employ Guy Pearce to play an old man? Here's an idea, just hire an old man to do it instead!

Even the characters taken as a whole are a rather strange bunch. In Alien they were a mining vessel (believable). In Aliens they took some hard asses because they were expecting trouble (believable). However on this occasion a billionaire thinks he'll take himself half way across the universe fully expecting to meet another civilisation who may or may not be hostile and who does he take with him? A couple of scientists, his daughter and a bunch of misfits. Oh but its OK, they have flamethrowers and a few pistols.

Moving on to the bad guys and here we have something which I thought was rather good, as an idea. The concept of humans having evolved from an alien race is a good one, and one of the more believable parts of the film. It was a good idea tackled well. Now if we'd just stayed with that idea and made a film about it I may have been a much happier man. However Scott had decided from the outset that this would be an alien prequel and we were subjected to this absurd notion that they were sinply created by a squid impregnating a super human. Bingo! Quite why this hadn't already happened on the planet before is a mystery, as is why the Alien's don't come out looking more human every time one pops out of our stomachs. And so to the final scene which I suspect Scott saw in a ream one night and built an entire film around it. I can only compare it to Darth Vader's unavailing in Star Wars 3. Laughable.

As a rule I don't like prequels and sequels. They all too often lead to feelings of anger and dismay. But I thought if anyone is going to do it right it would be Ridley Scott. Alien was his baby and there's no way he'd make a mess of it. Well now I feel its time for a public appeal. Will somebody please make a decent ORIGINAL sci-fi movie. PLEASE!","5"
"bad_badger","I'm sorry...what??","2 June 2012","I'd have loved this film when I was fifteen. I would have soaked it up unquestioningly and raved about the visuals and the space craft and the settings and the frights. Because when you're fifteen that's all that's really important.

Now that I'm old and crotchety, I look for a little bit more. Not an awful lot, it has to be said, but a little bit. And that little bit is a coherent plot. Sadly, Prometheus falls well short.

You can't fault the movie for sets and visual effects and score and sound - all of that is just as you'd expect for $200 million. There's nothing wrong with the acting either, although I imagine a lot of people would agree that Michael Fassbender's android David steals every scene he's in. Where this movie ultimately disintegrates is in the unravelling of the plot, quite literally in this case.

It just doesn't make any sense.

The principal narrative drive of the movie is various ancient human civilisations leaving engravings and cave paintings of the same constellation suggesting that our origins are extra-terrestrial. Humanity sends a ship out there to investigate. With me so far? This is plausible enough in the world of sci-fi, right up to the point where we find out that the location of these star-maps (presumably provided by the 'engineers' themselves, as referred to in the movie), is not their home planet or even a welcome sign but is in fact their equivalent of a weapons manufacturing plant that has been set up on a remote planet.

Eh? If you try hard enough, you could argue a case for this: perhaps the most obvious being that if our civilisation ever became advanced enough to follow the star-map and find this place, that we'd do ourselves in in the process. If that's the case, then WHY bother setting up our civilisation in the first place? We then find in the climactic third of the movie that these engineers were just about to set off in a ship BACK to earth to deliver lots of their nasty bio-goo to kill us all off or transform us into genetic weapons or whatever it does (again, left a bit nebulous in the movie), but their plan went pear-shaped and they never got off the ground.

Why they want to kill us now after taking all the time to seed the planet, no one seems to know. Am I missing something really obvious, here? There's lots of other strange things like the squid-creature that Rapace's character has removed from her womb and why a strange penguin-goblin thing is born from one of the engineers at the very end of the movie. If their genetic blue-print is almost identical to ours (again as suggested earlier in the movie), wouldn't a more typical Geiger alien be the product? Who knows...

Ultimately, a movie that looks and sounds great but just leaves the audience (or at least ME) very confused and ultimately wondering what just happened.","5"

Our specified idiots seem to represent devolved rather than evolved humans, as they now smoke in their space suits, bait clearly dangerous alien lifeforms, and hide symptoms of illness from their colleagues in this hostile, uncharted territory.

It is a shambles.

Only the opening scene with Michael Fassbender has any redeeming qualities - and looks like it will shape into a good movie in the 2001/Moon mold. But even this scene opens up major holes in the movie. Fassbender is watching (and quotes from) 'Lawrence of Arabia'. So movies exist in this world. Yet none of the other characters have scene ANY Hollywood thrillers, or read any novels or anything. They continue to fall in to the same traps as every other idiot in every crappy sci-fi film ever made.

Take helmet off? Check. Play God with a new species? Check. Open the ships doors despite not knowing who/what is trying to get in? Check The list of 'I can't believe they actually did that' moments is endless.

Some of the special effects are neat, and Fassbender is the one redeeming quality.

"rmax304823","Why Bother?","6 February 2014","This is a deep movie -- profoundly deep. Or so it seems to believe. Lots of references to Christianity, where did we come from, who created the creatures who created us? Actually, the answer is rather simple. It came from Ridley Scott, the director of ""ALien"", and the team of hard-charging MBAs that realized that ""Alien"" had made a lot of money and had lasted through an infinity of sequels. This is a kind of chimera -- a mixture of ""Alien"" and one of its own later sequels.

It's copied and recopied, a thing of shreds and patches. And -- now, this is very important -- it's more expensive and has more impressive visual effects, although they may or may not make sense. Egs., if there was a windstorm on the planet in ""Alien"", which was a nice original touch, there is a huge and dangerous sandstorm in ""Prometheus"" that could have been copied from Turner's ""Hannibal Crossing the Alps."" If something popped out of somebody's gut -- ditto. Even the musical score echoes Howard Hanson's Romantic Symphony, although it's just hinted at, not quoted outright. We get more of Chopin here, as if classical music can possibly add class to a commercial abomination like this.

It's the kind of movie that is so weighty and abstruse that a viewer might get more out of a second viewing of it, if only the first time through hadn't left such a strong feeling that once was enough.

The ending sets us up for a sequel. Don't miss it.","3"
"S_Craig_Zahler","decent sci-fi picture that turns into a below average horror movie and features lots of bad ""science""","13 June 2012","like sunshine, prometheus is a true sci-fi picture that turns into a below average horror movie. fassbender was really, really great, but the picture features many career-worst performances, such as the weakest work i've ever seen by theron and elba. this isn't a surprise, given the director--- harrison ford has never been worse than he was in blade runner.

i still don't understand what the opening scene meant--- why the thing altered it's dna and killed itself. or how exactly elba knew that it was a weapons depot. this seemed like a throw in to explain missing stuff to the audience.

additionally, the tie-in to the alien franchise is unneeded--- those are horror/action movies and have almost no science.

and the amount of dumb science was truly incredible.

1. ""hmm. we are in an alien environment. let's sends balls of brilliant red lightning ahead of us--- that couldn't ever be construed as hostile, could it?"" i bet ridley said, ""cause it looks cool."" 2. even more idiotic is the removal of helmets when the adjacent environment is toxic. they hit one air vent and they're all dead. 3. and then, after people are infected, they return...and remove their helmets again. yikes. scientists shouldn't be dumber that the dumbest person in the audience, but here they are. 4. and from what matter/energy source could the octo-alien increase its size by over 100 times in just a day? how did this 5 pound creature generate the body mass to become a thousand pound creature while stuck in a sterile lab? i bet ridley said, ""cause it looks cool."" 5. and more bad science is how a massively advanced ship would be destroyed by a lame human craft scuttling it. that ship would obviously have something to deal with matter in space that travels at far higher speeds than this slow human ship. 6. and even more bad science is the ergonomically awful ""future"" ship that requires the pilot to pick up a recorder and use two hands and a mouth to activate something and later move his hands across vast spaces to pilot the ship. this is like putting a turn signal in the back seat and the ignition on the hood.

overall, there were some striking images--- especially the resuscitated alien's head and the c-section sequence--- but it seems like prometheus was a three hour movie that the studio shortened by an hour to make more exciting, because lots of scenes were really rushed and none of the characters--- except fassbender's--- were at all developed.","6"
"Eumenides_0","Pretty visuals in search of a good story","19 June 2012","Prometheus managed to get me very excited: from the trailer I expected an intelligent, gripping, visually splendid science fiction movie like we haven't seen in a long, long time. Well, I got the pretty visuals, but Prometheus is a movie in search of sensible characters and an intelligent plot.

Two archeologists discover a star map on a cave painting and from such scarce evidence infer that Mankind was created by aliens, which they call the Engineers. They convince Weyland Corporation to finance a trillion-dollar expedition to the planet to search for alien life, filled with incompetent geologists and botanists who never heard of basic health procedures. At this point the movie basically becomes a remake of Alien - ships lands on alien planet, scientists find alien complex, strange things creep them out, people get infected with aliens, a double-crossing android (brilliantly played by Michael Fassbender, one of the movie's saving graces) manipulates the crew, people fight aliens, etc.

Most of what you see in this movie was already in Alien, all the way back in 1979, and the new ideas aren't particularly well developed. I'm sure an interesting movie about aliens creating mankind could be made, but Sir Ridley Scott and Damon Lindelof aren't up to the task. Most of the movie's problems come from the script: characters do bizarre, irrational things all the time - people with state of the art digital maps get lost in straight tunnels, scared scientists try to pet visibly hostile alien creatures; people with almost no information make incredible assumptions - Janek, the ship's commander, who never leaves the ship, out of the blue claims that the aliens were building biochemical weapons. There's an absurd twist halfway that introduces a new character in a very silly way. Alien, let's be clear, didn't have brilliant characters and the dialogue was so-so, but their personalities were well-defined and they were instantly compelling. Most of the characters here were loathsome and I was hoping they'd all die violently.

As a stand-alone movie Prometheus is a disgrace. But it's even worse what it does to Alien; basically it cheapens it by destroying the wonderful mysteries it kept for decades. I don't think the world ever needed to know who or what the Space Jockey was, we were all better off finding our own solutions in our imagination. But Scott must hate people using their imagination. He and Lindelof must also hate their because they came up with a dull explanation for him, not to mention he changed his bizarre look. The original Space Jockey was gigantic, this one is almost the same of a human. Although they're not the same character, since Prometheus takes place in another movie, I really want to see what explanantion - if any - they're going to find to there being two Space Jockeys of different sizes.

Besides Fassbender's excellent performance, this movie has excellent special effects, sound design and cinematography. The opening shots are beautiful and the visual inside the alien compound are very good, even if they're not up to H.R. Giger's.

I expected more, I was anxious to love this movie.","5"
"virindra","What was this really about?","3 June 2012","I guess I am going to be one of the less people who is not really content about this movie. Before I went to this movie, I heard it was a little about the Alien movies back in my younger years with the beautiful Sigourney Weaver, but then again it wasn't. So, I did not know what to expect.

When the movie started, I learned it was all about a group of people who went from earth to an alien planet to find out who could be the creator of mankind. They went to look for a possible God. That was a fine concept for me. After seeing a lot of things going on, like an octopus with four legs coming out of a woman's stomach, or this big guy killing everyone, I was asking myself what this movie really was about. If this movie wasn't about the prequel of the alien movies, what was it then about? It certainly wasn't about finding God or the beginning of mankind. I mean, at then end the search continues.

And there my biggest problem remains. They have seen this big guy. He wasn't kind or gentle. So why does this woman who gave birth to this quatropus want to search further? To meet more of these hostile creatures? This is the most unsatisfying movie I have seen in a while. A lot of money has been spend on making this movie. Cameron's Avatar and Christopher Nolan's movies are well made. Not because they only have a concept, but because they give the audience a whole package. Their movies have a beginning, a middle and an end. Prometheus has a beginning and a middle. Where the middle is, half away the movie, there is where it ends. It leaves you with the question where the movie begins with: who created mankind in the vision of Ridley Scott? Was it the big people who (I guess) created the aliens? But I think that was not relevant, because if it was, the movie did not stop half way the search.

And there is where the problem starts: If there would come a sequel to this movie, where would it go from here? Would the first alien movie be the sequel or the search for the creators of mankind? This movie did not get me warm to have this urge to see more of this expensive crap movie with a beginning and a middle. The only thing I liked about this movie is that Charlize Theron was driven over by a dough-nut shaped alien aircraft.","3"
"A_Different_Drummer","Apology more appropriate than a sequel","4 January 2014","Based on pedigree alone -- this is, after all, the Director of the original Alien and Blade Runner and Gladiator -- this is a movie you should be willing to sleep on the sidewalk for, just to get tickets. But looks can be deceiving. What you actually get with Prometheus is a deeply flawed and astonishingly imperfect film. Worse, if you did not know this was Scott's work, you would assume it was the effort of a newbie director, just out of boot camp, desperately trying to find a story to fill in the gaps between wonderful bits of cinematography. Critics, the brave ones not afraid of saying what they feel, have opined it is derivative of the first Alien. Under some circumstances that might be faint praise. Unfortunately. these are not those circumstances. If you ignore this warning and see it anyway, you will note that Prometheus, oddly, shares with The Avengers a passion -- nay, an obsession -- to bore you to death for entire the first hour. However, in the case of Avengers, the setup had a payoff, about 45 minutes of non-stop, head-spinning action. There is no payoff in Prometheus, although the pace does pick up a mite, and slithery things do dart hither and yon earnestly looking for bodies to infest. Naoomi Rapace, lately of the hit Euro trilogy ""THE GIRL WITH THE DRAGON TATTOO,"" gives a very compelling performance (for a newcomer to Hollywood) and (apologies for the gender reversal) pretty much sets the visual bar for the old saw about ""jogging home from your own vasectomy."" The movie ends so abruptly, with so many unresolved story threads, that an apology would be more appropriate than a sequel.","3"
"ben-1815","Oh dear Ridley what have you done","19 June 2012","As an avid Scifi fan I was really looking forward to this 'alien' prequel and perhaps therein lies the problem but this film is flawed on so many levels I do not know where to begin but I will begin with the biggest and most fatal flaw of the lot. I did not care! The characters are so under developed that not only didn't I care about any of them but didn't really understand why any would behave in the ways that they did. Fassbender was OK, Rapace wasn't bad given her command of the English language is less than perfect but all others were vacuous and frankly pointless. Theron suffers particularly for this poor lack of development and just comes across as wooden rather than cold which I suspect was the intention.

The second problem is plausibility. Now I know it's a scifi and you need to suspend disbelief but that should be limited to the premise. As it is we are asked to believe that these so called scientists, educated and measured people would disregard scientific methods and become mindless idiots, wandering off from groups (cliche) and prodding and poking things as soon as they see them. Collecting samples in what can only be described as a duffle bag is among the worst of these actions.

Finally and perhaps most disappointingly for Alien fans is where is the menace? Alien and some of the sequels succeeded because you were anxious almost all the way through the film. Here there was none, no egde of your seat moments, no heart stopping scenes, just a collection of uneven scenes hastily cobbled together to minimal effect.

It is beautifully shot hence why I've given it 4 stars but other than that very poor and for me the most underwhelming film I've seen in a long while!","4"
"robertllr","Too awful to rate","16 February 2013","There are not enough negative stars for me to adequately describe how bad this film is.

I'm sure it's no surprise by now to anyone that Prometheus is nothing more than a remake of Scott's own sci-fi/horror classic, Alien. Prometheus has the same line of action, the same characters, and the same design elements. It begins, after two limp prologues, the same way--with a ship in deep space--its crew in cryostat's; a human looking android with it's own agenda--dictated by a higher authority--who holds humans in contempt,; and a perky heroine increasingly on her own as the expendables drop off. The same design of the alien artifacts; the same girl stuck in a lifeboat with a parasitic alien. Scott even quotes his own images--like the android's severed head still talking, fluid dripping from its mouth. Yeah, Riddley, we get it. And ultimately, of course Scott ends the whole affair making it clear that the whole silly affair is not only a reprise of Alien, but its prequel.

Then there is all the malarkey. Prometheus has a standard sci-fi plot: life on earth was seeded by aliens, and an expedition goes back to find them. Indeed, the premise and the film's ending are lifted exactly from the 2000 film Mission to Mars. The science in Prometheus is dreadful--a hodge-podge of inconsistencies and non-sequiturs. For example, two expendables are attacked by the same alien parasite. One dies, the other is turned into a zombie. Why? And then David and Elizaeth also have different physiological reactions to being infected. And don't you just love the way the blasted ship falls back to the ground--so gently that the two women stranded there can stand and watch it, and then run away fro it. Hello, gravity accelerates falling bodies. Sheesh.

What is the first prelude supposed to suggest? And why would the engineers, choose as a way of wiping out humanity on earth, to export such vicious creatures, creatures they cannot control and that would, in effect would sterilize the whole planet, rendering it unfit for engineer habitation as well. Say what? Prometheus's end made me laugh out loud. Our heroin determines to track the engineers to their home-world and find out, ""Why create us and then decide to kill us?"" The android asks her why it matters. She replies that it matters to her because she's a human and not a robot. On the other hand, to the film's audience--comprising, we assume, humans and not robots-- it doesn't matter either.","1"
"davidcbabsthurgarland","The film I always wanted to see get made","13 December 2020","First and foremost, let's clear the air and put our expectations aside. This IS NOT a straight up ""Alien"" prequel! Yes it's directed by Ridley Scott and yes it's in the same universe..but it's not ""Alien Begins."" You won't get the details you might be hoping for with regard to the origins of Xenomorphs. You won't even get to see a Xenomorph (in the physical form we're all used to). This is, however, a wonderful new sci fi film that I think will garner more respect with time and multiple viewings. And for all you hardcore ""Alien"" fans out there.. you'll have to wait until the last ten minutes of the film to get your Xeno fix (and even then it's an atypical monster).

Having checked your expectations at the door, everyone should be able to appreciate this film for what it is. It's subject matter, i.e. the origins of life/creation/destruction, is something I personally have wanted to see on the big screen for some time now. And who better to helm such a mammoth task than Ridley Scott. He is, pound for pound, the best creator of worlds in Hollywood. He has a beautiful eye for detail and as a result, the aesthetics of this film are off the charts! It's gorgeous to look at. And this leads me into my criticism of several other reviews I've read; that this film is all special effects with no substance. Rubbish!! The special effects are used tastefully and sparingly, much the same way Christopher Nolan approaches his films. ""Prometheus"" uses epic set pieces to create it's world - and the cinematography is spectacular. It makes the landscape if Iceland, where it was shot, look other worldly - 'alien,' even (pun intended). The pacing of the film is solid, it never drags. The acting too is solid. However, I have one criticism of the overall character development in ""Prometheus."" Several characters aren't well fleshed out which leaves the audience feeling a little detached and 'so so' about the fate of the characters. Even when they're in peril I found myself..how to put this..I wasn't fully invested in their survival.

I think this film deserves far more respect than it gets. If you were to walk into a cinema completely unaware of who directs this... severed all ties to the ""Alien"" franchise...watched and enjoyed this film purely on its merits and treated it as an independent sci-fi film...you'll be rewarded.","8"
"johngraham1964","Oh dear....","14 October 2013","Alas..... A nice idea to 'prequel' Alien so that we know how the space ship ended up with the alien pilot in place, chest punctured etc (though he doesn't end up being punctured in the ship or in that chair..... odd....) Whole swathes of crew members given nothing to do or a button or two to push. Idiot crew members frightened of alien creatures who then go out and pet one of them. A total waste of the normally excellent Charlize Theron. And Guy Pearce in unrealistic 'old man' makeup? I read they originally wanted an older actor. Makes sense to me. David's actions make little sense (infecting a crew member - and he couldn't have planned for the fact that a pregnancy would ensue.... And then why be kind to Noomi Rapace at the end?) And if they wanted to spread life to new planets the engineers could surely find a better way of mixing their DNA into the planet's eco system than committing suicide.... very painfully!??? How about lop an arm off and use that? The list goes on.

OK so what is good about this film? Well...some beautiful, aerial shots in the first two minutes. And..... I am running out of options here...

"wandereramor","The best pro-choice movie this year","16 August 2012","Prometheus is a movie with big ambitions, aiming to super-size the Alien universe while at the same time making a grand statement about man's relationship with God. And it's worth giving it some credit for trying so hard to be a good film when just about every other blockbuster is content to coast on brand value and studied mediocrity. Which is what makes Prometheus's failures so heartbreaking.

Things go along pretty well for the first hour. The visuals are, of course, great, a strange combination of the blue-collar sci-fi ugliness of Scott's most revered films and the cosmic grandeur of 2001. The plot goes along at a nice clip. The characters are broadly drawn, but not so much as to seem unreal, with Michael Fassbender's ambiguous android especially standing out. It's a set-up for, if not greatness, at least a solid film.

And then comes the second hour, and things more or less go off the rails. The overall impression I got was that there were four different plots happening simultaneously, and none of them were willing to admit the others existed. In one scene Noomi Rapace's character emerges from a traumatic improvised abortion, dripping blood, and calmly plays her role as a minor exposition-seeker in another plot line. As far as I could tell one of the threatening aliens is forgotten about and never appears again. What's more, in the attempt to expand the mythos with a number of genetic mutations, Scott loses the mythic clarity of the first Alien film and ends up with a bunch of stuff happening.

Still, it's a consistently entertaining film, and one that manages to raise some genuinely interesting questions -- would finding humanity's maker, as the visionaries behind the project, really give us a sense of meaning, or just lead us on a chase for a yet higher power? There are plenty of good aspects of Prometheus, so I'm not ready to junk it as quickly as most critics are. If nothing else, it deserves points for trying.","6"
"rajesh-scorpi","Are you kidding?","9 June 2012","Right from the day the trailer was released, 'Prometheus' had a hype among the movie goers. I was not an exception. I wanted to see this film, as, from the trailer and from the internet, I learned that Scott will be presenting his take on the incidents happening before his big hit 'Alien' (1979). Also, since Ridley Scott is venturing in to a very familiar territory, I was wanting to see this film first day first show. I did.

What does this film say?

If you an alien expert, 'Claude Vorilhon' would ring a bell in your head. The Alien guru. Inventor of Raelism. The man who wrote the book called 'Intelligent Design', about how the alien master appeared in front of him and explained him the secrets of the creation. In short, the alien said: 'Listen. It was we who designed the humans, out of a scientific experiment. There is no god. I am the oldest of your creators'.

The question about the origins of the humans has long haunted the minds of many people, and out of them, Ridley Scott decided to pursue his 'prequel' dreams. As a result, Prometheus.

Before seeing this film, I had a huge respect for Ridley Scott. His films like 'Matchstick Men', 'A Good Year', 'Thelma & Louise', 'Body of Lies', 'Robinhood' were a few favorites of mine.

The movie begins with the scene of an alien, descending down on an uninhabited Earth, and disintegrating down to create the one celled organism, and from then on, life flourished.

We subsequently see Prometheus, a space craft, in search of a distant planet in the year 2089. How did they find this planet? Well, there are numerous 'evidences' from the pre historic days -the cave paintings - which we get to see in different parts of the world, with a similar pattern - the reference of six planets in the sky. By 'analyzing' these paintings, the scientists have found out about the distant galaxy and the sun there, with a planet resembling the earth and it's moon !!!

The members of the space craft are quite similar to the members from a mental asylum. Each one has specialized in his particular area of pissing off the others.

I'm giving out certain points, which, if considered the plot points, would provide the premise for any movie about the aliens.

1. The captain of the spacecraft would be a black guy. His only duty would be to keep shouting 'Oh my God!' or 'Hurry Up. They are coming' or 'America! Here we come !'

2. The crew of the spacecraft, as I said, are a bunch of clowns.

3. There is definitely a person among them who ridicules everybody else, and gets to die first in the hands (or rather, in the fangs of) the alien.

4. There has got to be a big cave in the alien planet.

5. There is most definitely a snake shaped alien, who drills down the body of the victims and emerges out from the stomach of the dead person.

6. The lone survivor at the end, would be the female lead.

7. The alien aircraft is hidden somewhere in that planet, whose controls are known very easily to an android robot with the humans.

8. The alien aircraft would start from the planet at the end.

There are some more. But, these would suffice.

Ridley Scott has miserably failed in trying to come out a yet another alien attempt. Every scene is known to the viewers, and they create nausea in the minds of a fan, who believed in Scott and who wanted to get a good experience out of this film. The climax is pathetic, to say the least. I didn't find even a single scene, worth watching.

Overall, this is a huge let down. I would suggest the movie goers of this weekend to see 'Madagascar 3' instead, as I am sure, it would never be - for that matter, no other film would ever be - as uninteresting as 'Prometheus'.

A sincere advice to the senior director Ridley Scott - please rest for a while. Please spare us from your outrageous ideas of making an alien film, and please take rest. The days of Ridley Scott as a director are over. Let's cherish his older movies, and let's bid him farewell.","1"
"sarkara","School kids are better scientists","23 June 2012","I don't understand where all the good reviews are coming from. This movie is based on a scientific exploration to a different planet and ironically there's nothing scientific about the movie. Apparently the so 1970 attempt to amaze people by showing a gigantic spaceship with hi-fi gadgets has worked. Not to mention the pretty Charlize Theron who has less chance of acting than the spaceship doors. Ridley Scott could be a good director (not in this movie though) but he sure as hell doesn't know s*it about science.

1. The ""scientists"" make multiple trips to the planet and never have a team leader. Even museum tours from schools have a team leader. 2. The ""scientists"" take their protective helmets off at will. On a previously unknown planet? Seriously? 3. Two ""scientists"" separate from the team voluntarily and no one cares to find out where they are until they are back in the ship. 4. One of the above two ""scientists"" see an unknown reptilian creature and proceed to touch it. Give me a break! 5. Two main characters in the movie have sex. And you'd have thought that space voyages have non-copulation rules.

But if not, then it will turn out as a gotcha and will make you feel stupid. The trailers didn't give much away, and that's a good thing. If you don't know what it is, then see it, and it will hit you.

It's the future, in 2089, a group of scientists, including Elizabeth(Nommi Rapace), her boyfriend Charlie(Logan Marshall Green), and David(Michael Fassbender), a droid, enter the ship Prometheus and go searching for the origin of human existence. But they really don't know what's in store for them.

After Prometheus was over, I realized that all of the finger nails available to chew off were gone. This movie will scare the crap out of you, and leave you on the edge of your seat. The special effects are spectacular, and some moments may have you covering your eyes. This is the first movie to scare me in years.

It's source material, which is clarified in the very end, was terrific. And it's great to have Scott back in his comfort zone. He's a sci-fi wizard, but i'm sure that we knew that from Blade Runner (and another little movie). I was starting to lose faith in him after I saw Robin Hood, but this is his best work since American Gangster.

The character development is marvelous; the performances are strong, and I was hooked from the opening thirty seconds. The Summer has just begun, and it's given us a masterful film. It's the best film of the Summer... until The Dark Knight Rises. But I mean, I think we are all thinking the same thing.

"SnoopyStyle","Ridley Scott revisits Alienverse","26 August 2013","This is a dangerous project for Ridley Scott revisiting one of his classic movies. It could muddy that franchise's good reputation if one could leave the various Alien vs Predator movies out of it. Luckily, it didn't do any major damage. It did raise some questions and hopefully answered others.

This time the cast consist of Noomi Rapace, Michael Fassbender, and Charlize Theron. They all are playing with some dark energy. There is no easy story here. It's filled with complications. There are great call backs to the original. It's compelling even if it's a messy story.

Guy Pearce is unrecognizable in his make up. And I think it's the most obvious mistake to cast him in this role. It has an easy solution if he would cast an older actor. Pearce just look fake. There are plenty of older actors around. I rather have Ian Holm if he was willing.","7"
"LloydBayer","Ridley the Riddler","17 June 2012","From reviews I have read to my own experience watching this movie, I gather there are two distinct groups within the audience. In other words, this is a 'love it' or 'hate it' movie. Like it or not, its either 'yes or no' with only a minority stuck in between. I for one find myself within this minority.

Borrowing from Greek mythology where demigod Prometheus was venerated by ancient Greeks in their quest for scientific progression, but feared as an idol of overindulgence and unforeseen consequences, director Ridley Scott's narration finds itself within a very similar paradigm. Conceptually, the film and its core message is the same as being told to be cautious when wishing for something to happen or materialize. It shares the same mythical philosophy as when Pandora opened the box, or biblically, when Adam in his greed for knowledge, ate from the forbidden tree. Set in 2089, it is within this premise where a group of scientists connect the dots to reveal a star map that interprets an invitation to the origins of mankind. We are first introduced to the android David (Michael Fassbender) as he monitors the flight path of the USS Prometheus, travelling at the speed of light. Mission director Meredith Vickers (Charlize Theron), followed by archaeologists Elizabeth Shaw (Noomi Rapace) and Charlie Holloway (Logan Marshall-Green) awake from a state of stasis hibernation, just as Prometheus approaches orbital range of their destination – LV223. After touching down near a monolithic structure, Shaw leads a team of explores in search of clues for alien life forms. As the tagline suggests, what they find not only jeopardizes the safety of the crew, but the entire human race.

Like Fox Mulder of ""The X Files"", I wanted to believe. If James Cameron has vested considerable time and money into exploring mysteries of the deepest oceans, I wanted to believe Ridley Scott was on a similar quest, but in the opposite direction. This was probably due to the immense hype made possible through word of mouth alone, and all before the official worldwide premier. We knew Scott was working on something so big, it had every prospect of becoming his masterpiece, not to mention him standing shoulder to shoulder with titans like Steven Spielberg, James Cameron and Peter Jackson. Sadly, and for obvious yet unbelievable reasons, ""Prometheus"" will always remain Scott's big catch that got away before the haul in. From my experience, it was like watching two very different movies. The first hour is a phenomenal piece of cinematic creation with fantastic visuals, ground breaking art direction, captivating atmosphere, and a mysterious story that boldly places us on the verge of THE biggest discovery since mankind learnt the use of fire. What happens during the second hour is a real shame if you ask me, considering Scott's nuance behind the groundbreaking ""Blade Runner"" (1982). The culprit is a fractured script that goes from phenomenal to ludicrous, thanks to the literary creativity (or lack of) of Jon Spaihts and Damon Lindelof. It is all the more annoying because this film blasts off to a brilliant start, and then out of nowhere, falls out of the sky because it only had half a tank of fuel to begin with. Then there are the astounding questions asked that never receive a plausible answer. This can be frustrating for certain sections of the audience but leaving those questions open-ended also makes the film intriguing but only for a few questions that are attempted with an answer. Ultimately, the final blow comes in the genre-altering second half, changing the story from sci-fi mystery to predictable sci-fi horror, and somewhere in between throws at the audience the notion that scientists, astronauts, and intellectuals of similar caliber lack basic common sense.

In all its worth, Fassbender is just about the only actor to look forward to as the calm yet eerie android, who ironically has more soul than most other characters. Rapace comes in at a close second, but given the built-in trend of all the ""Alien"" movies where a female protagonist uses every ounce of strength and courage to survive, Sigourney Weaver remains my favorite alien butt kicker of all time.

As a bold and visually stunning narration that tries to answer some of the questions that have been haunting mankind since we discovered the presence of celestial bodies, Scott can be credited with the overall aesthetics of this film. However, in staying true to the genre, this is not the best we have seen from the legend that is Ridley Scott.","6"
"elshikh4","Expensive Garbage !","3 January 2013","While Ridley Scott's (Prometheus - 2012) alleges a new story and viewpoint, it's his (Alien - 1979) all over again, with nearly the same characters, atmosphere, and maybe events; including ones from other Alien movies. True it's done with huge budget and more ambition, but sorrowfully filled with dumb uninteresting everything!

This round, it's not about the dangerous unknown, being represented in unintelligible monster, nope, it's about who mainly has created the known and the unknown; namely god, or - in the movie's viewpoint - gods. That looks deeper and catchier, putting in mind mixing it with the ""thrill"", ""horror"", ""sci-fi"", and ""action"" factors. But don't get so much excited, because this movie replays its stately original badly, while merely replacing the unintelligible monster with unintelligible monster god; which happens to be way less powerful, and less cool by the way!

You must get lost amongst clips from the previous movie, or movies, the weak plot, and the unanswered or postponed questions: Why David secretly infected Holloway with the ampoule's dark liquid of the so-called engineers? If the dark liquid was in our water since ages, why the humanity didn't turn sick, giving birth to monsters like what happened with Holloway and Elizabeth? What is that dark liquid in the first place?? Why Weyland is kept in the ship without anybody knowing except David and Vickers? And what could be the point of Vickers being the daughter of Weyland? (Ok, that guy must have given birth to her while he was 170 year old!), why Vickers forgot all about Shaw after Weyland's death, wanting to go back to earth without her? The event of ""let's destroy the god's ship for saving the earth"" seemed like a made-up James Bond climax for a movie that didn't have any. And all the matter of ""I'm pregnant with a monster"", aside from being repeated from the Alien series, it's too forced to be believed, they like affixed it after the script was completely written, just to fabricate a reason makes this pathetic remake a late prequel!

The rubbish talk about those engineers as the gods was killing me out of rage! Whoever wrote it needs a serious religious help. I know he has all the right in the world to imagine and argue, but ultimately, he went to nothing. His script is sort of soulless and mindless. It doesn't reach to a proper result; otherwise the gods are destructive creatures, they sleep then wait and wait and wait to be awaken, so they can re-continue destruction. What's this? (P.S: add a psychological help as well!). The thing is the script provided some sophisticated-like ""questions"" for the sake of upgrading a ""thriller"", while not answering the questions or making any great thriller at last. What a shame!

The character of Elizabeth Shaw, played by Noomi Rapace, seemed at the end as a take on Ripley, the heroine of the original movie played by Sigourney Weaver. Clearly they wanted to recreate a new heroine, with another history, trait, and aspects. This one is more interested in ""knowing"" more than ""fighting the alien"". However, that intention made a hideous irony with the movie's hoped for intellectual side, especially after the fallen of it eventually, and your discovering that there was no top action or thrill along the way either. So it came down to the ugly fact that this movie nearly had no goods to sell! The character of David, as performed by Michael Fassbender, had a lot of potential. It could fit a movie of its own. But alas. It didn't do much here in the middle of this mess of many uncompleted stuff!

I was disappointed the most in Ridley Scott. I longed for something from the Midas Touch that brought us earlier the original Alien of 1979. But he directed this lousy remake / prequel as another Hollywood sci-fi thriller, which didn't present much as a sci-fi or thriller. And its theory about god, the creation of life, etc. was laughable. Plus the way it linked itself to the Alien series was terrible. Come to think of it; if this movie wanted to give info about the origin of Alien, then what did it annex? That when half human half god-like freak rapes a dying god-like, then their bastard is The Alien??!!

The most, or only, perfect thing that this movie ever did; had to be the exotic backgrounds which embodied the unknown seductively, plus couple of nicely created and excused sci-fi details; the really inspiring ""disclosing flying puppies"" and the so-wild-it's-a-bit-creepy ""entirely electronic surgery"".

Prometheus is actually nothing but a reboot for the Alien franchise, so it may be launched again into a whole new series of movies, a la many reboot movies done lately such as Casino Royale (2006), Star Trek (2009), Rise of the Planet of the Apes (2011) and The Amazing Spider-Man (2012). As the movie's Weyland, Hollywood wants to live forever, but it must search for another god else remaking, otherwise it will end up being exactly like Weyland; insanely rich, awfully old, and spending astronomical sums for trying failed tricks to live longer!

My title is the first thing I have said after finishing this failed trick.","3"
"vovietanh","Not just a bad movie, but a big disappointment","16 June 2012","Sheer stupidities coalesce in a modern motion picture.

There are too many inconsistencies and fine-tunings in this piece of crap. Let me name a few. (FYI, fine-tuning in this case is like what you see in kids' fairy tales when a prince arrives with perfect timing to rescue a princess, which impresses the kids rather than make a logical story.)

1. Technology inconsistency: these people have achieved the technology that allows the production of a perfect and immortal humanoid. Yet, they have not achieved the technology that allows the rejuvenation of human blood and cells to at least make a person look younger. Evidently, the old man Weyland looks like... an old man.

2. Intelligence inconsistency: human intelligence is greatly underestimated by Ridley the stupid director. These people in the movie are supposed to be the few elites among a human population who have survived and evolved all the way till 2094. Yet, they dress, behave, talk, and respond to danger like retards. At the end of the movie, when the alien ship crashed and toppled down, the two surviving women were running along the falling ship's shadow instead of running sideways, which resulted in one of them crushed to death. Next, the surviving one flew back to Earth on an alien ship after leaving a general warning message without any detail to explorers in the future who may set foot on the planet again, forgetting that her crew didn't give darn to even more obvious warnings throughout their expedition.

3. Fine-tunings: when these people entered the planet for the first time, without any geographical survey in advance, within minutes they have found their destination - where they went there for and where all those aliens were sleeping with their spaceships. Next, when the big boss Weyland was awakened, he needed to talk with Dr. Shaw, who came in with perfect timing even though she had just been going through a separate series of extraordinary events. At the end of the movie, the surviving alien miraculously made it all the way from his crashed ship to Dr. Shaw (to take her life) and just in time to be raped by the monster octopus.

4. Underused and underdeveloped characters: Charlize Theron was so underused - Vickers's presence and actions were completely inconsequential to the plot. She said the ship is HERS but she couldn't stop the pilots from crashing her ship to the alien ship. The Medpod is in HER room and she didn't want anyone to touch it but Dr. Shaw just walked in and used it to extract the alien from her stomach. Finally, the international pilot trio (white-black-asian) sat aside the whole time and just ended up saving humanity.

I remember reading all those stupid flattering previews on the philosophical aspect of this movie and want to give all their posters a finger. That's why it's a big disappointment. There ain't anything whatsoever in this crap that's worth a thought, just some typical *beep* alien plot.","1"
"happyendingrocks","The weakest film in the Alien series, and the weakest film on Ridley Scott's resume","26 June 2012","By nature of its title alone, it's clear that Ridley Scott was intentionally trying to establish Prometheus as a stand-alone entity and steer us away from comparisons to the storied Alien franchise. However, since even casual viewers will know going in that the events in Prometheus are directly linked to that series, such comparisons are unavoidable, and a savvy director like Scott should have been aware enough of that to make sure that what we see in this film lines up with the mythology surrounding the discovery made by the Nostromo in 1979. Though Prometheus falters because it is a disappointing and simply average film as a whole, its biggest failure is that it does not serve as a logical introduction to the world of Alien, and as far as back-stories go, this one is murky and uneven at best.

The movie stalls right from the beginning, squandering nearly twenty minutes to show us events that are recapped in their entirety almost immediately afterward. The film doesn't begin in earnest until the crew of the Prometheus sets down on LV-223, and while our cohort of scientists' extended submersion into the planet's ancient catacombs is fairly tense and engrossing, it's also inevitably familiar for anyone who took the almost identical plunge with Cain, Dallas, and Lambert thirty-three years before.

The film is nearly half over before we finally begin to uncover any of the secrets of this expedition, and while our first exposure to the alien beings we expected when we signed for this mission provides a couple of much-needed jolts, the cause of this initial infestation requires us to accept that when two carefully trained and highly educated scientists encounter a bizarre, previously undiscovered species of monstrous, worm-like life forms, their initial hypothesis is that these slithering beasties who dwell in viscous pools of inky black sludge probably want to be petted. Predictably, this doesn't turn out very well for them.

Though this aspect of the plot should be a no-brainer since we're already wise to the ins and outs of these beings, the creatures in Prometheus are the most befuddling element of the film. Not only do these specimens bear almost no relation to their counterparts in the Alien installments, but their essence becomes utterly confusing and nonsensical when we discover what they truly are. While the previously-understood face-hugger begat chest-burster begat bipedal killing machine motif makes biological sense, the mutation of the aliens in Prometheus doesn't seem to adhere to any internal logic, and how these creepy-crawlies manifest changes from scene to scene and person to person. When encountering the matter which spawns the creatures, some characters swell up until their heads explode, one comes back as a powerful hyper-aggressive zombie, one finds herself impregnated with something that resembles an octopus, and one hatches an adolescent version of an Alien Queen.

More importantly, no one has anything burst out of their chest, which poses the pressing question: if this film is meant to explain what happened to the mummified pilot located by the crew of the Nostromo in the original Alien, why did he have a massive hole in his sternum when nothing remotely close to that is even suggested here? Purportedly, Scott's primary muse for this film is the origins of humanity, not the origins of Alien. Fair enough, and despite the often dicey quasi-mystical questions raised in this regard, that avenue is adequately explored here. However, since we ultimately don't get a resolution on that front either, I'm forced to pose another question: what exactly is the point of this movie? As a riddle, Prometheus isn't nearly as fun to puzzle over as it should be, and the intersecting sub-plots form such an incomprehensible web that I'm not quite sure if any portion of the story was resolved to my satisfaction.

I don't mean to suggest the film has no strengths, especially since it's pretty much impossible for a director with Scott's talents to put anything on the screen that isn't at least interesting to look at. There are some great technological innovations demonstrated here that were simply beyond the scope of 1979's visual effects capabilities, so Scott's imaginative addendums to the Nostromo's nuts and bolts are nifty to behold. But even these don't match up linearly with what we've seen before, and since every bit of machinery in this outing is so far advanced beyond the world of Alien, Prometheus seems to take place hundreds of years later, certainly not before. Worse, many of these gimmicks are just kind of there to be there (the film's android ""reads dreams"" by touching the crew members' cryo-pods, but this serves no ultimate purpose within the plot) and one toy is only utilized during the most cheesy and implausible scene in the film, when our leading lady essentially performs abdominal surgery on herself to remove an alien mass from her womb then immediately leaps off the operating table and runs down the hallway to rejoin the action.

The sets and locales are well-realized, and the acting is above-par (although Guy Pearce's old-age makeup is so clunky and unconvincing that he becomes a distraction whenever he's on the screen), but the characters themselves are mostly one-dimensional archetypes set up for easy disposal. There's really no one here to root for other than the creatures, which is a curious stance for Scott to take considering that this series introduced one of the most badass female heroines the screen has ever seen.

In the end, for all of its splendor and grandeur, Prometheus is essentially a glitzy B-movie, with all of the flaws and inconsistencies that designation entails. I'll still be the first one on board for a film that provides an exhilarating genesis for the scenario essayed to perfection in Alien, but this isn't anywhere close to being that film.","5"

Being a minority all my life ( At least, opinion-wise ) I'm going to sit on the fence here. There's no denying the plot is a teensy bit daft, and the trouble-in-space plot has been done to death.

But director Ridley Scott is a dab hand at these sort of cosmic shenanigans, and here again he injects excitement and intrigue into a scenario which could have been deathly dull. Watch out for some truly vile creatures too... If we ever get invaded by some of these beasties, remind me to evacuate the planet. It's a bit overlong too, but fans of the Aliens film... REJOICE!!

"adrongardner","Ripley's Believe it or Not (mostly not)","8 June 2012","More is definitely less.

There's an old maxim in creative writing. Never TELL your audience - SHOW them. That maxim has been both ignored and abused in the case of Prometheus. The filmmakers show you too much and explain just about everything too. Director Ridley Scott's return to the Alien universe is mostly non-triumphant. On revisiting a flame he he first ignited in 1979, one done with a great minimalist and atmospheric effect, Scott has betrayed his success by employing a genuinely odd and disjointed script, perfunctory direction and an endless hall of monster's closet scares. Ridley is much better than this. In fact, I'm hard pressed to find if he's ever been worse.

Prometheus is a concept film, wrapped in leftover sets and costumes from Avatar and spiced with Creature from the Black Lagoon. Despite how hard the movie tells the audience twe are watching is an Alien ""prequel,"" (or by the end he's trying to tell us its a prequel to a prequel), I'm hard pressed to find any substantive connection to Alien, Aliens or even the jumbled Alien3. Those films were at best, riveting. At worst, in the case of Alien 3, boring. I will stop there with comparisons because all that followed Fincher's mess really don't bother mention and I believe this one could fall into that category.

Exposition is at a premium here but development is scarce. From the first scenes, mystery is left to the dogs and before we can immerse ourselves in the unknown, voluble lectures of the plot yet to unfold are given ad nauseum. Prometheus is essentially two films. One is a concept of human origin, the other, and the majority in general, is an endless series of monster's closets. Just when things settle down and it feels as if we could be watching an actual science fiction movie, the jumpy music cues, gooey scares and terrible dialog set in. Then there's the other half. A nebulous origin story - one that could be interesting - is buried under rubber chicken on the string gags. Oh but there are mysteries. Why do they keep taking the helmets off? Why bother having them at all? Why did nobody ask Liz about her quickie operation and that nasty ""leftover?"" That's just the short end of it. How can we trace our DNA to these tall aryans? Then what the heck were the Neatherthals and all the other humans we share nearly identical DNA with? The script displays the trademark ravenous touch for dead ends of writer Damon Lindeloff, one of the head writers of TV's LOST. He should stick to television or perhaps working the McDonalds drive up, or would he screw that up too? Deus ex machina is at a premium, character exchanges are laughable, scenes pace with the tempo of a video game commercial and I still can't count how many endings the movie had. That last ""reveal"" was certainly a laugh, because a lot of the people in the theater found it funny.

But it's not all bad. Noomi Rapace is a decent match for Sigourney Weaver and proves yet again, even in the face of a terrible script, she will pull off anything handed to her. Just like in the superior Swedish Dragon Tattoo film, her unwavering commitment to her character shores up a meager story and holds us to the end. Michael Fassbender too gives a noteworthy play as the android and gives Lance Henrickson's turn in the same boots a run for his money. I don't know what Charlize Theron and Guy Pierce were doing here but she and everybody else are simply cashing a paycheck.

Where did humans come from? I don't know but the mystery of who bankrolled a script this bad is a conundrum worth solving. It is pretty obvious why Ripley never wanted people to know where the Aliens came from. She saw Prometheus and knew it sucked. Ripley warned us and tried to save us, but we had to ask. Now we know Ripley, now we know.","1"
"gregsrants","An Alien Prequel That Makes You Yearn For Alien","9 June 2012","The wait is over. The most anticipated film of 2012 and that does not contain a superhero or a Hobbit hits theatres this week-end in Ridley Scott's Prometheus.

Carefully marketed as an original film that takes place in the same universe and references Alien (1979) but not a promoted Alien prequel, Prometheus stars Michael Fassbenders, Charlize Theron, Noomi Rapace, Idris Elba and Guy Pearce.

The film opens in the year 2089 where Elizabeth Shaw (Noomi Rapace) and boyfriend Charlie (Logan Marshall-Green) find cave drawings in the Scotland Highlands that they interpret as a star map and invitation to another planet that may lead to the origins of mankind.

We quickly flash forward to the year 2093 aboard the spacecraft Prometheus where android and product of the Weyland Corporation David (Michael Fassbender) is quietly going about his work while 16 other crew members rest in hyper-sleep.

Upon their awakening, the crew land on the distant planet and begin exploring a complex structure containing various alien beings and creatures (both dead and active). With different members of the crew working with different objectives, the team splits up and survey's the alien structure only to discover that they find themselves in a terrifying battle to save mankind and earth itself.

Prometheus comes to theatres with incredible geek and horror historian expectations. Ridley Scott's Alien is widely considered one of the best horror and science fiction films in the history of film. And having master Ridley Scott back behind the camera for a science fiction film for the first time since in 30 years to revisit the movie that launched his career was a feat that came with high expectations from his fan base.

The pressure to provide audiences with just the right amount of everything may have been Ridley's, and subsequently Prometheus', downfall. To use the phrase that 'everything was thrown at you but the kitchen sink' in reference to this effort would be an understatement and the film bends to the heavy pressure of the deep and convoluted plot from writers Jon Spaihts and Damon Lindelof.

The origins of mankind can be a heavy and controversial conversation piece on the best of days, but throw in aliens and creatures that look like they crawled out of the space garbage compactor in Star Wars and you end up with a mishmash of a film that goes in as many directions as a compass arrow when confronted with multiple magnets.

The plot is only the beginning of the many disappoints in Prometheus. Whereas the characters aboard the Nostromo in Alien all seemed real and intelligent beings, this future doesn't offer the same hope. The 17 crew members about the Prometheus seem as if placed there by the same geniuses that screen thousands of applications before agreeing to send 18 castaways to an island on television's Survivor. Their personalities are wildly confrontational in interactions and it would be hard to believe that a trillion dollar science expedition would be left to some unstable critters as presented here.

As Prometheus is at its core an Alien prequel (the final scene more or less confirms all), comparisons to the style and pacing of Ridley's 1979 masterpiece is inevitable. But where the Sigourney Weaver classic was meticulously calculated and used the claustrophobic elements of the Nostromo to help create mood and atmosphere, Prometheus does neither. The scenes inside the alien structure seemed grand in design and were more of a set designers attempt at an Academy Award as it was a terrifying configuration of caverns and layers.

Anyone expecting the Alien as presented in Ridley Scott's original film or any of the subsequent sequels can check their disappointment at the door. Even though there are alien creatures that grow inside human hosts, they are a far cry from the H.R. Giger influenced creatures we have grown to root both for and against. And the 'Egg Room' that was the downfall of John Hurt's character in Alien has been replaced by a Cylinder Room filled with an oil-like substance that eventually plays its part in one of the sub-plots.

Not all is bad with Prometheus. The aforementioned set and ship design were both incredible creations. And many of the special effects, which would include Ridley's view of our future, were equally stunning. Michael Fassbender is again reliable as the artificial humanoid and Charlize Theron proves in two consecutive weeks at the box office (following last week's release of Snow White and the Huntsman) that when she is evil, she can be bitchy-she-devil evil.

But one cannot distance oneself from the Alien prequel hype. And as a lead-in to the popular film that coined the tagline 'In Space No One Can Hear You Scream', Prometheus fails to connect. So much so that we would suggest that if Prometheus was made first that Alien might never have been given a green-light. And now, my most anticipated film of the summer has left me feeling still empty and without the adrenaline rush that I craved in my horror junkie state.

"williampsamuel","A Visually Stunning Exercise in Wonder and Terror","10 January 2015","Prequels are always a dicey proposition, as director Ridley Scott discovered with his recent take on Robin Hood. This is especially when there is only the most tenuous connection to the original. But he's beaten the odds this time around. Not since Close Encounters has a science fiction movie filled with such wonder as Prometheus, and not since the original Alien has one filled me with such terror. And few movies from any genre have ever given me so much to ponder.

The wonder of this film comes from the first half. It begins the moment we first lay eyes on the barren world. I do not know where these scenes were shot, but I know that if it is a real place that I must go there someday. Rarely has such utter desolation ever held such magnificence as these craggy vistas and bleak flats. And the sense of wonderment (with an undercurrent of dread) only grows with each development. The discovery of breathable atmosphere inside the tunnels. The holograms that David the android activates. The perfectly preserved, 2000 year old body of a humanoid alien before a great door. And especially the room that lies beyond.

The crew thought it was a tomb. I thought it was an Ark, a repository to hold the species' genetic information for their future revival. We were both terribly wrong. It's here that the sense of wonder begins to mix with one dread, one that only grows as in an alien necropsy scene that for me evoked spine tingling memories of a near identical sequence in Howard Hawks' seminal The Thing from Another World. And then the real terror begins, because something is alive, something worse than any of them ever imagined. And like the original, every time you think it's over, it's not. There is always another horror.

Noomi Rapace deserves only the highest praise for her performance, and for even agreeing to this role. The ordeals she- and her character- endures in Prometheus are beyond even what she went through in Girl with the Dragon Tattoo. Ripley had it easy by comparison. She may have been trapped alone in space with one of the universes deadliest predators, but she never experienced a violation on the order of what Doctor - Shaw suffers. Many observers have commented on how the Alien from the previous films is basically a metaphor for rape. Prometheus takes it a step further- though thankfully not in the way that first comes to mind. Still, it is hard to overstate how disturbing parts are. This is not a film for the faint of heart.

A far different effect comes from watching David (Michael Fassbender), the first character seen aboard ship, and who looks far too gorgeous to be true. And indeed he is. He's an android, a fact that is made clear to everyone very early on. His beauty and obvious intelligence are captivating, even charming. But at the same time there's an almost paradoxical sense that he's too perfect. And it's clear that he knows more about the mission than he's sharing. In some ways, mainly his total lack of emotion, he reminds me of HAL 9000. Yet he still manages to come off as more human than Miss Vickers (Charlize Theron) the mission's commander. She is an absolute ice queen, aloof, condescending, impeccable in speech and manners, and supremely self confident and in control- in short, a cast iron B. She is every bit David's equals in the looks department, and there is some question among the crew as to whether she might be an android as well.

Nor is it only the people who are beautiful. Besides the barren plains and mountains mentioned before, there's the Prometheus itself. Far from the cramped, darkened corridors and ducts of the tug in the original Alien, the Prometheus's interiors are gleaming white. The early scenes in which David roams the ship alone to the accompaniment of classical music are a clear homage to Kubrick's 2001, one that contrasts markedly with the ugliness to come. And nowhere is this film more beautiful, more enigmatic, or more like 2001 than in the breathtaking pre-title sequence in which we first lay eyes upon what I call the Alabaster Man. It may produce utter bafflement at first, but once understood, this scene is as magical as any ever put on film.

Then there are the questions: the questions of our origins and purpose which the scientists seek the answers too, and which mankind has asked itself for as long as we have existed. And the true genius of Prometheus is that it does not provide a complete answer. For one thing, any answer it gave would ring hollow, and lack any weight outside the context of this film, resting as it does on the idea that we came from aliens. But more importantly, within the world of the film, the partial answers raise even more pressing questions, ones that we may not want to know the answers to.

People will see this movie to be scared. They will be scared, and they will be awed. But more than the terror or the wonder it creates, it is the imagination and inquisitiveness it displays that makes Prometheus a work of art, and a truly great film.","9"
"dk777","With Flaws, But Still Worth Watching","3 May 2023","A movie that could have been better, but it's not that bad, especially when you watch it more than once.

There are some flaws, some of the actions of the characters are illogical and border on nonsense, thus lowering the overall impression of the story.

We follow the crew of the Prometheus as they try to reach the destination of their journey and solve the mystery of humanity's existence.

The special effects are excellent, and the film itself is superbly directed. The script is flawed, but overall the whole movie isn't that bad, the only thing is that it doesn't really give us some of the answers we were hoping for. It's certainly better than its sequel, Alien: Covenant.

The cast is solid, Michael Fassbender is excellent as David, the android who helps the crew. His character is actually frightening and sinister, which we see in his actions. Michael Fassbender is perhaps the most interesting character in the film, and sometimes it seems that he is actually the backbone of the whole story.

Noomi Rapace plays Elizabeth Shaw, a scientist who finds ancient drawings and concludes that they are a map.

The problem in the film is the incredibly careless reactions of some characters who are supposed to be scientists, meaning they should have basic intelligence and a drive for self-preservation, and in the film they do some truly incomprehensible actions.

The film is visually great, starting with the depiction of the environment and the technique itself, the creatures look interesting and terrifying.

Indeed, the film could have been better, but still, even with all these flaws it is worth watching.","7"
"infestorOfSouls","Mr. Scott, Mr. Scott, What Have Ye Done?","5 June 2012","I knew that I had to lower my expectations but apparently I had to lower more...and then some:

» Non-lowered expectation: a masterpiece in the caliber of Alien, Blade Runner, District 9, Children of Men

» Lowered expectation: a flick with lots of CGI and far from Alien's atmosphere

» Letting Damon Lindelof write the story with his ""yes man"" attitude was a mistake. The story has a lot of ""mysteries"" and branched. However, Alien (1979)'s strong point was never a mystique and twisty story. On the contrary it was a B-film story executed phenomenally (this was in 1979). I wish they had gone on this direction instead of this mess they call ""Prometheus scenario"".

» No character development whatsoever. 0, null, nada! You cannot empathize with any of the characters and when they die left and right you frankly don't care at all. Maybe Idris Elba's character a little bit, just because he seemed more human than the rest of the crew.

» It could have saved them money if there was no Charlize Theron. I mean she did nothing to contribute to the story, just strolled like a Soviet commissar.

» Why the heck did you have to have a Mr. Weyland character as a twist? OK, you had him. Then why did you have to choose Guy Pearce with a horrible make up? Just to be consistent with the viral TED video? Horrible decisions in a series.

» What is the genre here? Sci-fi? Sci-fi horror? A Shyamalan film? If it was sci-fi horror (which everyone was waiting for) then you have failed monumentally Mr. Scott. There is certainly NO atmosphere, ambiance and tension build-up. Only wee bit crumbs of discrete atmosphere here and there.

» Overusing of CGI. Especially the Earth map scene where David watches in awe. That bleedin' scene didn't want to finish! It was as if ""Here is some dumb eye candy for 3D viewers""

» What in the hell was that ""put your hands up in the air, put your hands up in the air""-kamikaze scene? The crew working for Weyland corp. so far as we know from Alien would always ask first ""But will we get our money?"", not become a suicide bomber in 5 seconds!

» OK, the ""abortion"" scene was fantastically shot. But how come anyone did not realize what the heck happened in that chamber? Noomi Rapace aborted the squid and she right away galloped to the expedition with Mr. Weyland. Let alone running you can't even walk after such an abdomen incision! (also put together with some damn staples!)

» What was the xenomorph at the end? Was it not Mr. Scott who told us many times that there will be NO xenomorph for it was one of the most used figures of the 20th century? Eat back what you spat.

» A director's cut might save some of the film but you can't make a masterpiece out of a trash just by another cut. So, I have no hopes there.

There are many negative things but frankly I am exhausted to keep on writing 'em.

We wanted to see what the deal is really with the space jockey but instead the film gave us many more dumb questions! Basically we have been kicked in the crotch! Also, shame on you Hollywood for cracking the window for another sequel! (more $$$ yessss, more greensiessss!)

Last word: If you are an Alien fan, still go see this film but just for the effects. Because it is a huge let down.",NA
"spencergrande6","In this age of sci-fi as action tentpole, an amazing accomplishment","29 July 2017","Pure sci-fi. Not action, not horror, but a blend of elements and philosophizing that, in this age of sci-fi as action tentpole, is an amazing accomplishment. There are a lot of questions left unanswered, but much like life, the journey has to settle as the answer (for now).

That may seem like explaining away what could also be blandness, lack of imagination or incoherence, but in this beautiful and spectacularly crafted film, it's hard to believe that's the case. Just because something doesn't have a concrete explanation doesn't mean it doesn't have an answer. This is a visual film and also an emotional one. The characters don't understand what's going on and they're not supposed to. They're supposed to act and react.

It observes the creation of life on many levels, including some not often thought of - Parent and child, Man and machine, God and man, God and other creatures, even God as mortal creator.

And of course Michael Fassbender's David steals the show. An incredible accomplishment of restrained acting creates a complete character out of an android. ""Can you imagine how disappointing it would be for you to hear the same thing from your creator?"" David discussing the mundanity of creation to Charlie (Logan Marshall- Green) drowning his sorrows.","9"
"nevdelap","Very disappointing.","17 June 2012","I've given 4 only for the impressive visuals in the movie.

As for the rest... the science is consistently nonsense, the Christian religious references make no sense in the context of Christianity. The creationism vs evolution references are lame and philosophically weak, un-thought-through and poorly presented. The acting is so so and does nothing to save the story, which is dull and unimaginative.

A few specifically ridiculous things...

Why hire such a pair of twits as the geologist and the biologist for such an expensive and important mission? Did they ask for volunteers at the unemployment office? Come to that, how could they have such a crew of unprofessional clowns for a $1 trillion mission?

Can a surgery be any more ridiculously fake? Spray on a bit of ""anaesthetic"" and perform a Caesarian on a struggling woman?

How can there be such a powerful storm of such large particles and no- one's suits or helmets have any real damage? And there isn't piles of the stuff building up everywhere? Did it evaporate?

I suppose David's ability to read and speak a 2000 year old language isn't 'too' ridiculous, though it is still ridiculous.

To enjoy this movie one must have to a good level of scientific and religious illiteracy, or an exceptional ability to suspend belief and ignore the silliness of the whole thing.

And the attempt to link it to Alien was pathetic. To compare the movie to Alien at all is an insult to a true classic and that they'd make such a poor movie today with its big budget should be an embarrassment to its makers.

Disappointed.","4"
"piribweraz","Masterpiece","27 July 2020","I have watched this one many times now. I also had many unanswered questions like why scientists/astronauts would do some very dumb stuff? Viewers need to realise a few things, and the whole movie falls into place.

1 The entire purpose of the trip was to find the Aliens that made life on earth. Weyland did not want to die (old age). "" If they made us surely they can save us"" Only a few were aware of this (David, Vickers & perhaps other Weyland Corporation crew on board)

2 Old man Weyland was prepared to do anything, sacrifice the others to get what he wanted. This he did through David, whose primary objective was to Weylands agenda.

3 Vickers, Weylands daughter, wanted Weyland dead. He was old. Him dying was the natural order of things. She would then be Head of Weyland Corporation. But Weyland didn't want to die, and didn't want a daughter to be heir to his empire. He wanted a son, but didn't have one, and he made robot David yo be his right hand man. Much to the disgust of Vickers.

The hired scientists were really just a bunch of naive ones, each chasing their own agenda eg Money, getting paid at end of mission. They were not astraunots. Non of them knew why they were travelling in space ship for 2 years, or where they were going (except the archaeologists) That's why they made and acted on very stupid decisions in space. Eg drinking alcohol, taking off helmets, walking in sandals, smoking weed, trying to be friendly to an alien snake...

4 Weyland was willing to sacrifice all these scientists people to get what he wanted eg by allowing David to experiment on Charlie, allowing an alien fetus to grow in Elizabeth. He basically authorized David to do as he saw necessary to get the results.

5 Unfortunately the level headed people were also killed off, eg Vickers and the ship's captain and assistants. The rest of the crew deserved to die imo.","10"
"jefsof-2","Ridley Scott Has Lost It","11 June 2012","*Spoilers* So bad you just won't believe it. The sophomoric and hackneyed script hits you over the head with the stupid stick so many times you think you'll just submit when that proto-alien at the end flashes his pearly whites. I tried to throw something at the screen but was just to weak from the pummeling I took from the anti-science, illogical, adolescent, half-baked, excrement which was put on screen as an entry into the Alien franchise.

Audiences are so dumbed-down at this point that the film made money and they've greenlighted another. There is no possible way the next film in this series can be any worse. Oh, wait James Cameron wants to direct it, so we'll get an overlong smash-wham-bam action version. Dude, go back to the bottom of the sea - it's time better spent.

The high score here on IMDb can only be from so many members being film students themselves thinking they'll one day work with Ridley or Lindelof and smooching some ass to get that gig.

From the ""it's what I believe"" religious hooey, to the ships dropping in exactly over the temples without looking for them, to taking off their helmets, to an android that dies his hair, to terrible acting by the captain character, to a useless character only to have Charlize Theron in the movie ""don't open that door!""

Now don't get me wrong this movie wasn't terrible, I enjoyed many aspects of the story, the visuals were great and I was curious as to whom the engineers were. The problem is that there were many things I couldn't ignore that kept happening through the movie.

1. The scientists were more dumb than the audience.

Getting scared and getting lost even though you have the map. - Going on a long trip without even knowing why they are going. - Taking your helmet off just because the air is breathable. - Trying to play with what appears to be an albino space cobra. (Listen if it looked like a cute little bunny I would understand the mistake).


And on and on and on...

2. The story stopped making sense at its convenience.

Lets not keep an eye on the staff we have trapped in the alien structure. - Lets experiment on someone in the ship rather than going back to Earth and figuring out what the alien substance is. - Oh Peter Weyland is on the ship, why is that kept secret? - No one is shocked to see the bleeding woman in the ship? - Why did the Engineers send us maps to their biological weapons facility? We can presume at that point they liked us.


and on and on and on and on.

To sum up Prometheus: Its like when you watch a horror movie and someone runs up the stairs to get away from the monster, suddenly I don't care if the idiot lives anymore, I may even be cheering for the monster at that point. When people act in a way that you do not think is reasonable the movie loses its tension, its emotional connection, and the immersion. This is what Prometheus does for me, a bunch of idiots on a starship meet an idiot from another planet and together do idiotic things until credits.","3"
"Turfseer","Inside every giant squid-like alien, is one hell of an adorable gargoyle calling the shots!","16 June 2012","No matter how much he and his fellow scenarists deny it, Ridley Scott's 'Prometheus' is very much a souped-up update of Scott's 'classic' 1979 sci-fi horror show, 'Alien'. The film begins with a cryptic scene set during pre-historic times when a space traveler (who looks like a muscle-bound 'Mr. Clean' with pasty skin) drinks a dark liquid concoction that causes him to disintegrate. We find out later, that quite incredibly, the traveler's disintegration causes a biogenetic chain reaction, which is responsible for the origin of life on earth,

Cut to 2089. Archaeologist couple, Elizabeth Shaw and Charlie Holloway, make a new discovery of an ancient cave drawing that's similar to other cave drawings already discovered, pointing to a distant moon where Mr. Clean might have come from (these humanoids are dubbed 'Engineers'). Cut to the Prometheus, a giant spaceship financed by multi-billionaire Peter Weyland, CEO of the Weyland Corporation. Weyland is played by Guy Pearce, made up to look like a senior on his last legs (despite a ton of prosthetics, the make-up department ends up managing to turn Weyland into a clone of Biff Tanner from 'Back to the Future, Part 2').

Weyland gives the Prometheus crew a pep talk after they wake up from suspended animation, except he's a hologram. We're told by Vickers (Charlize Theron) that Weyland had a few weeks to live before the Prometheus took off but it turns out that he's been in stasis in private quarters, off limits to the rest of the crew. Weyland can't accept the idea that he's soon going to kick the bucket and hopes that the Engineers will restore his youth. Boy is he in for a big surprise!

Before the ship arrives at its destination, David the Android house sits while crew members sleep in their pea pods. David, designed by Weyland, has a mind of his own and a nice British accent to boot. He keeps himself busy before the crew wakes up by studying thousands of obscure languages and watching old movies. For some reason, David doesn't seem to be programmed to obey orders and ends up digging around for clues by himself once the crew lands on the moon.

Despite all the neat special effects, 'Prometheus' is saddled with one clichéd character after another. Holloway, the archaeologist leader, is the skeptical scientist who's contrasted with his lover Shaw, the 'believer', who is still bent on finding out the 'meaning of life' at film's end. Holloway is virtual cannon fodder after David infects him with the dark liquid seen earlier. Holloway proves to be thoroughly expendable when he becomes a virtual Zombie and Vickers must torch him to death with a flamethrower, to prevent him from getting back on the ship. Theron's Vickers, who turns out to be Weyland's daughter, has no interest in alien first contact and is a most unlikeable, one dimensional villain. Like Holloway, she's easily disposed of when she's crushed by the Engineer's disabled ship, during the denouement.

The bulk of the action takes inside a giant cave which turns out to be the Engineer's spaceship. Crew members Milburn and Fifield, decide to run back to the Prometheus after they're spooked by all the bad vibes inside the cave. As there is no discipline amongst the crew members, they're allowed to abandon their colleagues and promptly end up getting lost. Of course they're the first ones to be dispatched by the alien monsters, squid like creatures completely reminiscent of Scott's '79 'frightfest'.

Scott must have reasoned that audiences today still want a taste of that old 'Alien' magic, so Milburn and Fifields' demise must go the usual route of having the creature's tentacles reach inside the victims' bodies (through the mouth) and then having them subsequently disemboweled from the 'inside out'. But wait! Scott must up the 'ante' and then does so by having Shaw impregnated by an infected Holloway. Since she's now got an alien embryo in her belly, she's informed by David that she's now three months pregnant after one day! Not to worry! Set your self-service 2093 surgery machine on automatic pilot and let the device remove the nasty creature for you. Just make sure you give yourself enough shots of morphine, or whatever pain-killer does the trick!

It turns out that David has discovered that one of the Engineers is still alive, inside one of those pea pods inside the cave. When they wake him up, the crew members who went back into cave (including Weyland), have to deal with the humanoid's 'anger management' problem, which they didn't count on. Everyone is killed and David gets his head ripped off (don't worry, he's somehow still able to think, talk and communicate!).

It's not enough for the director to channel 'Alien' but why not a dose of 'Alien vs. Predator' while you're at it? That's essentially happens when the surviving bad-guy Engineer takes on the giant squid-like Alien, in a fight to the death struggle. Guess who wins?

Leave it to Shaw (the aforementioned true believer), to want to go off to distant places, in an attempt to extract an explanation from the Engineers, who seemingly gave humans life but then changed their minds. As Shaw jets off with the help of David, one wonders why Shaw seems to ignore all the unpleasantness associated with her first encounter with the surviving Engineer. Is there any reason why she wouldn't get her head ripped off, during a second encounter with these baddies?

If you're going to see 'Prometheus', it's for the special effects and not the characters. There's actually some neat visuals in this film, including a wondrous sandstorm and a star map highlighting Earth. But in the end, most of this stuff we've seen before. One thing I did learn from 'Prometheus' is that inside every giant squid-like alien, is one hell of an adorable gargoyle calling the shots!","4"
"Horst_In_Translation","Needs a bit to get going","26 May 2015","I have to admit I was a bit skeptical before watching this. Science fiction is not particularly my favorite genre, I don't care much about the ""Alien"" movies, I do not like Theron or Rapace (plays the central character, but it takes a while to find that out) and I don't care a lot for Fassbender (the epitome of a sterile and emotionless robot here) or Pearce. I like Idris Elba though. This movie runs for over 2 hours (including credits) and the first hour left me fairly uninterested, but then things got better. The main plot of this film is about a couple of scientists who discovered a far distant planet and travel there to find out what's its secret. It may have to do something with the creation of mankind. And they find more than they bargained for. Much more.

This film got Oscar and BAFTA nominations for its visual effects, but lost twice to ""Life of Pi"". If you ask me, it could also have gotten one for its art direction and set decoration, both nicely done. The film is directed by Ridley Scott and he got help from a duo of writers, one of which did a lot writing on the successful television series ""Lost"" before. As I said, the film gets better after the 60-minute mark. Rapace's scene in the cabin with that wicked creature inside her is really well-done, maybe the best of the movie. The deaths of the crew members aren't bad either. Well.. bad for them, but not bad for the audience. There are several captivating fight sequences outside and inside the ship. That giant monster which tears off Fassbender's head is a great addition too and I wouldn't mind seeing it in his own movie. Anyway, I just saw they plan a sequel for 2016. We'll see how that goes. For this one here, given all the previously-mentioned negative factors for my very personal case, I have to say I enjoyed this film slightly more than I thought I would. There are some flaws in the script, for example why would experienced scientists take off their helmets only because it appears safe, but it's nothing really that ruins the movie. People with a bigger interest in science fiction films will probably really appreciate this film. Recommended and it's probably also a movie worth rewatching as you will always discover something new. If you are lucky enough to catch a viewing at the big screen again, almost three years after it hit cinemas, do not miss it. It's probably much more effective there than on a small screen.","6"
"cherold","Unwieldy movie, full of plot holes and unlikely scenes","1 October 2012","I had high hopes for a Ridley Scott movie that was a return to the style of Alien, but alas, Ridley seems to have forgotten how to make a tight, exciting, suspenseful film. Instead, Prometheus is ponderous and pretentious, with a poorly thought-out script that makes no sense from one moment to another. Whether it's David's impossibly quick way with alien technology, fearful crewmen inexplicably becoming fearless and foolhardy, or the changeable nature of an alien goo, little in this movie makes any real sense (although if you check the forums you will see fans desperately trying to prove that the movie is a paragon of logic).

Beyond that, it really isn't all that exciting. I never felt especially scared and only found one scene genuinely suspenseful. I generally had a strong sense of what would happen next. Underneath its pretentious, search-for-meaning-in-the-universe theme, it's a very by-the-book sci-fi flick that offers few surprises.

It's good looking, David is an intriguing, well-acted character and there are a few nice special effects. But this is an overblown mess, in almost every way the antithesis of Alien. While watchable, it was a huge disappointment.","5"
"curlyq818","Beautiful film, but I couldn't get past how dumb these characters are.","10 October 2021","Visually, this is beautiful. The SFX, the suits, the technology, the absolutely massive ship, the gorgeous scene when Android, David, is surrounded by a holographic map of the universe, even the engineers and aliens themselves. Everything is visually well-done, and unlike most, I'm actually not at all disappointed that it's not the same as Alien because I didn't expect it to be. That said, it's full of very smart people making very stupid decisions. Seriously, why are these smart characters so painfully dumb? It honestly killed the movie for me, but while this movie wasn't for me, the visuals alone make it worth watching and honestly, if you're not a writer in the entertainment industry like I am, then you probably won't be bothered at all, so please don't let me scare you away!!!! I really wanted to enjoy this movie, and thankfully there are people out there who are able to do that for me. If that's something you have the gift of being able to ignore, or not even notice to begin with, you don't even need to keep reading, just watch the film, and enjoy. If, however, you were also bothered by just how dumb these people are, keep reading to find out why I only gave this beautiful movie a six.

Elizabeth stupidly falls into the trope of saying ""it's a scientific exploration, so we don't need weapons"" when they're on an unknown planet looking for other life forms, and they have no idea how friendly those life forms are, let alone if there are any other unexpected dangers. Minutes later, it backfires, and a character even remarks that it was dumb that they didn't bring weapons. Two throw-away characters then stupidly run off because they get scared, and after they separate from the main group, they end up getting lost and, inevitably, left behind. It felt like watching Scooby-Doo. Captain, Janer, then stupidly leaves his post to go have sex with boss Vickers, and doesn't even bother telling anyone to stay and keep radio contact with the two people who are now stuck, and this is AFTER a censor reported another living thing in there with them. Of course, these throw-aways are killed (after several more stupid decisions on their part).

Scientist Charlie stupidly removes his helmet because there's air on the ship even though he has no way of knowing what types of viruses, spores, bacteria, etc could be in the air, and everyone else follows suit. It ends up being a dose of black goo David slips him that makes him sick, however. Even though he is aware he is sick, he still goes back again and doesn't let anyone know. He just watches as they all remove their helmets once again. He starts feeling sick but repeatedly tells everyone he's ""okay"" while simultaneously asking Elizabeth to figure out what's wrong with him, and they still don't have helmets on! Charlie also decides to stupidly get drunk immediately after returning to the ship the first time because he's upset that all of the engineers are dead even though not minutes before, Elizabeth discusses with another character that they've only been there a couple hours, so they have no way of knowing if they're all gone, and spoiler alert, they're not. While the other characters are examining a head that they found, he's practically laying on a pool table. He's meant to be a scientist, but after two hours on a completely new planet, he is getting drunk and throwing a tantrum because he didn't immediately find what he wanted. Elizabeth and Charlie stupidly decide to have sex the second they're alone (that's now four characters who go off to have sex in the middle of something important) instead of examining their finds, and one another, to make sure nothing dangerous made it back, which of course it did. On a third return to the ship, Elizabeth tells everyone that they need their helmets because it could've been something in the air that infected Charlie. The other characters stupidly refuse to listen, and for some reason, TWO MINUTES LATER, Elizabeth takes hers off too!

Elizabeth is extremely intelligent and manages to program the med chamber to give her a make-shift c-section, after it is tells her it is only programmed for males, by telling it to cut out a foreign body on her abdomen. You heard that right, in the year 2091, a ship that is run by a female has an extremely expensive med chamber in her room, but it's only designed to do procedures regarding reproductive organs on men......... wut? Seven decades in the future (8 since the film came out), there are medical devices on space ships that can travel across the universe run and crewed by women that aren't programmed for any female-specific medical needs. It's an excellent chance to show off Elizabeth's intelligence and quick-thinking, sure, but it is still a silly plot point because there's no logical reason that machine wouldn't be able to do a cesarean, and once again, it makes it even more confusing when Elizabeth herself then begins making more stupid decisions, which is a disservice to her character.

David brings back an object from the ship and doesn't sterilize it. He also begins pressing buttons and opening doors any time he is near them and touches every wet and/or goopy thing he sees. This is all in a ploy to make him seem overtly suspicious, but we're practically beaten over the head with it, which makes it fairly obvious that he isn't the main villain, so it's obnoxious watching this very obvious misdirect for an hour and a half instead of having a realistically intelligent robot who isn't rude, sometimes sadistically so, to the other characters for no reason while claiming to be emotionless.

When the characters realize the only way to save earth is to destroy the engineers' ship with their own, Janer gives Vickers a chance to run and disconnects the escape pos for her. She jettisons herself from the ship, and Janer disconnects the escape pod, which crashes because there's no pilot. She then makes a critical mistake while running from the engineers ship as it falls. Her character was shown to be intelligent, calculated, and self-interested on multiple occasions, so it makes no sense for her to do this. Once again, a disservice to a smart character. There's clearly no reason for this stupid decision other than plot purposes, which is obvious about four minutes later. The characters do the same thing we see in every other film when something large is about to fall on them. Instead of running to the side, Vickers and Elizabeth stupidly try to outrun the giant ship in the same direction that it's falling. The film seems to have zero self awareness of how dumb this decision is because moments later, Elizabeth falls and is able to roll out of the way and avoid being crushed by moving LITERALLY THREE FEET to the side, while Vickers keeps running straight and is crushed. Elizabeth makes the same mistake when the ship begins falling the other direction moments later, but thankfully isn't killed when the ship nearly lands on her because she's wedged against a rock.

These are some of the dumbest smart characters I've seen in a long time...","6"

"s_campanale","""Casino Royale"" for the Alien franchise - New direction but 80% of what makes the fun is missing","1 June 2012","We saw this film last night at a special midnight ""premiere"" at our local multiplex, with a packed crowd of Sci-fi and ""Alien"" fans. The tension and excitement was high. At the beginning the manager introduced the film but warned it ""wasn't like Alien"". 2 hours later the mood was quite ugly, as if a riot was about to break out, mainly because ""it wasn't like Alien"" This film suffers from the same problem all big hits do. They become so popular that they are then endlessly rehashed; to the point that people complain it's too formulaic and always the same. But when the creators then try to change it, or go in a different direction, the work is attacked for ""not being 'X' or 'Y' enough"". In many ways ""Prometheus"" is like 2006's ""Casino Royale"" – A back to basics origin story that lacks 80% of what made the series so popular, with a few little hints and name checks dropped here and there so that it can be said to be a ""Bond"" film even though it doesn't feel like one. So here we have effectively a re-run of the very first ""Alien"" – a near identical spaceship goes off to a distant planet, encounters an abandoned extra-terrestrial ship, finds something evil inside, crew is decimated, lone girl survives. However this one has NO ALIEN creature (save for one in the final moments) stalking the crew. Instead we have a couple of genetic mutations that might turn into Xenomorphs later, but look like zombies, some tentacle creatures, a 'body-hugger' (pre- miniaturisation facehugger) and the ""Engineers"". The ""Engineers"" are the films big new idea, the old Dannekin ""Chariot of the Gods"" extra- terrestrials that made/educated mankind, though they have been done so many times now in modern sci-fi that they are an immediate cliché. They are what were formerly called ""Space Jockeys"", that bizarre, disturbing creature piloting the crashed ship in ""Alien"" whose ossified corpse was one of the film's lasting mental images. Like Boba Fett, it was a throwaway background thing that took on a life of its own and was eventually granted an official backstory in the prequel. However, like Boba Fett, the official backstory is dull and kills all mystique. Turns out that strange, Elephant like creature we all tried to imagine as a living thing of flesh over those bones was just a spacesuit! Inside was a large white muscly man modelled on Mark Strong, our human progenitors no less, not exactly what we all secretly wanted to hear. They are a sort of ""angel"" who created mankind, but now seek to destroy, or supplant, us with the Xenomorph. ""Why?"" becomes the big question that propels the film's main heroine, Elizabeth Shaw, played by Noomi Rapace, a scientist who also has a strong Christian faith which directs her research. Contrary to popular myth, a good percentage of scientists are also religious, indeed science itself has always been fed by the religious impulse, and it is very refreshing to see faith not be treated with cheap contempt in a modern film. Shaw is the film's Ripley, though her toughness is of the interior rather than exterior kind: No weapons blasting or Alien fighting for her, rather it is the strength of her character and ideal that make her our heroine., and which lead her to continue her quest into the expected sequels. Michael Fassbender is excellent as the android David, though even he eventually proves to be less instrumental to the story than we first imagined. Charlize Theron is wasted as the slimy corporate type, as is Idris Elba as the jovial ship's captain. The rest of the cast barely make an impression, the total opposite of the usual ensemble cast of Alien films, and it isn't even clear who dies when and how. The special effects and the 3-D is brilliant, and makes the film a pleasing visual experience, rather like a large art instillation, but what the film lacks is narrative drive. It is as if they had taken the first part of the original Alien, then left out the second and third acts, making it the story of a group of people who land on a strange planet and find something, with a little bit of running around at the end. ""Alien"" motifs are deliberately dropped in to remind us we are watching one, like the opening conference (Aliens) the landing on LV233 (Alien) searching the Gigersque ship (Alien) Metal vials laid out like eggs (Alien) refusing the infected return (Alien) seeking safety in a pod then attacked (Alien 1-4) and the final radio message of hope (Alien 1- 4), but they are done so deliberately that they strike false, just namedrops to keep the fans happy. ""Prometheus"" tries to return to the pre-Star Wars sci-fi tradition that spawned the original film, the sci- fi of ideas and philosophy, big questions asked out there in the last unknown, but all it does is ask questions it then doesn't answer, saving those for sequels of the ""to find out tune in next week!"" variety. It takes out the Xenomorphs, the horror, the action, the chase, but puts nothing in their place. It is both a very bold film, for its ideas themes and visual splendour, but it is also not an ""Alien"" film, and not a very exciting or frightening one either, and it sets up answers we never get. It is definitely a film to see in a large cinema, and a pleasant experience, but radically alter your expectations or you will be like that riot mob last night baying for Ridley Scott's head!","7"
"tieman64","Phylogenesis","22 November 2014","""Behold, I stand at the door and knock."" - Revelations 3:20

A prequel to his 1979 film, ""Alien"", Ridley Scott's ""Prometheus"" opens with a homage to the opening shot of Stanley Kubrick's ""2001: A Space Odyssey"". Scott then treats us to a riff on Kubrick's ""Dawn of Man"" sequence. Here, on a prehistoric planet Earth, aliens known as Engineers kick-start the evolution of life. They do this by ingesting ""black goo"". This goo breaks down the Engineer's biomass and somehow ""spreads"" their own genetic code. As the Biblical Eve is spawned by God from Adam's rib, so to does all subsequent life on Earth spawn from the Engineer's body.

""Prometheus"" leaps ahead to the year 2089. Here, Christian scientist Elizabeth Shaw (Noomi Rapace) discovers several star-maps. These maps point to the distant moon of LV-223. Shaw believes that God is waiting there. Wealthy industrialist Peter Weyland harbours no such illusions. Aliens exist, they engineered humans, they live on LV-223, they have superior technology and he wants to meet them. Why? As he is dying, Weyland hopes to be granted immortality.

Weyland finances an expedition. The space vessel Prometheus will travel to LV-223 and make first contact with ""God"". The ship's name is fitting. In Greek mythology, Prometheus steals fire from Olympus - against the will of the Gods - for the benefit of humanity. This theft results in Prometheus enduring eternal punishment. Weyland's attempting a similar theft. Punishment awaits him as well.

After a great, distant shot of the Prometheus zipping across space – the ship resembles Joss Whedon's 'Serenity', plus an added pair of engine nacelles - ""Prometheus"" becomes increasingly stupid. Scott's ship is populated by annoying clichés, unbelievable characters and the usual slasher movie fodder. The revelations that Weyland is ""hidden amongst the crew"" and that one character, Meredith Vickers (Charlize Theron), is ""really Weyland's daughter"", are likewise cringe-worthy. A better director would have dropped Weyland and Meredith entirely from the plot. They add nothing.

On LV-223, the crew of the Prometheus discover an alien ship filled with vases. These vases house more black goo. When this goo comes into contact with indigenous worms, this results in the creation of slimy penis/vagina snakes. These penis/vagina snakes attack and kill several crew members. When the goo is ingested by sterile humans, though, a different process occurs, and squid-like creatures (Trilobites) are formed. A Trilobite later ""infects"" an Engineer, resulting in the birth of a bipedal xenomorph (Deacons) similar to the black aliens of Scott's first ""Alien"" movie. Deacons will presumably lead to Alien Queens and so Alien Eggs and so Alien Facehuggers and so Classic Aliens. The end result of such elaborate xenobiology is a bizarre revelation: the 1979 alien is the incestuous product of a human and a God. Shaw's even given her own freakish Immaculate Conception.

Late in the film, a character states the obvious: the Engineer's vases are weapons of mass destruction. Their target? Earth. Why? The Gods are angry at their creations, and so want to eradicate all humans. Why are they angry? The film doesn't say. Scott's early treatments make it clear: Jesus Christ was an Engineer, we killed him, and now Daddy's furious.

Sequels and prequels can't help but destroy the mysteries of their forefathers. In ""Prometheus"", almost everything alien about ""Alien"" (1979) is demystified. The strange horse-shoe spaceship of ""Alien"" gets turned into just another generic ancient temple (which crumbles in the last act, of course), the elephant-faced Engineers of 1979 turn into flute playing muscle-men, and the mysterious Weyland Industries turns into a bad joke. Elsewhere Scott tries to replicate the horror of his 1979 film, but hampered by a PG13 rating, his attempts are mostly impotent. People die, but nobody cares, and the film climaxes with a silly axe-battle, an uninvolving sacrifice and a giant-but-dull crash sequence. The film's only squeamish moment involves Shaw cutting a Trilobite out of her stomach. This Caesarean operation, or abortion, harks back to the iconic chest-burster sequence of the 1979 film, only here it's cynically reverse-engineered to both evoke a past moment and slip under a PG13 rating.

""Prometheus'"" execution may be poor, but its core idea is very good. The ""Alien"" franchise works best as a sick nightmare in which Gods, men and beasts infect, rape and torture wombs, bodies and minds. In ""Prometheus"", Shaw's character arc is worthy of Ingmar Bergman (""Cries and Whispers"", ""Winter Light""), the poor girl clinging to her faith in the face of a cosmos which is monstrous, predatory and concerned only with death and decay. This is best seen during a cheesy sequence in which Shaw and Weyland resurrect an Engineer. They expect to find a benevolent Creator who imparts love, knowledge and truth. Instead, in a scene lifted verbatim from 1951's ""The Thing"", they get a swift fist to the face. God wants you dead.

""We made you because we could,"" David (Michael Fassbender), an android, says. ""Can you imagine how disappointing it would be to hear this from your creator?"" David harbours malice towards his Gods, hates humans, in much the same way the Engineers are disgusted by their own spawn. When unobserved, David watches David Lean's ""Lawrence of Arabia"", a film about a maladjusted, homosexual man who is out of place amongst Europeans and Arabs.

Scott's always been interested in theology (""Conquest of Paradise"", ""Exodus"", ""Kingdom of Heaven""), and in interviews has outright called religion ""the biggest source of evil"". ""Prometheus"" ultimately ends on a note of optimism, though. In the film's best scene, Shaw hops aboard a spaceship and goes in search of the Engineer's creators. She has a crucifix around her neck and David's decapitated head in tow. Somewhere, out there, is the God of Infinite Regress. She will find Him, and she will knock on Heaven's Door.

"jmlawton","Dismal stuff.","4 July 2012","Well really it's all been said by others posting this sort of score, so rather than repeat that, let me try to get to the nub of why this film seems so terrible to me.

When I watch a science fiction film, I want internal consistency for the plot and the (pseudo)science and believable behaviours from the characters.

In Alien, for instance, we know why the crew are in space and so do they. We see that some of them are well educated and highly motivated - the officers and engineers, and some are blue-collar and motivated by money. In general their behaviours back up these characters. When the exploratory team leaves to investigate the alien ship, you really feel the environment, they act the way you think they might. When they come back with Kane and the ""face sucker"" there are sterile procedures which Ripley tries to enforce. We see how these get overridden, we believe.

There is none of this in Prometheus. Everyone is a cypher, from the ice blonde controller (who oh gosh is Wayland's daughter - didn't spot that coming)through the android to the gung-ho black pilot - who should actually have been chawin' a big ceegar like the top-sergeant in Aliens, to really stamp the card.

No one behaves logically in the face of any external threat, and there are bizarre holes in the pseudoscience for no apparent reason.

I said I wasn't going to list all the faults that others have done before me, but they are peppered throughout this atrocious ""B"" movie. Only worth 3* because of the visuals, but that's no reason to go and see it. In fact, I just demoted it to a 2*","1"

"Uriah43","The Prequel to ""Alien""","30 March 2021","This film begins with a humanoid being on another world drinking a black liquid substance from a small vial and immediately disintegrating into a nearby stream of water. The scene then shifts to an archaeological expedition in Scotland where two archaeologists named ""Charlie Holloway"" (Logan Marshall-Green) and ""Elizabeth Shaw"" (Noomi Rapace) discover some ancient pictures drawn on the walls of a newly discovered cave. They are particularly drawn to one which shows a human being pointing at what appears to be a group of stars in the night sky. To that end they quickly compare it to other similar images from other archeological finds elsewhere on earth and after further study realize that the pictures represent a map to another solar system from which human life originated. Needless to say, they immediately report their findings and soon an interstellar expedition is funded by the Weyland Corporation and launched directly for the only planetary object capable of supporting human life-the moon LV-223. On board the space vessel Prometheus is ""Captain Janek"" (Idris Elba), the corporate executive manager of Weyland Corporation by the name of ""Meredith Vickers"" (Charlize Theron), an android known as ""David"" (Michael Fassbender), as well as the two archeologists mentioned above and several members of the crew. Although supposedly a scientific venture, the two archaeologists soon discover is that both Meredith and David have two totally different agendas in mind and things begin to take on a completely aspect once they reach their destination. Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that I didn't particularly care for this film because the director (Ridley Scott) chose to spend an inordinate amount of time focusing on action and special effects which directly impacted the overall plot. To that effect, this prequel to ""Alien"" had numerous plot-holes with too few answers to the questions being offered. In short, it was a profound mess. That being said, while I have no doubt that there are some viewers who will enjoy this film based solely on the action and special effects, I found it to be much too confusing at times and for that reason I have rated it accordingly. Slightly below average.","4"
"alinadimafb","Not worth spending your time on","3 June 2022","If you are searching for a movie and you have nothing else to watch, I guess it works, Visually, it is great. The storyline, however, it is all over the place and it is chaotic.","3"
"tedg","Snowcrash","30 June 2012","It seems all the writing about this film is about the story, how it doesn't hold your hand and what religious metaphors are exploited. Well, that matters a bit because it elevates the thing out of the ordinary package. But a much more interesting way to think of this film is in terms of particles - how they build images and story elements.

There are many remarkable instances.

Chronologically first, we have the prologue to this prologue, a small film made independently of all else, and farmed out to dimensional experimentalists WETA. It is unlike anything that follows in many ways: nobility, flight of the camera, a blending of scale from planet to gene. There is only one element that carries over, and it is the notion of dustsized particle. This forms the cinematic base of all else that follows.

If you have not seen the film, an alien 'Engineer' ingests some nanosludge, and it breaks his body into trillions of particles that interestingly swarm as a group and each transform microscopically. This occurs next to a massive waterfall, a real place in Iceland. But it has extra renderings later in the scene: a mass of coherent froth and a swirling family of clouds.

The nanoagents swirl with (slightly more) energy than nature's vortices, and BANG, we have our main cinematic device. There is a story of sorts that this kicks off, and of course most people gnaw at that. Ridley wisely gives us only *particles* of that story, bits that leave a lot unexplained.

We'll see this particle notion many times, this particle as image notion. We'll see it first in the ordinary holographic display in the spaceship where an artificial man (after the fashion of Bladerunner's replicants) spies on a naive female scientist's dreams. (The basic vocabulary for cinematic holograms was set in the first Star Wars, and like so much in movieland, we stick with it whether it makes sense or not. It is a mix of glitter, snow and image — particles.)

We see it in both sides of the technology, human and engineer. The humans have an extraordinary mapping/visualization technology that displays using this fog/glitter particle imaging. The engineers have inexplicably made holograms of their actions that the replicant can replay. There are two of these, both extraordinary.

The first is handled in a way that only Scott could: he establishes a definition of space in ordinary, claustrophobic caves that all of a sudden is filled with these glittering particles which organize to give us a movie — a three d movie. We watch them watching it.

The second is so grand it challenges even Malick's recent masterpiece. This is a swarm of white particles that organize to give is the most elaborate and thrilling orrery in films. It serves the plot to tell us (some will explain) about engineers, seeding and planned destruction. But for me, it is a sort of triumph of the white nanoparticles over the black — of coherent vision over dreaming monsters.

Think I am reading two much of this? Consider the two actual films within. One is a hologram of the sponsor, explaining the purpose of the voyage. It is cleaner than the others, but still based on this fine glitter. See how the effects have the glitter move to form the images — as opposed to just being suspended fog on which an image is projected?

The other film here is an actual film, ""Lawrence of Arabia,"" who our replicant emulates. That movie was the first to photograph sand as a self-organizing society — one which defined an alternative cosmos to Lawrence. (The later ""Woman in the Dunes"" would elaborate on this.) Incidentally, it looked to me as if that inner film had been processed to be 3d.

This is the kind of thing Scott knows how to do, subtle and powerful. Look even at the one effect that was clearly added by funders to jazz up a section of the story. Our explorers race back to the ship to beat a storm of particles. This is an age old device, boring. The particles must be presented as benign because the planet (in most interpretations) has no consciousness. But even there, the particles swarm according to the patterns and vocabulary of that first segment.

Genius.

"malthenielsen","Characters were all off","1 June 2016","The movie has visuals going for it, as well as a setting that COULD have been used to make a good movie. This is why it is so frustrating it turned out so badly.

Worst of all are the characters. None of them make any sense.

The robot is experimenting on important crew members for no apparent reason. If he had picked one of the presumably expendable people with no name that are on the ship it would make a little sense. As for the first experiment - infecting Halloway, by making him drink alien goo - he doesn't even seem to care what the goo does to him, but looses interest in him. When he discover Halloway's girlfriend is impregnated by an alien embryo, he again for no clear reason decides to sacrifice her and keep the embryo. But when she manages to get the embryo-now-baby-monster, he simply doesn't care, and never inquires whatever happened to the embryo that was important enough to him to kill for. The baby is alive and well where he was left, but he never even goes into the room to bother to see if it's there.

His actions seem more like a sick person playing tricks on people because he is bored, and who moves on to something new when the trick is finished.

The biologist and geologist also just seem crazy. They freak out for no reason and leave their team - supposedly you would pick more cool headed people for such missions. After that the geologist forgets he is the map expert and has a 3D map, and the biologist tries to pet an alien snake and gets killed.

Weyland, the rich man funding everything, hides for no reason in the ship. There is no rational explanation why he keeps it a secret he is on the ship. I am assuming he is paranoid that someone will kill him for no reason, or maybe he just likes to surprise people?

Shaw seemingly forgets everything instantly. Her husband is out of her mind as soon as he is dead, and she never mentions to anybody that she just removed an alien embryo from her body. The only thing she remembers is her Cristian cross.

Vickers seem like an aggressive sociopath, with no plan and nothing in particular she wants out of the whole space travel project, except bullying her crew mates.

The two co-pilots seem strange and sort of sedated. They don't even react more vividly to being blown up for no reason.

The captain is the only character that is believable and at least seem like a normal human being.

The movie doesn't make sense having characters as these, as they are supposed to be an elite team of top scientists. The movie would have worked if they had adopted the ""Dirty Dozen"" plot, that mental patients and convicts get a chance to get a clean slate of they volunteer for a suicide mission in space. Alternatively, this could be an internal plot in Weiland's company - his colleagues want to kill him, so they manage to get him the worst crew they possibly can, to ensure he never returns from his mission. This would have made the movie work better, it would at one stroke have explained most of the erratic behaviour of the characters, and it would have been a chilling background story. As it is, it simply does not make any sense.","1"

Expecting to see some monstrous space alien from Aliens1/2 on a vicious killing rampage will most probably ruin Prometheus for you.

The characters do some dumb stuff, yes. I believe this was no accident or poor writing. Weyland funded this mission and needed the so called scientists to be, well, dumb, and not the best in their professions obviously. I believe Weyland knew all along that the time will come to sacrifice some crew members on this mission as experiments in his search for a cure to old age/more life. It was all about Weyland and he wouldn't have brought along scientists clever enough to quickly figure the Corporations true intentions. Weyland had David. What other true scientist would he have trusted more than this advanced android?

The dumbest survivor in the end decides to go on a suicide mission to where the engineer s came from. Yes , Shaw was a perfect candidate for Weylnds mission. No wonder she was impregnated with the Alien... And Weyland knew this. The creature was next door from his Chambers, growing, and tentacles banging on the walls making noise, hungry and looking for a feast. But yet still Weyland didn't kill it and let it grow.

That's a Riddley Scott film for you. So, i'll just focus on the character's behavior. Oh my, where to begin? - A team of misfits with severe behavioral problems chosen to be crew members on a trillion-dollar expedition. - a geologist that looks like a street mugger and smokes pot inside a space suit, panics at the first sight of a dead alien and then, being, of course, the person who maps the caves, gets instantly lost. - A retarded biologist that tries to pet a snake-like alien creature that is displaying blatantly obvious aggressive behavior. - Another retarded paleontologist that has no right to the name of scientist and comes up with the ""engineer"" theory based only on her personal feelings and religious beliefs. - Another retarded paleontologist that sees tentacles coming out of his eyes and hides the fact from everybody else for no reason at all. - An emotionless robot that displays sarcasm and a varied set of other emotions. - THE WORST SURGERY SCENE EVER SHOWN ON SCREEN OR OFF IT (by the way, displaying amazing lack of imagination and incredible ignorance; if the machine was programmed for males (supposedly, it's Wayland's), it should make a top-to-bottom incision, but it made a lateral incision, which is the one used in cesarean anyway. Also, no anesthetics from the supposedly standalone medical module (spray on skin does not count. And cauterizing and stapling to close the incision. Really, folks, that's just lack of imagination: they copied standard cesarean procedure, and made it a thousand times worse. If that's future medicine, I want none of it!!!) - Also, Shawn's inhuman resistance after the operation (the rest of the movie) is ridiculous. - They open the door of the ship to something that's obviously not human, from its posture (impossible to a human), just because it's wearing Fifield's suit?! - And then, the Engineers, the crowning imbeciles of all. Why did the engineer in the prologue have to sacrifice himself before the ship posturing as a sky god? Wouldn't just his blood with the black slime (which seems to create all kinds of life) work the same? - I don't care why they wanted to destroy humanity. That's one of the films' mysteries and it's OK. But why make a monster vector that implants other monsters inside people? That's stupid. A virus would work a lot better and be much more energy-saving to engineer (pardon the pun). - Why does the awakened engineer charges blindly at the humans? He only succeeds because they had no weapons with them (oh, yes, another thing we have to thank Shawn's imbecility for). And then, after his ship has been crashed by the tiny humans, he goes charging after Shawn blindly and with his bare hands, again!!!! The problem is that the characters are irrational and idiotic, when they should not be. They should be the cream of earth's scholars and scientists - remember, it's a trillion dollar mission to save Weyland's life. Why would he bet his life on imbeciles? And this never happens in good science fiction. but then again, I'm afraid those who think this is a good movie (aka good story, not good visuals, that you can get from a screen saver) have never read good science fiction, like Isaac Asimov, Arthur Clarke, Robert Heinlein, Philip K. Dick, or Howard Philips Lovecraft (who mixes sci-fi and horror very well in his stories), and so many others that were REAL writers, not just people who put words together. However, I haven't read the movie's original script yet. After I do, I'll find out whether the rumors that Scott messed with it are true, and discover that he has really embraced religious idiocy and bad Hollywood clichés. But after Blade Runner he hasn't made a really good movie - except visually, they are all stunning. 1492 is so bad that he didn't even research history. People had known the Earth wasn't flat since the Middle Ages, and, in some cases, before that! This is just current-day cliché from the historically-illiterate. So, I'm afraid Alien and Blade Runner are fortunate accidents and the rest of his opus just shows that the Congress should approve an act forbidding Riddley Scott from messing with film scripts or even choosing them. Just direct them they way they are, and everything will be fine. That law should also apply to James Cameron, with an addendum forbidding him to write his own scripts. Same case as Scott, only worse.","1"
"The-Sarkologist","I preferred AVP as a prequel.","24 June 2012","To be honest I really do not know what to make of this movie. The special effects were brilliant, especially the landing sequence, but it was simply too much of a remake of Alien. In fact it was almost as if the writer had taken the script of Alien, make some changes to it, and called it Prometheus. Okay, it was probably less like Alien than that, but considering that the director of this film also directed Alien, and that the film was the long awaited prequel then I guess it is not surprising.

The film is supposed to be about the beginnings of the Wayland Corporation, the entity that, while not necessarily a bad guy, does cause numerous problems for Ripley in the later films. Basically some archaeologists have uncovered some patterns that appear among many of the ancient cultures around the wrong, wrongly conclude that it is an invitation (I though that scene sucked) and then go off on a spaceship to find out what is at that location.

I guess the movie is a philosophy of the origins of humanity though, once again, it seemed as if it was borrowed from Lovecraft. Humanity came about when a race known as the Engineers, released some DNA into the Earth's water supply with kickstarted the evolutionary process that resulted in humanity. However, unlike Lovecraft, the creation technically was not a mistake, it is just that humanity did not turn out the way that they expected it to.

There are hints that suggest that Christ was actually one of these Engineers that was sent to Earth to attempt to reform humanity, however humanity pretty much killed him, so it is suggested that the Engineers decided that humanity was not worth saving, however before they could go out to destroy them something happened and they ended up getting themselves all killed.

This idea, while quaint, I have to admit ignores a number of facts, such as the bible actually saying that Jesus had to die to be able to move humanity to that next level. Many people seem to misinterpret the biblical record to suggest that Jesus was more like Socrates in that his teaching rubbed one to many people up the wrong way. Well, it is true, his teaching did, and it is true that they went out of their way to look for a way to kill him, but I guess the whole free will and predestination idea ends complicating things to no end.","6"
"differentbutsimple","Do androids dream of better scripts?","14 June 2012","Prometheus is a pretentious, well acted, poorly scripted pile of wan*.

I entered this film with diminished expectations after hearing a few bad reviews but my expectations were not diminished enough. I had been expecting a slower more thoughtful film than Alien or its successors, but what I had not been expecting was a insipid, vacuous plot full of asinine characters.

The story takes a plunge right from the start into the big questions; on a seemingly primordial earth a suicidal alien (one of the Engineers or Space-Jockeys as they were known from Alien) commits suicide by drinking some black-goo on the edge of a waterfall and tumbles into the water where his DNA is deconstructed and then recombined by the goo.

Later in Scotland, with a plot device straight out of 1994's Stargate: ancient paintings are found from different cultures around the world all depicting a race of aliens (Engineers) and a constellation of stars with which to find them. This finding propels a crew of scientists across the galaxy in search of the depicted aliens and is bankrolled my mega-corp Weyland represented by the inhuman Vicars and the grown-up AI David. The science team is led by the archaeologists who found the drawings presumably because experts in ancient human art will be immeasurably useful for a first contact! But wait, there is an explanation here, they are proponents of an idea that people were created by these aliens (Engineers) and share some kind of common culture with them. David the android is then given the task of deciphering the roots of every language on Earth while the others whisk across the galaxy so that he can communicate with the aliens (Engineers) on arrival.

The big picture here is a particular take on Panspermia - in this case with an emphasis on the 'sperm' - with giant white, suicidal, elephantine helmeted aliens (Engineers) taking on the roll of the architects and creators of life. (I suppose it's not that much more ridiculous than a black box.) So with that big question out of the way in the first 5 minutes of the film we are left with a number of further questions: is our creator god, who created our creator, how does our creator feel about us? And the answer is: who cares? The problem with the rest of the film is that these kind of big questions need to be handled intelligently not penned in crayon. Just throwing questions at the audience with smattering of mythology does not an intelligent, engaging film make. But the biggest obstacle here is that the characters are just unbelievably stupid. Like their mothers were drunk the whole way through pregnancy stupid. The characters are more stupid then the characters in AVP:R, more so since the characters in AVP:R are supposed to be stupid teenagers, these are supposed to be scientist on a trillion dollar expedition to a new planet to find the origins of life.

Probably the quickest way to convey the unremitting catalogue of idiotic decisions taken by the characters is to list the good decisions made, so here it is: Vicars the supposed bad character wants to quarantine the definitely infected character outside the ship. That's it - one good decision! That left me with more fondness for her than the rest of the cast.

The rest of the crew are a bunch of helmet removing, location forgetting, black-goo swigging, door opening, infection hiding, snake petting imbeciles. Which brings me back to the Engineers. When the crew finally meet one in the flesh it turns out he is not a benign creator but a wrathful one. And frankly at this stage I would be as well. If I had put in the effort to create and nurture a new race I would be inconsolably pi**ed off that they had turned out that inane. From this point forward I was hoping that the Engineers would take off and bomb the Earth out of existence for everyone's sake.

Aliens has always relied on a certain amount of sexual queasiness to create its visceral shock, but it has always been a suggestion; in Prometheus it's out there. ""How do you know it's a girl?"" The reason I ask because it looks like a fricking giant pulsating dong! With the amount of shock moments delivered through betentacled oral penetration and gnashing vaginal consumption I began to worry Ridley Scott had decided to produce 'shokushu goukan'. But really it was the clumsiness with which all of this was handled that shocked me.

Honestly I am surprised by the lack of critical response on the IMDb for this mess. I have seen some serious mental somersaults and post hoc rationalisation being undertaken by the fanboys such as ""the characters are supposed to be stupid. Weyland deliberately hired idiots because he wasn't interested in the successful outcome of the expedition."" Seriously? He decides to fly across the galaxy with a crew of idiots; is that not the plot of Coneheads? The current high IMDb rating reminds me off the high rating of the Phantom Menace shortly after release. In the end you'll be out on your own having given the Phantom Menace 10 out of 10 stars.

I can only imagine it will only be a matter of time before Damon Lindelof's name becomes toxic; I look forward to that day.

It generates a lot of expectations but never follows through. It talks about this mysterious race supposed to have engineered mankind, thus supposed to be of a superior intelligence and it keeps us in expectation of the dialog between it and the humans and the answering of their interrogations, such as ""why did they create us"", ""why did they want to destroy us"".

"Furious77","Do they have negative stars?","18 September 2012","This flick is the worst of every horror and SyFy flick ever made, all the stupid people, with all of the fake plot points, and all of the lazy plot points to drive the flick along on it's path of crap.

One thing that really rubs me the wrong way about this flick was the usage of overly dark scenes to hide crappy props, scenes and CGI. This technique went out years ago when CGI got to the point that it didn't need to hide anymore and still appear present in the scene and not overlaid. Give the audience some credit that even if it's obvious CGI, let them SEE the scene, otherwise what was all this time, money and energy spent for, if not to show it off with some flashlights that are more powerful than the cheap door prize toys they give away at children's birthday parties.

Also, could the writers really not think of anything for the aliens motivation beyond some imagined second guessing on their part? This flick does not deserve the genre of sci-fi, it should be eternally relegated to the crappy category of d-list horror flick that kills everybody off because they are stupid, along with all the people that die while trying to clean the mess up, because they were too stupid to know they were traveling across the universe with a complete retard that somehow managed to build one of the largest, most far reaching, powerful companies, yet he can't manage to hire some competent underlings to crew his trip.

Watch this flick if it is free and you do so without reporting back to the studios in any way that you watched it i.e. cable, satellite, theater, rental, Netflix, Hulu, so they don't think this movie has a satisfied audience that is telling others to watch it. For some reason, this flick has a high rating here on IMDb, must be all the idolaters that bow down at the temples of Ridley Scott, H.R. Giger, or the Alien franchise and can't comprehend how much of a pathetic disappointment this is and how to express their dismay that this steaming pile of dog poo was made in such a lame excuse for a Syfy bargain basement idea, with an Independence Day budget.

This rant may ramble, but I write this immediately after watching this disaster and it's going to take my mind a nights rest to reorganize following this colossal let-down.","1"
"dierregi","A rehash of Alien, minus the cat","1 June 2012","Throughout the years I came to consider Alien and Blade Runner more as exceptions than as standard Ridley Scott masterpiece productions. Therefore, I did not have high expectations for Prometheus.

Nevertheless, it was with some anticipation that I joined a crowded audience for the premiere of Prometheus in Brussels. I watched online the promotional ""teasers"" about ""David"" and about the fictional 2023 speech for TED, delivered by Guy Pierce (as Peter Weyland) and I was hoping for some new concepts to be developed.

Turns out, those two teasers were – almost – the best part of the movie. I cannot but agree with most other reviews so far. Great photography and CGI, poor story.

The movie opens with an enigmatic sequence about DNA merging, which is left unexplained. What follows is a rehash of the Alien plot. Namely: assorted crew sent for an undisclosed mission; mysterious android who might have a hidden agenda; spunky heroine; a hasty exploration leading to infiltration of alien material; dire events that cause the extinction of almost all the crew does that remind you of Alien or I am biased? Only this time there are no pets on board and I really miss the cat Jones.

The distinctive qualities of Prometheus are few. The crew is supposed to explore the planet from which humankind originated, thanks to alien ""Engineers"". I guess this should be the great twist – looking for the creator rather then stumbling upon the destructor. Unfortunately the development and outcome are very similar to Alien, with zero depth attached to the philosophical quest.

Frankly laughable, even at fictional level, the way the so-called scientists explore the alien artifacts and analyze the samples they collected. Indeed, some of the scenes cause unintentional amusement When the spaceship lands, even if the ""scientists"" are told there are only few hours of daylight left, they rush out like children to investigate the alien ""building"". Once inside, they touch everything around them, sticking their fingers everywhere. Two of them manage to get lost, even if they are carrying very sophisticated directional equipment...

Worth mentioning a creepy scene of the Engineers escaping along dark corridors and the tri-dimensional space map (as mentioned, the visual part is terrific). Also the enigmatic android David. He is truly the star of the movie, and it is not a good sign when an android is the most interesting ""character"" of a movie. The Rapace character – ""scientist"" Elizabeth Shaw – is not so successful.

If you saw Alien you might not be so impressed by Prometheus. Perhaps young audience will like it better, but what I start to find tiring in the Alien universe is that we still have no clue about how all this started or is going to end. And sometimes closure is really needed.","5"
"davidmvining","I don't care what you say, this movie is great.","26 November 2019","Out of all the opinions I've expressed about film, my love of Ridley Scott's Prometheus is probably the one that I receive the most grief over, and I do not care. I've seen this movie seven times now, and I love it as much after the seventh viewing as I do after the first. This movie is great.

It's about searching for truth and the nature of faith. I think it meshes well with the ideas behind Close Encounters of the Third Kind, though they would make an odd double feature being so different in style and tone. Any actual answers that the movie offers (which are few) are beside the point. The point isn't the answers themselves, but the searching for them is what is important.

The crew of the eponymous Prometheus is travelling trillions of miles into deep space chasing a series of cave drawings that seem to be an invitation to the home of the Engineers, giant beings who may have had a hand in the creation of human life. Funded by Peter Weyland, a man who speaks to the crew in the form of a hologram message, the ship is out with the mission to find the answers to our existence. Why do we exist? To what purpose were we created? These existential questions are woven into the fabric of the whole movie. Elizabeth Shaw, the main character, is looking for the same answers to the same questions but from a different point of view. She comes at it from a point of faith. Her boyfriend, Charlie, is a man of the moment with little concern for the metaphysical. Vickers, the company woman in charge of the mission, has no concern for the questions at hand.

What drives the movie and the characters within it is the question of what do you do when you receive an answer? At the sight of the Engineers' fate under mysterious circumstances, Charlie instantly gives up. He keeps hoping for something, but he sees the Engineers' end as an end to the question. Vickers is simply relieved and hopes to go back home, her immediate question answered. Shaw, though, is invigorated. She doesn't see the Engineers' dead bodies as an end, but as just the next step in her journey. She's invigorated by the search itself. Even much later, after everything has broken down, Shaw's been through massive trauma and an improvised surgery, she's still demanding further answers.

It's the contrast between Shaw and Weyland that really works for me. Weyland (hidden away on the ship in his own separate cryo-tube) comes out and demands answers not for his own edification, but in an attempt to extend his own life. Shaw wants answers from the same source, but it's more in line with a scientific inquiry. That she is the most religious of the scientists there provides an interesting juxtaposition that one might not expect. Taking the actions of the film on a moralistic vein, everyone is punished for how they approach the search for truth, but only Elizabeth Shaw is spared. Everyone else thinks the answer is the point, but only Shaw realizes the journey itself is the point.

This movie, though, isn't a drama, it's a horror film, and I feel that the horror ties into the central ideas rather well. The literal source of horror is the weapons the Engineers created, but the weapon seems to follow no logic, only producing destruction and aggression in its wake. I think that's the point, though. The Engineers created a weapon they couldn't control (with an implication that they created humanity and they couldn't control us either) and it wiped them out. The characters' search for answers will never get answered in the same way that the weapon will never provide an easy answer to its methods. The purpose is the aggression and unpredictability, not its final form. The audience and the characters never know what's going to come next just like the answers to the questions are never going to come, only leading to more questions.

Visually, I think this might be Ridley Scott's best looking film. I love the look of Alien, the recreation of ancient Rome in Gladiator, and the general gorgeousness of Exodus: Gods and Kings, but it's the alien landscape, the green/blue color scheme, the overall gritty feel, and the huge sets that sell this movie so completely for me on a visual level. I think Scott's one of the premiere visualists currently working, but everything gels here in one package that I just adore.

The movie overall is visceral and thematically weighty. It's a thrilling ride into interesting questions that are designed to have no answers with a horror element that ties in with the ideas at play. I love this movie.","10"
"Hellmant","A masterpiece that will be examined and analyzed as classic science fiction always should be for many decades to come!","12 June 2012","'PROMETHEUS': Five Stars (Out of Five)

Director Ridley Scott's long awaited prequel to his classic 1979 sci-fi horror film 'ALIEN'. The film is not a traditional prequel as it takes the popular franchise in an entirely new direction and actually does very little towards building towards the first 'ALIEN' film. It does set up a possible new prequel trilogy (if the films continue to do well financially) and I think this prequel series will be a lot more interesting and fan pleasing than George Lucas's. The film was written by Damon Lindelof (head writer and co-creator of 'LOST') and Jon Spaihts and stars Noomi Rapace (the original 'GIRL WITH THE DRAGON TATTOO'), Michael Fassbender, Charlize Theron (in another deliciously villainous role, following 'SNOW WHITE AND THE HUNTSMAN' just last week), Idris Elba and Logan Marshall-Green. The movie is nothing like what I was expecting and is an incredibly lot to digest but I can say it's without a doubt a masterpiece that will be examined and analyzed as classic science fiction always should be for many decades to come.

Rapace stars as Shaw and Marshall-Green co-stars as her lover Charlie Holloway, a team of archaeologists who find a 'star map', in a cave on Earth in 2089, that they see as an invitation to meet mankind's makers. They find funding for an expedition, from the elder CEO of Weyland Corp. (Guy Pearce), and begin a mission to a far away moon named LV-223 (where they believe the map is taking them). They travel in cryofreeze aboard a spaceship called Prometheus, while being watched over by an android named David (Fassbender), and arrive at their destination in 2093. The crew is awakened and Shaw and Holloway inform them of their goal, to an uneasy response of course. They then enter a large structure they land next to on the moon and what they find inside changes the world and life as we know it forever more.

The movie is full of biblical references and high concept philosophical ideas. I found it to be quite a new and original take on the 'where do we come from' story premise; kind of like a science fiction version of last year's 'THE TREE OF LIFE'. It asks a lot of questions that it doesn't answer but that's in large part because it's waiting for the sequels to do that. I look forward to them and really hope James Cameron writes and directs the next one (or maybe co-writes it with Lindelof). Cameron had a strong interest in doing the original prequel several years ago but when the studio opted to do an 'ALIEN VS. PREDATOR' film instead he thought it would forever kill the validity of the series and gave up hope. The script is brilliant, thanks in large part to Lindelof's rewrite. Originally it was written as just a straightforward prequel but then Scott and Lindelof decided to do something different with it, which ultimately disappointed a lot of the die-hard horror monster movie fans. Classic 'thinking man' sci-fi fans will love it though. Scott's directing is superb and the visuals are astonishing (the 3D works beautifully as well). It's a little too serious and cold but characters like Elba's 'Janek' do liven the film up. Fassbender probably gives the best performance of the movie in the most interesting role but Rapace does rival Sigourney Weaver as the action heroine lead. Of course Theron is beautiful and superb once again as well. The characters aren't quite as developed or likable as Cameron's 'ALIENS', which is one of the reasons that film is my favorite of the franchise. I'd put this one right up there with the original though. It's one of those movies that creates a ton of conversation and leaves a lot for the viewer to think about (you always have to give a film a lot of credit for that!). Scott's return to sci-fi should please any true fan as well as fan's of the franchise. Let's hope they do something equally impressive for the next installment.

"simonw70","In space no one can hear you groan","6 January 2014","Having watched Prometheus several times now, hoping that it would get better with repeated viewing, I can say that were it not for the excellent Michael Fassbender, this movie would have no redeeming features of any kind.

It's ironic that the only character in the entire movie that isn't completely one dimensional happens to be an android. Noomi Rapace who plays the only other reasonably fleshed-out character, Doctor Elizabeth Shaw, manages to make her character so whiny and unlikeable that I think the movie would have benefited by her being killed off along with everyone else.

Every single other character is simply a non-entity, with nothing of interest to say (or worse). The script really is awful. The concept, that scientists journey to an alien planet to find the answers to the ultimate questions of mankind's existence (and it all going wrong), is an interesting one. But the finished product is more like a parody of that concept than a serious attempt to realize it. What would happen if a bunch of hopeless morons went to meet their makers, and their makers turned out to be genocidal maniacs who kill on sight? That's Prometheus in a nutshell. It might be fine if it were supposed to be a tongue-in-cheek comedy. But it's not. Not intentionally anyway.

In addition to that, basically, what we have here is a clumsy attempt by Ridley Scott to shoehorn a backstory into the appearance of the ""spacejockey"" creature which was shown in the first ""Alien"" film and possibly an explanation of the genesis of the xenomorph creature itself. And it simply doesn't work. This is to ""Alien"" what ""The Phantom Menace"" was to ""Star Wars""... it completely undermines the mythology and contradicts itself.

The admittedly beautiful visuals are not enough to save this movie from the contrived plot, awful acting, disposable characters, and just plain silliness. In fact, it's only Michael Fassbender who single-handedly saves Prometheus from being completely unwatchable garbage. His character, David, is so apart from the other characters in the movie and the only one you have any sympathy for. Was this some genius masterstroke by Ridley Scott? Some kind of sub-text? Considering the clumsiness of everything else in the movie, I seriously doubt that this was the original intention. I think that it is simply Fassbender himself managing to pull something meaningful out of this awful mess of a movie. Any kind of perceived depth in the plot is just wishful thinking on the part of the viewer. After a few viewings, you'll notice the continuity errors that prove it once and for all. The people making this movie either had no idea what they were doing or didn't care.

This is a movie that does not know what it is trying to be, and it ends up being nothing except something to ridicule. The big questions it leaves you with are not ""where did we come from?"" but ""how much did people get paid to make this?"" and ""why didn't people notice how bad the script was?""","2"
"yannreckless","Piece of Art","10 January 2021","All about this movie is genius and excellence. Special effects, casting, acting, sound, atmosphere, realness, second-to-none sense for details. With Prometheus, Ridley Scott didn't make a movie, he made an intemporal gift : intense, sharp, generous, dreamy piece of art. Thank you.","10"
"necron99","What happened?","22 June 2012","I anticipated the release of this movie for a long time. I really enjoyed Alien and Aliens and was looking forward to his one by Ridley Scott, who directed one of my favorite movies Blade Runner. With that being said i must way I hated this film for so many reason I needs to use bullet point but won't.

SPOILERS: THE film starts out good enough, interesting landscapes, great picture quality, and a great performance by Fassbender (droid) alone on the ship for two years learning about various civilizations. The movie starts to go go downhill within 10 minutes unfortunately.

The most annoying aspect of the film is the behavior of the characters. The droid has malicious intent unlike in previous franchise films, and poisons someone just to see what happens. Half of the crew are not introduced, and the half that are are limited to only speaking a couple of lines.

Once inside the alien vessel/structure all of a sudden it is OK to take off your helmets in a strange new world. The android is all of a sudden an expert in how to open doors and use their weird control pads. LETS BRING NO WEAPONS OF ANY KIND TO THIS STRANGE ALIEN STRUCTURE. Holograms from the eighties just pop up of giant guys running for their lives. By the way, huge baby-face giants are not scary, neither are tiny squids that can be born 10 hours after conception. They take samples and never really examine them, except for the large head they decide to re-animate for the hell of it. Oh yea, heads explode for no given reason. So is it an infection?

Is it worm like things that grow out of the ground? Does the infection make human heads explode or turn you into a baby-face giant engineer guy? Two dudes get lost, come across a worm like thing, and decide it is best to pet it like it was a cat or something. This is despite these two guys were the cowards leaving early in the initial exploration. Oh yea, the captain abandons the monitor of them in order to bang Theron, who is merely eye candy in the film. There are also two co-pilots, one of which is Benedict Wong who was great in Sunshine, but all their dialogue relates to a stupid bet. There are also a bunch of mercenaries on board, and you never know what happens to the last two. One minute three of them are helping Mr Weyland, the next minute two of them are never seen again. What is with Guy Pierce doing small roles in films? (The Road, Hurt Locker, etc) Why not just get a genuine old guy to play the part? The main female lead escapes the other scientists to have her alien baby removed. She survives this graphic ordeal and NOBODY chases or looks for her. She just re-joins the crew LIKE NOTHING HAPPENED and nobody says, ""hey what happened to the baby?"" ""You had the machine cut it out of you?"" This would be a major interest for scientists but I guess this crew thinks it is NO BIG DEAL.

There was no sense of dread, thrill, or excitement to be had watching this film. She gives birth to a squid, the squid becomes a giant face-hugger like thing, attacks the giant baby-face guy, and this giant guy has a traditional alien explode out of him. There is no real ACTION sequences. The most climatic thing is when the one scientist asks Theron to burn him, oh wait that was not exciting either.

Another ridiculous thing is when two co-pilots just volunteer to die to pilot a craft into the aline vessel that is leaving. Like the captain wasn't enough. IT ISN'T LIKE THE SHIP COULD FLY ITSELF AT ALL. Is there anything like cruise control or targeting of any kind, let say after 2089?. Lets lift our hands up and gladly die to crash this spaceship. As Hudson would say, ""you can count me out!"" Woops I assumed this movie would be intelligent to a certain degree and I was dead wrong.

Wow, long review. Rent this one if you are curious but not worth the hype. 4/10 due to Fassbender performance and great special effects.","1"
"Robin_clarke41","Duped again on the promise of a good Alien/s movie","4 June 2012","Let me start by saying I like to think of myself as a reviewer for the average Joe. I.E I'm not into art-house movies, contemporary foreign movies or generally movies that it's 'hip' to like but the average guy would be bored to tears with. That said let me let you know my feelings on Ridley Scott's latest offering Prometheus. To be fair I actually enjoyed the start and it showed great promise for what was to follow. Beautiful cinematography and an introduction to the ships android David were well executed and tee'd up the film ready for something great. However this is the point where it all fell apart for me. We see Noomi Rapace introduced as the strong, intelligent heroine and Logan Marshall-Green as her sidekick/partner. There are then a string of what I like to think of as 'random' characters thrown in to the mix. For instance I still have no idea what Charlize Theron's character's purpose was or what she was doing there? We have a captain that doesn't seen to care about anything and can't even fly his own ship (as pointed out by one of his own crew members!). There are then other characters that are just there to fill space. Remember the scenes in Alien and Aliens (see my Aliens review) where the crew mix in the canteens? They had a realistic feel to them and interacted with each other in a natural and almost (for us) voyeuristic way. This not only heightened the tension but made us care for these 'real' people. Sadly on Prometheus we have none of that, characters forcefully spit out their dialogue (often inappropriate for the situation) and as a consequence you never really care if they live or die. Then we come to what should be the star if the show, the aliens - I mean after all however you dress this up it's an Alien movie right?! That in my opinion is its greatest failing. The large, plastic looking, humanoid creatures are far more at home on a Sci-fi channel Saturday movie than a multi-million dollar blockbuster. They look ridiculous. As for the tension, terror, suspense we were treated to in the aforementioned Alien movies, Prometheus is completely devoid of that. It takes almost an hour before anything of note happens and even then it's such a non-event it leaves you looking at your watch wondering how long is left. Like the rest of the film the ending is just as poor and again leaves you feeling no empathy with the lead character or concern for her situation. Alien movies aside and judging this film in its own right as a Sci-fi, action blockbuster actually does it a dis-service as the promise of some kind of link to the other Alien movies is all I found myself hoping for all the way through as it's ploy to be 'original' is so flawed. With the talent on hand from the director, actors, effects makers and writers, not to mention the licence to use the Alien franchise this film should have been nothing short of amazing. Instead what we were presented with was a boring, confused, badly written (and in place acted) mish-mash of very amateur looking scenes. My plea to Hollywood..Please give the fans what they want next time (see the Avengers) and don't let over-zealous directors dictate a film into becoming a shining example of how not to do cinema such as Prometheus.","1"
"moonmonday","A Z-Grade Film With An A-List Budget","6 November 2012","Prometheus is probably the largest-budget piece of garbage I've ever seen. It does an amazing job of wasting otherwise capable talent and proves, beyond a shadow of a doubt, that whatever skill Ridley Scott had in crafting the original Alien film was magic that worked once and once only.

The only character played with any degree of aptitude is the woefully underused Vickers, portrayed perfectly by Charlize Theron. But like most all of the cast, the viewers aren't given a chance to get to know the characters except in the most superficial way, and the characters the script inexplicably concentrates on are the least interesting and poorest-acted, namely Shaw and Holloway. Vickers should have been the heroine of the film; if they have any sense, they'll find some way to sidestep (pun intended) and bring back her character if they do a sequel...which I sincerely hope they won't, but fear they probably will anyway.

Michael Fassbender's David is attractive in his own way, but also underdeveloped even though most of the scenes revolve around him...inexplicably. He has an attractiveness that makes the viewer want to like him and be interested in him, but there's not a lot in the script for the talented actor to work with...and thus, we're left with only his natural charm, which is stunted in the awkward role, with a walk that looks constantly like his underpants have crept up the cleft of his buttocks.

No character acts sensibly or logically, no-one has any clear or reasonable motivation, and none of them is given enough time to develop so that we as viewers care at all about whether they live or die. In fact, this is such a low grade of film because of its amateurish attempt at portraying characters; we simply do not care. It is impossible to sympathise with anyone (aside from Vickers, if only because she actually believes in taking realistic precautions), and the story unfolds at a snail's pace and then ends up never resolving a single plot point that it introduced during its superfluous length.

The monsters are afterthoughts, and very poorly-designed to have allegedly taken advantage of Giger. The whole thing is a huge mess and proves quite ably that a giant budget and a 'name' director are not enough to save a plodding mess of a script that apparently didn't go through any revisions past a first draft. It's a shame that better films often don't receive the green light or a fraction of the budget that Prometheus did, and Prometheus still was terrible, fakey-looking (even in the scenes that weren't filled with CGI, despite Scott's claims) and cheap.

I didn't believe the reviews could be right in how harsh they were, but this really is one of the worst films I have ever sat through, without exaggeration. I have watched films that were bad but tried much harder, and I have watched films that were good but had less resources. There is no excuse for a film with this one's pedigree and budget to be as awful as it is, and thus it deserves a harsher judgement.

Prometheus is a turd, and not even a polished one. It's a first-draft, barely passable mess that isn't saved by its handful of good actors, because actors can only do so much with a lacking script, and even good actors flounder with a lousy director, as Scott has proved he is.

Avoid this. And hope that a sequel is not approved.","2"
"tendobear","All Style, No Substance","7 January 2013","Really disappointed to say the least - I was expecting something epic and mythical to add to the canon of Alien and Aliens. Looks like Scott was trying too hard and tried to juggle too many ideas at once; so the end result is a mish-mash of half-baked ideas and red herrings - just when you think you know what direction the movie's taking and you think you've got it sussed, Scott will throw in another random idea that's unrelated to the other plot points before it that'll take the whole thing in a different direction. You'll be left wondering how the characters went from one plot point to another, for example; at what point did Idris Elba and his crew actually realise the danger they're in and the imminent threat to humanity that they become so heroic as to sacrifice themselves? They were hardly involved! What was the purpose of Charlize Theron's character?? How the hell did the dead Engineer get from the shuttle wreckage back to his own ship to position himself for the start of Alien? Overall, stunning visuals but this is a confused, mediocre effort.","4"
"flute_ian","Needs to flesh-out characters","4 July 2012","I can't say I enjoyed this film with the main reason being the issue of character development, or more accurately the lack thereof.

The priority was to tell the basic story, OK, which answered questions re: Alien.

But an opportunity was missed. The film could have been 'humanized' (so to speak) with more emphasis on the personal relationship of the scientist-duo protagonists.

An opening scene could have had them at home attempting to conceive to the sounds of Chopin, and to get the time, edit out the unnecessary scientist-security guy lunchroom bit. (And that would have given the credits-music a pay-off.)

The characters are trotted out and portrayed one-dimensionally so who cares about them? Therefore the movie has no 'grip'.

Not that some of them don't have a degree of credibility: the trillionaire CEO isn't exactly the brightest fellow but this is not surprising as he has wasted his life focused on money-making so his fate fits. But the lack of storyline redemption for some of the others further adds to a sense of coldness-who cares about this project.

One of the shoot-em-up scenes is simply an irrational butcher shop.

3D would have helped at least in the visuality, which was OK, but the film needs anything in the way of elements to try to fill this void of characterization. With Creature of the Black Lagoon as the roots of 3D and with our greenies sliming about in the soup why not set it up for the glasses?

If you are an Alien devotee then you will likely make the effort to get out of the house to the theater to see this one, but for anyone else I don't see the point of doing so.","5"
"zkonedog","More Aesthetic Than Depth, But Not As Bad As Its Rap","22 March 2021","1979's ""Alien"" gained a cultural foothold (spawning numerous sequels) as sort of defining the bleak, depressing space movie aesthetic. The anti-Star Wars, if you will. 30+ years later, director Ridley Scott returned to that universe with this quasi-prequel ""Prometheus"". Though not nearly deserving of the extremely poor reception it received at its premiere, this is a film that largely features visual aesthetic over character depth--when it would have been so easy to have both.

For a very basic overview, ""Prometheus"" tells the story of a deep space exploration mission that may help determine no less than the origins of human life. Ostensibly led by scientists Elizabeth (Noomi Rapace) and Charlie (Logan Marshall-Green), the crew quickly discover that ship leader Meredith Vickers (Charlize Theron) may have an entirely different goal in mind. Android David (Michael Fassbender) also harbors an agenda that may be questionable to all sides.

The look of ""Prometheus"" is tremendous and it is built on an epic scope/scale. While not my favorite film of all-time, ""Alien"" did a remarkable job of conjuring creepy creatures/locales, and this movie follows aptly in those footsteps.

All the characters too, for the most part, are built upon an interesting premise. The nature of faith/religion is a constant theme, as is the joy/terror of a potential ""first contact"" with non-human life. In other words, pretty heady stuff. Truth be told, the themes of ""Prometheus"" are higher-shooting than anything in ""Alien"".

The biggest ""problem"" (depending on your goals/perspective) with this film, however, is that it plays too coy with its ""prequel/sequel status"" and ends up overshadowing the interesting premise. I almost wish the film makers would have front-loaded the ""Alien"" Easter eggs in order to service the original material. Instead, Scott slow-plays the themes and builds to the chest-burster we all were expecting. That, of course, being the problem--we were all expecting it. While still an iconic visual, its tease was the main focus of ""Prometheus"", not anything truly story-related.

Overall, I enjoyed the experience of ""Prometheus"". I liked its return to ""Alien""-adjacent topics and aesthetic. However, I wish this effort would have serviced the characters and themes a bit more instead of focusing so heavily on the visuals and teases. That being said, this is certainly not worth the lowly reputation it has seemingly acquired. It can still be enjoyed just for the sheet spectacle of it all.","7"
"oble","Visually amazing, but...","2 July 2012","I have to agree with the rest of the reviewers who noted the visual impact of Prometheus. Truly it's a beautiful, eye-popping movie to watch. The scenery is just immense and the CGI work on the backgrounds - the terrain, ship, and even some of the creatures - is outstanding. However, as a movie I left feeling let down. In thinking about it, my disappointment stems from three main problems:

1) Character development (or lack thereof rather). Of the 17 characters in the movie - yep...SEVENTEEN folks to keep track of - I really felt that I only got to know (and consequently cared about) three. Noomi Rapace's Dr. Elizabeth Shaw is pretty much the focal point of the movie and is probably on screen 60 - 70 percent of the time. Thus, as an viewer I got to know her and mostly care about her as a character. Similarly, Michael Fassbender's David is on screen about the same amount of time and I really got a sense of him and his perspective on things. While he may or may not be a character the audience cares about, you definitely get to know him. And I must admit, Fassbender's performance was great as far as I'm concerned. He was really enjoyable to watch. Lastly there was Charlize Theron's Meredith Vickers is provided ample screen time, to say nothing of key character development scenes to get to know her. Further, these three characters actually behave logically for their characters, so it seems that their development was thought out. Of the other 14 characters, I can remember 4 of their names, but they were given so little development and any motivation for their presence that I just didn't care about them. I was thinking about this in contrast to the 7 characters in the movie Alien - of which Prometheus is loosely related - and even after some 40 years I can remember each and every character from that movie - their names, their roles, their personalities, etc. I cared about those characters, and when they had problems or died, the movie had impact. In Prometheus, that impact was not there for me. Forget any problems with alien lifeforms or alien planet weather or things like that - I didn't even really get on board with why they were going to an alien world to begin with.

2 Which brings me to a related issue - Character motivation. I always love the comedic play on the clichéd actor's angsty ""yeah, but what's my character's motivation?"", but the fact is decent writers and directors making decent movies usually do provide actors with some guidance in this area so said actors can...you know...indicate to us, the audience, that their characters do, in fact, care about what they are doing. Again, I got that from Dr. Shaw, David, and Vickers, and to good extent Dr. Shaw's Partner Dr. Holloway (Logan Marshall-Green) and some from Peter Wayland (Guy Pierce). The one person I was really expecting this from was the ship Captain Janek (Idris Elba), but all I got was 'eh...I fly the damn ship'. Heck...I kind of thought that maybe I'd see some enthusiasm and wonder from the two other ""scientists"" - geologist Fifield and biologist Millburn, but not so much. The scare quotes around scientist, BTW, is to denote that as far as their presence and actions went, they really appeared to be scientists-in-title only.

3) Which brings to the last point - story scope. Good stories, at least to me, focus on some particular plot element. In most cases, really good stories - and by association really good movies - can be boiled down to one sentence synopses. Alien is pretty much ""alien life form gets on a ship and crew find they are in jeopardy if they don't get it off"". I can't come up with one for Prometheus. I really feel it's scope was way too large for the story. As others have noted, this was a movie made specifically to be part of a larger framework - at least a sequel and probably a trilogy. That said, I felt overwhelmed by the number of elements that the movie was trying to get across. The meaning of life, immortality, the punishment by the gods, the meaning of being human, evolution vs creation, religion vs science, do androids dream of electronic sheep, the desire to create and destroy...it's all packed in there. And it's tough to unravel a story from all those threads, let along care about said story with all that going on. Basically I just found it too cluttered with all these messages and by the time the alien life forms show up, it's hard to fit them into the context.

I will throw in one other note. Not so much a criticism, but just a let down based on expectation. I really thought this was supposed to be a scary movie and it really wasn't for me. And I mean at all. It certainly had some disturbing scenes and some gore, but there was no ""haunted-house"" spook factor. No startles what-so-ever as far as I'm concerned. Alien, Aliens, Alien Cubed, and Alien: Resurrection and even the Alien vs Predator movies all made attempts to have jack-the-box startling moments - admittedly some more successfully than others - so I was expecting that kind of scare tactic in Prometheus. Not so much. There were some decent gruesome moments, but overall this was more an adventure movie than a horror-scary movie for me.","5"
"janus-20","Mesmerising, beautiful, thought provoking, a REAL movie experience.","4 June 2012","That header is just my opinion, its not a guarantee, i feel this is a truly unique film and well worth your time and money. Its a bold movie and has the courage not to rest on previous laurels and opt for the lazy, unoriginal route most blockbusters take. There's no spoilers to give, because the best stuff would take way too much explaining.

This film is the realisation of all Ridley's promises to expand on one of the most intriguing indirect questions ever posited, ""who or what was that in the Space Jockey ship"".

Its not Alien and its as far from Aliens as you can get, there are connections to Alien, one main connection and others lesser ones. Don't think about the Alien movies, just keep them in the back of your head. It does not dwell on splatter and its not a ""monster"" movie, but it does have those things.

If you require black and white exposition and don't enjoy post movie speculation, i probably wouldn't recommend it. The films plot is pretty straight forward, ask a question, get your answer but definitely not the one you wanted.

What you do get, if you focus on it, are answers and larger questions from those answers, as to ""what was in the chair and what was it doing"". It does not answer everything, either existing questions or new ones that are raised and thats obviously intentional. Because thats whats so damn good about it, it explains more, but doesn't remove all the mystery of the one main thing that connects this to Alien, the mystery that makes the whole thing so provocative.

If Ridley had tried to make this a straight on horror/sci-fi movie, it would have been suicidal and a waste of his and our time, Alien cant be topped in that arena.

This is a sci-fi film, with ""thriller"" elements, thats intended to be the start of something more than just another monster mash and when considering that,it gives you a lot to start with and not just rehashing and cheap tricks.

Its the most mature movie in the summer season for a far back as i can remember. This film is a significant effort towards getting adult movies back on the summer season slate, it would be a terrible shame if it couldn't achieve its potential because of individual misinterpretation and pining for elements that we all claim to be thoroughly sick of anyway.","10"
"strange-6","Priority One: Insure safe return of millions of $$$, all other considerations secondary. Story expendable.","21 June 2012","I know the reason why the Space Jockey / Engineer wants to return to Earth and destroy it: to wipe out all mindless Hollywood screenwriters.

How they related something masterful and perfect as Alien with this nonsense? This is what happens when movies are not done primary for passion and love but only for winning lots of $$$, it is OK to win money, but at least earn it with something good, lots of Sci-fi folks were truly hoping for something much more than average in Prometheus. My buddy and I, both sci-fi and cinema lovers, were really upset when the movie was over.

All the bad reviews you've read are correct ! Bad writing and bad characterization plagues the whole movie; a bunch of Eagle Boy Scouts lost in a dangerous jungle would behave much better than the 'scientists' portrayed here.

Yes, in Alien there are also some poor character decisions, but they are made within the story, not to serve the script, and a bad one this is ! And the people in Alien were miners, not scientists, which behave totally off character in Prometheus.

I love excellent Sci-fi that blows your mind, love the Alien universe, Ridley Scott is (was?) one of my favorite directors. Why did he allowed this?

The music is almost bad. A surprise because the music in many of Scott's films is outstanding.

Alien 3 is almost a masterpiece compared to this, really, no pun intended, at least it handles well the drama; Prometheus, no drama no suspense at all, you do not care about anyone or anything....And even Alien vs. Predator already has the Erik Von Daniken type of plot about ancient civilizations and extraterrestrials and also Wayland goes for the ride...been there, done that. Boring, boring, boring. Did someone in preproduction noticed this before saying yes to the script?

The mythic Space Jockey is reduced to a mindless The Thing From Another World (yes folks, that classic from 1951) monster, a man in a suit is now replaced by CGI; at least back then it was groundbreaking, now, it is boring and lame.

I feel totally betrayed by Scott and company, they have morphed in an evil cinematic Weyland-Yutani company that only cares about money. Story expendable.

The Good: Michael Fassbender's android; though his motives within the story are not clear (again, bad writing).

2 or 3 precious minutes with David, the android, doing housekeeping before waking up the crew. Very 2001, very cool.

The FX and cinematography, of course.

Somehow, the movie is not boring, but there is no drama you simply do not care. Just shut your brains and engagement and go for the ride.

The bad: almost everything else.

Prometheus, as it is, is a movie that should have never been made. Surely it is another mindless Hollywood Bantha fodder that, except for the visuals and cinematography, any unknown director could have made.","4"
"mtbgtown","A Phantom Menace scale let down with an easily digested script for the masses.","25 June 2012","Awesome special effects, bad acting, shallow script. If the movie ended after the first 5 minutes, I would be happy. Up until then we had only a sample of Noomi and Logan's high school level acting, and several minutes of Fassbender's android impersonation. Come to think of it, he didn't have much dialogue by then, so it seemed like a good movie. But then you get 2 hours of unmotivated action, overwrought speech and terrible acting by last years TV costars. It was a lesson in script short cuts and no-no's. Maybe the studio bots lightened the mental load for today's 3rd grade comprehension audience. I'd like to hope this isn't Ridley's fault. Face the truth, folks. Alien and Blade Runner, with their spare dialogue and superb acting, with their mystery and suspense, would not earn a cent today. You have to sell, deliver, then explain every scene. If the character picks up a hammer, they have to say: ""Why is this hammer here? Why am I picking it up like this? What am I going to do with it? I'm going to kill someone with it, that's what!"" or it's too complicated and the Simple won't part with their coveted $12. From now on, if you see big budget special effects, know that in order to pay for it, producers have to draw in the cattle.","1"
"poe426","Chariots of the Gods...","4 December 2013","I have to agree with zetes (the only comments I've read regarding PROMETHEUS): this is a showcase for the production designers and the special effects crew. Nothing more. Harking back to THE CHARIOTS OF THE GODS, PROMETHEUS offers little more than second-hand ruminations, coupled with some of the most overblown filmmaking ever seen. Granted, ALIEN itself was hardly what one would call ORIGINAL in concept (it was a hybrid of a number of lesser known films, most notably Mario Bava's PLANET OF THE VAMPIRES and IT!, THE TERROR FROM BEYOND SPACE), but one would think that a filmmaker with Scott's (financial) pull could come up with something better than a rehash of Von Daniken. (Want to see the same concept done much better? Check out THE ETERNALS, a comic book done by Jack Kirby.)","3"
"samuellop10","What were people expecting?","9 June 2012","I just came back from seeing this movie, twice! Yes, it is that good. I saw it in both formats: 3D and 2D. Definitely go see it in 3D, and in IMAX 3D if you have the chance. I really felt the movie benefited a lot from the 3D and the detail due to the amazing visuals. Anyways, as it seems that every review agrees that the visuals are amazing, I will get on with the rest.

First, the performances. The highlight in this film was definitely Noomi Rapace (Elizabeth Shaw) and Michael Fassbender (David the android). Noomi Rapace gave such a convincing and emotional performance in a character who is so sensitive but which brings out such a fighter that I was rooting for her character from the moment in which her life begins to peril. She was really good at bringing to life such a character. I was really amazed at how good she was playing Elizabeth Shaw. There are at least two scenes (will not detail either because that would spoil some of the story) in which her character is in a sort of suffering (will not detail what kind, again, because that would imply spoilers) that I felt like jumping into the movie/story to help her in some way. I really think and hope that she will receive recognition(s) for her performance. Fassbender was excellent at playing an android. It seems like a big challenge for a human (full of emotions, with free will) to play and embody a robot (no emotions at all, no free will), but Fassbender does it flawlessly. The body language, facial expressions, etc., he does it perfectly. Idris Elba was very good at playing the captain; bringing charisma, a little humor, and a good amount of authority and responsibility. Logan Marshall-Green was also very above average, but I will not go into his character as that would hint spoilers as well. Charlize Theron was also excellent playing her character, including the ""suit"" aspect as well as other (spoilery) aspects. At first it seems some of the characters are not fleshed out, but the more you think about them, the more you get a nice, very dimensional image of these characters who could be real people. The rest of the cast is good as well but they do not get enough screen time (the movie is only two hours long, at the cast includes over 17 people).

Second, expectations. This is a very touchy subject in regards to this movie, and it is the reason which most people that were disappointed were so. Many were expecting some sort of Alien (1979) film. Others were expecting a stand-alone, original story. And others were expecting to witness the greatest thing in their lives. First of all, it is a movie; a horror/thriller/sci-fi movie. Thus, it will not change your life dramatically or have a big impact on it. It is a movie; therefore you should simply expect to get a good amount of entertainment from a horror/thriller/sci-fi movie, which is exactly what Prometheus is. Second, it is a movie which it is not totally original, by this I mean that yes, it does have connections to Alien. On the other hand, and thirdly, it is also a new story, although within the same universe. So, do not expect to see Ripley's mom pregnant with her, or a queen laying the eggs which are shown in Alien at the end of Prometheus. There are clear references and elements which are directly connected to elements of Alien, but, it is a new set of characters, places (not universe), and a new set of conflicts, problems and plots. For those who have seen Alien and/or are fans of it, do not expect to feel and experience the same feelings. For those who have not, or barely have, seen Alien, you will still enjoy it but keep in mind the first half of this paragraph: just try to go watch the movie with realistic expectations in regards to a movie which has horror, thriller, and some big sci-fi (mainly visual) elements in it.

Third, yes I very much enjoyed this movie and what it was about (I did give it a ten after all). So two scientists find similar paintings across the world who were made across big spaces in time. A company funds their expedition to the planet which is depicted in all those paintings. Those paintings also depict bigger beings as compared to humans, and this is where some split in their thinking, expecting to find different answers to different questions. The main character, Dr. Elizabeth Shaw, believes the expedition will lead her to God, or at least, believes that it will lead her closer to finding Him. Her partner and boyfriend, Charlie Holloway, thinks he will find answers to the origins of human kind but, not to God necessarily; he is more of a skeptic. Meredith Vickers is positive that the trip is a waste of money and time; she is only doing it because her father (previous company owner) had agreed to it already. They get there, events begin to unravel, and some do unexpectedly. A little later all hell breaks lose and they find out that they are the only ones which can prevent the end of our kind.

Fourth, the film does start slow. As it advances it gets to a point which it almost becomes dull. By this time (unexpectedly) the thrills begin, and a little while later the horror, and in less time all hell breaks lose and hope decreases to an ever-so-faint flicker, including any kind of survival and Dr. Elizabeth Shaw's faith and beliefs in God.

I have almost used my 1000 word limit so I will end with this: Go into the theater with realistic expectations and you will surely enjoy this film to the fullest. You certainly will not be disappointed.","10"
"ross_kewl","Disappointing, some good things but overall bad.","24 June 2012","Since I never watched any Alien films before seeing Prometheus, I was open minded and quite excited because my family and friends talked about Ridley Scott as the godfather of sci-fi horror. Critics have claimed Prometheus as thought-provoking about the origins of human life. Well not really, since we have developed technology to trace our origins of life back to the apes, this idea of humans coming from space is definitely not thought-provoking.

The movie opens with two scientists who find cave paintings all over the world from different civilizations which depict a star constellation. Elizabeth Shaw (Noomi Rapace) and Charlie Holloway (Logan Marshall- Green) form a team of the best scientists to travel light years away to a mysterious planet. Wrong. They form a team full of incompetent retards whose instincts are to touch and cuddle sinister looking reptilian creatures. I mean come on, three times, I was almost rooting for the aliens to win in the end. If this is humanity's best then society in 2093 must of degraded to medieval times.

I could point out all the other minor flaws like David's (Michael Fassbender) motivations and the inability of Vickers (Charlize Theron) to run to the side of a huge rolling spaceship, but from the reviews I've already read, that's already been covered.

The biggest let down for me was when they awakened the space-jockey from hyper sleep. These were meant to be super intelligent beings who engineered the creation of humanity. However when they awake him, he proceeds to killing all of them. Wouldn't the space-jockey ask them questions like, ""How did you get here?"", ""What are you doing here?"" or ""You survived the sinister looking aliens?"". It was established that this was some sort of biological weapons storage facility and which, judging by the large number of corpses that were the Engineers, was overrun and this space-jockey was the sole survivor. Many of my friends have attempted to answer some of the plot holes, but there is no definite answer, like why did the space-jockey then decide to launch his space ship and destroy Earth (which is actually not even made clear in the movie, the characters seem to figure out that the space-jockey is headed for Earth with biological weapons) , not even sure if thats correct but this only proves that there is much ambiguity in the plot.

Some good points, the acting was superb, Fassbender and Rapace's performances were so realistic that I always felt engaged with the story. The special effects were great as well, but with any movie made in this era, it is expected. The Aliens looked great and the scene with the cesarean on Shaw I will never forget, that was utterly disgusting.

I do accept the fact that this movie, although similar to Alien was not in the same genre. Alien was designed to scare people, but Prometheus attempts to be more philosophical. Although this intention is commendable, it was poorly executed.","5"
"kevinhayward","Muddled, boring and lacking tension. (possible spoilers)","1 June 2012","I saw this at a midnight preview and I was really looking forward to it. I'm a big fan of Alien, but I was really disappointed; this is a bloated mess.

In Alien, the creature presented an abstract threat to earth but the plot centered on the immediate, physical threat to the crew. In Prometheus, the threat is purely abstract and while SOME bad stuff happens to the characters, they are all unsympathetic so it is difficult to care. Characters are established with simplistic dialog; this is the cool black guy, this is the incautious explorer, this is the obnoxious mercenary cyberpunk (who, for no reason, is also a scientist), this is the uptight corporate type.

The scientists don't behave like scientists, they don't talk like scientists. The nerdy biologist (who has to walk off to be monster fodder later), walks away from an alien corpse because it's not his field of interest. Huh? Archeologists suddenly turn into medical experts and people exploring an alien ecosystem for the first time remove helmets without regard for contamination of the environment or themselves. Often, the only justification for character actions seems to be to set up later plot points.

Alien worked because it focused on believable characters stuck in a terrible situation, without that believability the film would be greatly lessened. Prometheus, lacking that, is uninteresting.

Prometheus puts me in mind of Avatar. The use of 3D is excellent and the art direction is amazing. However, as with Avatar, technical excellence cannot make up for a terrible plot, sub-standard characterisation and meaningless dialogue.","1"

"blades_n_stone","alien episode 1: the phantom menace?","19 June 2012","this review contains spoilers!!!! OK. So I loved the alien movies, I loved the predator movies. I took a guilty pleasure in the AVP movies. I don't love Prometheus. I should have. There was a formula set that worked. This should not have been screwed up. First off. this movie is visually stunning. I love the visual over CGI graphics. It is as rich and full as its predecessors in visuals. but not in story, effects, or development. Its like the whole budget and time line was put into sets and then they tossed the actors in and filmed the script after it was sorted by a strong wind. the films android David(Michael Fassbender) is the only developed character you feel for. in fact you root for him to kill off the humans. Noomie Rapace is awful. one of the worst actresses I have ever seen. Her roll is so badly cast as the heroin that I think someone in casting should be fired. she never develops beyond a confused religious scientist with poor priorities and worse judgement. None of the major characters have any personality. Charlize Theron should have played the main in this film. Guy Pearce was completely un necessary and the whole beginning in the ruins on earth could have been skipped. the film is full of holes and missed opportunities for subplot. The beginning where they verify the star map is laughable, the archaeologists admit the galaxy they represent is too far for humans to even see in the sky. So how the hell did to relic hunters find it? they made up the theory of the engineers with no evidence. how the hell did they convince a superstitions industrialist to spend a trillion on an expedition with no payoff!!!? they were pseudo religious morons with archaeology degrees trying to prove god. Dr shaw says in one part as she cuddles her cross. ""they made us so who made them."" as a way to hold her faith. how did they clear psych checks to even get into space? not the kind of people you hand a blank cheque to unless you really love the whole cult experiences.

all the other actors other then the droid may as well have been mannequins. the scientists were all idiots with no knowledge of standard lab or quarantine procedure. lets all take our helmets off kids!

so plot holes: 1: why is the technology in the past better then the technology in alien? they have better mapping systems, better medical, better rovers, better ships, better hyper sleep? this is a prequel. way to take a page from star wars Ridley! 2:the living green slime on the engineers control panel in the ruins on the planet. David sees it reactive to touch and says its interesting. that's it? its a bio reactive material that somehow stayed reactive to touch for 2 freaking millennium and its just ""interesting"". I had a crap once that was ""interesting"" too. 3: the virus cases in the storage chamber. David takes one. parts the grey slime and get the ampules containing the builder virus out then infects one of the doctors. the grey sludge was an organic packing compound and of no interest to him. yet it is what turns one of the crew into a monster and mutates the worms. so what the hell was the grey slime? 4: on the wall is painted a picture of a xenomorph. so the engineers were familiar with that genetic screw up. yet this film predates the xenomorph. 5: the Dr. infected with the builder virus by David rapidly sickens and is killed. so what was the point of the infection? it proved nothing. there was no way he could have known any of the outcomes were possible. and as a robot he would not have been motivated by anger to kill the Dr. so wtf!? did we just need to ad a squid Cesarian to spice things up? 6: the engineer holograms show them running and setting the ship to take off. but not what they were running from and the run to the room full of their failed bio weapon. its like the worst parts of a system shock remake. but without a system or a shock! 7: waking up the engineer. he's been in hyper sleep for 2000 years. and he just wakes up fine. we have the same DNA. same side effects! 2 years leaves a person dehydrated and puking their guts out. 2000 leaves you crying on the floor not beheading robots! 8: Dr.Shaw and David take the one of the other ships to go to the engineer home world. but the virus ships from this planet were supposed to go infect earth. you mean in 2000 years no one from engineer base one noticed the ships never made the delivery. hell if fed ex can track a shipment I'm sure the aliens who evolved fed ex can too! and how will they survive. I'm sure engineer food is tasty. but her suit will not mesh with their life support in hyper sleep and she sure as hell wont fit and engineer flight suit.

the only way to make this movie suck more would have been to make jar jar Binks jump out of the engineers chest in the end! Even with the pseudo alien in the end what does it matter. its the only living thing on a dead planet fathered by a dead squid. good luck.

look you want to watch Alien. go watch Alien. leave this crap alone. the visuals make it worth ONE watch. but don't even think of it as having anything to do with Alien. all his needs in the credits is ""The Syfy channel presents..."" I Feel dirty and cheated.","4"
"p-stepien","Ending beginnings","27 July 2012","After three decades of hit-and-miss Ridley Scott returns to what he did best - science fiction. With ""Alien"" an undying classic and ""Bladerunner"" arguably the best genre movie ever, high hopes were abundant and understandable for the Englishman's return to the source.

""Prometheus"" retcons the appalling two ""Alien vs Predator"" movies, albeit the basic premise does throw us into recognisable Eric von Daniken territory of aliens creating life on Earth. Near the turn of the XXIst Century, after a couple of scientists, Elizabeth Shaw (Noomi Rapace) and Charlie Holloway (Logan Marshall-Green), discover that murals from across the world present the same star system configuration, the almighty Weyland Corporation embarks on a cross-planetary mission to discover the truth behind the ancient scribblings boarding a ship adequately named Prometheus. During the long voyage they are overseen by David (absolute perfection by Michael Fassbender), an android with his own game plan, one programmed into him by his 'father' Peter Weyland (Guy Pearce). The ship itself is commanded by a brash, but enticing, Janek (portrayed favourably by Idris Elba), whilst the interests of the Weyland Corp. are looked after by Meredith Vickers (Charlize Theron), a detached, rigid personae, but without the power craze of most corporate stools inhabiting the Alien universe.

Fronted by the brilliance of Fassbender, Theron and Elba with a competent, if slightly underwhelming, performance of Noomi Rapace, ""Prometheus"" manages to divert attention for a lot of its apparent shortcomings for much of the movie. Nonetheless when the character count drops at an increasingly rash pace with a feeling of widespread underdevelopment of said corpses, the multitude of flaws overpower even the most rabid Alien fan with a lazy, rushed story, that promises and drastically fails to deliver. Despite some initial promise, especially after a superb opening sequence of David passing time in the depths of space, whilst the rest of the crew stays in cryosleep, characters are thrown in by the bunch-load, rushed through the motions and by the end viewers fail to connect with any members of the crew, basically making them disposable and their subsequent deaths a meaningless chore.

Part of the problem stems from the inherent attempt at detaching the story from the Alien itself and refocusing on the lore of the universe with the Engineers at the forefront (known more commonly to movie addicts as the 'disc jockey'). The severing off of ties seems too forcible, to an extent that implausibility is chosen as a path and even when 'an Alien' finally appears it isn't even 'the Alien', but some malformed re-imagining. Thrown into a movie reality, which likes to overcomplicate matters, Ridley Scott forgoes the more sensible simple route in connecting Prometheus with the 'Alien' universe, instead delving into a mutating cacophony of monsters, which lack semblance or reason. Ultimately he ventures into the absurdity of trying to avoid connect the dots between ""Prometheus"" and ""Alien"".

The script itself similarly seems to have undertaken some alien tampering, which piles on the mystery, mostly unresolved by the end credits, with several layers of plot holes and threadbare logical connections stinking up the conclusions. Scientists convinced that life on Earth was engineered, because they found a sequence of stars? And why would this sequence point to a military facility in the first place? A trillion dollar expedition jumping gung-ho into an alien compound without any protocol or line of command? Worms transported via sperm impregnating women, than fully growing like a foetus in the span of 15 hours? An alien facility covered with goo with nothing similar to living habitats? First flaming an infected individual to avoid him entering the ship, afterwards supplying entrance to a second such individual without any precautions? An Engineer hell-bent on murder after waking from 2,000 years of cryosleep (not to mention his psychotic attack after crashing the alien ship). The list endlessly goes on, as we are told to suspend belief in the script, which in many cases can be too much too bear.

Nonetheless the set design, cinematography and special effects do help to gloss over many of the faults, suggesting that ""Prometheus"" can be enjoyed purely as another decent popcorn flick. Given however expectations the disappointment is much larger, than that of watching another James Bond action packed thriller. As if to compensate for script shortcomings Ridley Scott does his best to deliver an eerie scenery coupled with some frightening, grisly moments, which verge on disgusting, but manage to instill an honest reaction from viewers.

The movie ends rapturously with mayhem and destruction, but with promise of a further, hopefully better, instalment. Nonetheless with such a disinterested outing it begs to ask whether further parts will not further devour the magic of the Alien universe. It is punishment enough that Scott ventured into the origins of his classic with such a dramatically underwritten flawed script.

Another big let-down is the promise of a otherworldly haunting legendary score fronted by the motif used in the ""Prometheus"" trailer. Unfortunately the said music features only briefly, what's more in such a way that my girlfriend actually missed it. Instead the movie offers a pretty standard forgettable score, which highlights what could have been. The concept itself wasn't a bad one, but the terrible connections made by the script cry out for a more well-rounded, less flamboyant, Engineer holding the reigns.","5"
"Prichards12345","Yet another director sells out his legacy.","2 January 2013","Biggest disappointment of all the films I viewed over the New Year was Prometheus, which was a load of rubbish from beginning to end. A story that followed the same beats as Alien, with cardboard characters who have a tendency to do the stupidest thing possible at all times, the worst ageing make-up since Back to The Future pt II, an almost total absence of suspense or drama, and about as much atmosphere as Sponge Bob Squarepants! In short a fourth rate rip off of Alien and a sixth rate rip off of 2001. Having forked out my cash for the blue-ray edition I've never felt so short changed and ripped off by a movie as this.

Let's start with Michael Fassbender's android character David, and his love of Lawrence of Arabia; he appears to have watched only half of that movie judging by his character. Major writing problem with David - just compare this blandest of androids with the skilfully layered performances of Ian Holm and Lance Henricksen. Even when he's supposed to be sinister he isn't. ""Try harder"" is something the script-writers could have done with heeding themselves.

And though the film is set about 30 years before Alien the technology on display here is vastly better. Hell all the crew of The Nostromo needed was some of those bouncy red ball thingys to map everything out. No need to go to the alien ship at all. The whole mystique of the ""Space Jockey"" is completely destroyed by this movie. YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED. The motivations of the Engineers are utterly murky and the scientific rationale behind their genetic engineering of humanity is just plain wrong. Mr. Scott do you think a lot of your audience is stupid? Plainly you do. Human DNA ancestry can be traced back millions of years, not two thousand.

Poor old Guy Pierce must be in need of a job to accept the role of the ancient Weyland. Indeed they all must have been to play such uninteresting characters. Dr. Shaw heads off into the wide blue yonder at the end, searching for The Engineers. No emotional trauma at all after her Ceasarean of an alien-type creature in her womb. Indeed, she even takes the guy who tried to let the fetus grow along with her. Yeah, right. How do these guys get such highly paid script writing jobs?

Charlize Theron appears even more robotic than David - a Hitchcock blonde in the wrong movie. She's always good for a few laughs. The alien ship is navigated by playing a flute solo. Presumably a Will Ferrel cameo.

As a result of all this I've made a New Year's resolution not to see a franchise movie unless it's proved itself a good film. I'm going to totally ignore The announced new Bladerunner films as a result of watching this - Scott will only screw it up, and in doing so with this turkey he's now joined a lengthening list of film makers who just want to sell out and cash in on their legacies.","1"
"talentedripples","The Greatest Voyage?","26 June 2012","More like the Greatest Snorage.

Prometheus has a wonderful title but apart from that it is extremely lacking. As with a lot of films the best part about this flick is its trailer. The trailer promises action, excitement, and even on a couple of occasions, fear. However when the entire film steps up to deliver it falls spectacularly short.

Names are banded about like 'Incas' and 'Aztecs' though their significance to the plot and to humanity's history is never explored beyond they were a primitive people and aren't these pictographs interesting? We so no carbon dating or similar techniques. There is no explanation about how the characters could possibly know the dates of these drawings which are oh so significant, other than the fact they must be.

With the decision that these drawings must be an 'invitation' and not a screaming warning left by civilisations of the long distant past that could not be full understood without the proper context a mission is launched. This mission is to determine whether or not human life was created and/or comes from aliens. Right. So that's the premise of the film. So where does the fun start?

It doesn't. That nice sand storm seen in the trailer is little more than a ruse. It's timing in the movie doesn't just fall flat it proves to be a disappointment.

The little aliens themselves are less like Alien and more like those little wormy things out of Dreamcatcher which has ten times more heart, soul and interest than this story.

Are we supposed to care about these characters? Because it is impossible to care when none of them have any personality to speak of. There's no oomph, no oozing charisma, no twinkling eyes or air of J'ai ne sais quoi. All of them are more like androids that David played by Michael Fassbender who holds the most personality and interest out of all of them combined - AND HE'S THE ANDROID.

And then there's the creepy old man whom Charlize Theron doesn't get on well with at all. The only time any personality is seen from her character is when she gets a little mad and by then the whole world is going up in...well...I'd like to say smoke but it's so slow and dull and subtle that really it's a puff of invisible air. The creepy old man who's significance is never fully realised explains only David's motives, who, again, appears to be the only thing in this movie with something to do.

This movie gets two starts because it did not so utterly suck that I felt so immensely bored I almost walked out of the cinema, and because Michael Fassbender managed to put on an emotional yet emotionless performance. His acting allowed me to believe he was a creation pretending and acting like a human - sometimes getting it right, and sometimes not quite so much. But beyond that the main characters are so utterly dire that when their relationship falls apart nobody cares.

That's the problem with this movie. Nobody cares. And as for the Alien golden nuggets promised by Charilize Theron in her interviews...where were they?","2"
"crown-16","Is this really Riddley Scott's","18 June 2012","After watching Prometheus I was in perplexed and in deep thought until it hit me: Riddley Scott has an evil twin with the same name. One Riddley Scott is directing Blade Runner, Alien and Gladiator and the evil one the Prometheus.

Where to begin: the plot holes, the cardboard characters, the unbelievable scenario, the details that make no sense. I could have excused all that if there was good action to go along with the stunning visuals; if there was a strong message or a cathartic ending among the pointless running around. Alas no.

**spoiler alert** At the opening scene we see a beautiful take of what we are led to believe was primitive Earth and one of the ""Engineers"" while watching his spaceship take off, is apparently seeding Earth with his DNA. A civilization this advanced and he has to commit suicide for that? We then have a visual of his DNA being destroyed. If the idea is to propagate it then why destroy it? One possibility is that he could be rouge but why not suggesting that with a chase by the others in the spaceship?

The two protagonist scientists keep finding drawings in early human civilizations of a star system. Those humans were separated by hundreds or thousands years. So the engineers keep revisiting Earth again and again to give humans that star map? Weren't humans impressed by 3 meter tall aliens to make any drawings of them?

The huge ship that takes our motley crew to the distant system is actually capable of making a landing itself, not a smaller craft which would be more logical. No mother ship orbiting and scanning from above, no probes released in the planet.

Then we have a Star Trek moment when they land right next to the alien ""pyramids"" and how do they find them in this gazillion dollar ship with advanced technology? They look out the window!

Charlize Theron is one more of the disposable characters and mostly doing the catwalk around the ship. Her performance is wooden and her character adds nothing to the movie.

She is the daughter of the billionaire who funded the trip and while in his recording he specifically says that the two scientists are in charge, she acts like she is. Only that besides being a bitch she makes no leadership decisions.

She is the apparent heir of a person that can fund such an expedition, something that would stretch the budget of the richest nation, and she wants to come along to a trip in space that takes years each way rather than stay home and hang out with Paris Hilton's granddaughter. Oh yes, talking of fun, out of the blue she has her way with the captain - another unnecessary plot dead end.

Noomi Rapace's character is downright annoying. She is supposed to be the strong female character so well played by Sigourney Weaver in the Alien movies and fails. Not so much by the actress, it is the plot and direction that makes this character confusing to say the least. Combine that with a slightly strange expressionless face and an annoying voice with a forced accent and you struggle to find anything to like about her.

Her fellow scientist and boyfriend while at a certain point and for no apparent reason is tainted by David the android, he starts to turn into a monster, not impregnated by the alien creature. He is sleeping with her and SHE is impregnated. How is this consistent with the Alien's ways I don't know.

Then in the famous (or infamous) scene with the auto surgeon: She runs to the hugely complex and expensive machine that performs auto surgery and asks for a cesarean section; what happens then? It can't because it is calibrated only for males! OK, Meredith Vickers whom is beyond doubt a woman brings along this marvel of a machine half way across the galaxy and it is set for men only. It could be for her father but how difficult would it be to be programmed for women too?

The list goes on and on. I don't want to forget to mention the music that is annoying at places and doesn't always project the feelings on screen. This is unforgivable in such a high budget film.

I am afraid that I cannot recommend it to any scifi fan. Put one of the first two in the DVD and watch Riddle Scott at his best (The real Riddley Scott)","3"
"lrishJoe78","Extremely disappointing","22 December 2012","The ONLY positive thing I can say about this is that it looks great on screen, stunning actually at times. Everything else was disastrous. The biggest problem was the plot, which would have been naive and clichéd if it had been done well, but did not even live up to that and ended up being simply nonsensical. I could literally list dozens of contradictions, holes and unexplainable oddities in the storyline. Then there was the acting which was uninspired to be kind about it, which obviously leads you to wonder about the direction. I find it hard to understand how a movie like this which should have been great can go so completely wrong and not be caught by the studio quality control somewhere before release, or perhaps it was too far gone too fix by then. I find it harder to understand how people are giving this movie positive reviews. Major disappointment given the director's history with this genre.","3"
"John_of_Lenah_Valley","Hugely disappointing!","5 July 2012","This started out with so much promise. All the publicity suggested it was going to be a much deeper, philosophic cinematic experience. Indeed the first few minutes of the film, with the Icelandic scenery masquerading beautifully as the primordial Earth, and the ""engineer's"" spaceship arriving, were great.

But almost immediately after, the problems started. The role the engineers had in creating or modifying humanity was depicted in a way that was altogether too stylized. It did not explain in any way how the later societies, who left the star map artifacts, could have known anything about their creator(s) or learned their language. Shouldn't there have been scenes of the engineers actually interacting with these societies?

Moving forward to the 21st century, should there have been a lead up to the expedition to LV-223? It all seemed to happen far too quickly. The star map itself was a problem. If the maps were as old as they claimed, observations in the 21st century would not have identified the pattern, due to the stars moving in relation to each other over long periods of time (galactic rotation). A pattern depicted over 2000 years ago would have changed markedly in that time. Why, if the engineers want us to find them eventually, do they give the ancients a map to a planet they use as a biological weapons development and testing area? (I suppose it could be argued that the role of this place could have changed in 2000 years. Even so, it does seem peculiar.)

Another quibble - which also applies to just about every modern Sci-Fi film is that weightlessness, the impossibility of faster-than-light travel and other relevant physics are all totally ignored. The distance they travel (over 10 light years), and how long it takes them do not match, even if ""Prometheus"" can travel at close to the speed of light. If Kubrick could get it so right in ""2001 - A Space Odyssey"" over 40 years ago, how come most sci-fi films since then have got it so wrong?

Other reviewers have expressed their puzzlement at the composition of the crew, and I won't detail again the many examples of the team's peculiar behavior. Surely Weyland would have done extensive selection processes for such an expensive, critical mission, yet this is a bunch of dysfunctional incompetents who make the most stupid mistakes, deliberately take insane risks and don't communicate vital information to each other. The science performed by the crew is more akin to that of the original ""Frankenstein"". I mean, trying to reanimate a 2000 year old head by putting electricity through it....please. And on the subject of ""science"" - correct me if I'm wrong, but surely a 100% DNA match between a human and an engineer would mean they would be totally identical organisms? What about the planet's atmosphere? The crew member reading the analysis says that it contains 3% Carbon Dioxide (I'm sure they said DI-oxide not MON-oxide!) and would thus be poisonous, so suits would be required. In fact, people can tolerate 3% Carbon Dioxide for up to a month and even 4% for a week or so, with the only effect being drowsiness. Suits would not be required.

The climax of the film, where the humans and android meet the engineer, is very disappointing if you hoped for anything inspiring. Considering communication was possible (because the android had skills in the engineer's language) and the engineers had obviously wanted their creation to meet them one day, what happens is all too ""human"" and disappointing.

The end of the film obviously implies a sequel. Hopefully set on the home planet of the engineers, maybe we will learn more about the engineers and their motivation for creating humanity. I'm not holding my breath, though.

I give this 4 for some excellent set design and special effects, plus good performances from Noomi Rapace and Michael Fassbender. Other than that, hugely disappointing and IMHO could have been better had it not referenced the ""Alien"" series at all. Trying to maintain congruence with ""Alien"" canon probably took the plot in a direction which was too difficult to reconcile with the more philosophical who-made-us-and-why theme of the film.","4"
"p_imdb-238-926380","It is good, but not a ""clever"" or ""best movies in years"" like seen in reviews","30 May 2012","I just saw Prometheus during the premier in Luxembourg. The theater was full of course, everybody was excited.After the film was finished, I could hear the people around me being a bit disappointed.

The reason is obvious to me. The film is well done in nearly all aspects, but the major disappointment comes from the fact that it often is illogical. The whole crew behaves like beginners without any deeper sense for the situation. I understand that they need to get action going, and some people need to make mistakes so something can happen. But the whole crew is just stupid.

The movie plays on a level of a 1980 carpenter vampire movie. Don't ask for logic, or why has this been done in the way it was.

The movie is not as deep, as Scott announced it to be. Can't remember how he said it, but it was among the lines ""It's everything about everything"". No it is actually very comparable to an Alien movie. You can clearly see they dug up the same tension making scenes and face huggers scare jumps etc.. It's also a bit over the top, without real story telling reason (like Alien 3 or especially 4).

I have to admit that you get to know more a about the universe than in the Alien movies. But that's just a side effect.

The movie is good, if you expect something like Alien (easy entertainment without too much thinking). But if you go there because you want to know more about the universe etc (like promised), it is going to be a disappointment.

This movie positions itself right in the middle of ""Ghosts of Mars"" and ""Space Odyssey""","1"
"Vivekmaru45","The Most Horrendous Casting I Have Seen In Years.","27 December 2012","The persons that did the casting (Nina Gold and Avy Kaufman) should have their licenses revoked. These are the most horrendous bunch of buggers(I don't even want to call them actors) ever assembled.

This film began as an idea for a prequel to the 1979 cult sci-fi horror film Alien directed by Ridley Scott. But sadly it de-evolved into a standalone film.

Prometheus is a Titan, culture hero, and trickster figure who in Greek mythology is credited with the creation of man from clay and the theft of fire for human use, an act that enabled progress and civilization. He is known for his intelligence, and as a champion of humanity. In this film Prometheus is the name of the space-ship used to reach the distant moon LV-223. In Aliens(1986) the planet where Lt. Ripley first encountered the alien organism was LV-426. Hence we now confirm that Prometheus is a stand-alone film and NOT CONNECTED TO Alien(1979) and Aliens(1986) in any way whatsoever.

In Prometheus writers Jon Spaihts and Damon Lindelof conceived of large humanoid alien beings nicknamed ""Engineers"" who initiated the process of life on the planet we know as ""Earth"". This was accomplished by the humanoid alien drinking a dark bubbling liquid while standing next to a large waterfall. He then starts to disintegrate due to the ingestion of the dark liquid. The alien's remains cascade into a waterfall. His DNA triggers a biogenetic reaction creating living cells in the water.

This stuff is enough to send a biologist or molecular biologist to a fit of hysterical laughter. Of course you realize these guys have no primary or secondary education at all. They never studied biology or chemistry. They are what you refer as flunkies or junkies or the combo.

Years later in 2089, archaeologists Elizabeth Shaw and Charlie Holloway discover a star map in Scotland that matches others from several unconnected ancient cultures. They interpret this as an invitation from humanity's forerunners, the ""Engineers"". Peter Weyland, the elderly CEO of Weyland Corporation, funds an expedition to follow the map to the distant moon LV-223 aboard the scientific vessel Prometheus. The ship's crew travels in stasis while the android David monitors their voyage. Arriving in 2093, they are informed of their mission to find the Engineers.

The special effects are higher class of C.G.I. developed for people who have sharp eyesight and can spot the fake computerized pixels a mile away. These days even PS3 games have better graphics than shown in movies. The C.G.I. effects are used for the Engineers and the few mutated snake-like alien creatures. The biggest of which strangely developed inside Elizabeth Shaw. And at the end of the film we see an alien creature emerging out from an Engineer which resembles the alien we saw in Scott's first alien film and is a poor attempt at pacifying die-hard Alien(1979) fans.

The acting is unbearable with Michael Fassbender (who remarkably looks like Peter O Toole) as the only bright spot in the film followed by veteran actor Guy Pearce(Memento, Time Machine, Lockout, Ravenous) who plays the role of Peter Weyland, the billionaire founder of and CEO of Weyland Corp.

Charlize Theron is utterly useless in her role. Even a lesser actress like Noomi Rapace outperforms her.

Idriss Elba tries in his role as captain of the Prometheus but is ineffective (this guy couldn't even captain a kids football team).

The rest of the actors are like a mix of various colored turds in the manure and do not deserve mention.

Overall: it was not worth the wait for me and was a big disappointment. I was expecting Alien PREQUEL and not the Alien which lives in Ridley Scott's a**.","4"

"rooprect","Attention, fans of 2001: A Space Odyssey...","6 January 2016","If you never saw ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" (1969), then run yourself silly in a giant hamster wheel for 10 minutes, watch ""2001"", then come back and read this review. 2001 is the one that started them all: those scifi epics that blended spaceships with the ontological questions of existence (and no, ontology has nothing to do with cancer. I looked it up). Kubrick's 2001 spawned an entire genre of film in the same way Darwin spawned an entire genre of science. Notable follow-ups to 2001 include Tarkovsky's ""Solyaris"" (1972) and Soderbergh's remake ""Solaris"" (2002), Robert Wise's ""Star Trek: The Motion Picture"" (1979), the recent Battlestar Galactica remake (2003-2009) and Ridley Scott's own ""Blade Runner"" (1982)... stories that hit on questions of existence, evolution and the creation of life. Here in ""Prometheus"" we have the latest foray into this small circle of films that blend suspense, philosophy... and big things that zoom through space without making any noise (AS IT SHOULD BE).

In 1979 when director Ridley Scott made his groundbreaking ""Alien"", it was apparent that he was stylistically influenced by Kubrick's ""2001"". He presented an ominously cold future full of enormous, sterile machines that reduced humanity down to a flyspeck. And from there he proceeded with a classic existentialist struggle of the human faced with an ominous, overwhelming conflict. Prometheus is visually and stylistically a continuing chapter of the Alien world, and in fact there are plot elements that tie into the Alien story as well (although some of those elements seem to be more gimmicky than substantial... tying this story with the enormously popular Alien franchise). From there we are led into an epic tale that blends good ole ""2001"" philosophy with ""Alien"" action. The question is: how do you prefer your balance between the two?

Another important question is: how much can you suspend your disbelief? Granted, all futuristic films require some suspension of disbelief, but in this case there are a few moments when you'll need a 50 story tower crane to suspend your disbelief. Others have covered some of these points in their reviews, so I'll just leave it and assume you can deal with it.

Regarding the deeper thematic elements (the meaning of life and all that jazz), here's where I'm speaking to the 2001 fans because I feel that's what ""Prometheus"" initially promises us. Much like 2001, it begins with a cryptic dramatic scene on Earth, eons ago, then soon jumps us to a colossal spacecraft of the future. The message being: this film promises to address the question of our existence by examining our future. But my personal feeling is, following this excellent introduction, the film gradually makes too many compromises for the sake of ""momentum, pacing and time"" (3 words which are used a dozen times in the DVD commentary to excuse the cutting of 37 minutes of film). And ultimately, the film delivers a wild scifi/action/fx ride that will certainly get your heart pumping, but not necessarily your brain cells firing.

I definitely recommend this film to scifi/action fans because it has an intelligent premise and manages to blend that with a fast-paced, classic blood & guts action story. But for any 2001 fans who might want more, I strongly urge you to watch the 37 minutes of deleted scenes. With only 1 or 2 exceptions, I think they all should have been part of the movie. Not just to further explain the story (which isn't really necessary) but to add dimension and meaning to the characters, expose what drives them and how it fits into the overall theme of searching for the meaning of life.

In particular there are 2 scenes between the captain of the ship ""Janos"" (Idris Elba) and the dragon lady ""Miss Vickers"" (Charlize Theron) which take these two characters out of their 2-dimensional, supporting-character roles and flesh them out as real human beings with internal conflicts and complexities of their own. In the commentary the cut was justified, saying that the scenes unnecessarily took away from the main hero's story. As if we're too stupid to handle a subplot. Other cuts were similarly justified for plot momentum (sanctioned by Ridley Scott himself, so we can't even blame some dumb corporate suit for butchering a masterpiece), and you soon understand that it was not Ridley Scott's intention to go so far into 2001 territory as it was to stay true to the ""Alien"" space horror formula.

And on that note, I felt a bit cheated because the formula in the 2nd half was almost identical to Alien, almost scene-for-scene toward the end, and I feel like it didn't offer anything above and beyond the original masterpiece. Noomi Rapace is an excellent actress, but she didn't quite fit the tough-as-nails Sigourney Weaver role that she was evidently expected to emulate.

Perhaps an unintended highlight of the film was the performance of Michael Fassbender as ""David"", an unusual character whose secret I won't ruin though it's revealed in the opening minutes. Fassbender was easily 50% of the reason why I liked this movie.

In the end I enjoyed ""Prometheus"" as I think every scifi movie fan will. But part of me felt let down because of what it could have been. I felt most cheated by the filmmakers' self-admitted compromises for the sake of moving the story along at a brisk pace. But at the same time, nobody can deny how majestic the visuals are, certainly the best scifi special effects I've seen in a long time, and the action succeeded in getting my pulse pounding twice as fast. ""Prometheus"" does make a very powerful, original statement. So yes, go see it. And maybe in a few years we'll get the ""Prometheus full extended cut redux"", or whatever it'll be called, for those of us who can take 37 minutes more. One way or another, I think this film is a step in the right direction for scifi.",NA

I can accept weaknesses in some area such as plot or not too many unanswered question but to make a story or plot based on stupid character which is supposedly clever scientist or geologist just an awful movie. This really insulted the audience intelligence.

The scientist is so stupid that they don't act like one such as no weapon allowed, opening the helmet in unknown environment, playing with snake like creature in new planet just found, don't have proper preparation in assessing new situation such as the risk or danger they may encounter.

"jimfarley1025","What was that?","1 January 2013","We watched this on the recommendation of a friend's teenage daughter who, fortunately loaned us the DVD so that we have no financial investment in this at all. I've loved many a Ridley Scott movie and was prepared to forgive him the descent into ""3D"" because I assumed that there would be some fine scenery and an entertaining story.

First, let me say that the costume and set design are first rate. Absolutely what I expected and hoped for with Mr. Scott having a basically unlimited budget. Visually, a very entertaining movie with no overwrought ""for 3D"" effects, or at least none that were too glaring. Of course, after about half-way through the file I pretty much stopped paying attention, so there might have been something towards the end that wasn't good; I wouldn't know.

As to the acting of the movie; what a waste of some very talented people. The writing was so awful and the characters so shallow that it would have been difficult for even these talented people to shine. Most of the cast seemed to be at home in the shallow depth of the flat characters presented in the story. More's the pity for them. The promise of any excellence in acting is not possible given the poor dialog, vapid story-line and constant switching from one distraction to the next as the movie (I wouldn't say story) progresses.

The story line was non-existent. The outline of a possible idea for a story seemed to be about all there was. The outline was stuffed with one stupidity after another. When the characters pronounce otherwise earth-like atmosphere to be toxic because of 3% CO2, I had my first over-suspending of disbelief. Then followed one after another as the characters performed a never ending series of literally unbelievable actions, most of which in addition seemed rather random and disconnected from the main story outline.

What an awful disappointment. I really expected better of Ridley Scott. It seems a terrible shame that there is apparently an inverse ratio between the expanse of visual possibilities in film and the depth of the stories presented. Imagine how wonderful a good story might be if it were enhanced with some beautiful surroundings.","1"

The plot is ridiculous, and riddled with holes that a 10 year old would see through, the acting is like something from stage school, and the dialogue borders on the hilarious (the plot is so bad that much of it is articulated by various characters just so you can follow it). Just about every movie clique is here... the dysfunctional crew, a romance, gratuitous religion, unnecessary gore, etc. After an hour, I gave up on it as a serious movie and started to enjoy it for the farce that it is. I gave it 3/10 for special effects (+1), the 3D (+1), and some of the science fiction (+1). Everything else about this movie is worthless.

"gamskee","Boring, Stupid, and Not Very Scary","12 June 2012","I will try to create a quick bulletin list of problems with this film, starting with the good first.

The Good 1) Visually very well done. The landscape and technology were all very interesting to look at. 2) Actors were believable. Fassbender gives a great (if wasted) performance.

The Bad 1) Actors actions- while you could believe the characters, it was hard to believe their backgrounds or motivations. Scientists and select crew for a trillion dollar secret mission to an alien civilization act with all the sense and survival instinct of camp Counselors at Crystal Lake. The android infection scene had zero to do with anything- not science, not a plan to take over the ship, not to make the old man immortal. Nothing. It was very dumb.

2) Plot and themes in general felt very paper thin. The aliens actions are under explained, never very clear. Weyland's plan is full of holes. The magical medical chair was just fine, save for it's rather inexplicable lack of female anatomy lessons (12 in existence, and they get the dudes only chair? In the woman's private chamber?)

3) Not scary. There just wasn't a good build up of dread. It never hit the fan in the way it needed to, and the characters were so undeveloped, you couldn't even muster a bit of care when they were killed. For it to be scary, you have to get people to buy into the premise, and I started laughing as it went on. The kills lacked a certain useful realism.

4) Plot holes! There are multiple, but my favorite is, how did the space octopus grow to epic proportions in a room with no food- was there a pudding button on the magic healing chair?

5) Wasted themes. Good sci-fi will ask questions about who we are, what we are in the universe, whys and hows, and explore them. This movie nods at them, then wastes time on mutants and octopi and predictable to point of stupid twists, and we never really get that sense of having gotten a hard think out of it.

If it had been scary, or compelling, or visually stunning to some new heights, it could've succeeded, but it's a slow ride to nowhere that leaves you feeling empty.","3"
"dobly58","Below Average! Sorry Ridley.","3 June 2012","Having waited almost two years to see this film, I could not begin to quantify my disappointment as I exited the theater in disbelief. After twenty minutes I knew we were in trouble. Something was amiss. I just didn't feel the dread, didn't relate to any of the characters, found the dialog under-par, and everything just seemed rushed. Rather than rant on and make myself even more depressed, here are a few of the points I had trouble with: - The music score was...oh I forgot to listen to that! Some theme repeated over and over.

Why DID David spike Holloway's drink. Spite, curiosity, in the name of Weyland? - What exactly did the snake creature do after it entered that guys mouth, yet his mate gets covered in acid and returns as a super-strength zombie? Hmmmm - Did Guy Pierce agree to do that role or was a gun put to his head? - Vickers and the Captain agree to have sex while the rest of the crew are in mortal danger outside? - A cesarean section then marching on to be the heroine of the movie. Just a scratch eh? - Do I recall any of the characters names? - Why were the engineers so hostile in the first place? - Shaw gives birth to a squid! - The tentacled creature was stolen from John Carpenters The Thing.


The baby Xenomorph looked like a donkey.


I could go on all night at this rate. I won't be returning to see it just to confirm it was awful. But Ridley...after loving your movies for thirty years, you need to restore confidence QUICKLY!!","2"
"mike-ryan455","We were bored!","23 June 2012","My wife and I saw Prometheus tonight. We said ""Hey, Ridley Scott directed and produced it so it HAS to be good, right?"" Boy were we wrong! We were literally yawning by the end of the movie.

Yes the special effects were quite good. And the guy who played David the Robot was good and the South African chick who played the blonde who acted like a robot was pretty good and nice eye candy to boot. But that's where the good stuff kind of ends.

The part of them breathing the atmosphere was really ludicrous. Who knew what the heck the infectious germs would be in that atmosphere in the ship? From there, I just realized that they had chucked any sort of common sense out the door.

It wasn't so bad I would demand my money back. But there was WAY to much lousy stuff. I don't know how it got such a high rating on IMDb, ballot stuffing by the production company I expect.","5"
"davethejackal","Prometheus? More like Poopmetheus...","4 June 2012","Never mind Von Daniken's ""Mansions of the Gods"", principal influences seem to have been the computer game Dead Space ... and a Johnny Walker commercial.

OK, so Dead Space itself draws heavily on numerous sources, not just Scott's ""Alien"" (John Carpenter's ""the Thing"", ""Event Horizon"") but it is a computer game, and you kinda expect that, they're not really meant to be cinematic masterpieces (though, compared to this movie, it is one) .... when were virus nano machines that could infect a host and mutate it in to, I dunno let's call them ""necromporphs"" shall we(?), ever part of the Aliens universe? Also stolen from Dead Space is quasi religious belief that grows up around an ancient artifacts (or ""markers"" as they say in Dead Space) that gives clues to our alien forefathers. Unlike Dead Space's creepy cult ""unitology"", which are clearly a sideswipe at Scott's own religion Scientology, Prometheus's religious seem to wear crosses in a religion that resembles Christianity/belief in God/belief we were created by aliens/who the floodle knows, even this wasn't thought through enough to make sense.

Scientologists aren't known for taking disrespect well, maybe that's what this is all about, making sure the rumoured Dead Space film project never gets off the ground. Yeah I like that theory, at least it would explain why dross like this ever gets made.

You can see the Johnny Walker commercial on Youtube, just google ""Johnny Walker Human"", it does in a minute what Prometheus fails to do in however many minutes it drags on for.

Other than that: extremely bad science, implausible leaps in logic by characters, levels of stupidity and poor decision making that would make the dimwitted denizens of ""Friday the 13th Part 17"" blush, several obvious internal inconsistencies .... I could go on. The science was so bad, 10 minutes in I was thinking, ""O M G what have they done?"". Androids don't have souls, eh, so everything is meaningless to them is it? W T F ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT!?!?!?

"aaronjbong","Discovering Humanity's Forerunners May Lead to Our Extinction","7 June 2012","What created humanity? Why are we here? Who created us? The answers to these questions are what the characters in ""Prometheus"" seek in this two-hour sci-fi film. In this magnificent two-hour adventure of exploring our beginnings, we are taken to a moon located in a distant galaxy named LV-223 where clues and secrets to humanity's beginnings are kept and where dangers against undiscovered species await.

""Prometheus"" is a prequel to 1979's science-fiction horror masterpiece ""Alien"", also directed by Ridley Scott. It's been over 33 years since that critically acclaimed film influenced the movie industry and aside from James Cameron's ""Aliens"" released in 1986, subsequent films in the series (and that includes the two crossovers ""Alien vs. Predator"" and ""Aliens vs. Predator: Requiem"") have brought disappointment and it must have been painful for Ridley Scott to watch his beloved franchise crumble into pieces. But that all changes with the arrival of ""Prometheus"", the long-awaited prequel to the original ""Alien"" film.

The first moments of ""Prometheus"" show us the beautiful sceneries of Earth in the distant past. Is it Earth? We don't know. Then we see an alien with extremely pale skin and well-built standing by a massive waterfall. However, we don't know where the scene is set. The alien drinks a mysterious black liquid and then vomits. He then disintegrates with his remains falling into the bottom of the massive plunge pool where it morphs into something alive.

We then travel into 2089 where Elizabeth Shaw and Charlie Holloway discover mysterious markings in a cave located in the beautiful Isle of Skye located in Scotland. After comparing these markings with previous markings found in other locations, the archaeologist couple believe that this is an invitation from humanity's ancestors, which they call the Engineers. Then we go to 2093 where we arrive in LV-223 using a vessel called the Prometheus. Then the violent and gory adventure begins.

""Prometheus"" is divided into two parts. The first hour focuses on discovering the magnificent dome located on the moon and examining the various extraterrestrial objects while observing some beautiful visual sets. The second hour of the film is when action sequences become more prominent, when it gets more violent and gory, and when there are many deaths.

Most of the film takes place inside the dome or pyramid located on the moon. It is where most of the story takes place. At first, it seems like an ordinary network of corridors with nothing interesting but as we get more into the film, we discover some horrifying stuff here and the movie starts to get more interesting from there on. The horror scenes are reminiscent of those present in the original ""Alien"". We discover multiple vases filled with disgusting but deadly black liquid, a massive statue of a humanoid head, and corpses of giant aliens (believed to be those of the Engineers').

Even though most of the film takes place in dark and gloomy spots, the visual effects of the film is still one of the strongest highlights of the film. The murals on the ceilings of the dome are very detailed and beautiful. The carvings on the walls of the pyramid are intricate and very meticulous in detail. One of the scenes where David discovers a room and finds a star map highlighting Earth has amazing visual effects. It's one of the bright scenes in the film and is the best scene in terms of visual effects. The holograms and everything incorporated in that scene is a job well done. The 3D is also excellent and it does not disappoint.

Let's talk about the characters now. Sigourney Weaver's Ellen Ripley is now replaced by Noomi Rapace's archaeological character Elizabeth Shaw. She is a strong believer in God and throughout the movie, she still believes that God is the ultimate source of life and creator of everything. However, she's less bad-ass compared to Sigourney Weaver's Ripley but a scene in the movie depicts her sense of feminine strength. Accompanying Shaw is her love interest Charlie Holloway portrayed by Logan Marhsall-Green. Unlike Shaw, Holloway is not a strong believer in God and skeptic. Onboard the ship is the android David portrayed excellently by Michael Fassbender. He is an android who doesn't show feelings and is envious of mankind's feelings. There also others on board the ship: Meredith Vickers, Captain Janek, Millburn, Fifield.

The characters were portrayed excellently from their respective performers. Noomi Rapace didn't give an Oscar-worthy performance but she still delivered a powerful performance. Logan Marshall-Green's portrayal of Charlie Holloway was also strong. Charlize Theron gave one of the more powerful performances in the film as Meredith Vickers. The minor characters were given excellent performances too. However, Michael Fassbender's portrayal of the android David grabs the spotlight. His performance as the android is intriguing and very powerful that for a second, I thought he was portrayed by a real android.

The characters in ""Prometheus"" are driven by intrigue and curiosity. They are so interested in discovering their origins that they would pay any cost to uncover the truth and reach the answer. Their sense of curiosity is what caused the disaster. ""Prometheus"" is later on fueled by extremely intricate sets and amazing visual effects and accompanied by solid performances (a special note to Michael Fassbender's portrayal of David). Whether it's a prequel, sequel, standalone film, ""Prometheus"" is a magnificent film. It's not perfect and it has some flaws but ""Prometheus"" is a must-see film of the summer movie season - and in 3D.

Rating: 9/10

Final Verdict: It may not be perfect but the fantastic sets and visual effects accompanied with extremely powerful performances, especially Michael Fassbender as David, assure that ""Prometheus"" is a must-see movie of the summer.","9"
"leersaunders","Really bad!","17 June 2012","What a shame! This could have been great, but the plot fails and along with shallow characters we wish the whole thing would just end as soon as possible.

Too many loose ends add up to a confusing plot. examples: 1. Why does Guy Pearse play an old dude, when they could of hired an old dude??(at some stage I was expecting him to become younger!)

2. The film starts out nicely with a scene of an alien drinking by a grand waterfall, yet this has nothing to do with anything later on!

3. In the original ""Alien"" film, the crew find the driver sitting in his cockpit, yet here, he tries to kill the last scientist in her ship, thus leaving the chair he is found?

4. Why is Fassbenders character trying to kill the crew?

5. Why are the humanoid aliens in the holograms running towards the crypt that's full of dangerous type of aliens?

6. Why didn't the humanoid alien that's sleeping leave earlier for earth before waiting to be woken-up by Fassbenders character??

The list goes on and on...

This is a very well acted movie , Michael Fassbender as David is nothing short of perfect and for reasons I wont go into as thing it would spoil to much almost seems to be the heart of this movie.

All the other characters are also very well done Noomi and Charlize are great to watch.

"Sharkey360","Enjoyable","6 June 2012","It may not be perfect but Prometheus still is an engaging sci-fi flick that comes with a mix of mystery, science, horror and some notable solid performances.

Director Ridley Scott tells a story that dealt with the search for answers regarding the origin of humanity and similar to his 1979 classic Alien, Prometheus has a star ship and a crew with a mission. At the same time, the famed director made great use of the technology and with his technical team delivering great cinematography, striking effects and most of all a great sense of immersion into the story.

The first half of the film had a strong sci-fi exploration flavor in it laced with mystery. In the second half, the tone changes into suspense, horror and shock all delivered in a fine pace. Along the way, there are lots of elements that connect Prometheus with Alien and for sure the nerds or the more observant moviegoers will have a blast connecting the dots.

The casting is a mixed bag although it is somewhat justified by the time the film ends. Sure there were crew members who are pretty shallow and not worth caring for. Of course, the more notable roles such as David (Michael Fassbender), protagonist Elizabeth Shaw (Noomi Rapace) and Meredith Vickers (Charlize Theron) somewhat made up for the lack of depth from the others.

Noomi Rapace delivered a fine performance as a strong-willed woman who not only searched for answers but also came up with the courage to survive against tremendous odds ala Ellen Ripley (Sigourney Weaver) in Alien.

Charlize Theron is excellent as the beautiful but very cold-hearted Meredith Vickers, and for the most part her presence attracted a feeling of animosity from the viewers. Still, there is also that feeling that before you want to get rid of Vickers, you also would want to know what she knows, what she is after and more.

Michael Fassbender, in my view, stole the show as the android David. He is no copycat of Ash (Alien) or Bishop (Aliens) but rather he stands out as an android that not only tirelessly works to accomplish his goals but also learn about humanity as well as the search for answers on the galactic level. Quite symbolically, David is very much like a living, walking version of HAL (2001: A Space Odyssey) as well as a more sophisticated version of Star Trek: TNG's Data.

Will Prometheus end up as a timeless classic like Alien? That is something we won't find out until decades to come. No box office numbers or any wave of media reviews will be able to justify that because clearly only time will tell if Prometheus will be remembered whether as an indirect prequel to Alien or as its own sci-fi story.

In my honest opinion, Prometheus is a very solid sci-fi flick on its own and definitely it is one of Ridley Scott's best films in a long time.","8"

For me this movie is a betrayal to the any past Alien movies. It is a shame. Deserves 3 to 4 maybe but I want to choose word Awful, that's why I gave 1 as score

Read below spoilers please, so you save your money!!

you can collect a better team from street randomly compare to that discovery team - such a important discovery team with no plan, no disciplined, no report each other. - team members need to make sex regularly, including captain leaves the main deck (easy to get a girl with some stupid conversation, 'mam, are you robot? no! leave the main deck alone and check me, then you decide yourself captain but in my place') - you can act like an idiot all time time, no problem, this even gives you more credit in team - movie was so horrible, doesn't deserve more words :((((((( from start to end, if you don't question anything and can enjoy watching a thriller with a comedy approach, then go.


(when you find a snake like horrible looking creature in another planet surrounding lots of dead alien body, what would you do? - hey look! how sweet this thing, I want to touch you and kiss you.. so exiting.. :)))) above happened in movie :) really funny ha

"atk92","A very polished, nice looking movie. Not much else.","17 January 2013","The title of my review says it all. This movie is visually stunning, one of the best looking films I have seen in years probably. Otherwise, I did not care too much for this movie.

Half of the characters in this movie are canon fodder. They are there simply to be killed, and in some cases only have about 30 seconds to two minutes of screen time. You won't know their names after the movie, because in some instances you won't know their names during the movie. As for the main characters, I can't relate to any of them. Michael Fassbender's David is the most likable character, and he is a robot. This film is a case where sheer stupidity by all characters is necessary for a lot of the plot to happen, and that is a major failing of almost any movie that is of the horror/sci-fiction genre.

I say the understatement of the century when I say that this movie promises answers, but in the end just leaves you with a crap-ton of questions. If you see it and like it, more power to you. As of the time of the review this movie is posting a 7.2 rating, so obviously more people like it than hate it. I would say it is good for entertainment value, but it is obvious that Ridley Scott wanted for it to be more than that. Unfortunately for me it just isn't. It is a polished turd that has fooled some people into thinking it is the best sci-fiction in the last decade.

A Challenge to the Viewers: I challenge anyone who watched this movie, or plans on watching it, to name as many of the characters, by name, as they can by the end, and see in the credits how many you got right. I personally got five or six (out of about eighteen or twenty) and thought I did very well. If you can get half of them, you are amazing.

Don't worry if you do bad. It's not like you forgot any characters worth remembering, cause there aren't any in this movie.","3"

"dave-appleton-242-121346","A bloody awful movie!!","4 June 2012","Seriously I read some of the negative reviews of this movie and thought how can it be that bad? Ridley Scott will be returning to the Alien universe and all will be well! I couldn't have been more wrong!

Let me start by saying that this movies marketing campaign has sucked people in incredibly successfully and lead people to believe that they will be watching a suspense filled, dark and mysterious sci-fi horror which will be reminiscent of the original Alien movie we all know and love. Wrong!

Firstly the movie visually is stunning and Michael Fassbender performs well but honestly folks this is we're the positivity ends in spectacular fashion!!

The story starts out quite well and the shots of the spaceship the planet and Fassbender playing basketball, watching Peter O'Toole in Lawerence of Arabia and doing his hair and I thought well this will be interesting as a movie and have some depth. How wrong I was!!

Once the other character came out of hyper sleep the movie steadily went down hill. The dialogue between the actors mostly seemed unrealistic and forced with most of the characters being a complete waste of casting as they were irrelevant throughout the movie and had zero depth.

What really made me wince were the strange decision some of them made and the movies lack of explanation as to why they did the things they did. An example of this was when Milburn and Fifield get lost in the alien temple after becoming scared when seeing a decapitated Space Jockey and decide to go back to the ship. There is no explanation as to why they become lost and a complete lack of interest from the rest of the crew as to we're they are and their safety. Despite Captain Janek stating to them via radio that Alien life has been detected, he just tells them to go to sleep, very odd!

While still lost they go from being terrified to encountering a large snakelike alien and losing all their fear and start to pet it like a dog. Surprise surprise they both get killed. The whole thing was ridiculous.

These themes continue throughout the movie but to list them in detail would take a long time.

The movie was completely lacking in tension, suspense or scares that made Alien 1979 so gripping and believable. It also opens with a theme about how we as human being have been created and tries to debate the creationist theories against the Darwinist theories but soon unravels into a complete mess and standard slasher in space type movie.

The whole C-Section part of the movies was also pretty poor and was more amusing than scary and the laughable use of Guy Pearce as the old man Peter Weyland was B-Movie standard, I mean why didn't they just use an older actor instead of prosthetics. Terrible.

The dialogue was for the most part pretty dire and this made the characters almost comic book-like when compared to realism of Alien and Ridley Scott's other great movies. This was probably due to Lindlelof's writing but come on surely this had to get passed Scott? What is going on?

I also got the feeling that the movie was rushing along and that story lacked cohesion, jumping around from pillar to post and not giving the audience any time to relate to the characters. This made the film for me feel odd and mostly non-sensical. Scott stated that the movie was a tight cut but the movie was trying to cover too many bases and essentially it then had no identity and felt flat.

There was no explanation as to the motives of the Space Jockey race and their reasons to wanting to destroy Earth leaving the movie open to a sequel but seriously if it is as badly acted and disjointed as this I will not be watching on cinema. No chance!

I could list all the sequences I disliked in this movie but we would be here for some time and quite frankly I could not quite believe that this was made by Ridley Scott considering some of his great movies of the past. Maybe Hollywood these days has to much of a stranglehold on a directors artistic licences these days and will only produce CGI filled garbage that numbs the audiences brains into believing they are watching a quality product. Well in this movie they ain't and I wasn't fooled!!

All I can say is Ridley please give up the ghost and retire!! We can't have you destroying Bladerunner with a sequels like Prometheus.","1"

"zofos","""Did I request thee, Maker, from my clay to mould me man?"" - Paradise Lost","7 June 2012","When Alien first appeared in 1979, it really was a game-changer for the science fiction genre. For the first time, a creature from outer space looked believably extra-terrestrial on screen and had a five-stage life cycle (egg, face-hugger, chest-burster, young adult and adult or warrior as James Cameron calls it) straight out of Biology 101.

James Cameron's Aliens was that rarity, something that respected the first film but nevertheless improved upon it to make one of the best sequels ever made (Sigourney Weaver got an Oscar nomination for her performance, how many sci-fi films can boast about that? Not many).

Alien 3 literally crashed the franchise and, while Alien Resurrection was an improvement, that's not saying much. Alien Vs Predator wasn't bad, Alien Vs Predator: Requiem with annoying teenagers added to the mix was a forgettable misfire to say the least.

And now, 33 years on, original director Ridley Scott has returned to the franchise he kicked off in such dazzling style. Comparisons have been made to George Lucas returning to the Star Wars series to do prequels with mixed results but I believe Ridley Scott's effort here is better than that.

The film starts off with a huge albino giant with killer abs drinking what looks like an eel smoothie and having something awful happen to him (he's like a cross between the Silver Surfer, the monsters in Duran Duran's Wild Boys video and that bald dude from The Hills Have Eyes.) Fast forward 2,000 years to the year 2089. Noomi Rapace plays Doctor Elizabeth Shaw, an archaeologist who discovers primitive cave paintings that seem to point to alien visitation in prehistory. Another fast-forward of four years, finds Shaw on board the spaceship Prometheus in deep space about to stop off at the planet hinted at in the cave paintings. Weyland Industries (the evil company from the first Alien films hasn't merged with Yutani just yet) has funded this exploration to the tune of a trillion dollars.

Charlize Theron and Michael Fassbender are perfect Aryan blondes in the mould of Rutger Hauer and Daryl Hannah from Blade Runner. Theron's character starts out as a cold control freak reminiscent of Nurse Ratched in One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest. When she is prepared to let people die on the planet or even take up a flame-thrower and kill them herself, she becomes something much darker. Later on, it is revealed that she is old Peter Weyland's daughter and, when she refers to her father as a king, it takes on a Shakespearean, King Lear dimension of the old man giving control of his kingdom to his vicious daughter.

Ireland's Michael Fassbender gives another assured, notable performance and he is rapidly bagging all the plum acting gigs going. It is interesting to see him progress as an actor.

Noomi Rapace is impregnated with a precursor of the chest-burster and gives herself an astonishing DIY abortion that has to be seen to be believed. (If this is a prequel to Alien, how come they didn't have all that fancy medical equipment, 360-degree helmets and 3D cave-mapping drones in a time that is supposed to be more technologically advanced? Another question I had was, if it was so easy to infect the space crew by skin contact or airborne droplet infection, why bother evolving into the chest burster? Seems a much faster way of transmission.)

The film is nowhere near as bad as the first reviews suggested. I think it was just the weight of 33 years of expectation not being met (what could live up to the reputation of the classic Alien we all grew up watching again and again on VHS, DVD and now Blu-Ray?) The ending of Prometheus is left tantalizingly open for a sequel with many questions still unanswered and I believe there could be life in the old Star Beast yet.","7"
"griffolyon12","Please, Just Watch Alien Instead","7 December 2012","Certain ideas are interesting in theory, such as having Ridley Scott (director of the original Alien) return to direct an Alien-prequel, called Prometheus. Alas, certain ideas, such as this one, are already setting themselves up for disappointment.

The fact of the matter isn't that Scott and company do not have a story filled with original ideas, it's that the story falls into cliché, horror/action territory, trying to pigeon-hole itself as a prequel to Alien, rather than being its own film. For example, the idea of aliens coming to Earth and creating humans, is an intriguing kind of sci-fi concept that hasn't been committed to celluloid before, however, once the explorers reach the mysterious planet that may harbor all the clues as to where we came from, the film sees fit to play all the same cards as the original Alien. An android with ulterior motives, a questionable mega corporation mogul, tons of crazed monsters running around killing, and a female scientist having to become a hero. The problem is, all of these things have been done, over and over again before, to much better results.

There is a lifelessness to this film about discovering where life originated. It feels as if it's going through all of the motions, trying to put all of the pieces into place for the next installment, rather than innovating and being something truly original. If this film were not beholden to the Alien franchise, I believe Prometheus would not only be a different film, but possibly even a better film, but unfortunately it is what it is, and I just cannot recommend it.

I give Prometheus a 3 out of 10!","3"
"KnightsofNi11","It's cool... but it hurts","9 June 2012","Here it is. The long awaited prequel to Ridley Scott's 1979 masterpiece Alien is finally here. But the question on everyone's minds is, is Prometheus really a prequel in the way we would have all hoped. The answer... not exactly. It definitively puts a backstory on some of the unexplained aspects of Alien (ie Space Jockey) but all in all Prometheus is its own story. It tells the story of a group of scientists who venture into space to discover where all human life and creation began. They hope to find all the answers to civilization, but instead they find something much more incriminating and far more dangerous than they expected. The story is full of twists and turns, and it opens the doors for many new ventures into the Alien universe. Prometheus is essentially a prequel to Alien with its setting up of how the events in Alien came to be, but the main focus of the film's plot is its own original idea that is more or less inspired by what Ridley Scott put together back in 1979.

As far as this original plot goes, it's nothing groundbreaking. It's not much more than what we've seen before, but it still manages to be intriguing and engaging, as well as a whole lot of fun. The verbose storyline here makes for a winding tale of chilling adventure that is equal parts cool and creepy. There's a lot going on here, some of it Alien related, some of it not. The new story developing here is nothing extraordinary, but it will certainly keep you entertained.

Now, when you begin to look at Prometheus as the prequel to Alien, it then starts leaving a little to be desired. The explanations attached to the mystery and ambiguity of Scott's horrific science fiction masterpiece are nothing exceptionally creative or earth shatteringly profound. It's something that makes you go, ""Oh neat,"" or, ""I like what they did there."" Different people will have different outlooks on this but, as far as I'm concerned, if you're not going to make your prequel astoundingly brilliant, it's almost better to leave the mystery as just that, a mystery that fans of Alien get to speculate about for years and years.

Honestly, a part of me is a little disappointed that I now know the backstory to these events. It's a little crushing to know that this is the true explanation and there is no refuting it as it is Ridley Scott's universe, and Prometheus is a Ridley Scott film. As much as I enjoyed this flick, I'd be lying if I didn't say a little part of me died when all was revealed and that beautiful veil of ambiguity was lifted to reveal a less than groundbreaking explanation to it all. It's a Wizard of Oz type experience, and I can't say it doesn't hurt just a little bit.

But all nostalgic nerddom aside, it really is pretty fun to be back in the Alien universe and to experience something of a glimpse into what the backstory behind all this is. And that is just what Prometheus is, fun. It's creepy, it's gross, it's action packed, and it's got some truly great visuals that any sci-fi fan can get excited about. I can't say I didn't enjoy Prometheus but in retrospect I realize what I've lost in seeing this movie. It makes this a terribly bittersweet film, but I'll give it the benefit of the doubt and won't let my science fiction nerdiness get the best of me. Prometheus is a fun film. Definitely see it, but don't allow it to get too rooted into the beloved Alien universe which captivates your mind.","6"
"petra_ste","Script expendable","25 February 2015","For about twenty minutes, Prometheus promises to be the first worthy entry of the Alien franchise since decades: a Lovecraftian thing of awe and terror, a space version of At The Mountains of Madness, enriched by Scott's sumptuous style.

Unfortunately, crisp visuals cannot stop the script from collapsing under silliness and vapid characterization. Only Fassbender's David emerges as a compelling individual, while everyone else is either flat, inconsistent, or a moron: the biologist who runs away from a corpse but stops to pet an alien snake in full threat display mode is already a meme of horror movie idiocy. These lowbrow moments - see also the stoner geologist: it's amazing how much these minor characters hurt Prometheus - clash with the film's lofty ambitions of saying something meaningful about faith, religion and mankind's place in the universe. It's like a Jackass version of Rendezvous with Rama.

Oh, and I like Charlize Theron as much as the next guy, but what exactly was she doing here? How is her Vickers necessary to the plot? Waste of a fine thespian; and the same goes for Idris Elba as the captain and a prune-faced Guy Pearce in bad old man make-up.

Scott complained the Xenomorph was becoming mundane after years of overexposure and tried to shock audiences with new creatures - sadly, the results include a flexible space zombie and a brawl between a giant albino and an humongous squid. Less is more, Ridley.

I'll defend Prometheus on one point, though. Not explaining the Engineers' motivations has been criticized, but it's the ONE THING the script nailed. The moment you start exposing the thought process of a powerful alien race, sci-fi steers towards parody. It's one of the few ideas here worthy of an Alien prequel (sort of). Even Spielberg and Shyamalan, not exactly masters of subtlety, had the good sense of letting their aliens in War of the Worlds and Signs keep their mouths shut.

Not a total disaster, but a tragically missed occasion. Then again, while Scott's first three movies (The Duellists, Alien, Blade Runner) are among my favorites, almost everything else he has done since has left me disappointed.

That trailer surely looked great though.

The acting, cinematography effects galore, soundtrack, and Sci-Fi is magnificent! I guess the writing is a little sloppy once that's voided out the rest is very enjoyable especially as a reimagining of Alien.

"shaunmichaelgreene","Perfect Movie - Bad Reviews Are Result of Flawed Expectations","10 June 2012","I found this movie to be completely perfect. The acting was top notch, the visuals and effects were stunning, the plot was smartly developed and kept the tension at an all time high, and even the score was brilliant.

Of course, I had done my homework on the movie leading up to it. I had read several times that this movie was not intended to be a direct prequel to Alien, although would take place in the same universe. Ridley Scott had already come forward and said that traditional xenomorph would not be a part of this film, but that one would begin to notice the ""DNA"" so to speak. I've seen a lot of discussion from upset fans regarding the absence of the xenomorph and the loose connection to the alien franchise.

The entire movie is about origins (hence not showing facehuggers, classic xenomorphs, etc), and does a great job exploring the concept. It asks the questions that people don't like to hear, and leaves the most jarring and ambiguous unanswered. It was also set up wonderfully for a sequel, which I highly anticipate.

If you wanted to see a movie with the same old aliens, action, and every question getting answered and every loose end tied up - go see an action movie. Or better yet, stay home and re-watch Aliens! Scott did a wonderful job with this movie. He gave the fans what they wanted to see without rolling over and catering to their every demand. He kept Prometheus' integrity and allowed it to stand on its own 2 feet alone, while at the same time expanding the alien universe. I can't think of any changes that could make the movie better (while still keeping in mind that this is a Hollywood production and a business - they have to protect their best interests and maximize profit and thus make a sequel). 10/10 stars, perfect.","10"
"reknob","RIP Ridley Scott the film maker","3 June 2012","I shan't compare this to other ""Alien"" movies because, frankly, I think it's irrelevant.

I shall, however, judge it as a film on its own merits.

This is a very, very poorly made film.

The narrative arc (is there one??)/script are wholly lacking, there are GAPING holes left all over the place such that quality actors have to deliver CRINGEWORTHY exposition lines to let you know what the hell is going on. Nor is there any sense of discovery here at all which is absolutely criminal given the synopsis. The pacing, or lack of it, never once let's you settle into any kind of immersive atmosphere, save perhaps for the first 30 minutes or so.

Fassbender (especially) and Rapace are the standouts here, everyone else would have served the film better if they had simply not turned up for shooting so they could be scrubbed from the ""script"". I'm not having a go at the supporting actors as they can only work with what they've been given but honestly, there are quality actors here having to deliver truly embarrassing work.

Are there good things here? Yes, visually, at times, it is stunning although the too-fast pacing often sees incredible imagery on screen for painfully short periods crushing your immersion. Also, the one stand-out scene left me reeling and bonding with Rapace's character - the only time I felt tension and horror during the entire film. The first thirty minutes or so are spell-binding including the introduction to Fassbender's character who we see watching a legendary movie (also a personal favourite of mine and one in which the main character is also on a journey of self-discovery).

However, from thirty minutes in, it's all downhill.

I cannot for the life of me understand how Ridley Scott let this film get away from him so badly.

Scott made his name with his first three films, showing stupendous ability at creating immersive atmospheres with exquisite attention to detail - The duellists, Alien and Bladerunner. These are films that I watch at least twice per year.

The fact that he since went down the Hollywood blockbuster route has been of constant disappointment to me. While he likely ballooned his own net worth, in my opinion he has created nothing of much worth for anybody else since, certainly nothing towards the art of film making. OK, so he went for money and ego instead of craft and art, it's his life and his choice but I never thought that he would treat a legacy such as Alien with such consummate disrespect - this is shameful work from someone who, at least used to be, capable of so much more ...

I would like to think that this film was destroyed in the editing room and that there's 20 minutes or so of ""extra"" narrative-laden material that was dumped for the oh-so-superfluous ""action"" scenes that made it to the final cut. Swap those in on a Bluray Director's Cut (sic) and maybe this can be lifted from its theatrical release level of shame ...","4"
"ritera1","Stick a fork in Ridley","23 June 2012","The main problem is that it had no heart. Want a movie that looks great? This is your movie. (Which means he wins the award for spending money.)

It wasn't even that cool. Some good elements like Theron and Fassbinder. Rapice wasn't even that good, which was surprising.

But it was a monster movie. Not a psychological piece about man meeting his maker, or God.

Everything was anti-climatic and bland. We knew from the ads that it was aliens as the daddies of man. We knew that the alien ship was going to crash at the end. We knew that Aliens were somewhere in the mix.

What was the corporate intent? The old man wanted to meet God. But Fassbinder's android had another idea infecting the crew? Why? I thought Thereon was behind capturing the Alien but she turned out to just have daddy issues.

And early on. Doctor couple finds the solar system on cave painting. Okay. It's an ""invitation"". But in the end it wasn't. They ""invited"" the human race to their weigh station (as it wasn't the home planet)? We needed a reason to go to the planet in the beginning but turned out to be stupid in the end.

A few ""pops"", so to speak, where overlooked. The creature in the husband's eye. Blah (which I just saw on an even worse ""Falling Skies""). The supposed dead old man appears at the end. Blah. The old man is Thereon's daddy. Blah. The alien stumbles out of the sleep chamber. Blah. The pilot and those two other guys decide to hurdle the ship and themselves into the alien ship. ""Okay, guy?"" ""Uh, sure. Why not?"" Blah.

(I do get why the alien daddy hated humans and Earth. He probably went under around when W was elected the 2nd time.)

What about when they all woke up. Nobody had met anybody else? It was very labored to tell us this several times. They couldn't have a cup of coffee beforehand? It felt awkward.

And for all of Scott's slamming of the other Alien movies, the 2nd-4th had pretty decent characters that you cared about. This had cardboard cutouts xerox'd from the other films.

Like the mohawk geologist who launched the balls that mapped the caves. He had the map and couldn't get out of the cave? And he and his buddy with glasses turned into clowns. And those guys were the better of the lot.

It was very convenient that the aliens videotaped themselves doing everything in grainy hologram and Fassbinder cue'd both up at just the right time.

And it was mentioned briefly in IMDb. How did Fassbinder talk alien?

Also, the alien daddy woke up in a sleep chamber and decapitated Fassbinder. Then the alien launched the ship from a different compartment? And then left the sleep chamber behind? Somebody said to me that it was one in the same. But I don't recall seeing the alien daddy and his chair in the compartment when Rapice picked up Fassbinder and his head after the crash.

They missed a SPLAT sound effect when Thereon was crushed by the ship.

I don't know. My hope eclipsed my common sense. I would have been fine waiting for DVD.","7"
"agmoldham","Not as good as Alien","17 July 2012","I tend to avoid film reviews before seeing a film where possible. I did hear that Prometheus was supposed to be like Alien though and there was a lot of discussion about whether it was a prequel. The problem with having a film likened to a classic is that your expectations are set very high.

There's no doubt at all that Ridley Scott has directed another very fine sci-fi movie, but it isn't quite in the same league as Alien. As with every film the key thing that depends on your enjoyment is how much you care about and relate to the characters. In contrast to Alien I found that I didn't really care about many of the characters in Prometheus. This means that the action does not really quite carry the same impact.

For all that it was reasonably enjoyable and well worth a watch. Just don't expect it to be as good as Alien!","5"
"sddavis63","Ridley Scott's Failed Return To The Alien Sci-Fi Genre","22 February 2013","Ridley Scott, of course, made his first significant directorial splash with ""Alien"" - a long, long time ago now. He basically left outer space, alien sci fi behind after that one and went with more mainstream material, and ""Prometheus"" was really his re-entry to that genre. The influence of ""Alien"" is obvious in this. There are lot of connections, and a lot of similarities. One thing I liked about ""Alien"" was that it didn't seem to set out to scare the pants off the viewer. It was a tense type of movie, with a lot of suspense, but not much by way of real horror or gore. This was probably a bit heavier on the horror/gore metre than ""Alien"" was, but not much. But it didn't capture the overall atmosphere of that earlier effort by Scott.

To really work, this type of movie has to have at least one of three things going for it. It either has to be frightening, or it has to be suspenseful, or it has to have a pretty interesting moral or ethical or philosophical reflection going on at its heart. I didn't think ""Prometheus"" really accomplished any of that, and because of that I can't say that the story really managed to pull me in. There were moments of horror; there were moments that made me jump a little - but they were few and far between. At the base of the movie is a philosophical reflection about the origin of life, with some attention made to religion, God, etc., but while that was there, it was never really central, nor was it ever really satisfactorily resolved, with the end result being that this often seemed to lack a clear focus. What was Ridley Scott trying to accomplish with this? What statement was being made? What impact was it supposed to have on the viewer? I'm really not able to answer any of those questions.

Neither the cast nor the characters held me spellbound. I thought the performances were a bit dry, and the character development was rather weak. Aside from Dr. Shaw (Noomi Rapace) I can't say that I really got drawn into anyone's story in particular, so I really didn't care that much for them.

In the end, ""Prometheus"" disappointed me. Perhaps Ridley Scott, in returning to the genre that made him famous, tried too hard to make ""Prometheus"" a reflection of ""Alien,"" but it didn't work very well. (3/10)","3"
"OneAnjel","Money grab and some good CGI","11 October 2023","Ok, yes, I'm a fan of Alien (but not the franchise, just the original film). And I am a huge fan of science fiction. For some reason, I've never seen Prometheus before -- I might have thought it was actually about the Greek god. Fast forward to present day and I find myself looking for some good Halloween films to commemorate the month. I can see it's very dated and, in my minds eye, even more-so than Alien (1979). The short of it is that I felt this film was just a money grab and a school-boy glee at the modern CGI of the day.

Here's a summary: Entertaining = 5 * CGI = 8 * Dialog = 3 * Acting = 4 * and finally Story = 6 * The story itself was not horrible but had the gratuitous plot holes in order to make the story work. Unlike many reviews, though, I don't see it as a possible insight into our human existence. This type of philosophy has been around since the beginning of time, the idea that perhaps our creator is from outer space. In fact, it was taught in college in the 60s and 70s in most philosophy courses - the what ifs.

And as the title points out, the film is literally based on an ancient Greek myth but with the perspective of gods being aliens amid many and varied differences to the original tale.

Apparently, this film has been highly criticized all over the globe for years, so I probably don't need to go into too much detail on my list, such as the ridiculous decisions made by the team, putting themselves at risk; or the fact that no one could have their muscle cut through one hour and then lift themselves up over edge after edge (never even accomplished on Ultimate Beastmaster) the next hour, and I also thought the Ace bandages fashioned into a bikini for Shaw's dip into the surgical bed had to have been done for humor since undies and bra would have served the same purpose. Guys, was that sexy or just silly? And how about what a motley crew the world's most wealthy scientist gathered for this all-important task. Should I at least mention how completely anticipated it was that David was programmed to put the crew in danger if necessary. Where have I seen that before (tapping temple).

In many ways, Prometheus is just an attempt at remaking Alien but on a much smaller budget and with less interesting characters. And at the very end, who do we see? I gave a big eye roll there. But it is 11 years later and, in its time, perhaps this was a decent film. It's arguably one of the earliest ""prequel"" style films to a franchise. My biggest question as the film ended was: Is Vickers an android? If David is Weyland's son (or closest thing to), was his daughter a similar offspring? They certainly wanted us to think she was.

There were some noteworthy moments, such as when the crew did the suicide mission to stop the monster ship; and then when Shaw decided to keep exploring instead of going back to Earth - I thought that was an unexpected twist. But over all, the characters severely lacked depth and there were some missed opportunities, for instance if we had disliked Vickers a bit more, her demise would have been a highlight. I didn't hate the film but I thought it was more of a missed opportunity -- unless your main focus was to present the state of the art CGI of the day. Then it was fairly successful.

I glanced but didn't see a Prometheus II where we could find out if Shaw made it to her destination and why the mother race was destroyed and wth those pod things were. But it's sci-fi so the point is the thrill. I'm glad they didn't try to actually answer like that bore-fest, Contact. But it was too cut and dry and, therefore, missed a lot of opportunity, like Ender's Game.","4"
"sandy-462","So much of this movie could have been easily fixed...","6 June 2012","Don't get me wrong. It's gorgeous to look at, and I'm definitely going to go and see it again. It's really impressive.

But... It's stuffed with scenes without any payoff. Again and again it sets stuff up and then just... walks away from it.

In at least one unforgivably stupid scene, someone *literally* just walks away from an antagonist and leaves it there. And then doesn't tell anyone about it. Some of it's really effective. There are some scenes that are absolutely gripping. But so much of it doesn't make any sense...

Having said all that I think it's very clear that what I just saw was Prometheus part 1. It's very definitely supposed to have a sequel and I will certainly go to see the sequel. I think both movies taken together might score a 10.

"oceanic_osprey","So close and yet so very, very far.","5 June 2012","Greetings all.

I will attempt to write this in as polite and unbiased manner as I know how. My thoughts upon the film ending were simply ""What the hell was that?"" And now for the explanation. Firstly, I shall start with what redeeming features are present and the merits which were, so unfortunately, massively outweighed by faults.

The visuals were highly impressive, but so are most these days and thus I cannot allow much praise for that which I expect of any high budget movie. The opening sweeping scene however, was highly enjoyable complemented by the grandiose musical theme. In fact, generally the first half of this film was decent enough, it all goes to pot once they land on this planet and begin exploration, but I digress. From the cast I found Fassbender a believable, emotionless entity aside from that most seemed the stereotypical types you could spot as ""alien"" fodder from the outset. Without out giving too much away the Engineer species this motley crew seek were fairly uninspired in appearance and did little to increase the supposed tension.

In summary the opening, visuals and the score are the best parts. I can't say much for the sets as they seem to be primarily taken from a certain franchise we're convinced is not present here.

I have watched all the Alien films with varying degrees of satisfaction. But I came to this with relatively low expectations, as is my charge with modern cinema, so that I might be pleasantly surprised.

It becomes derivative and confused once it gets going. Some questionable actions of the crew alone caused me to admittedly scoff and huff in disbelief. To name a few instances, how can surgical staples hold stomach muscles together to be sufficiently athletic and mobile? Would a geologist that makes mapping equipment get so easily lost? Why would there be no armed escort into what one should logically assume is a hostile environment? I was left wanting more answers than I was given, unlike the characters who for the most part had an answer to everything with their child-like back and forth dialogue.

Disappointment is the order of the day here. Do not even attempt to comprehend what goes on, otherwise you might give yourself an aneurysm.

In even greater summary. First half good, second half overly bad - we're in dire territory.","3"
"ian_span","In space no one can hear you whatever.","7 June 2012","What was the purpose of the movie? To reveal the circumstances that led to Alien? Well, I wish, I never knew about them because there is some weird stuff going on. The Alien, one of the most iconic monsters in movie history, is a mutated worm. Sort of, I think, but not quite because it is a child of a normal and mutated/infected/something human I better just give you the recipe.

How to make an Alien: 7 easy steps.

1 Put a black liquid on a worm- you get a pre-facehugger.

2 Forget about it.

3 Put the black liquid on a man- you get a sick man.

4 Find him a woman to make sweet love to. She'll give birth to another giant squid- like pre-facehugger.

5 Find an extraterrestrial with a 100% human DNA and let the pre- facehugger do its oral rape thing- you get a pre-alien.

6?

7 John Hurt.

Am I clear enough? No? You don't say! There are other important revelations. The space jockey's race are actually tall bluish humans in space suits (wtf), who created mankind because and then decided to eradicate us because. The black liquid may or may not have anything to do with it. Prometheus is the name of a ship. Charlize Theron likes it black. Weyland is a senile old man.

So I am sitting in the theater trying to figure out the nonsense happening and I recalled all the jabber from Ridley Scott about how this is something like a prequel, but not exactly, sort of re-imagining of the universe and so on. You know what? It is much simpler than this. It is a remake that reboots the franchise. He did not want to tell you because you would most probably have given him the finger. They made it work, more or less, as a prequel. But if Alien is about Ripley then Prometheus (and sequels) is about the New Chick.

Am I OK with a fresh start? Yes, I guess. Is, however, the movie any good? Hardly. To me it ruins most of the iconic mysteries in the franchise. The story is sloppy. Because of the whole mankind origin storyline it feels more like a Stargate spin-off. Good God, they did not find anything under the pyramids. Oh, wait, they found a star map drawn in a cave. Classy. For every good scene, there is one illogical or frankly dumb. The movie is not scary (rated 12+ here), not thrilling, not action-packed and spectacular. Then again it's not the worst thing out there. It's just the fourth (or the fifth, if you will) very uneven and ill-conceived attempt to re-do the original Alien. Actually the most memorable thing was the theater response at the end- a collective 'meh'. What is your rating for 'meh'- 5, 6, 7?

"Denoument","Strong premise, good cast, solid design but ultimately disappointing, and here's why...","30 May 2012","There is not a review bad enough to prevent someone from seeing a Ridley Scott film, nor should there be, because one does have to see with his own eyes to believe just how bad this one is.

The major flaw is undoubtedly the story itself, or the lack thereof. The absence of structure leaves the impression that no choices were made, not only in the writing phase, but in the editing room as well. While certain scenes seem redundant, some unconvincing, there are those that are downright ridiculous. There is no suspense, save for a few weak attempts to hide the obvious. The sense of gradual progress is missing and any interest that may have been sparked by the opening sequence swiftly wears off.

The lack of character development does not help either. One-dimensional characters do not provoke any emotion. Even the protagonists do not stand out, despite the attempt to bring back, or rather chronologically speaking, pave way for Sgt. Ripley in Dr. Shaw.

Dialogues are weak. Even the most benevolent audience could not but laugh at lines that were not meant to be funny. And this was as a benevolent an audience as it gets, given the fact that everyone had waited for months for this film to come out and cued for at least two hours to buy a ticket.

The film was promoted as the latest achievement of the director of Alien and Gladiator. The Kingdom of Heaven was conveniently forgotten and this film would share the same fate on the posters promoting the director's future efforts if it were only up to the artistic criteria. However, box-office will most likely determine whether a new franchise will be made based on the open ending.

Had it been someone else's film it would have deserved two stars, owing to the strong, good and solid points mentioned in the title, however, as it heavily milked the allure of the Alien mythology and the director's reputation, one star is all it gets.","1"
"ConsistentlyFalconer","Rammed full of lunacy.","28 June 2015","Well I liked it.

Despite the characters frequently deciding to act in a completely illogical fashion; despite the massive plot holes; despite Guy Pearce's dodgy makeup; despite Logan Marshall- Green's character being an absolute bellend; despite all this, and the fact it'll never even come close to matching up to the 1979 original (one of my favourite films of all time) I liked it.

It's partly the visual aspect - it does look tremendous. I also really rated Marc Streitenfeld's magnificent score.

But most of all, I think I just enjoyed how many batshit crazy ideas Ridley Scott and his writers managed to cram into it. A lot of other films would have had me throwing my hands up in despair, but I just went with this one and I'm glad that I did.

Always good to see Benedict Wong on screen, and a rare instance of Idris Elba not being in The Wire and not being completely rubbish.

Verdict: Treat it like a massive-budget Grindhouse movie and you'll be fine.

"engstfeld","Very disappointing","16 June 2012","The effects and visuals were good, great even, but this was a horribly written story. I don't think 3D did much for it either. The characters were thin, the movie seemed to have hardly any significant dialog, and there was almost no suspense whatsoever. This is arguably, for all the hype, Ridley Scott's biggest dud.

Basically, a trend is detected in the paintings and carvings of ancient civilizations that allow us to determine the origin of a solar system with a planet that has a hospitable moon on it. Based on the geometry of five stars. Seems like quite a stretch, but OK. So you'd expect that the best of the best would be gathered to go investigate, right?

Instead a motley crew of some of the world's most unprofessional ""scientists"" are randomly gathered up and sent to a foreign world to search for the origins of life. Clearly a grand mission involving tons of money and planning you'd think. The characters were stored in some sort of bio-stasis device which allowed them to sleep off the 2 plus year's journey. Once awake and past their travel sickness, they acted as if this was the first time they'd ever met. No joke. The movie was fine until this point and then it spirals pointless and hopelessly out of control hereafter. Highly illogical and nonsensical decisions are made, often for no reason whatsoever. Characters that were freaked out by almost nothing are then completely calm over what should have been alarming situations.

Some examples: In one scene, the ""robot"" (as the humans refer to him and who is of similar mold to the android from Alien) knowingly and purposefully infests a character with a pathogen that leads to the character's demise. No reason is given for this act, but you expect to learn later in the movie why and that explanation never comes. The sinister nature of the act is reminiscent of the behavior of the android from the movie Alien. Also, the movie resorts to the same cliché it borrows from Alien, with the android's head getting severed off, but alive and speaking, albeit this time without the gelatinous ooze spewing from its mouth (perhaps Scott thought that too much of a cliché).

And the award for most unbelievable character went to the geologist, whose person looks and behaves like a street punk, is a stoner, and who after learning that there aren't any rocks available to look at, forgoes any further scientific curiosity and elects to abandon the main body of scientists (along with another scientist) while on the planet and in the abode of a strange temple-like complex and manages to get lost. This despite only having to basically make one right or left turn to head back in the correct direction inside of a ""C"" shaped structure. OK.

And it goes from there and gets no better and you can read some of the other reviews that will give you more of what made this movie so very disappointing for those of us who were big fans of the Alien series.

To sum it up, while the movie touched on elements of 2001: A Space Odyssey, Blade Runner, and Alien, it lacked all of the charm that made those movies great. Perhaps, in part, because we'd already seen these unique elements before in these earlier movies. The biggest fault of this movie was that it lacked any real ingenuity, and only repackaged the novel parts from these earlier movies and added nothing of its own.","3"
"RichardSRussell-1","I Bet the Science Adviser Asked for an Alias","8 June 2012","Prometheus (2:04, R, Imax, 3-D) — 6 — SF, biggie, original

Prometheus is solid science fiction riddled with mushy science. These are just the blunders I bothered to note:

  A tracking shot of the night sky used 3-D effects to show some stars nearer than others. At interstellar distances, no parallax would be evident.

  The 6-circle pattern the archeologists recognize from a variety of ancient drawings all over Earth was not of a distant star system but of a distant PLANETARY system, as if the planets were always in the exact same spatial relationship to each other.

  The atmosphere on the surface of the world our team is exploring supposedly has too high a density of carbon dioxide to breathe safely, but once they go DOWN into a cave, it magically disappears. But CO2 is 54% denser than air; if anything, it would be MORE concentrated the deeper you go.

  By the same token, if it really were well below zero (whether Celsius or Fahrenheit) as reported, you wouldn't have running water, and you WOULD be able to see your breath.

Here are some additional improbabilities that aren't exactly unscientific but don't really make any sense:

  The crew has been kept in suspended hibernation for the 2-year journey, except for David (Michael Fassbender), the android counterpart to HAL 9000. After they're revived, they're briefed on what to expect. There's no reason the briefing couldn't have been conducted BEFORE they departed, when some serious questions could have been raised about what to be prepared for when there was still a chance TO prepare.

  The non-aerodynamic starship Prometheus arrives over its target world and just heads on in, without conducting a preliminary mapping survey from orbit. There is no obvious or stated need for haste. The captain (Idris Elba's Janek) makes everyone else sit down and strap in, but he himself stands without support behind a big metal railing looking out a big shatterable window smack dab in the front of the ship.

  The chain of command of the 17-person crew is horribly screwed up, with a captain, a pair of archeologists (Noomi Rapace's Elizabeth Shaw and Logan Marshall-Green's Charlie Holloway), and a company woman (Charlize Theron's Meredith Vickers) each nominally in charge. This too would have been cleared up before departure by any sane planner.

  The equivalent of the Colonial Marines are more like street thugs and perform poorly under stress. Really? A planetful of mercenaries to choose from for this trillion-dollar expedition, and this is the best they could come up with?

  It's 2093, and we have a European scientific team quoting inches. INCHES!

  Upon discovering the unaccountably low CO2 levels, this team of ""scientists"" decides it's OK to remove their helmets, because after all, what could possibly go wrong if the air is breathable?

  Equipped with anti-gravity laser mapping spheres and navigational beacons that can transmit thru mountains, 2 team members wander off and manage to get lost in the tunnels of the cliff-like ""pyramid"" they're exploring.

  They drag this dessicated head of a space alien back to the ship to perform an autopsy on it, and who gets to do it? The doctor? No. The biologist? Nope. It's the archaeologist! Way to put together a team, guys!

  A woman is impregnated and gives birth via C-section less than 12 hours later to something that looks like it runs a good 5 kilos. Its sole source of that material was her body, so she should be exceedingly debilitated, to say nothing of having been sliced open and summarily stapled shut. Yet she performs like a trouper for the next hour.

  I will cut the aliens some slack over their unaccountable preference for lumps, bumps, ridges, wrinkles, corrugations, and protuberances in their architecture. It doesn't make any sense from an engineering standpoint, but hey, they're ALIENS!

  And here's a final hint. If you're fleeing desperately from a giant rolling wheel, do not run directly away from it. Run crosswise to its path. Idiots!

The acting here is horribly mannered. I was hoping for just ONE naturalistic moment like the famous ""Game over, man! Game over!"" that Bill Paxton reportedly ad-libbed in Aliens (which was set in the same universe about 80 years later), but no: Stiff and stilted is the order of the day.

What, then, all downers? Not in the other departments. The production design is fantastic in both senses. The story is gargantuan in scope. There are moments of genuine suspense and heroism, believably depicted. There are at least 2 layers of mystery, cunningly resolved. There is a fall and redemption. There is another fall that just keeps going. Corporate greed is pitted against superstition and religion, a battle which I liken to vampires vs. werewolves vs. zombies, in that I hope they all lose, and for the most part they do. There was effective use of 3-D in the opening waterfall scene, in the long slow glide over the monochrome wasteland of the distant moon (actually Iceland), in the thrashing tentacles of one of the bit players, and especially in the holographic maps that showed the progress of the exploratory team.

Sadly, these genuine accomplishments don't suffice to make me overlook the one-dimensional performances and the many incongruities and improbabilities — ALL OF WHICH COULD HAVE BEEN AVOIDED if the writers (Jon Spaihts and Damon Lindelof) had consulted a decent science adviser. Or even me.

I had high hopes for this film. Director Ridley Scott, after all, gave us Alien and Blade Runner, plus the non-genre films American Gangster, Black Hawk Down, and Thelma & Louise, so we know he's got greatness in him. This is not an example of it. Sorry.","6"
"tomcat-350-27521","Not worth watching!","10 June 2012","This is a terrible disappointment. What happened to Ridley Scott? The same what happened to George Lucas, David Lynch and many great Hollywood directors.

There are simply no words describing the boredom and sketchiness of this flick. Characters are shallow or totally empty, they actually have no characters. Most of them just stare at computer screens in a shock, or at alien artifacts with the same face. If we asked an amateur middle school acting class to perform something ""Alienic"", probably this would be the result. What we see on the silver screen defy the laws of physics, logic, and whatever comes. Heck, it even defies the Alien universe! For example, what the heck was the deal with the guy who turned into an invincible zombie? There was never anything like that, and we get no explanation. Or how come they have fancy 3D hologram user interfaces for their computers, yet the story predates the Nostromo's demise, where we only see randomly flashing lights and keyboards? The storyline is a catastrophe. A lot of events happen which are not explained and do not fit into the previous episodes' concepts. The characters often act against common sense, especially the two scientists who lose their way in the alien ship. Just how stupid should you be to start taunting an obviously hostile alien life form in an alien planet which you have just explored? Also, Mr. Weyland's mask seems like from an 1980 kids' movie. Why didn't they simply hire an old actor to play this role? A guy in a rubber mask in 2012 is simply ridiculous, at least they should have added some CGI.

Some people love this movie for being so ""spectacular"". Sure it is: another CGI porn. Anyone with some taste or common sense must avoid this movie, as it is awful, and not even worth downloading, let alone paying for it.","1"
"slobinchair","This film strangely works better when revisited...","23 November 2022","On first viewing I gave this film a begrudging 5/10. It is visually stunning, the larger than life engineers stuck in my mind and I wouid think about them from time to time. This would prompt me to rent Prometheus every couple of years and watch it again. I realised on the third viewing that my initial disappointment was because Scott hadn't made the Alien related film that I wanted to see... it didn't answer any questions that were promised in trailers and advertising blurb so I felt let down. He did however make a good film that is atmospheric, energetic and above all entertaining. This review is based on my third viewing and I really liked it, I wasn't hampered by what I wanted anymore. I allowed for plot holes, various errors in continuity and suspended disbelief, the result was a most enjoyable and much needed escape from reality for a not too long 2 1/2 hours. Oh... and... yes the tall engineers still haunt my mind 😊","8"
"pfgpowell-1","24-carat b*llocks with great CGI (if that's your thing. Me, I like a little more)","26 August 2016","Ridley Scott does know how to put on a spectacle, but in Prometheus, a kind of Alien prequel, he seems to have forgotten how to tell a tale. And no amount of CGI jiggery-pokery, flashing lights, super-modern looking spaceships and the rest can make up for a poor tale very badly told.

Setting the scene is rudimentary if not an insult to the viewer, the characters are two-dimensional stereotypes with not an ounce of motivation among them, plot elements are peremptorily introduced merely to justify one scene, then forgotten, and to call the the whole storytelling aspect to this film a complete mess would be pulling one's punches. What was Ridley Scott thinking?

Prometheus will surely satisfy any young viewer under the age of 13 who will take on trust what goes on and instinctively understand it all. Those over 13, though, will find themselves increasingly looking at their watch and wondering how much longer it will go on.

I shan't spend a moment pointing out the ridiculous plot holes, inconsistencies and the rest, because that would be futile. And ironically a good film can get away with and be forgiven plot holes and inconsistencies, but Prometheus isn't that film: it is superficial bombastic nonsense with barely a redeeming feature except the special effects and those are now ten a penny in all Tinseltown blockbusters. Sad, but true.","4"
"deltaforce7","Way below any reasonable expectations","1 October 2012","*This review may contain spoilers*

I am a huge fan of the first two Alien movies, so I guess my standards as well as my expectations for any Alien sequel/prequel are high. Unfortunately, the only bright spot of the whole film was unexpectedly interesting performance of Michael Fassbender as the android David. True, his part has its share of stupidities and inconsistencies, but it is at least watchable most of the time. I am sure that by now you can guess that the vast majority of reviewers here were unhappy with the Prometheus film. Instead of repeating the others and giving you my general impression, I will try to highlight the worst stupidities and inconsistencies that this movie is entirely made of. 1) In the beginning of the movie, one of the Space Jockeys, an Engineer as later called, arrives to prehistoric Earth and dramatically dissolves himself into a bunch of molecules in order to populate the planet. Why such dramatic sacrifice was necessary, especially if seemingly a few years later the Engineers decided to destroy their creations using the unruly Xenomorphs? 2)If the Engineers and the humans share precisely the same DNA structure, then why don't both species look more alike? 3) Also, if the first Engineer on Earth who dissolved himself, released the ""building blocks of life"" into a river"", then why people did not evolve as water-living creatures, but instead prefer to live on dry ground? I mean, humans cannot exist under water. Plus, if the Engineers created ALL life on Earth (animals and such in addition to humans), then how come people do not share the same DNA with fishes, birds, reptiles, amphibians, insects and so on? 4) If those archaeologists in this movie discovered so many ancient depictions of the Engineers visiting Earth (as a matter of fact, there are many somewhat similar actual drawings that do depict human-like creatures flying spaceships, wearing space suits and such; do some research), then why all those cave wall drawings point at the stellar system where the Space Jockeys established a small military base? Wouldn't it be more logical for the Engineers to be pointing at their home world, to the place of their origin? 5) Alright, so later on a private corporation (then just Weyland - not Weyland/Yutani) funds this space expedition. Seemingly only about 80 years from today there are interstellar spaceships capable of faster-then-light speeds, there are androids and whatever not. I do not expect this to be happening so soon. HOWEVER, if this is such a well-funded expedition, then why the entire crew of the Prometheus vessel carries around the 8 AA-battery powered LED flashlights that are sold on eBay today? Those three-beam LED flashlights that they use are Fenix TK45, and I own one. Why couldn't they make a prop flashlight or a night vision device that would look and function more futuristically? 6) It is quite unbelievable how this fully automated spaceship arrives so precisely to the right planet (or moon) without any preliminary research. The crew makes a decision to LAND without being certain that there is anything on this planet worth landing. Why were they so sure? In the case of LV426 (in the Alien/Aliens movies) there was that emergency beacon signaling from the Space Jockey's spaceship. And the beacon allowed the USCSS Nostromo to be guided to the right spot. What guided the Prometheus? A wild guess based on the prehistorical cave wall drawings? 7) Why the Prometheus space vessel lands in its entire bulk? I mean, is it feasible of efficient to be landing and taking off the WHOLE interstellar spaceship? I mean, that thing is big and heavy! And its interstellar engines and power sources must be useless for planetary landings and take offs, so they are nothing but a huge amount of dead weight. In both Alien and Aliens movies they used MUCH smaller and lighter vessels to land and take off, which does make scientific sense. I mean, while a landing vessel is on a planet, the rest of the interstellar ship (the mother ship) is safer and better off remaining in space. 8) Before landing of the surface of LV223, the crew of Prometheus did not bother to do any research and investigation of the planet. Only by chance the ""alien structures"" were VISUALLY discovered later on during the final descent. 9) Once the Prometheus ship lands, there is no investigation of the surrounding environment, they do not scan or drill ground around the alien structures therefore missing the Space Jockeys' ships buried a few inches under top soil. 10) At first, most of the crew does not seem to know what they are after, why they were hired for this important expedition, so they get introduced to their mission by watching a lousy 3D presentation that mostly shows this old Peter Weyland fellow and his stupid dog. 11) I don't even have to mention that all those ""top scientist"" are consistently unscientific in their actions, their attitudes, their inability to properly cooperate. What was the purpose of hiring those mostly weird amateurs? They did not even have a lot of common sense, so one cannot even begin to discuss their ""professionalism"". 12) Why weapons would not be allowed to be carried on a ""scientific"" mission? When someone is on such a mission, does it automatically guarantee one's safety? I mean, peacekeepers and medics involved in military conflicts (read: hostile environments) are not safe, although everyone knows how to tell a doctor or a peace keeper from an enemy combatant. But aliens couldn't tell a scientist from walking and talking fast food! So, who can assure safety of the scientists working on an alien planet full of hostile life forms? Right, no one can. So, proper weapons are necessary for basic self defense.","1"
"Westeire","Great Movie (if you liked Alien)","16 September 2012","I really loved this movie, it was well made. Noomi Rapace did a great Job. Fantastic to see the Girl with the Dragon tattoo back on screen. Movie is not to everyones taste. If you didn't like Alien you won't like this movie. If you did like alien then you will enjoy the movie. I won't spoil with too many details, but the ""operation scene"" was true alien genre. I liked the actors in the movie, it was great on Big screen. I found the movie engaging from the start. I have to say it was money well spent going to see this movie. I can see a sequel to it appearing soon or so the ending would suggest, I think Noomi Rapace has made herself a stable to American cinema.","10"
"schorschi100","boring and meaningless","20 August 2012","I am a big fan of Scott's and of sci-fi. Had been waiting for weeks to watch Prometheus and drove like crazy to get on time for an after work show. I should have known better. The movie simply sucks. The visuals are great, no doubt, but everything else does not make any sense at all. Admittedly, you do not expect scientific truths or revelations, but some bone structure is primordial. The ship goes off to find our creators. There is an underlying story about the zillionaire who in his dying days pays for everything, his daughter who wants to stop him and the robot who clearly wants to become Data. But the center story, namely the aliens, what they are, what they want, why, who are they, what did they do, etc. remains nonexistent. Lots of disgusting creatures, lots of modern splatter, and nothing beyond. The characters do not evolve, and practically no decision of their's really makes any sense. Even the music was boring, borrowed and lacking originality.

"robbinn-354-691035","Cool movie with logic thrown out the window","21 June 2012","What to say what has not already been told. I can maybe talk about the stuff that annoyed me and left me clueless. - Safety on board is a joke. Every rule is broken and broken once more. Helmets off everybody. Lets bring contaminated lifeforms into the ship to mention few. - Scientist that has strange ""vice versa"" temper. Gets crazy about rather small thing but remains calm as ice when he should be screaming his head off. Behavior of the characters is not believable. - Then comes he worst off the bunch is that the android head is still on the same location after the ship crashed, rolled half a circle and crashed again into the ground. What a sticky head :)

Well on the more positive notes, the film is beautiful. I specially like the shots from Iceland. For Alien fans this is a nice addition, but be ready for a disappointment as I stated above. I give it six for it is nicely taken, David the android is well performed and it is quite exciting at times.

I recommend it as it is enjoyable feast for the eye.

"tomlaws","Prometheus is pathetic","29 October 2021","Prometheus is pathetic. Here we have yet another film who's art department special effects department and costuming departments were wasted on terrible dialogue and writing. The crew of the spaceship is incredibly unprofessional, definitely should've had a psychological screening before they boarded and their English skills are sloppy. I guess the director and writer and actors I've never seen NASA or SpaceX in action. Nobody but nobody has an attitude, they speak as close to the Queens English as possible and our pleasant to each other.

When we have to hear such poorly thought out details as ""the company spent $1 trillion on this mission"". Sorry but the odds of that mission costing such a round number as 1 trillion are about as likely as my hitting the lottery. Next we have one meat head whip off his helmet to test the air quality and within 20 seconds everybody else does too because you know, 20 seconds is plenty of time to figure out if somebody's gonna die from something mysterious.

Don't waste your time, and my apologies to all the hard work done by those who didn't direct, write or act in this film.","3"
"sunznc","Totally forgettable, rehashed ideas from other films.","10 June 2012","Prometheus starts out a mystery and ends with many questions. What does the opening mean? Neither of us could tell. This is before Alien yet the technology is more advanced than Alien and Alien was further in the future.

Also, this advanced technology can show what a person is dreaming while asleep but it can't show what is inside of an ancient, abandoned space ship. It can't show that there are bodies, living and dead, in that same spaceship until much, much later.

We were expecting this film to end at a point near where Alien starts but that idea isn't fleshed out completely here.

This film is just a mess with ideas sort of flung in the wind that end up not being satisfying. There is a tedious feel to a lot of this. A lot is happening but it isn't very fulfilling nor interesting. The scene that had the most impact is that of a woman crew member who chooses to enter into a surgery booth and have surgery performed on her without anesthetic. The rest was rehash from other films, other ideas we've been exposed to before.

Sorry Ridley, this didn't work for me and I won't remember a thing about it 3 months from now. Time for something completely new. I suppose the acting was very good, the film is nice to look at but there isn't anything interesting here.","6"
"davincirecebe","Worstest Disappointment EVER","21 September 2012","I registered here in IMDb just because I feel I have to warn others about this movie!

The visuals, as usual with R. Scott, are indeed stunning...but as for the rest...

I CANNOT stress enough how bad the story is, I used to be a sci-fi lover but this movie's plot is so STUPID, the storyline and acting is so GODAWFUL I'm considering a review in my tastes, I'm actually REVOLTED at how bad it is - Why do they make ""sci-fi"" movies without the slightest concern at real science?

A child knows more science than the ""writer"" of this piece of s...,

Just a FEW main ""holes"". Not plot holes, because that would mean there is a plot:

STUPID 1) Starts off with an ""engineer"" (a member of the alien race who created us) next to a river in what is supposed to be ancient Earth, looking at a giant hovering spaceship. He then drinks a black goo, and dissolves into the water..so that's how they brought human life to Earth...very intelligent, dissolving oneself hideously to create life...of course, they never heard of genetic engineering labs and tools...

STUPID 2) Jumps to archaeologists finding a cave with ancient paintings of giants next to a star system...then jumps again to the Prometheus spaceship, with the crew being wakened from stasis by an android....and then the crew assemble, and are introduced to each other (obviously that's how you select a crew, a lot of guys some of whom look like prison inmates who never saw each other before...training together must be a thing of the past)

STUPID 3) The archaeologists explain that all ancient cultures made those paintings (How? Man is 2, 3 million years old, how could a 5 or 6 thousand year old culture know about the engineers?) and that they showed the star system they are arriving at.

STUPID 4) They approach an Earth-size moon, and try to land IMMEDIATELY, without recon of any kind...then, of course, by sheer dumb luck, they find an ancient engineer base close to where they are landing...because one ""scientist"" spots some straight lines on the surface...that's like finding a needle in a haystack on the 1st try!

STUPID 5) They go off immediately to visit the aliens' base, again without recon, without waiting for anything, like a tally-ho bunch of teenagers, even though night and a huge storm is approaching...

STUPID 6) Once inside, just because the computer says the atmosphere is breathable, they OPEN their helmets...why??? That is ABSURD! How could a team of scientists ignore the dangers of contamination? Of unknown viruses or bacteria???

STUPID 7) They see the floor covered by puddles of black goo, and IGNORE it entirely...actually step ON it, without seeing small worms swimming in it...c'mon, that's utterly LUDICROUS, these are supposed to be scientists????

STUPID 8) Two of the group decide on the spot that they'll return to their spaceship (probably out of boredom with the plot)...just like that, they abandon the others...and of course, get lost inside the alien base...that's not absurd, that's RIDICULOUS behaviour...and further on, when they find an alien snake, they start to PET it...till of course it attacks them...of course, if you or I found an alien snake we would try to cuddle it, wouldn't we? That's simply BEYOND ridiculous, that's revoltingly unbelievable...

STUPID 9) They watch ancient holograms (very blurred, since the poor engineers didn't have good cameras) showing the engineers fleeing from something...and then they find a 2000 year-old severed engineer head, which they take back to the ship and try to revive in a Frankenstein- like way (literally!) again without any concern for contamination. The head explodes because of the black goo on top of it, and again no one tries to analyze it.

STUPID 10) The evil android (of course, he's evil, all androids are) puts some of the black goo in the lead scientist's drink...why? Because he is...evil, of course, and because that's a ""very scientific way"" of learning what the black goo does. I think I'll drink a few drops of mercury to find out how poisoned I can become...(after this movie, not such a bad idea).

STUPID 11) The lead scientist falls sick with an alien disease, but doesn't think of analysing it, and doesn't tell anyone about it...again, very plausible behaviour, let's start an epidemic, it's fun.

STUPID 12) The tycoon who financed the expedition was aboard all the time, but of course in hiding...why? No reason...no, wait, he's evil too, he loves to creep up unexpectedly.

STUPID 13) The engineer they revive and try to communicate with (the android has deciphered their language) behaves in a truly evolved way, by not answering a single word but just trying to kill everyone like a charging bull; later, he will try to take his ship full of black goo (apparently a bio weapon of theirs) to Earth...but that part at least I could understand, he must have been mad at our race for making a movie this bad....

And it goes on and on, the whole movie is like a STUPID or IMPLAUSIBLE behaviour CONTEST, for chrissake.

It borders on the CRIMINAL that so much money, so many splendid scenery and CGI and effects are COMPLETELY wasted in a story that makes ABSOLUTELY no sense, has no coherence and is so completely meaningless that to say it is AWFUL is actually praising it. I used to hold R. Scott works in high regard...but honestly, the worst B-movie I've ever seen is Oscar material compared to this story..!

A final warning: All the ""positive"" reviews here are obviously PAID, no one in his right mind would ever write a positive review of this, they probably hired a few hundred people to write good things about it here as part of their marketing campaign.","1"
"XweAponX","A Dash of DNA and Half a Brain","17 September 2012","What makes this movie great is the concept that even with technological advancement, people are inherently stupid - Ergo Logan Marshall-Green (Charlie Holloway's) remark about anyone with a dash of DNA and half a brain being able to create life.

As with the first Alien film, where there was one and only one intelligent person (Ripley) on the crew who saw the danger of allowing an unknown alien life-form into the ship, the 17 Members of The Prometheus are mostly dumb even though they are Geologists and Biologists (Whose stupidity caused them to become the first victims of mutated earthworms). HOWEVER... Noomi Rapace was totally the wrong person to be cast as the ""Ripley"" of this film. I had seen her in one other movie where she was appropriately cast (one of the Sherlock Holmes films with ""Tony Stark""), but she was also well-directed in that film. Here, she was not. Ridley Scott paid a lot of attention getting this film to look a certain way, even bringing HR Giger back into the fold- but he utterly failed in his casting and direction of Noomi Rapace. He was all gewgaw with praise about her appearance in the Millennium trilogy, but in fact Roony Mara was several notches better in the role. Ms Rapace fails to replace Ripley, and that mistake made this film suffer. In fact, I'm dropping my rating down to 8 because of her poor performance. I'm leaving it at 8 due to Michael Fassbinders excellent ""David"".

But some people are not stupid, and other people simply make the wrong choice. Even others who are not actually human are simply ""following orders"" as with the case of David 8 (Michael Fassbinder, Magneto from X- Men first Class) - Who, as the indentured servant robot David would rather be T. E. Lawrence. But in fact he is bound to do everything Peter Weyland (Guy Pierce) commands him to do-Until in fact released from that contract by Weyland's death.

Basically what we have here is a story of Men trying to be Gods on several different levels, or trying to steal fire from Olympus and having to pay the consequences. In the opening ""creation"" scene I do not believe the ""Engineer"" was left on Earth with the blessings of the crew of the flying saucer we see leaving the vicinity. But it is clear that these beings later interacted with people due to the ""chariots of the gods"" evidence found by Dr. Shaw (Noomie Rapace), an alignment of planets oddly similar to the planetary system shown at the beginning of Alien, identified as LV-426 in Aliens. This moon is identified as LV-223.

This story is magnificently filmed and directed, using a minimum of CGI, and Weta Digital at that - And so the landscape of LV-223 looks wholly real.

The only thing that bothers me, is why did The Prometheus have such High-Tech computers and gear, but the Nostromo, a ship from a later time, have tape, paper-clips and chewing gum with Computers that look like IBM PC 8088's? Obviously in 1979 the computer tech shown was top of the line, but I just wish Filmmakers, when dealing with future stories, would use some imagination, so that High Tech PCs will not look like Anachronisms 32 years after the film is made.

Other than that, story. We know that most or all of the crew of the ship must needs be killed in horrible ways during the course of the film. But to see such idiocy... We would think that Humans of the late 21st Century would develop a sense of caution especially in space. What occurs in this film is basically a bumbling, inept comedy of errors which results in ironic tragic deaths. The basic Tenet of ""Don't Touch anything that you do not understand"" or ""Do NOT Open Doors"" should be a given. In a potentially hostile environment, you simply don't run amok opening doors and Vases full of ""Make-Me-An-Alien"" Juice. You DO NOT try to pet an Alien-ised Earthworm as if it is a pet CAT! And you really, really NEVER leave your group in an unknown place, unless you know exactly the way out. I accept this movie as a lesson that Stupidity has its own, permanent sentence: Death.

Even the ""Engineers"" - Maybe were trying to ""Clean Up"" an Exxon Valdez oil spill of their own: But the contagion of Stupidity must have affected them as well.

As a warning, this film is great: As a Prequel to Alien, it is wholly acceptable. The Music of Marc Streitenfeld is excellent, including the riffs from the original Alien. The little stylistic influences on the production design by H. R. Giger was a great ""Almost-Alien"" - Or, because this was LV-223, perhaps things happened differently than they did on LV-426. Because we KNOW that the Xenomorph will take on characteristics of its host life-form: Human, Dog (Or Cow if you watch Alien 3 Directors Cut), Predator.

Needless to say, this happened on a different corner of the Galaxy as did the events leading up to Alien. Now that know there are as many designs for creatures mutated from Host life-forms as there are stars in the sky, perhaps some of these can be exploited in Movies about them. As far as this film goes, it paves the way for that to happen. But I REALLY want to follow where Noomie and Fassbinder's head went, after leaving that place. It was excellent to see one of those ships in working condition. NOW WE KNOW, who was piloting the ship in Alien, was not as non-human as they originally appeared.

The only other thing I do not like, is that this movie appears to be targeted, with hundreds of verbatim 1-star reviews: Obviously from the same person.","8"
"sinister_prog","So much promise, so little delivered.","2 October 2012","Prometheus doesn't have the suspense of Alien. Nor does it have the action of Aliens. Everything after that smells of Hollywood milking the cash cow dry. I hoped that Ridley Scott's return would have helped steer the franchise back on course to what made the first two movies so great, but no. After watching Prometheus I can only guess that this was an attempt at the thinking man's Alien but the whole idea of the movie just seems fixated on getting as many people killed off as possible while leaving an abundance of unanswered questions behind.

First of all it's very difficult to feel any kind of emotional bond with the characters when their biggest discovery in the history of mankind - discovery of an alien civilization, is just shrugged off just like that. No champagne corks, no parties, not even a group photograph. Archimedes had his ""Eureka"" moment, Watson and Crick went down to the pub to announce they had discovered the structure of DNA. The USA cheered when Neil Armstrong stepped on the moon. The crew of Prometheus land on a planet, discover the first ever proof of extra-terrestrial life and the only excitement and celebration felt is because it's Christmas, and someone has put up a rather weedy Christmas tree in the ship. It is that underwhelming. No build-up, nothing. If it's that exciting to the characters, how would that excite the audience?

After that it becomes clichéd horror movie material. Despite advanced mapping technology, the guys in charge of mapping the area still manage to get lost, lose radio contact and get killed in easily avoidable circumstances. Then the whole plot just forces events on characters to make sure everyone and everything gets killed and throw in a plot twist to ensure they don't have time to simply pack up and leave.

Prometheus is a very pretty film to watch. But I didn't come out scared, excited, relieved or thinking, ""Wasn't it awesome when ..."" or ""Wasn't it scary when ..."". I came out thinking I should have watched Resident Evil instead.","3"
"stuartkpark","It's not Alien!","12 September 2012","As a self-confessed Alien fan boy I've found it difficult to put down some unbiased thoughts around Prometheus. After the first viewing I was disappointed, I was expecting a direct Alien prequel and this isn't it. The film was better second time as I could leave all my preconceived ideas behind and enjoy it for what it is. There are some good performances (particularly Michael Fassbender), some great set-pieces and for the thinkers it proposes some answers to the big questions: who are we and where did we come from.

"J-bot6","Meh!","11 June 2012","I'm a huge fan of Alien, liked Aliens, and despite originally not liking the third movie, I actually have grown to really like Alien 3.

Prometheus had potential. But, like so many sequels and prequels nowadays, it's highly derivative, borrows situations and lines of dialogue from previous films, and is generally unimaginative.

The editing was too fast. Yes, they did a nice job on the ship interiors. But they were in too much of a rush to keep the pace up. There were shots of the interior of the company ship that were nice but too quick. Just as you were beginning to take in the atmosphere, they cut to the next scene. The soundtrack was complete rubbish; It pulled me out of the film repeatedly. The supporting actors were awful, reminding me of the bad moments of the fourth film combined with pretty much all of Aliens vs Predator. What is it with childish over-acting in so many films of this genre these days.

For characters, I felt that Vickers and the ship's captain were the two best. However, neither is really given the chance to fully develop in this film. As a fan of Alien (spoiler alert), I was pretty ticked off that the writers decided to change the ship's alien crew into humans. WTF!? Seriously, a group of ten-year-old children could come up with far more imaginative explanations of what the alien race was. So what if they biologically engineered humans. That doesn't mean that they themselves have to look like humans. Along with this particular gripe are the many seemingly random and unexplained scenes. One of the main characters of the film is infected with a 'virus' that makes him mutate slightly and wig out. Okay. Why? This along with a number of other short and definitely not sweet oddities make the film seem unfocused and scatterbrained. Finally, the lack of imagination of the presentation of the world that this series has tried to flesh out over the last number of decades is somewhat diffused by this film. It's ironic since the story actually attempts to broaden the Alien universe. Some things should never be explained, lest you ruin the mystique.

So, I give it a good rating for visual effects and for SOME of the acting.

I give it a thumbs down for the rest of the acting, the ripping off of elements from the first film, the crap soundtrack, and the general lack of tension. This movie has no real climax. Instead it has a bunch of half-baked mini-climaxes. Very unsatisfying.

Hence the final rating of ""Meh!""

Advice to Hollywood: Unless a stellar writer, amazing composer, and awesome director of photography signs on, cancel any and all Blade Runner sequels now.","5"
"born-giantsfan","Pick your tag line","20 June 2012","I really wanted to like this movie. I really like Alien, thought Aliens was a decent sequel, and have a serious celebrity crush on Charlize. But this one just didn't do it for me.

The acting was fine and there were some moments of very good acting (Fassbander in particular). The cinematography is at times stunning and the special effects are quite impressive. But the plot line and the dialog so completely underwhelmed that it ruined the movie for me.

Some people can overlook those faults and just enjoy the ""make you jump/squirm in your seat"" antics. But some of us can't.

That is why you see such a range of reviews and scores from both critics and fans. Even my local papers in the SF area had three quite different reviews of the same movie.

In summary my view is:

there was no character development. I didn't give a hoot about any of the characters. to me they just seemed like dumb, unimaginative plot fillers for the aliens to eliminate. Even the surviving character(s) didn't really have a semblance of humanity.


dialog was often childish, insipid, out of context or character, or just plain stupid.


the plot had so many holes or inconsistencies it was distracting. Other reviewers have comments that people that complain about things being unexplained ""just don't pick up on the clues"". And while I often agree with that and myself love a good mystery or Hitchcock film, I found this movie's faults to be more with the inconsistency than the subtle clues.


For more detailed elements of these faults, other reviewers have covered them at length. So in summary I will point out few of the unused marketing tag lines that have been suggested for this movie:

In the dark, no one can see your eyes roll


in space, no one can hear you groan


in the theater no one can hear your boredom


in space no one can hear you snicker","4"
"damonous","Of the caliber of an Aliens VS Predator movie","9 June 2012","Ridley, please hear this: If this was really YOU ...something you thought was going to be great...and not just you wanting so bad to do another Alien movie before you die that you didn't care what mess the script was like; then please STOP NOW before you put your hands in the Blade Runner cookie jar (as is rumored) and ruin that for everyone, too!

Everyone else: There's no 'science' in Prometheus, only re-warmed 'fiction' that a 2-year old could write better, and it's use of 'horror' consistently arrives with unintended chuckles.

Outside of Noomi Rapace and Michael Fassbender, the movie could have served just as well with splice-in's of actors in 50's B-movie roles. And that amazingly includes Charlize Theron, and also the normally-capable Guy Pearce in age-makeup that barely betters that of the Back to the Future series.

I do facetiously appreciate Idris Elba's sudden, out-of-character & random 'exposition scene' sandwiched just past the mid-point of the film. You know your story is a lost-cause when it's not thorough and deep enough to force people come to the conclusion on their own, and you just don't have any patience left to try and nurture that understanding because now it's time to ""bring it on"" (the action).

The creatures all look completely fake and unbelievable, including those that may look familiar to you. Think Alien3's level of monster-believability. Not only that, but there's a complete lack of consistency between how the creatures in this film adapt. And I'm referring to that as it pertains WITHIN this film; not in comparison to the other Alien movies.

And don't worry: you'll have PLENTY of time to contemplate all the nonsense going on, too. While the original Alien probably holds to this day as having had the best suspense of ALL the Aliens movies (including Cameron's sequel), here Ridley seems to just be waiting/hoping/praying for something to happen. Knowing that it was going to be a 2:15 min movie, I happened to glance at my watch when I was hoping it was near the end, only to realize that only an hour had passed. (!)

I don't even give Ridley credit (as some are) for astounding visuals. Remember the intense, lonely feeling of landing ON a totally alien planet when the Nostromo sets-down in the original Alien movie? (A feat never since executed as well again by anyone.) --As you might suspect from the commercials...don't anticipate that here.

Probably, the worst of it all is in the last half-hour when it feels like they made-up the script as they went along. You WILL have the feeling of one of those poorly-executed prequels where the writers are desperately trying to shoehorn the story to match the movie that comes after it. Needless to say, there is one HUGE, honking continuity error (that at first seems like they might have got right). To me, it was this moment when I finally KNEW for certain that I had just watched an Alien VS Predator -class movie, and not a groundbreaking piece of cinema from an accomplished auteur like Ridley Scott.","1"
"jboothmillard","Prometheus","5 August 2012","This film was advertised like it would be a blockbuster, and like a prequel to Alien, which would make sense as Sir Ridley Scott (Alien, Blade Runner, Gladiator) was directing. Basically, millions of years ago a race of humanoid alien creatures inhabit the earth; one drinks a dark liquid that disintegrates his body, his remains scatter down a waterfall, his DNA is broken, and the building blocks of life are spread. Then forward to 2089, scientist couple Elizabeth Shaw (The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo's Noomi Rapace) and Charlie Holloway (Logan Marshall-Green) find ancient cave drawings in Scotland with a star map from an unknown culture, they believe it is the key to discovering how life on earth was created, they call it an ""invitation"". Elderly CEO of the Weyland Corporation, supposed dead Peter Weyland (Guy Pearce), has funded a mission for a crew of scientists to board the vessel Prometheus and travel the three-four year journey to the calculated location of these findings, the distant moon LV-223, where they hope to meet the race they call the Engineers. The crew includes Shaw, Holloway, android David (Shame's Michael Fassbender), ship captain Janek (Luther's Idris Elba) and mission director Meredith Vickers (Charlize Theron), and when they arrive by the year 2093 they land successfully and begin to explore. Finding a large artificial structure, like a pyramid, they enter in the spacesuits, finding many stone cylinders on the ground, a large humanoid head monolithic statue, and the corpse of one of the humanoid alien creatures, and in the process of this exploration David takes one of the cylinders for his own means. When a storm approaches the crew are forced to head back for Prometheus, but Fifield (Creep's Sean Harris) and Millburn (Rafe Spall) are left stranded inside the temple, while the scientists match the Engineer corpse's DNA with human DNA, so they have found it predates human life. Meanwhile David opens the stone cylinder he collected, it contains a strange dark liquid, and he uses a small sample of it to put into Holloway's drink, and shortly after he has drunk it he and Shaw have sexual intercourse, while the trapped scientists in the structure, without the other knowing, are attacked by a snake-like alien creature. When the crew return they find the corpses of the men they left behind, while David in a further part of pyramid discovers a control room with a surviving Engineer pod, and he also activates a digital star map highlighting the earth, and of course the effects of the dark liquid infect Holloway's body. Vickers refuses to let the infected Holloway back into Prometheus, and he is rapidly disintegrating, so with his wishes he wants to burned by a flamethrower to death, and this is done to Shaw's devastation, but she gets a shock of her own when David carries out a test and she appears to be months pregnant, despite only having intercourse a few hours ago, it is an alien offspring. She demands an abortion to remove the creature inside her, and after the android refuses to help her she uses the special medical machine herself to take it out herself, and despite the pain she does manage to remove the squid-like creature from her stomach. It is confirmed that Weyland is still alive, and he explains that he is hoping that the discovery of the Engineers could help end his ageing process and prevent him from dying, and then Fifield returns to the ship, having been mutated, and tries to attack the crew, before being killed. Janek speculates the structure was an Engineer military base and they lost control after something went wrong with the biological weapon, the dark liquid, and he determines that the control room is a spaceship, and sure enough the crew wake up the humanoid preserved inside the pod. When David tries to communicate with it, the humanoid decapitates the android, and kills Weyland and the other crew members there, Shaw manages to escape just as the creature activates the spaceship to take off, but it must be stopped from leaving the moon or it will take the biological liquid weapon to earth. After being convinced to stop it, Janek and the remaining crew sacrifice themselves and crash Prometheus into the alien ship, and when it crashes back to the ground Vickers is crushed attempting to escape. Shaw appears to be the last remaining crew member, but the alien that she aborted from her body has grown in proportion and is still inside the ship, and the head of still activated David warns her that the humanoid astronaut survived the crash and is trying to kill her, but the giant squid-like alien stops him. The end sees Shaw and the head of David leave in another of the alien spaceships as they plan to travel the Engineer home planet in an effort to discover why the race want to destroy humanity, and we also see the humanoid Engineer have a large alien creature burst from his chest. Also starring Emun Elliott as Chance, Moon's Benedict Wong as Ravel and Kate Dickie as Ford. Rapace has similarities to Ellen Ripley, but she brings her own style to the role, Fassbender is great as the apathetic but very likable robot, Pearce is almost unrecognisable as the crazy old man, and Theron in her moments is pretty bitchy. You can see why this is considered, probably confirmed, as a prequel to the Alien saga, because it sets up many of the concepts to come, such as the androids, the chest burster moments, the alien pods (cylinders here) and ultimately the terror is space concept, obviously it may not be as scary as the original Alien, and you could joke that this is an insight into the Scientology ""religion"", LOL, but it is a clever enough, engaging and watchable science-fiction horror. It was nominated the Oscar for Best Visual Effects, and it was nominated the BAFTA for Special Visual Effects. Very good!","7"
"nagyistvanandor","When CGI takes over a film production","9 December 2012","Prometheus in some ways reminds me to Batman and Robin. Both movies placed its main focus to something which it should not have. In the case of Batman and Robin, they made the world longest toy commercial instead of a movie, mainly because they wanted to sell toys. While in Prometheus instead making a movie with cgi, they made a cgi eye candy wrapped in some story. There's nothing wrong with using CGI, while You keep in mind its just a tool, like: make up, lighting, camera angles...etc. (And to be fair beside its focus error, ""Prometheus"" and ""Batman and Robin"" can not be matched together, sure its bad but not as bad as that toy commercial.)

The movie often feels like it was driven by CGI. For example:

The opening scene where the big-bold-alien dude drinks the black slime. Why the hell he would do that? They are advanced enough to make stuff which trigger evolution, but not advanced enough to synthetically mix it with there DNA. ""Okay we have the stuff, this will create life, the only problem that its needs some DNA from us. How about one of us drinks it and die with horrifying pain?"" Somehow I don't find the logic in this. Except if I look at it from outside the story. ""Lets make one of the bold guys drink the black slime. So we can make some sweet cgi scene where his body starts to break down, and we can go inside its body and show how his cells mutate and all that stuff. It will look cool!"" And there You have it cgi taking over story telling.

Or when they found the head. People-a: Oh my god, this can be the biggest discovery of humanity, and probably the only intact remain we will found from our creators, how seams to instinct long time ago.

People-b: So we gonna preserve it and carefully study it?

people-a: Nah lets just poke it with electricity till its blow up. It will be fun.

Seriously? I bet from 1000 scientist, 1000 would not react this way. Except when the filmmakers go ""Oh lets make them blow up the head it will look awesome""

And the movie goes on with a series of similar events, which gives us nice created cgi scenes, but You just cant ignore that the characters and story are literally stupid or unbelievable.

The movie could get some credit for the idea that humanity was created by an alien race.

However this part quickly gets swapped in the background, and its kinda only gets mentioned when its reveled that the bold-alien dudes wanted to destroy us. But in the end this two facts just briefly mentioned and no explanation given.

And the second one fails even more if You think about it. Why on Earth would the bold-alien dudes create a biological weapon which could whip them out as well. Instead of simply bomb us down, or make something which only attacks humans. They probably had the technology. But nope, they went for the biological specie thing which got out of hand and kinda whipped them out.

And on top of this, the idea of humanity was engineered by aliens not a new idea. Its kinda a rip off from one of the episodes of Star Trek - Next Generation. Even the alien race which made us are kinda similar looking. Plus in Star Trek, they give a correct reason why they did such thing. (in short that race where explores, how discovered there are no other similar species in different planets. So they started evolution on countless planets, so they will not be alone in the universe, or if for some reason they get extinct, there still be similar live in the universe.)

And there's the backbone of the alien story's, the dark side of humanity, that they want to profit, explore, exploit things which they cant control, understand or simply not ready to confront jet. This is kinda in Prometheus too, with the old dude, how wants immortality and only financed the hole thing because of this. But this part is tiny, not explored and fail short.

if You happy to see cgi in its glory and don't want to bother with things like story and characters You probably will like Prometheus since the visual effects are eye candy.

But if You want to watch a movie, furthermore a GOOD movie, than go watch something else. Prometheus is a b-category Horror film, where most people only there to die in a gross way. The story have its weak not developed sparkles, and only exists for the death scenes, and cgi graphic. So its watchable once, and the the visual effects might make You enjoy it, but I would not watch it twice.","3"
"crazymanmichael","High Hopes Dashed","2 February 2013","Okay, I'm gonna cut Ridley Scott a lot of slack with this film. I like his work generally: Blade Runner, Gladiator, Black Hawk Down, and of course Alien. With Prometheus he's obviously trying to create a prequel to the Alien franchise, and that's fine; it could use one. And frankly, I loved Alien, despite its many flaws and improbabilities; loved it for the whole ""film noir in outer space"" genre that it spawned. Loved that its brooding darkness and menace enabled it to transcend the whole guy-in-a-rubber-suit alien thing. (And, I loved that Scott deliberately didn't give his actors the heads-up about the infamous chest-burster scene, so that he could capture some authentic shock reactions on film. Now that takes cojones!)

Let's face it, the whole squeaky-clean Star Trek/2001: A Space Odyssey style of science fiction was begging for a flipside, and Alien was it. With it, space became gloomy, dirty, depressing and full of hidden danger. And, in a complete break with tradition, the first sequel, Aliens, from the hand of James ""Titanic"" Cameron, was as good as—some say better than—the original! (Alien 3 faltered somewhat, despite having David Fincher (Se7en/Fight Club) at the helm, and Alien Resurrection was pure crap on a cracker.)

But, there's only so much slack one can cut, before the whole ""willing suspension of disbelief"" thing falls to pieces.

In order to move the plot forward, Scott has his characters do unforgivably stupid things, time and time again. And not incidentally or fleetingly stupid. We're talking relentless, towering stupidity that even stupid people would find insulting. Once I could deal with; twice, maybe. But stupidity as their go-to behavior? Please. One would have to assume, if you're going to send a bunch of guys out into space on a potentially dangerous mission, one with so many unknowns, that you'd get some pretty highly trained specialists to go along, wouldn't you? Yet one of these guys, when confronted by a completely unknown alien life form and knowing absolutely nothing about it, sticks his face inches away from it and teases the damn thing! And he KEEPS doing it, even after it makes an obvious threat display. Does the word ""moron"" spring to mind? The guy got nothing less than what he deserved.

Speaking of moronic the crew lands on a completely unknown planet, right? One they know absolutely nothing about. They're there for a few hours, nowhere near long enough to learn anything significant; they're exploring an unknown alien structure, one that's possibly brimming with life-threatening hazards; and, just because the atmosphere turns out to have an earthlike mixture of nitrogen and oxygen, this guy immediately removes his helmet and takes a deep breath! Is he TRYING to die? (Question: where the hell did the oxygen come from, anyway? There's obviously no plant life) And by the way, what the hell was Charlize Theron's character there for, other than to look hot in a skin-tight jumpsuit? And maybe to give the film some big-name draw. What was her role in this mission, other than to get in the way of people doing their jobs, annoy them, and generally behave like a tight-assed, obstinate bitch? I really couldn't figure that one out.

Well, I could go on. This COULD have been a brilliant movie. And to be fair to it, it does have a one or two pretty good nail-biting moments; and, what with the Terragen 2-generated alien landscapes and H.R. Giger-inspired interiors (a la the original Alien) it does have a great look.

The Alien franchise had (and still has) a lot of unexplored territory that could be mined to create some really innovative, strange and exciting story lines. I hope someone still will. Sadly, it would seem that Scott is no longer the guy to do it.","2"
"SimonJack","Low on the fright, interest and originality levels","10 June 2018","""Prometheus"" follows in the string of outer space sci-fi films that are searches for other life. These differ from the space adventure films of the Star Trek and Star War series. In these explorations of distant galaxies, one knows that it's really about monsters. Of course, the 1979 film, ""Alien,"" set the standard for terror and fright in space. No one has been able, yet, to outdo that hideous, ugly, frightening monster.

So, the constant challenge of sci-fi writers and moviemakers is to come up with something more frightening. Unable to do that - as all have been since ""Alien,"" the challenge then is to make the plot more mysterious and intriguing. So, far, the only way to do that has been with more special effects and fictional technical equipment and abilities. This film is loaded with that - the 3-D projections of maps, creatures, etc. and all types of futuristic gadgets and systems. But, in order for those things to hold one's interest in lieu of some fantastic new alien creature, the plot must have some substance.

And, that's where ""Prometheus"" fails. It becomes just another lackluster sci-fi trip into outer space. Oh, it has a mission, or a couple that may be in conflict, but they are sidetracked in the individual miscues and little tragedies that befall some of the crew. The four stars are for the artists who did the CGI and special effects. They are quite good, even though the story so soon becomes lame.

One thing that gets me about most of these movies is how really dumb some of the scientists are. In this one, Dr. Charlie Holloway takes off his helmet - against the advice of his cohort, Dr. Elizabeth Shaw. Why? Because he could read that the atmosphere was safe to breathe inside the unknown structure they found. So, the air makeup is identical to earth, but what else might be in that air? Of course, a real scientist wouldn't think about that. He'd be so delighted that he could take off his helmet to breathe the natural air.

But anyone who saw ""The War of the Worlds,"" - the 1953 original or the 2005 remake, would know that other things exist in air that might be harmful. And so Dr. Halloway finds out in this film. The dumbness of the guy aside, his metamorphosis turned out to be one of the most interesting action parts of the film.

I enjoy sci-fi immensely, and especially that set in outer space. So long as Hollywood keeps putting them out, I'll keep watching sci-fi films. One never knows when one might be particularly good. And those that don't have good fright value or intrigue - well, usually the scenery, CGI and special effects are dazzling enough to keep one from falling asleep.

I suspect that the high rating for this film comes mostly from a modern day younger audience. Most probably have not seen some of the classic sci-fi films. But, anyone who enjoys sci-fi from space should at least have seen the three films that are the standards. For aliens from outer space who come to earth, ""The War of the Wolds"" of 1953 is the film to see. And, for outer space monsters and fright films, ""Alien"" of 1979 is the standard. The one other that tackles time, space travel, advanced civilizations and uncertainty and intrigue about space itself, is the 1968 classic, ""2001: A Space Odyssey.""

There really have been no new ideas about space since those gems on which to make sci-fi films.","4"

"jackmeat","Very well made sci-fi movie which is a good thing","20 August 2015","My quick rating 7,5/10. This is an excellent sci-fi flick. Interesting way to start a review, eh? It looks spectacular visually and editing as well. The story itself is unique (i believe it was a comic book at some point) but either way the plot will draw you in. Noomi Rapace does an excellent job in the lead, but no surprise there, she is a great actress. I did find the other characters a tad bit irritating aside from the Captain. Charlize Theron was used sparingly so not much to say (I read she was also considered for the lead). The action scenes are paced nicely and are used when needed not overdone. When the action scenes were used, they were filmed so well even with the mix of CGI often but I almost didn't even notice, well, almost lol. The obvious influence of the late H.R.Giger was also a nice touch, giving homage to the great artwork he graced us with. At 2 hours long, I was hard pressed to even notice how long it was since I was that into the film. One way to end this short blurb is I am looking forward to the sequel which is coming in 2017. I believe any sci-fi fan would agree and will be looking forward to it as well. Non sci-fi fans most likely will appreciate an interesting story and well made movie so my final thought, see it.","8"
"Pjtaylor-96-138044","Over-complicates and demystifies what needn't be explained; joyless, overly serious and a tad pretentious.","5 March 2018","As a distant precursor to the 'Alien' franchise, 'Prometheus (2012)' maintains a generally wide berth but still tries too hard to over-explain what needn't necessarily be explained - retroactively over-complicating and demystifying the previously established lore. The feature itself is mostly joyless, being consistently too serious and just plain dull, and its constant forced existentialism does come across as a tad pretentious. It's really this that kills the piece, as it mistakes itself for some grand comment on the nature of man, and indeed mankind's origins, when it is simply science-fiction schlock. It is almost as if it wants to be classed as 'high-art', to distance itself from the apparent 'B-movie' origins of the franchise, but in the process becomes so much worse and incredibly strained. The simple things aren't even done right, and so the piece isn't even believable on the most basic of levels. For example, the characters keep making decisions that would seem stupid even for children and yet we're supposed to believe they are the scientists chosen to explore a new world. Mostly, though, the movie is just boring. 4/10","4"
"stephenwilletts68","In space who cares if you scream if you can't be bothered to run","5 June 2012","To be honest i had no idea of the plot for Prometheus. I hadn't read any reviews and had no idea that it was meant to be a prequel to the original Alien. However while watching this movie it soon's becomes apparent that its a sequel as the storyline and characters seem to mirror the original in many ways. The movie however does not hold up to the original. The acting although wasn't too bad (for some people), the characters were just not believable. Noomi Rapace although a superb actress just doesn't deliver as the heroine at all. She is just too nice a person, to play this part (she was best in her millennium trilogy role.) Most people have said that Michael Fassbender played his role really well. Well they may be so, if playing it well means he looks like he's constipated through the whole movie. Lance Henriksen's acting as Bishop in aliens was far superior. As for Charlize Theron, What the heck was she in this film for. Her character did nothing at all. She is billed as one of the main actors in this movie, and yet her character has no meaning whatsoever. If that role hadn't have been written it wouldn't have lost anything whatsoever The plot of the movie was pretty lame and could never hold a candle to Alien. The Original the crew can't escape the creature because its on board the ship. In this movie, their really isn't a creature for most of the film. Just a some slime, that could have been 'snot' and that was meant to be scary. Even when the creature is first seen, it more resembles a plastic snake with a gaping wide mouth.

"cat-that-goes-by-himself","Expensive waste","10 January 2013","Marketing people should be paid to leave the directors alone. That would have spared us a lot of bad movies these last 10 years. I see the same degradation in the Star Wars franchise as in this Alien saga at work. Bloated special effects and anemic scripts.

I truly wonder how this heap of money could be spent on such a lame synopsis. When I watch a movie, I'm more than willing to temporarily suspend my disbelief, but at least I expect basic consistency in character psychology and plot. As many have already pointed out, here we can find neither.

What happened to Hollywood producers, I wonder. Take no risk, aim for an audience of little kids and airheads or something? What a waste of more than decent actors and director. With 1% of the budget they could have paid someone to actually write a scenario, but I guess it was deemed unimportant or even counter-productive.

I hope the producers got as much money as possible out of this, that's the only thing it can produce. No dream, no imagination, no memories. This movie-product will be forgotten in a year, leaving a few big wigs a bit richer. What a shame...","4"
"liammofo-816-651953","Let down by the writing","3 June 2012","This is an average film made less than average when you add the expectations of a great director, a promising story arc and a talented cast.

It isn't all bad, mainly due to Ridley Scott's flair for direction but I have to say I'm surprised he accepted to make the film based on that script. It feels written by someone lacking experience; there are ideas of grandeur without depth, sub plots abandoned, stock characters and some of the worst dialogue I have been subjected to at the cinema. Without Ridley behind the camera creating the visuals he did, I would have walked out.

THE PROS: Few unfortunately. Michael Fassbender - An excellent character (maybe I am overstating as this was the only well written character in the film. I think a lot of that may be due however to Fassbender's performance). I like that all of David's actions are not explained, but hinted at. Visuals and effects - As expected - excellent. The abortion sequence - Brilliantly filmed and well acted. Apart from the opening (and the storm to some extent), the only real good set piece in the film.

THE CONS: Too many for a film of this calibre. Ridley Scott - He is a powerful presence in Hollywood and should have demanded better from the script. There was a severe lack of tension and suspension in this film, instead the later scenes felt rushed, rather than built up. Damon Lindelof - This is the major con. The film is brilliant right up to the point of meeting the crew. The crew are given minimal (and clichéd) dialogue to interact to give the audience a sense of their character and relationships. This is all done with no sub text. Motivations and actions of the crew go against their supposed backgrounds and some are clearly convoluted to enhance plot or a set piece. (Come here baby. I won't hurt you. AAARRGHHH). An attempt to create an original story within the 'Alien' universe - failed, primarily due to being unsure of which part of the story to tell and which parts to explain to enhance the experience. (I'm not a fan of having things explained in films; the best part about this film being David's actions with unclear motivation; but what happened to those snake like beings and what is their effect? Turning humans into zombies? This will tie in at some point... oh no, it doesn't and almost feels random in regard to the rest of the story. Climax - Rushed and disappointing. A revelation that a superior race is about to destroy Earth and mankind, over within minutes with no suspense. Also, once Charlize Theron escaped from the pod and was running with Noomi Rapace away from the alien craft, I was just waiting for her to get crushed by it. This was in standing with the rest of the film, predictable and flat. Guy Pearce - Who did his make up? I laughed out loud when he was first revealed. (And a couple of times in his later scenes - it was comical). Last scene - A rushed birth of the 'original' xenomorph.

"thecamillocienfuegos","Prometheus vs Alien, compare and contrast...","2 January 2014","Much well-deserved vitriol has been poured upon Prometheus by so many reviewers, it is not necessary to rehearse these critiques. I would like to add a brief comparison with the original Alien (1979), which is revealing as to the relative qualities of the two films and the general progress of Hollywood zeitgeist. (spoilers for 'Alien' alert).

First some prominent similarities, not to say homages/re-hashes...

Rag-tag crew rocks up on Alien planet and snoop around


Alien'impregnation' and 'birth' central to the plot


Dodgy android getting his head knocked off, then having a chat


Now for some telling and unfortunate differences...

The Crew: The Alien crew are often foolhardy, panicky or misguided, but then they are a bunch of miners tossed into an unexpected and shocking situation entirely unprepared, so their behaviour is believable. What's more they have an easy familiarity with each-other and humour that makes them sympathetic human beings. In contrast, the Prometheus crew, despite being highly qualified professionals, if anything behave much more stupidly and inexplicably than the original crew - there is little evidence of protocol or scientific rigour, not to mention common sense. More importantly they lack any semblance of humanity and likability - they are an atomized group of plot-drivers playing pass-the-stupid-ball.


The Androids: Ian Holm plays the android in Alien as officious, dispassionate and if anything slightly irritable - the genius of the role and performance is that you believe him as a human, but you also totally buy it when you discover that he was a robot all along. His motivation for letting the alien on board against protocol is entirely explained - he is a machine, totally loyal to corporate interest and indifferent to the lives of the humans on the ship. Michael Fassbender's android is a crass and faintly ridiculous caricature, who despite frequent references to his inability to feel emotions constantly has resentment or amazement written all over his face. Like the original android he wantonly endangers the crew by bringing nasty unknown alien stuff aboard; however in the case of Prometheus the crew includes the owner and financier of the mission (and his only child), making Fassbender's actions entirely insane, unless we assume that he has malfunctioned and now wishes to kill his programmer.


Dramatic tension and pace: Alien takes its time establishing dramatic tension, introducing the crew without fanfare and with little sign of the horrors to come. Prometheus immediately shows us the beef, which although visually entertaining, completely destroys the sense of reveal about the deadly/creative effects of the black goo. In Alien, tension is established and broken deliberately, as when the crew laugh together just before the alien 'birth', momentarily lulling the viewer into a false sense of security which serves to heighten the shock of the event. In Prometheus tension is never established, and what little there might be is broken incessantly by accidental absurdities, like the enthusiastic determination of the biologist to touch the hostile alien snake, or the eager cheerfulness of the pilots upon learning of the necessity of suicide.


The Politics: Alien was enhanced by a powerful undercurrent of political commentary on the present-day society. The corporation - aptly represented both by the literally heartless ship's medic, and the abstract 'computer-says-no' protocols that force the crew's compliance - is the other great enemy in the film, and the android's admiring description of the alien is a subtle but powerful critique of the amoral competitive mentality that was increasingly dominating business and politics. Of course the message is even more resonant today. Prometheus loses any semblance of political commentary in a swirl of arbitrary events and cosmological ideas too big to possibly explore satisfactorily – instead of a coldly acquisitive company we have a delusional old geezer, and a cheap re-hash of tired Pandora's Box / Tower of Babel / Frankenstein / Curiosity Killed the Cat themes that frankly were much more effectively done in (for instance) the Indiana Jones films.


In conclusion, Alien is a darkly effective and relevant movie that hints at a much greater universe and mystery in a way that enriches the film, while the similar ambitions of Prometheus are thwarted by a convoluted plot, poorly described characters, and the simultaneous over-exposure and under-explanation of the enigmatic and 'profound' elements.","3"
"1bilbo","Spoiler - very poor.","8 August 2012","This movie just failed to deliver.

The suspense wasn't there, the really great opening scene from Alien where we look around the ship created a real atmosphere – nothing like that in this film. Also we now had to have a ""Love interest"" sub plot – listen you directors love interests are for girlies who watch Friends – sci-fi is above that.

Then we had the convoluted graphics that were created in the abandoned space ship – they were colourful but meant nothing much. How much better when the original computer ""Mother"" was accessed by Sigourney Weaver in the original.

By the time the nasty creatures has revealed themselves the film had descended into gratuitous horror.

A wasted opportunity.","5"
"rlaine","Sadly not what I hoped for","7 October 2012","This is one of those movies that confirms that you should never really look forward to any movie. Call me pessimist, but it's very very rare that a movie you really wait forward seeing actually delivers. I love Ridley Scott's movies from past decades, Alien, Bladerunner, Legend. They're great movies, but I can't say I liked any of his movies as much after Black Rain.

The good things. Well, it looks pretty good and the general plot is thought-provoking. Noomi Rapace. I wasn't really sure about her being the leading lady here (after seeing her in the original Millennium trilogy), but she really makes this movie, she outshines everyone with Michael Fassbender, who also does a great role.

The not-so-good and bad things. Everything else, starting from the script. It's pretty interesting in the beginning, but a lot of stuff goes unexplained or are left as a mystery. I'm OK with movies that leave space for thought, but I feel they left too many things open here (like ""Lost"" btw..). You can have a mystery and an explanation in the end. I always loved the way the original Star Trek: The Motion Picture (1979) was written. It had a wonderful plot and the way things unraveled in the end, it was great. I guess those days are gone. In the end of this movie you'll just be scratching your head.

Having said that, this may be a case of heavy editing. There must have been an explanation or justification to every single scene in this movie, I'm sure the writers are not dumb. There are so many elements which kind of fit in the story, but are very loose and/or left as a mystery. For example the scene which reveals that Vickers (Theron) is Weylands (Pearce) daughter and showing their troubled relationship. This fits perfectly in a story about creators and creations, but it's completely irrelevant to the movie as it is now. As does the part where Shaw (Rapace) is impregnated. Did David plan it, what was the purpose? It's a pretty huge thing to carry an unknown lifeform, isn't it? But didn't seem that important to writers. There are lot of these things that would kind of fit the story, but are not really explained enough to fit the whole. Who should one blame, the writer, editor, producer, director? I don't know.

Then there's the cast, which is relatively big. I felt there were too many characters and I understand that in movies like Alien and Aliens, where they are on a routine mission or assignment, you have sort of ""misfits"" in the crew, but this was a billion dollar expedition to make first contact. Not buying it, sorry. The crew was full of morons. A tip to movie makers. You don't need to add ""regular"" people for movie-goers to relate to. In this movie they are totally out of place, unlike Aliens, which was handled with perfect tone by Mr. Cameron.

Then they had this side story of believing in god. Way too much going on.

While the soundtrack in general was OK, I didn't like the main theme (track ""Life"" in the OST). It had a ""something wonderful"" celestial vibe to it and was very out of place, I really disliked it in this movie. The movie was about mostly hostile beings and it wasn't friendly at all. Maybe would've fit in an early Star Trek movie or so, but not this. Horrible contrast, horrible.

I only hope there would be a (super)extended directors cut and maybe a sequel to explain things, otherwise this is just a torso of a movie. Shame on you all for producing this.","5"
"Chrismagee333","Absolutely dreadful","3 June 2012","This movie was awful. Solid acting performances are undermined by a preposterous premise, prepubescent philosophising and gaping inconsistencies. Why was an archaeologist (or palaeontologist?) also adept at surgery, neuroscience, anaesthesia and genetic biology? Being called ""Dr"" doesn't mean you're a skilled polymath, particularly not one with a working knowledge of the specialist surgical equipment market. Why do creatures with exactly our DNA look radically different to us? And why are their neurons not subject to autolysis after 2 millennia?

Very few of the characters' choices make any sense, from the first character on screen using himself as a channel to propagate life, rather than creating a chemical gumbo which would achieve the same thing, to their decision as polymath scientists to handle alien pathogens without protective clothing, to one character's decision to play with an alien that looked like a cross between a vagina and a cobra (people other than their regular handler should think twice before playing with either) that was hissing at him. The characters acted randomly, with no clear motive and often no conceivable motive, although assuming the Engineers' belief in a religion would explain some of their psychopathic murdering, blithe genocide, overcomplicated architecture and the suicide at the beginning.

However, basic concepts haven't been thought through. Somebody here suggested that we were to be destroyed because we'd reached the installation and woken the sleeping engineer, but of course they'd been delayed in destroying us by 2000 years, so that can't be the reason. And the brilliant philosophising defending the concept of a god - ""They made us, but who made *them*"" is easily and immediately answered. Maybe they evolved? Or their creator's creator evolved. We know that RNA can form spontaneously from assembled polymers so why not? Just because you can engineer biosystems doesn't mean you haven't evolved from chemicals. The film seems to argue that all life currently on Earth was seeded simultaneously (if not, the human race needs to have been inserted into an existing evolutionary biosystem that already contained bunnies and Neanderthals and such), therefore all them fossils we've been digging up that we thought preceded each species' common ancestors were also put there by these nutty bipolar aliens. Seeing a strand of human DNA floating about in a primordial river, I was reminded of John Cleese's line in The Life Of Brian - ""Where's the foetus going to gestate? You gonna to keep it in a bag?"". You can't just chuck some DNA in a river and expect a human to form underwater.

A Director's Cut might make some of this clearer, but it wouldn't get around some of the crummy science and bizarre character motives. Take the geologist, for instance, who gets lost trying to walk away from the search team after they find an alien (what was he expecting?) dead by a door. His helmet is melted to his face by alien (hydroflouric?) acid blood. He later drags himself back to the ship motivated by either vengeance or zombieism (the lifegiving goo has different effects each time, natch - if you're a chap it turns you into a piñata, a contortionist zombie or makes your leg fall off, but if you're a lady, exactly the same goo will leave your DNA untouched but it'll reactivate your withered reproductive system and cause an 8 pound squid to grow inside you within 24 hours with no baby bump, extreme hunger or pain, which you can detach from your spinal column with no injury via a hefty tug) and starts throwing punches, Queensbury Rules. He was only in that position because his mate decided to play with Gynocobra and his plight went undetected because trillionaire heiress ice queen Theron suddenly melted and hopped into bed with the ship's captain, because he explained the provenance of his accordion and accused her of being an android, leaving the bridge unattended.

Rather than try to hail the stranded men the next morning, and play the footage from their helmet cams when they didn't respond, our now post- coital heroes ""suit up"" and charge back into the temple accompanied by an android who's stopped following their instructions and taken to experimentally pushing any buttons he comes across in there, none of which bothers them.

This android, incidentally, must have a very sticky head, because after discombobulation it remains exactly in situ despite the circular ship he's in crashing, and making several rotations on the ground. Come to think of it, everything's still in situ so maybe it's just another egregious lapse in logic.

By this point, what could have been visually atmospheric sets just seem to be illogical. Why did the Engineers build a military facility out of heavy and hard-to-clean patterned, die-cast steel? Why have weapons with the ability to seed or destroy a planet been left with no automated security? Why can the characters touch light? Why is the ship's computer activated by playing a flute? Why was there no flute holder for the flute since it was integral? Is it because the Engineers each have their own flute?

As you're watching this film, you're initially giving its oddities the benefit of the doubt, and it's only afterwards that the full horror of what you just saw starts to sink in. It seems inconceivable that good PR or threat of personal injury weren't behind some of the fawning reviews I've seen and Wossy's two word review ""Oh dear"" rather sums it up for me, rather than Elliot Noble's more misleading effort which can be found above.

It's a silly film, best avoided. If he's going to do the same to Blade Runner, I may just have to start leaving copies of the original in hotel rooms like Giedeons bibles.","1"
"adrian-43767","PROMETHEUS: a jumble rehash of sci-fi and other classics, sinks deeper than TITANIC","1 November 2018","Ridley Scott, producer and director of PROMETHEUS, has the cheek to copy the stylish interiors of 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY; to have a kind of mutant (played by Fassbender) act like a highly scientific BLADE RUNNER who models himself after LAWRENCE OF ARABIA; two completely pointless characters played by Theron and Pearce, who bring to mind FORBIDDEN PLANET; the ship's sole survivor reminded me of Sigourney Weaver's character in ALIEN; the ship's navigation area and crew bring to mind STAR TREK and STAR WARS; and brains blow up inside glass headgear in a manner reminiscent of MARS ATTACKS; and ultimately Scott sets up a suicide scene that sees spaceships sink deeper than he sank TITANIC in 1997. Finally, as the piece de resistance, the last creature we see is a copy of ALIEN, the film that projected Scott as a director.

Frankly, Scott should be heavily fined for copying others' ideas and foisting them on the public as something new. To make matters worse, the film is overlong and does not make any sense at all.

I could kick myself for watching it to the end and I vow to steer clear of it, if ever I set eyes on it. The two stars are for special effetcs and photography.","2"
"squicker","Ghastly Muck","24 June 2012","Billed as an original myth set in the Alien universe, the story revolves around a team of scientists - of highly dubious ability - who set off to meet and speak to our makers. Predictably, things don't go as planned and the rest is told via an appalling script and amazing - but somewhat derivative - visuals.

Rather than the film being simply set in the Alien universe, it beats us over the head with a near constant stream of Alien references which merely serve to remind us how amazing Alien is compared to this claptrap.

Prometheus is bursting at the seams with religious symbols, but these are never fully explored, resulting in a rather 'Inception'-like experience, where stupid people will be made to feel they have watched something 'deep' and the more switched on viewer will recognise this for the charade it truly is.

Giger must be laughing his head off at the creature designs in Prometheus, which are the sort of thing you see in comedy horror films. And, whilst the set designs are based upon his work in Alien, they just do not have the haunting and disturbing quality of the original design ethic.

Worst of all by far is the writing which has no focus and sees people acting in ludicrous ways which defy motivation. The dialog is comprised of lines such as, ""if you go down there you will all die"", or, ""I love rocks!!"", or perhaps, ""I am only here for the moneeeey!"". Truly embarrassing stuff that will have you hiding your head in your hands every five minutes. Add to this a few utterly predictable reveals, an ending only for fanboys and science that even a 4 year old knows is baseless and you have the least watchable film of the decade to date.

The only reason to watch this film is to have a Mystery Science Theatre 3000 style evening with friends, where Prometheus will provide you will ample opportunity to snigger at its many shortcomings.","4"

I'm not going to go in into great detail about the movie, other than I watched it when it came out on Blu-ray and watched it again 3 nights ago with my girlfriend and I still loved it the second time!","8"
"robertguttman","Alien Revisited, Plus Creationism, Equals a Mess","16 October 2021","Ridley Scott, who directed ""Alien"" in 1979, revisits all the plot and character points of that earlier movie with the addition of a great deal of pseudo-religious ""Creationism"". The movie begins, presumably on Earth at the ""dawn of time"", with an ""Engineer"" (i.e., an Alien) who is on Earth for no reason that is ever explained, and who promptly commits suicide for no reason that is ever explained. If you find that perplexing, don't worry about it because the scene is never revisited or explained again.

The scene switches to 2093, when a spaceship is sent on a ""scientific"" mission of discovery to a particular moon of a particular planet in particular solar system, the selection of which as a destination is never adequately explained, in order to find and confront the alien beings who created mankind to learn the reason for creation. Once there, the ""scientists"" and crew behave in the usual un-scientific and un-methodical manner of humans in any new environment, exploring the new world with all of the finesse of a herd of bulls in the proverbial china shop. One repeatedly hears one character or another warn, ""Don't tough that"", only to be ignored with the obligatory dire consequences. Upon encountering an unknown but threatening life form, one character, purportedly a biologist, reacts by trying to pet it - with the obligatory dire consequences. When, for no reason that is ever explained, a character who is already dead turns up unexpectedly alive outside the ship, the crew immediately open the door to admit him - with the obligatory dire consequences. One of the most jarringly absurd aspect of the movie is the scene where a woman performs a caesarean section upon herself in order to abort her unborn alien fetus. If that isn't ridiculous enough, she promptly snaps back a moment later just as fit and active as she was before the surgery.

Although the story takes place in 2093 and the film was made in 2012, some of the characters behave more as though they were in movie the 1950s or 1960s. At one point the captain of the ship accuses the leader of the expedition, who is a woman, of ""being a robot"" because she won't put out. Today one would expect a woman to respond to that with indignation, to fire him for sexual harassment or even to have him prosecuted. However, her response is to tell him to meet her in his room in ten minutes!

However, perhaps the most jarring note in ""Prometheus"" is the pro-creationist/anti-evolution note that runs through the entire narrative. At one point one of the characters, purportedly a biologist, makes a remark about ""throwing out three centuries of Darwinism"". NO scientist, least of all a biologist, would talk like that. The theory of evolution IS NOT, and NEVER HAS BEEN, a religion and Charles Darwin was NOT the prophet of a religion. In fact Darwin, who was the son of a Protestant minister, would have been appalled at any such notion. The theory of evolution is exactly what it says it is, a SCIENTIFIC THEORY, arrived at through observation and inference.","3"
"codive","Doesn't make sense","19 August 2012","One point for the visuals.

The rest is nonsense, and fails at anything it promised before, and keeps promising during the film.

I do forgive a lot, but I don't forgive film makers when they demonstrate that they think the audience is stupid.

Now, that I've given it two days to contemplate, I really must say, this is the worst film, I've seen in a looooong time.

And that's all I say. I've now tried several times at listing the horrible mistakes. I give up. Look at other reviews, you will find plenty of them.

The keys to a good film are: characters, acting, and a good story that sticks to the premises it sets, and keeps it up with all consequences.

I can accept time travel, space ships that make a sound in vacuum, androids that express emotions, The Force, a terminator that needs human tissue, or some goo that is doing inexplicable things, even dead people who are resurrected somehow.

As long as you stick to it! I can not accept a story that contradicts itself in so many ways, and leaves plot holes so unbelievably obvious, it makes you cringe, and it's not even unintentionally funny.

I'm not stupid! But the film makers make me feel I am stupid.

Enough said. Don't see it. It's a waste of time, and the more I think about it, the angrier I get.","1"

"HareTrinity","Prometheus: Taking the ""science"" out of ""science fiction""","14 June 2012","Hey, do you have a basic understanding of evolution and see how smoothly we fit in with the species of this world (e.g. pentadactyl limb)? Forget it. A rough idea of where our medical science is and how it's progressing? Won't need that either. The ability to relate to characters that are well written? Unnecessary, there aren't any characters like that here!

The science is bad from the start (basic understanding of human/non- human DNA comparison seems absent, that or we're meant to swallow that HUGE coincidence) but the scientists are worse. I'd have thought that the average human knows that ""finding a patch of breathable air in a cavern"" does not mean ""the whole place has breathable air"" due to gas pockets and risk of airbourne infections, let alone the more physical dangers of exploring underground terrain (e.g. collapsing ceilings), yet NO ONE, not even the geologist/biologist duo, disagreed. Also, know something that any living thing with basic instincts should know? If a large snake-thing is rearing up to a good 2 feet, hissing and displaying its hood, DO NOT poke its face! Know who I'd least expect to ignore those warnings? A biologist in the dark who was already specifically trying to steer clear of alien lifeforms, which brings me onto my next point...

The ""characters"" are horribly erratic. It was when the biologist found ALIEN LIFE that he decided to leave. Uh, what? Isn't that WHY he went there? He seemed like such a friendly nerd when we first see him but quickly runs off with the guy who hates him. It gets worse. If someone saved you and your partner's life after the ""greatest discovery of mankind"" would you really get drunk alone and start slagging off your saviour? Also; you'd think that finding out that you were right all along, that your faith was justified and that ""anyone can make life"" wouldn't be the time to suddenly bring up and cry about fertility issues. Ergh. Why was a certain stowaway was kept secret anyway? Why did they decide finding 1 tomb-like structure meant that the species was extinct? Why did the researchers, getting no instant reaction to electricity, decide to further Taser their great and fragile discovery? Why, why, WHY would you pick death-by-fire over death-by-atmosphere? Or run forward instead of out of the path of the giant rolling wheel? ALL of these things could have been done better (e.g. fertility issues brought up by worried anticipation as they approach the planet, not introducing the unfortunate buddy pair as scientists who didn't like each other, not having a surprisingly-heavy-zombie scene at all). The whole film felt like the ""plot points"" were just messily shoved in as an afterthought (""oh, put some emotion in there, and some action here"").

As for the technology... We're already starting to use digital microscopes, projectors/screens on a regular basis an lasers to close wounds; what was with the manual tasks, acrylic block iPhone and staples? Why doesn't the ship have a delicate enough autopilot to avoid that ending (and why does no one seem to value their lives)?

To finish my review: The 3D was pretty terrible too, plus this film had the most unbelievable dream sequence I've EVER seen. This is only getting 3 stars from me because I think the actors did okay with the scripts they were given, the effects were decent and the scenery striking, plus I liked the baby-to-the-rescue scene at the end.

Wait for the film on TV if you're curious, but I went with low expectations and was still surprised by how bad it was.","3"
"mike-odell","too ambiguous, too illogical, totally unsatisfying","26 July 2012","My main problem with Prometheus is that it doesn't follow the principles of evolution that the first two films stuck to. The nasties in Prometheus appear to morph within a generation, according to whatever is required to jump out at the victim.

From the first scene Ridley proffers up goop that breaks you down into little strands of DNA. If you are an Engineer on a waterfall then the process is immediate. And your DNA magically flows out into the world to make a new species. Not bad for a fairly unstable molecule. So right from the outset, we're encouraged to forget about evolution and instead believe that humans are engineered. There is even a line delivered by one of the disgruntled grunts on the space ship to this effect.

But if you're a human, then this disintegration is delayed overnight, long enough to pass on your semen and for nematodes to crawl out your eye. Meanwhile, the sperm will produce a daemonic squid embryo which will grow big enough, fast enough to tackle an Engineer. And if that giant squid gets you, then a proto-alien mysteriously arises from your remains.

But that't not all! The goop nematodes can grow into mealy worms that within hours can grow into albino snakes. I'm not sure what those had to do with the reanimated corpse that turned up outside the ship with it's legs over it shoulders, bent on murdering everything until burnt to death. Are we talking zombies from the tape worms?

So we have these randomly morphing entities that alter form within single generations. It's not clean, it's not tight, it's not believable. It's too X-Men. At least the X-Men premise is forgivable because, as nonsensical as it is, the premise of fantastical mutations within individuals is set up from the outset. Fine! Accept it or not, you know where the starting point is. But Alien didn't start with that. The thing that burst out of John Hurt remained more or less the same thing that burst out of everyone else, give or take some spare DNA from the host to ensure the newborn was adapted to the surroundings. So being asked to swallow a host of hokey morphings between (or even within) generations isn't part of the deal.

What is worse, is that it pre-empts any decent attempts to expand the Alien myth backwards from the first film. Alien and Aliens (and to a much lesser extent Alien 3) took their time to describe a new species and stayed true to that description. The lifecycle of the alien was tight enough for people to invest in. But Prometheus grabs at so many different ideas that it breaks that rigor down.

So that is my main problem, instead of being shown more of the Alien universe and how the Space Jockey's got tangled up in it, we're fobbed off with quasi-religious pseudo philosophical posturing about the meaning of sacrifice. Ridley nailed the way to philosophize about existence in Blade Runner, the nature of the soul and artificial intelligence.

But he didn't have to sacrifice the integrity of the physics in the Blade Runner universe in order to do it. The film was first and foremost a great Action SciFi film noir. The story was central. That has to be priority number one. But Prometheus wanders randomly, dragging ideas in, none of which feel vaguely original.

Compounding this is the sad fact that Prometheus as a movie is just plain bad. I found very little in it to generate suspense. The alien head reanimation was lifted from Alien and Aliens 3 where the android are similarly reanimated, but the techno babble in this case is thin and totally unconvincing. A giant needle to the head and magic dust. And to what effect? It appeared to be there for the sake of being there.

Characters acted inconsistently and illogically; No archaeologist would open a tomb at the risk of changing the atmospheric conditions. No xenobiologist would risk touching unknown substances. No ship's captain would open the ship to allow in potentially infected crew.

And as for that abortion scene?! How come a machine that is configured for men has forceps? And whatever that technology was that can staple her abdomen together and leave just a red line behind could have been used to serious effect on the Nostromo years later! Good job she knew precisely how to override the machine and get it set up for her needs, being an archaeologist and all. Once the cut and shut jobs been done to poor Noomi (who does an outstanding job of imbuing some integrity into this nonsensical thread) we descend into The Three Stooges slapstick as each scene now contrives to hit her in her wound.

The last reel is positively risible, both ladies dash ahead of a rolling Engineer ship (I was waiting for a nicely timed window to save Noomi) until finally she dives sideways, just for the gargantuan ship to fall sideways, but avoids crushing her because ... of a rock?!

All well and good that Ridly wanted to put in plenty of allegory into the film, but he lost site of making a story and dumped the Alien myth in the process. The one thing that still make me so angrily disappointed by this film is that now no one will have a chance to backfill and expand that story with something true to the spirit of the original. I can only hope that someone will buy the rights to Blade Runner to prevent him hosing that one down too.","1"

Unfortunately, however, the story has more than a few plot holes. The characters constantly behave stupidly and illogically, and after a while it's hard to believe in, or feel for, them. Aside from the usual red shirt characters, who are obviously in the film to get killed off early on, pretty much everybody in the film is conspicuously dumb too.

There's plenty of gore, with heads exploding and similar. Some people really go for that stuff, and consider it a major attraction. I myself don't mind it, but only when it serves the story. I find it a bit cheap when the causes of these events don't seem to make a huge amount sense.

One thing worth noting before you see it is that THIS FILM IS NOT A PREQUEL. The planet it is set on is not the same planet that the original Alien film starts on (LV-426). Instead, it takes place on LV-223 which just looks very similar. Confusing, but there it is.","6"
"greenmemo","Pearls Before Swine","13 June 2012","""Prometheus"" is a film born of an interesting idea but with an agenda so varied that it cannot possibly fulfill each and every one of its interests. Moreover, the coexistence of these very diverse themes results in some serious problems of tone which are very difficult to ignore. Let's just say that rather poignant musings on the creation of man and the nature of the soul do not get along very well with monsters straight out of ""20,000 Leagues Under the Sea."" And if we add an element of ambiguity that stems from sparing vital information for understanding some of the actions of the protagonists, in the absence of which it is easy to assume that these are a completely illogical acts, we have a sure shot for controversy , where some fans will complete the missing elements with theories lifted from the discussion forums and viral videos, and other will give up concluding that it's just the screenplay's expository problems. I personally favor the latter: I do not think a film should retro-feed information from any other medium, or even from other entries in the ""Alien"" franchise. The film itself should contain all the clues to explain itself. In this regard, ""Prometheus"" wins some points for its first half, during which it sets itself apart from the universe of ""Alien"", putting enough distance to it, so it is actually able to stand on its own foundations. Unfortunately, soon enough it starts losing these points, as it piles up the type of loose ends that only a sequel (or two) could mend. That is to say, ""Prometheus"" is not so much indebted to the past of ""Alien"" as it is to the future of a new saga. It is a sign of the times, where sequels and reboots dominate the market and its creators conceive narrative arcs that only close in a next installment (box office returns permit). Not that ""Prometheus"" does not have its pleasures. In fact, as entertainment, it is a film that has very few flaws. As a spectator you can feel frustrated, but never bored. Obviously, it is a film built around a handful of very effective set pieces, except perhaps one involving a mutant attacking the crew, an episode whose sole function seems to have been to raise the body-count. The decidedly retro look of the movie is another aspect that I enjoyed greatly, a style not necessarily inspired by the iconography of the original ""Alien"", but by cult films like Mario Bavas's ""Planet of the Vampires"" , Fred M. Wilcox's ""Forbidden Planet"", and of course Stanley Kubrick's ""2001: A Space Odyssey"", which opening sequence plays a similar role to that of ""Prometheus""; Weyland's room also strongly reminds the aging astronaut's quarters in that film. Equally outstanding is the conceptual art for the Engineers: their silent presence is more evocative than any description the writers could have come up with: their appearance is reminiscent of the archetypes of beauty and virile power reflected in art from ancient times, usually associated with the notion of a Creator, suggesting that perhaps these were not just a sublimation of an ideal, but a reflection of a real model. As for the acting, just one word: Fassbender (he eats the movie, stealing every scene he is in). While watching ""Prometheus,"" especially when a character was delivering a particularly bland line of dialog, I could not help feeling that the crew of the starship were in desperate need of a philosopher. Maybe a Dr. Spock type of character: someone who could make an erudite interpretation of the events; an intellect capable of drawing analogies; of weighing the significance and consequences of the encounter between Creator and creature as featured in the film. None of the characters lived up to the challenge. Shaw, the protagonist, was admittedly wrong throughout the whole film (not an example of clear mind for sure), and David, although might have been a good philosopher, hid his motivations so well that his contribution to this effect was limited to only a few sarcastic remarks. Pearls before swine, as they say...

My score: 7/10","7"
"bigbillyt","Visually Amazing, Horribly Written","27 June 2012","I will make this as simple as I can. The look and feel of the film was beautiful. The combination of cinematography, lighting and effects was just stunning at times. Unfortunately, the script was awful. I never felt any empathy for these characters. So, even though, conceptually, the plot had some compelling points, I was never drawn into the story. Then I remembered, this is the same writer behind Lost and it all made sense. I tried to watch that meandering train wreck of a series for the first two seasons before I realized that the writers idea of motivation for characters was either painfully corny are made purposely and unnecessarily ambiguous. So, if you enjoy blatant, phony manipulation using overwrought abstract concepts, you might enjoy this. Otherwise, spend your ten bucks elsewhere. Too bad, 'cuz Ridley Scott is generally a good director.

Ah, I see now that same guy produced and wrote stupid Cowboys and Aliens too, that explains that movie's stupidity then too. Wow, talk about a crappy character. Poor Harrison Ford, they made his character so despicable that it made no sense that he was supposed to have this huge change at the end and you were supposed to like him, whatever. Sorry, I hate crap writing, especially when they con me out of money to be exposed to it.

Oh, and I really feel a little ripped off by the it's not really a sequel BS too. I mean, really? You are going to have all these concepts and characters but then show us creatures that require some evolution or explanation as to why they are what they are. Just seems ill-conceived if you ask me. I hope they either don't do sequels to this or at least try to clean up some of the mess if they do.","5"
"mkc1218","Awful","10 June 2012","***SPOLIERS, BUT DO YOURSELF A FAVOR AND DON'T SEE THIS MOVIE***

Prometheus is one of the worst films that I have ever seen in the theater.

I had no idea what the story was and, quite frankly, did not care after a while. I wanted all the characters to die, all 73 of them. Seriously, what is the point of all these characters? And the fact that they are so uninteresting?

Nothing happens in the first hour. And when things do start happening, you have no idea how they relate to each other.

The music seems to be from a different, happier movie. (Jerry Goldsmith is turning over in his grave.)

As my buddy pointed out, the aliens give signs to the people of Earth telling us where the base is from which they plan to destroy Earth. Huh? Maybe I am missing something here, or these are just really stupid aliens.

Two characters announce they are going to have sex in 10 minutes, and we never see the scene or have it referred to again in the whole film. Don't get me excited to see a scantily clad Charlize Theron and then let me down. That's just not right.

What is up with Guy Pearce channeling Keir Dullea from the film 2010? What is the point of having a young actor play an old man unless that old man is transformed into the young actor at some point in the film? Why not just get an old actor? Let's save some money in our makeup budget.

And the whole search for God premise and its really bad development and symbolism was cringe worthy. I felt sorry for the filmmakers watching the entire thing.

On the positive side, there are two legitimately cool scenes in the film. And Charlize's complexion is flawless, the movie looked great, and my popcorn was fresh. Way fresher than this movie.","1"
"R_Alex_Jenkins","Inexplicably Bad","22 May 2014","It's got everything going for it - one of the best directors, unparalleled subject material and a huge budget, but even so, it's shockingly bad. It's so difficult to comprehend, I'm even going as far as noting down the names of the writers in an attempt to avoid their future work: Jon Spaihts and Damon Lindelof (who?). I can't believe Ridley Scott is entirely responsible for this mish-mash of a film.

How did they get is so wrong? I swivelled in my armchair and raised a middle finger to the screen in personal protest, scoffing to myself, after about an hour. It was boring and hugely insulting to the intelligence.

Getting back to cold facts; the film and its idiocies didn't offend me as much as the horrific, hollow acting. Going back to 1979's 'Alien', the acting offsets the tension through constant bantering/bickering between crew members, sexual innuendo, incompetence, laziness, etc. The acting and interaction is a pivotal point of the original film because it distracts us from the true horror lurking in the dark. Here, it flat-lines. Noomi Rapace was out of her depth and Charlize Theron completely non-existent in a pointless part. Only Michael Fassbender was any good.

I'm not going to mention everything else (lying) such as the ridiculous, obnoxious scientists, panicking one minute, overly confident the next. The absence of safety measures and protocol when handling foreign objects, spontaneous opening of airlocks, taking helmets off in space, not using quarantine procedures, rash experiments on potentially hazardous specimens... it just goes on and on - a real headache of insulting inaccuracies and glaring omissions.

Yes, I hated it, and it's not scary or tense at all. It's technically superb but devoid of quality acting and intelligent believability.

I want to add to the scorn and criticism for this film because it deserves it.","3"
"jaj5zh","awful sci-fi","21 February 2014","I settled in my hotel room and switched on HBO to find Prometheus just beginning. Checking IMDb, I found that it had 7+ stars, so I thought why not. Boy, what a disappointment! By the end, I was almost laughing except that I knew I would never get those two hours of my life back. Futurama is more compelling sci-fi than this!

The talents of many fine actors was wasted here - Charlize Theron was apparently signed to look devastatingly beautiful and calculating, which she managed effortlessly. Michael Fassbender's role was laughable (such a waste). Indris Elba was apparently asked to affect a southern accent (tragic!). Noomi Rapace was able to generate a bit of character interest, but it was all for naught when she put Fassbender's head (still talking) in her backpack, hence the Futurama reference. Awful, awful, awful, awful!","3"
"DustinRahksi","A good start, but I need more.","22 November 2012","This film is in no way, shape or form a bad movie, it's high above average, but only for a few reason's. I haven't been this excited to see a movie in a long time, I even went on opening day, that was a bad idea because our seats were in the second row from the front, so I didn't get to enjoy the 3D. Noomi Rapace and Micheal Fassbender were good, Charlize Theron was just there and the rest of the crew is garbage. I found the Charlie character to be annoying. It baffles me how all these characters, especially when they find the pyramid thing with the alien artifacts, you would think they would be excited as hell, but they even get mad about their findings. There are a lot of plot holes and some of the actions they do are ridiculous, at one point they even have an baby alien on board the ship and they don't care or do anything about it. And how a woman can give birth to a squid(face-hugger) is beyond me. But i'm just complaining now so i'll get on with the good things. The visuals are incredible, same with the original score. The sets look great, the ship is fantastic. The atmosphere is great at some points, although not many. The Fifield creature scene was great, very well done. The space jockeys or engineers, whatever, were disappointing at first, but you will get the reasoning behind, so it is acceptable. This film would feel much more complete with a sequel, after all it is going in a different way then the alien franchise, and i'm glad they chose to do so. This film should be experienced with a good sound system, maybe even 3D, but I can't say anything about that.

Recommend to any fan of science-fiction, I have watched this film a few times and I enjoy it more with each watch.","7"
"qqknowlton-85783","An Excellent, Throughtful Sci-fi","26 July 2017","Prometheus is one of the few sci-fi/horror movies that is deep enough to make it almost detracting from the story.

Noomi Rapace did an excellent job as the independent female lead.

Charlize Theron, Guy Pearce and Idris Elba (who should have had more screen time) were excellent.

The CGI wasn't distracting, but helped to create a real alien world environment.

I liked the film's anthropological approach to discovering human's roots and I appreciated the philosophical questions that were raised.

The film is very entertaining for people who like slow-paced thrillers with good scares and real human emotions.","8"
"commander_zero","Launches, sputters, crashes","9 February 2013","If you've enjoyed any of the ALIEN films, be prepared to find PROMETHEUS deeply depressing. Its plot is silly, its characters are unengaging and its suspense is missing. What went wrong? We have a skillful director, a great cast, and wonderful special effects—all undone by a clumsy script. It's as if the credited screenwriters, Jon Spaihts and Damon Lindelof, wrote two separate screenplays and Ridley Scott just stir-fried them together, occasionally mixing in a page or two from a script of his own. The result is a little bit of sci-fi spectacle, a little bit of action- buddy movie, a little bit of medical horror, and even a little bit of the laziest device in sci-fi movies, a character whom alien infection turns into an unstoppable zombie killer.

Part of making a believable imaginary world is that the world of the film must at least be consistent with its premises. When the film's scientists, searching for clues that terrestrial life emerged on an alien planet, find the air breathable and TAKE OFF THEIR HELMETS, only to spend the next hour or so worrying about contagion, it seems likely that the production was filmed from a scattering of pages. Similarly, although the premise of the film is that Prometheus has taken more than two years to travel at great speed to a distant star, at one point its commander Charlize Theron (who, no doubt furious at finding herself in this turkey, plays her ice queen role to grim perfection) complains that they are ""half a billion"" miles from Earth—meaning that they are only out around Jupiter somewhere.

Scientific illiteracy, irrelevant back stories, uncertain motivation (like the geologist who, when they find an ancient alien skeleton, turns around and heads back to the ship, because skeletons aren't geology)-- it's as if they had given Ed Wood 150 million dollars to make his dream film. Proof of the prevailing contention that all the good screen writing is on television these days, ALIEN fans would be better off watching ALIEN RESURRECTION—now THERE'S a fun movie—or even the much-maligned ALIEN VS PREDATOR which at least, unlike PROMETHEUS, is professionally- done every inch of the way.","4"

"SpoilerAlertReviews","It's part of the Alien Franchise.","3 July 2012","Oh dear, I remember leaving the cinema undecided and after much thought and discussion, Prometheus turns out to be quite a disappointment. Given the already established ingredients that made the original and sequel such a success, it's hard to digest Mr. Scott failed to deliver what was one of the most anticipated movies of it genre. I can understand Mr. Scott making a non-direct prequel in his own fashion but to lack the horror/suspense/action which made the originals so iconic within sci-fi seems and proves to be a mistake.

Instead we're offered what might appear to be a prequel to something else, a realm of mystery and the famous alien heritage getting a cameo appearance. What we do recognise is the artificial human David, which Mr Fassbender portrays excellently and actually steals the show. We have been expecting to meet the 'space jockeys' and we do but we also get introduced to a new array of creatures, only one of which being like the original Alien. There is some confusion and debate about the motives and processes in Prometheus that makes the audience leave with a lot of questions.

The special effects and production are impressive and echo Alien perfectly, however, I can understand it's hard to imagine something new, but there is already a platform for the alien creation and I can't stop feeling that, even with H.R. Giger's input, the Alien legacy has been tampered with, giving me the same distaste Alien Resurrection left me with. Really, given Mr. Scott's experience and the fact he made the original Alien, I honestly believe he should know better. There was some unnecessary scenes and plot devices, and some that just didn't make much sense.

Even though the film runs slightly over 2 hours, I don't think the characters, apart from David are giving enough time to develop. The crew is strong so it can only have something to do with story/script. The score hints at the original themes and does it's job. But overall, the film is disappointing but quite possibly because I'm such a fan of the early franchise. So, if you haven't seen the previous films already, this might be a superb film for you.","5"
"taoandtao","Planetary Exploration But Everyone Sucks At Being Professional","23 September 2021","Let's get one thing clear: Prometheus could've been a good movie, maybe even a great movie. But the lacklustre writing really brought this film down.

THE GOOD:
The visual effects in this movie are amazing. They've really outdone themselves when it came to creating realistic and beautifully grotesque alien lifeforms.


Some characters. Fifield, while appearing to be a tough and probably not very likeable character, at least he has the common sense to want to get out of there when there's a literal DEAD body on the ground.


David on this journey also acts like the HAL 9000 in 2001: A Space Odyssey. A (mostly) emotionless, yet efficient, artificial lifeform that could quickly produce results.

THE BAD:
Literally every other character in the movie.


Elizabeth Shaw seems to be a religious fanatic obsessed with finding out more about the Engineers, even though there's clear danger. Her addiction to finding answers would always result in disaster. And why would she just leave a hostile alien baby inside the medpod? She didn't even bother to mention to the crew ""hey, there's a giant killer squid alien in the medpod, watch youself.""

Holloway's idiotic decision to leave the ship when he is visibly ill nearly slam my head into the wall. If I woke up with bloody eyes and a moving, wriggling parasite in my eye, I would visit the medic.

Millburn's carefree and moronic decision to approach what clearly looked hostile ultimately killed him. The writers didn't even make him likeable enough for the audience to feel emotions when he was killed. What do you do when you see an alien organism? You stay away. It looked like a cobra, and it moved like a cobra. You don't see anyone else in literally any other space horror film where they go ""goo goo gaa gaa"" to an unknown alien animal.

The crew just acted like idiots. A few examples:
~ They removed their helmets in a supposedly clean environment, but when there was unknow waste around they didn't even bother to put their helmets back on. It was unknown biology, it could've done anything. How would they know if it wasn't toxic? I'm quite sure their scanners wouldn't be able to identify chemicals and compositions it wouldn't know.

~ They just casually bring a severed preserved alien head onboard. Like ??????? Isn't that some sort of biohazard? And why didn't they have any more protection, instead of just surgical masks and gloves? That doesn't seem safe. And people just watched without any protective gear?????

~ When they were running away from the rolling spaceship, why didn't they run out the sides? It was like a scene from a cartoon. It's like running straight on the traintracks when there's a train approaching.

~ Shaw claims not to need weapons on the initial expedition. Like sure that's safe. You have no idea what's inside, but absolutely don't bring anything that could keep you safe?

Bad storytelling. There was just too many things going on. For some reason this movie loves to have two major events happening at once, such as:
~ Holloway having a medical emergency when there's literally two corpses, one with an unidentified alien inside.

~ Shaw having a hostile alien baby inside of her, a horribly gruesome scene, then Fifield shows up out of nowhere and starts killing the crew?

~Shaw is suffering severe pain from that improvised surgery. She is stumbling around the ship covered in mucus and blood and anaesthesia, but suddenly Weyland himself is there? And then she just forgets about her painful ordeal just moments ago?

The story also moves too quickly. It's just one scene to another scene to another scene. Like such:
Holloway sick -> TWO DEAD BODIES ON THE GROUND -> Alien inside dead body -> Drive back -> Holloway is burnt due to infection -> Shaw wakes up and is informed she's pregnant with an alien -> she is sedated but escapes and has a C-section -> she fights off the alien and tries to contain it inside the medpod -> Fifield (but hostile) stumbles back to ship and kills and wounds multiple crew members -> Weyland is woken up and is Shaw just bows down to him -> They go back to alien spaceship. This all happens within half an hour. That's wayyyy to much for the audience to handle, let along develop a proper story.

In the end, there's just way too many disappointments in the movie, so it's ultimately not that good.","5"

"vip-danii","A Major Disappointment...","13 September 2015","""Alien"" was a classic. This is yet another hypey Hollywood blockbuster that was forgotten immediately after viewing. I saw it the week it came out, in 3D. Re-watched it again just now, and it's still crap.

One word to describe the movie: ""disappointing"". Why? Because it felt rushed, severely under-developed, inconsistent, poorly put together, unrealistic, amateurish, and, at times, downright laughable.

Lots of WTF moments. Scientists basing most of their rationalization and decisions on ""this is what I choose to believe?"" It's a trillion dollar mission, yet no-one seems to know why they are there and what's expected of them? Taking your masks off on an unfamiliar planet, where air could be contaminated? What do you do when you make the most important discovery in the history of mankind -- get drunk, of course!? A guy who freaks out when he sees a dead alien body then decides to pet, and play with, an unfriendly-looking alien cobra? Running around with your abdomen sliced open and held together by a few metal staples? Giving birth to a squid less than 24 hours after intercourse with an infected individual -- and you don't tell anyone, and nobody notices, and having wanted it out of you so badly, you forget to kill it once it's out? Seeing that you're about to get squashed by an incoming alien space craft, instead of moving sideways, you continue to run *away* from it? Are you kidding me? Ridiculous. This half-arsed movie is unwatchable! It's an insult to human intelligence.

And as soon as the team meet ""our creators"" (for some reason, there's only one -- and he is a moody bald bodybuilder that has been abusing steroids?), the creators immediately rush to their ship to get to our planet and destroy it? Jeez, they had that option for, like, centuries; why now? Why are they hostile towards us in the first place? Not clear.

I think most of the characters were totally unnecessary. Some of them served no purpose whatsoever. It's like they had a lot of spare money, and decided to spend it on employing more actors for no apparent reason. The people behind this movie should have used the spare money to pay a competent screen-writer to review the story-line and dialogue, both of which were a complete joke in my opinion.

P***-poor acting by Charlize Theron. Jeez, she cannot pull off a role like this, sorry. The lead female was half-decent; the rest were not very good. Zero character development. The characters were unlikeable and not at all interesting. Plus, none of them could pass for an actual scientist; not in a million years. And speaking of characters: where did they all go? Some of them were killed, but what happened to the others -- it was never explained; they just vanished.

You know, watching this reminded me of watching daytime soap, honestly. Boring, over-dramatized, completely unrealistic. No tension, no suspense... just a bunch of poorly-chosen random people getting paid to act out a ridiculous script.

Some reviewers have described this movie as ""thought provoking""... Well, I assure you I'm not being sarcastic when I say that I've seen some episodes of Barney the Purple Dinosaur that were more though-provoking than this. The only thought it provokes, is this: why was this movie necessary, and who is the target audience (the mentally handicapped or pre-schoolers)? The only good thing I can say about this movie: good scenery (especially in 3D). But people go to see movies primarily for the story, so the visuals alone are not quite enough, sadly.","1"

I expected it to be a proper prequel but it wasn't supposed to be, but even as a movie it had plenty of shortcomings. It's like a series of boring events made exciting by having them take place on an alien planet. I didn't like the character of David at all and his ridiculous knowledge and understanding of an alien dialect/language he's never seen before. I don't like how Weyland was alive and on the ship for no reason other than his own desires. And I especially didn't like how stupid every single crew member was. Although the technology was seven kinds of amazing, it's not a big enough influence on the actual movie itself. If you wanna see amazing technology, just find it on YouTube. Scott demands that the audience suspend practically all of their disbelief to make the film work, and that's never a good idea.","5"
"movieman89-2","Over hyped and disappointing","13 June 2012","When I first heard that this was a prequel to the Alien saga (which I'm a big fan of), I did think at first 'OK, enough is enough with Alien, should of technically stopped at 3'. But then I found that was Ridley Scott doing it and that was step up for me. I saw many trailers. Still unsure about seeing it. Then I thought 'what the hey, I'll go and see it' Invited a few friends with me to see it last night. I came out the screen after very unsatisfied.

The acting performances were great. Fassbender was very good. Noomi Rapace was really good and did a very convincing British accent, may have slipped a couple of times but that doesn't matter.

Now the story, it ran in the same format as the first Alien film, OK, we've seen that format before, but lets just let it go and keep watching. It was nice to see new creatures other than the original ones. But let me ask, we know the 'engineers' created these creatures, but where is the explanation of the original ones? We also found that the engineers created humans, very unsure.

Now the scene where Repace's character gives herself surgery in the surgery booth because there is a creature in her stomach, it was shocking but I thought it was ridiculous, how can you still be alive after giving yourself surgery without anaesthetic? I don't know.

The ending of the film really frustrated me. In the first Alien film, we find that the engineer is in the ship, on his chair on the telescope, dead with ripped open rib cage. In this, after the ship crashes, he comes after Repace in her ship. There is a big continuity mistake between this and Alien. I'm sorry Ridley, but if you're trying to make a prequel, you've got it wrong.

The CGI was probably the best thing about the movie. You can tell that Scott had a lot of fun with it.

I'm sorry for all the spoilers and sounding rather grouchy. Overall, very disappointing. A prequel gone extremely wrong. Very over hyped, maybe it's because it has connection to Alien and It's Ridley, directing it. You might enjoy this if you haven't seen the quadrilogy but if you have, you can point the mistakes in this. It's good for entrainment, thats for sure. I did see that Ridley is planning a sequel. Well he better do better than this.","5"
"moviexclusive","Groundbreaking it is not, but Ridley Scott's return to sci-fi is visually astounding, grippingly-told horror that thrills and intrigues as his original 'Alien'","5 June 2012","How thoroughly distressing it must be for Ridley Scott to watch one of his beloved creations desecrated by one filmmaker after another with each successively disappointing entry in the 'Alien' franchise, so much so that after a thirty-year hiatus from the science-fiction genre, Scott has decided once more to revisit the very series that has defined his entry into Hollywood. And what better way to return than to go all the way back, even before the point when the spaceship Nostromo first picked up that unknown signal from what seemed to be a desolate planetoid.

It should come as no surprise by now that 'Prometheus' is the first of a two-parter meant to explore the origins of the iconic extraterrestrial lifeform known simply as the 'Alien'- but in doing so, Scott has also boldly attempted to uncover the very origins of human life. Where do we come from? Why are we here? Indeed, these are the big questions at the heart of the movie- though in the minds of 'Alien' fans, the more important question probably is this: How is the search for mankind's beginnings related to the beginnings of another creature so far ahead in the chain of evolution?

Not many summer blockbusters have the gumption to play with such abstract ideas and concepts, so kudos to Jon Spaihts and Damon Lindelof for their ambition. Don't expect however an easy answer at the end of the film- in fact, it's likely that you'll be left with even more questions than answers, a deliberate but undeniably effective ploy at whetting your appetite for the next one to come. Though not fully explored here, its thematic question of the nature of mankind's creator- given our twin propensities for creation and destruction- is fascinating while it lasts and should serve well as intellectual fodder for the sci- fi geeks.

Nonetheless, it's likely that they will be- like us- already geeking out at the similarities between this movie and 'Alien'. In place of Sigourney Weaver is 'The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo's' Noomi Rapace, the latter an archaeologist named Elizabeth Shaw whose discovery of similarities between ancient cave paintings from different parts of the world has led to the said life-finding expedition. Like Weaver, Rapace epitomises the strong-willed independent heroine- and nowhere is this more apparent than in a classic-in-the-making moment where Shaw climbs into an auto-surgery machine to remove a non-human foetus from inside her womb.

Similarly, Ian Holm's Ash has found its equivalent here in Michael Fassbender's android David, whose loyalties and humanness are just as necessarily suspect. Whereas Holm's identity was kept hidden till halfway through the film, Fassbender's is known right from the beginning- and that knowledge only makes you admire his class-act performance in human verisimilitude even more. Mirroring both his looks and diction after Peter O' Toole's in 'Lawrence of Arabia', Fassbender nails the portrayal of a half-human half-machine confused over its own identity, and is easily the standout among the ensemble cast.

Scott is fully aware that character is key for his audience to be invested in the adventure, so he avoids the obvious stereotypes in the rest of the supporting crew. Despite being Shaw's academic and romantic other half, Charlie Holloway (Logan Marshall-Green) turns out to be on the opposite side of the fence in the debate between God and Darwinism. More than just another seen-it-all captain, Idris Elba's world-weary Janek gets a nice heroic turn as things go from bad to bad-ass worse. And ice-queen Charlize Theron's corporate rep Meredith Vickers turns out to be more than just another easy villainous target in a late twist that reveals much more to her background for Weyland Corporation, the company which had bankrolled the current voyage.

Just as in 'Alien', the dynamics between the various characters keep the pace humming and the tension rising- in particular when David's agenda is finally revealed, together with the surprise appearance of Guy Pearce in almost unrecognisable makeup. Demonstrating his assuredness as a filmmaker, Scott juggles both the character dynamics and the story developments confidently. The first two-thirds of the movie basks in the same sense of eerie intrigue that made 'Alien' such a discomforting but utterly gripping watch, as Scott lets his audience acquaint themselves with the crew of the 'Prometheus' as well as the elaborately designed labyrinth of chambers and tunnels within which the imminent terror awaits.

The latter itself deserves special mention- Arthur Max's set design is stunning, expanding H.R. Giger's original designs of both the 'Alien' spacecraft to an entire subterranean world complete with a Mayan-temple like chamber that houses a humbling statue of a human head. Just as breathtaking are Dariusz Wolski's epic vistas of the rugged planet, even more spectacular in 3D- demonstrating once again how the third dimension can be exploited to its full potential at the hands of filmmakers at the top of their craft. On top of it all is Scott, the once-commercials director continuing to impress as a visual storyteller, synthesising the cinematography, set design and art direction into one seamless and visually astounding whole.

Yet despite its strengths, it's very likely that 'Prometheus' will still be greeted with some disappointment especially from fans looking for Scott's return to the sci-fi genre to herald a seminal epic in the vein of '2001'. To be sure, it doesn't reinvent the genre, even though its philosophical musings of creator and creation may suggest that it has something groundbreaking to offer. But it more than lives up to the legacy Scott had created with 'Alien', and this thoroughly gripping, edge-of-your-seat thrilling sci-fi horror breathes life once again into the 'Alien' mythology that no other entry since 'Aliens' has been able to.","8"
"jessyjeanhrdlicka","Still a great movie","9 November 2020","This movie is a classic both as an addition to the Alien Anthology, and on it's own. The first time I had ever seen this, I woke up in the middle of the night having passed out on the couch, and it was on tv, at the ""c-section"" part. I was wide awake from then on, totally into the movie that I didn't even know the name of, until the part at the end, I figured out it was the next piece of the Alien movies. I went out and got the movie the next day (this was before streaming had totally taken over). I love the overall tone and scenery of the film, it is one that I watch when I don't know what else to watch. I love the idiocy of the people, more in the long list of humans that think they can study the Xennomorph. HAH. Once ""Alien: Covenant"" was released, I think it did a great job complimenting this one, and makes a good addition to the whole Alien Legacy. Keep in mind that, of course, no movie is EVER going to equal Aliens (2), but this one isn't half bad at all. Prometheus is one of my all time favorites, and has some really super creepy scenes.","10"
"masterofpuppets79","In space no-one can hear you yaaawn","4 June 2012","Saw this at the Imax last night, I'm a huge fan of the alien films, I love how each film is unique in their visual tone and style, and was very much looking forward to Ridley Scott's Prometheus. The film may or may not be directly linked to the original Alien film, however upon viewing, you will realise that Prometheus is very much a prequel of sorts.

And an extremely bad and disappointing one at that.

The film lacked any suspense, drive, atmospehere, strong characterisation, or coherent plot. There was no atmospheric scene-setting, you just get launched head-first into a lot of inane dialogue, I actually just wanted the characters to shut up as there was no value being added to further the story. The characters themselves were a laughable joke. And many many many of the incidents that happen had me scratching my head - how can someone who removes an alien from their womb by cutting into their skin and muscle recover so quickly and is able to run around, and absolutely NO-ONE ask why she has staples on her stomach and is blood soaked? Why would a ship's captain who just want to fly the ship and go home suddenly go on a suicide run taking the crew with him, just based on quick information relayed to him by a complete stranger? Why does one need to blow into a flute in order to ignite the engines of a starship? If the mission was to contact a possible alien life form, why only send a handful of geologists, who by the way do not look at a single rock at any time in the movie? How does the android David know how to fly the alien spacecraft, speak the alien language, and know what the black goo will create? There are many many more questions that can be found in countless other reviews on IMDb! I was waiting and waiting for the main plot to kick in, but none came. The visuals and 3D were impressive, but that's not the main focus of what a movie should be! All other Alien films functioned perfectly in 2D with minimalistic special effects.

Verdict: Prometheus is yet another example of modern filmmaking - trade on an in-built audience to ensure big money, sacrifice story and characterisation for flashy visuals.","1"
"logosgnosis","Criminally Underrated","15 June 2022","No other movie that I know of has such a conflicted audience. You either love this movie or you hate it. Usually in matters of taste there can be no argument... But about Prometheus, the haters are simply wrong.

I kind of get it, I don't think I understood what I was looking at the first time I watched it either. That could be part of the problem: people aren't really prepared for it, and hence, they don't know how to view it.

Let go of your expectations, open yourself up, and what you'll get is: an all-star cast, interesting/complex characters, beautifully shot scenes, a stunning tone and visual effects, heady themes, great mystery, horror, suspense, and a dive into the fragility of humanity.

The critics want their hands held and to be beaten over the head with all the answers. ""Prometheus"" provides all the material, but invites the audience to answer the questions. Along the way, it's an extremely entertaining spectacle. It's a movie you can basically figure out, but it might take some time spent unraveling your thoughts, or with friends or family. The endless rewatchability offers more depth each time you return.

Critics quite honestly nearly expected the movie to answer the meaning of life and if there's a god or not. Spoiler: it can't do that.

But it does invite you to.

"nukfan","Sci Fi Horror at its best","10 June 2012","Perhaps the trailers are a little bit misleading. This film is not dedicated to terrifying you from beginning to end. it is not a haunted house. It is dedicated to making you think, and ask questions, with or without the benefit of seeing the Alien series.

But it will terrify you.

The film develops its characters well. The acting is convincing, especially from the likes of Noomi Rapace and Michael Fassbender. Ridley Scott has once again devised a great female lead (the notable other being, of course, Ellen Ripley, played by Sigourney Weaver) who you will respect, admire, and root for, whether or not you agree with her religious beliefs (I did not). Fassbender plays a great android. Doesn't sound like praise? Trust me, it is. Everyone else is more than satisfactory, as they all react realistically (I can assume) to what they deal with.

I won't give anything specific away, but there are multiple genuinely horrific sequences in the film, and the ending... well, some of you might like it, some of you won't. That's for sure. I loved it. That is also for sure.

Was thinking about downloading a Torrent to see what is was like before I spent some 10 USD on seeing the film. Should have looked at the torrent first and saved the 10 USD.

The scenarios were bad, the acting worse. The technology they had was more advanced than the the original and as previously stated by some, there was no due diligence on behalf of what the actors were saying or doing. I have no idea where the writers came from for realism, a women who falls apart due to her lovers infection, has a serious op and then manages to walk, run, fight, climb within say 1 hour of the op. I know women are super heroes, most men will admit that. but WTH? Even THOR needed a rest after having his butt kicked by Ironman. Another one; what about the 3rd law of Robotics?

Maybe the intention was to open up a line of alternatives to the Alien series based on the lady in question? It has succeeded in this but left many questions unanswered and raised a few more that now can not be answered like; How did the alien get to another planet without any transport?

Can I have my 10 USD back or a ticket to see the Avengers for the 3rd time? Definitively not what was expected.","1"

All ended up being slaughtered by an equally motley bunch of extra-terrestrials with the exception of an alpha female lead. Well, silly yes, but at least it was silly fun.

Fast forward a couple of years, some people apparently felt that the Alien franchise was still worth milking and decided to finance a prequel (not but quite), brought back Ridley Scott (at least in name) and also threw in a few bits of pseudo religious mumbo jumbo for good measure (this being backed by American money?) As much as this will surely turn you off, the movie then felt that it should rip off the best bits of the other movies in the series. And ridiculous as AVP was, it too was not spared.

Here the (spoiler) dead/dying/and not quite dead rich industrialist hires motley crew of professionals and mercenaries to explore ancient relics. All ended up being slaughtered by an equally motley bunch of extra-terrestrials with the exception of an alpha female lead. At the same time, remove all sense of fun and suspense, but load up the movie with ridiculous dialogue and gaping plot holes, and the creme de la creme, a demonstration on how to get oneself killed under a falling spacecraft.

"mronrox45","A good start to a new set of ""Alien"" movies","6 January 2013","I was really impressed with the direction and subtle approach to the origins of the ""Alien"" franchise. David is the best ""android"" yet. The ""invitation"" seemed a bit of a stretch seeing how there are no cave paintings at all of early man worshiping stars and large beings. Would have liked for Scott to have used something more historically real. No big deal, I just like being titillated by a little history that somehow connects our future. I like Scotts approach to fate. Its so much more mature for a director who respects the fact the more than 80% of the planet believes in some form of Diety. Its nice to see someone in Hollywood respecting people of this planet as opposed to mocking them. It obvious from the people who ""hate"" this film, there is a large portion who dislike it based on the ""faith"" premise. I understand not believing in a God, I was one myself for 30 years. But the new batch of anti-Christians (they are really anti-Creationist, but as most only seem to criticize Christianity, that what I call them) just flat out cant handle any kind of mention of faith at all. Its sad really, don't we all deserve respect for what we believe? This movie does a good job expressing that respect.","10"
"Bob_the_Hobo","Nothing Short of Breathtaking","24 November 2012","Following the discovery of a series of cave paintings all depicting the same other-worldly beings cradling a series of galaxies, a multi-billion dollar mission is funded by the enigmatic entrepreneur Peter Weyland (Guy Pearce) for a group of scientists headed by Elizabeth Shaw (Noomi Rapace) to visit a moon on a planet trillions of miles away investigating the ultimate question: can we meet the Gods that created us?

Ridley Scott's finest science (fiction?) epic ever poses a million questions and does something rare in having the audience try to find the answers themselves. Damon Lindelof returns to the same thrills that drew similar viewers to ""Lost"" by penning a script with Jon Spaihts that stuns and thrills while never trying to oversimplify its message.

Charlize Theron and Noomi Rapace head the cast as strong, independent, willful women who travel light-years away to prove their power. Both turn in strong, Oscar-worthy performances aside a supporting cast including actors such as Idris Elba as the tough captain of the ""Prometheus"" vessel and Logan-Marshall Green as a scientist desperate to find the meaning of his life.

Michael Fassbender here plays an android, David, created by Weyland to keep maintenance of the people involved and the mission itself. As the humans around him try to find out who created them, he lives his life knowing why he was created, and it torments him. Fassbender's performance alone wins the film ten stars. An Oscar is not enough for his work here.

The worlds we may never know in our lifetime are brought stunningly to the screen using breathtaking cinematic effects that are not used strictly as a budget expense, but as a character in themselves. The score written is profound and beautiful, using the entire orchestra to emphasize the profundity of what these characters discover. The combination is pure movie-going magic.

There will naturally be a sequel and it will naturally not be as good as its predecessor. Perhaps that will be because it answers the incredible questions asked by the first film. But is that not the question ""Prometheus"" asks us to ask ourselves in the first place?","10"
"alsumrall2001","Poor casting/character development ruins Prometheus","22 June 2012","With the exception of Fassbender and Theron, the casting was very poor. These actors had zero charisma. It was a mistake to not cast more well known actors that don't need a lot of character development. Fassbender's character development was the only attempt (Theron didn't need it) and it worked. Guy Pearce would have been great if cast in a real role. The young actor made up as an old guy NEVER works. Pearce, so strong in the trailer was totally wasted in this film. Maybe a prequel might be in store for him, that would be an excuse. The plot also got a bit too coy, it was thought provoking but went overboard trying not to be transparent and not explain ANYTHING (characters while being developed in a film often discover things with the audience...not in this film). Rapace was just awful, no way to compare her to the strength that Weaver had in her many Alien appearances. Overall a disappointment when there was such a good potential story with which to work. Not a film I would want to see a second time.","5"
"xamtaro","Either you're smart enough to get it, or go back to watching Michael Bay.","8 June 2012","According to Greek myth, Prometheus the titan molded man from clay and stole fire from the God's; a fire which can nurture life as much as destroy it when misused. For his actions, Prometheus is punished to suffer eternally. After the discovery of ancient star maps across several ancient civilisation ruins, archaeologists Elizabeth Shaw and Charlie Halloway postulate that extraterrestrial beings were somehow the progenitors of the human race; the star maps reveal other planets that the so called alien ""Engineers"" may have visited . They are tasked by the Weyland Corporation, under supervision from the cold calculating Merdith Vickers, to lead a team to a distant world in order to discover the mystery of humanity's origin. Yet some among them would follow in the mythical Prometheus' footsteps and dare to plunder the secrets of these alien ""gods"" for their own gain.

Big ideas and double metaphors abound in Ridley Scott's spiritual successor and very loose prequel to his 1979 ""Alien"" masterpiece. Though set in the same universe, Prometheus has less in common with Alien's chilling, shock horror genre and more in common with the contemplative 2001: A Space Odyssey; yet it's marketing campaign leads us to believe otherwise. Thankfully, a lack of scares does not mean a lack of suspense. Questions are slowly unraveled through the course of the film while maintaining palpable tension and a sense of ""something is not quite right"".

The well paced mystery plot is complemented by some fine performance, most notably Michael Fassbender as the android David and Charlize Theron as Vickers. One a creation embracing his creator's traits, the other a woman burying her humanity. Similarly, most of the characters exist as mirror opposites of each other that break the typical stereotypes for such familiar characters in a science fiction movie; the faithful Shaw and the skeptical Holloway, the overly cautious hot headed Fifield and the overly curious Milburn. Even Captain Janek, whom the scientists originally think of as merely a dumb space jockey (pun pun), breaks the stereotypical ""tough black guy"" mold. If it were not for their terrific chemistry and realistic portrayal of their characters, the dialogue heavy nature of the film would have weighed it down.

Where Alien's look was dark, claustrophobic and eerie, Prometheus is generally bright, wide and grand though still equally unsettling. Weta, the company behind the special effects of James Cameron's AVATAR have once again brought their best efforts to the table giving Prometheus much visual splendor. From the intricately designed vehicles to the surreal alien constructions, every effects shot is a work of art in itself. The film score by Marc Streitenfeld and Harry Gregson Williams keeps this feel of grandeur; the kind of wondrous uplifting theme that invokes images of explorers braving uncharted frontiers in search of the unknown. It is a positive theme, which makes its coupling with the unsettling tone of the film so much more disturbing.

But what is there to set this apart from your typical space exploration, extraterrestrial encounter movie? It is how this movie challenges the audience to think. Within Prometheus' many philosophical touches runs a cautionary tale of mankind's increasing hubris. When analysing the DNA of a dead alien Engineer, Dr Shaw exclaims, ""It's us"". Thus, the metaphor is complete: the Engineers represent humanity's dark future. Like their extraterrestrial creators, humans have created life in their own image, personified in the uncannily human ""David"" android. They seek to transcend mortality, they seek to create, to conquer; their greatest pride is the creation of their greatest weapons. Should their creations not satisfy, they have no qualms about eradicating their ""mistake"". In the process of self advancement, they lose their fundamental humanity, becoming cold, distant, inhuman. Alien. But in seeking to become like Gods themselves, their greatest pride will one day become their undoing.

Aside from a predictable final 5 minutes, Prometheus is almost perfect in every way. Overall, the film might not be the Alien prequel some were expecting. But it manages to be Science Fiction at it's finest with something for everyone to enjoy. Hardcore science dudes would have a thrill picking apart the metaphors and throwing out wild predictions on the various mysteries presented.For fans of the Alien franchise, be on the look out for the numerous references to previous titles and a delicious little teaser. For the casual crowd, there is enough eye candy here with great performances set against a gripping suspense tale. Only adrenaline pumped action junkies may be a little disappointed by the lack of said action. Like Alien before it, Prometheus seems set up to open a whole new universe of sequel possibilities.","9"
"verminhater","I expected much, much more","14 April 2014","Given the qualifications of the director and the size of the budget I expected a fantastic piece of scifi, right up there with Alien. What I got was a farce.

Lets get the praise out of the way. It's visually brilliant. As good as it gets even and the reason for 4/10 rather than lower.

Now to the crux of it's failure - the script. There is one failure after another in it. The script has been written by the most ""Hollywoodised"" (sic) team I've ever come across and that's NOT a compliment. There is one cliché after another and one moment of total and utter disbelief after another: entering a planetary atmosphere just a couple of miles from where they want to be by pure chance, man with satnav gets lost, removal of helmets in unknown atmosphere, treating unknown alien as automatically friendly, major operation and immediately mobile etc etc etc. The list is frighteningly long so I'll not list all the moments of failure. These ""Hollywood moments"" as I'll call them utterly ruin the film with there voracious tenacity to continually test your intelligence. Scifi requires a certain suspension of reality in many cases to produce a film at all. That suspension of reality works only if it's plausible. This film though, takes reality and sticks it's middle finger up at it. When you throw away any semblance of reality what you have is suitable for animation only. Unfortunately real live actors were subjected to this script. They did a decent job in as far as the script allowed but it couldn't have been harder for them if there'd been a custard pie throwing contest in the middle of the film too. This was more Keystone Kops than Alien.

Prometheus could and should have been a magnificent film. The hard bits were done superbly. How they could have got such a basic as the script so badly wrong is beyond comprehension. How a talented team failed to see such a poor script was in use is also beyond me.

I note that Prometheus 2 is listed on IMDb as a 2016 release. I earnestly hope that a different team is chosen to write it. Films that insult your intelligence will always fall flat.","4"

Don't be mistaken though, Prometheus works very well on its own.

To people that are not familiar with the ""Alien"" universe, Prometheus offers an experience rich in entertainment, visual prowess, imagination, and a fascinating script that both succeeds in being a beautiful ode to life/genetics as well as being an effective, imaginative science-fiction/horror story of its own.

Direction is wonderful and true to the genre, visual effects are amazing, characters are engaging, and the score is both beautiful and haunting. From the opening sequence, you'll know you're in for a cinematic treat.

The script changes levels at about mid-point of the film : Prometheus starts off with a pace very faithful to the first entry of the ""Alien"" franchise (lethargically nightmarish), while the second half unfolds in a more conventional way, with a blend of stressful situations and edge-of-your-seat action.

A genuine sci-fi film, and a very welcome expansion to what has now become a legendary universe to sci-fi fans from all around the globe. As an ""Alien"" fan, I could not be more thankful. And, more simply, as a sci-fi fan, I'm stoked. Thank you, Ridley Scott.","8"

This movie is flat-out awful. From the very start to the bitter end, its disjointed, poorly scripted, without direction and an utter waste of money -- to the viewers at least. I'm sure the industry profited from its production as I'm sure Ridley Scott made his pile of loot. But the producer seriously ought to stand up in front of the audience and say ""I'm Ridley and I now make lousy movies"".

The characters are superficial, unbelievable and given some of the worst dialog ever. I truly believe the master copy of the script fell off a table, the pages got mixed up and in their rush to start the money train rolling the producers just said 'the heck with it, just say whatever lines you feel like..

"sljohnson12","Terrible","22 December 2012","Production Values do not make a film, as this facet is a given in high budget movies. Adequate Actors do not make a film excellent if the script is poor - in this case mediocre - and there is a complete lack of characterization. A Screenplay with an interesting premise does not make a good film if the development is good but becomes extremely drawn out, then suddenly a rushed ending is thrown at the audience. The cliffhanger is great, though.

Allusions to stand alone classics and mythology do not make a film if they do little to nothing in contribution to the film in its entirety. People have lauded this film as if it is some avant-garde, incredible work of art for in the least its name being a reference to the Greek myth where Man is made, given the ability to make fire, as well as metaphysical overtones inherent of such, and the obvious reference to the story of the birth of Christ. All of this does little to actually help the film. If anything, these allusions are made to make the film seem deeper than it is.

Again, the premise is the best part, and while I was enjoying it so much as I am a huge fan of science fiction, there came a time in the film when I was struggling to come up with warrants to justify why the film was good, let alone why I should not walk out. I am capable to logic and reasoning- people complain at how analytical I am at times - yet, hopefully not to sound cyclical, it was when the film started to drag on that I, in retrospect, should have walked out.

I have never walked out on a film before (except for the second installment of Lord of the Rings, due to the fact I couldn't stand the directing). At least I got to watch that movie for free. I regret having spent $9 to see this movie. It had some good scenes though and I know not to watch this as if it is an Alien film, but treat it more like a separate sci fi film (given the ending, it is impossible to - I will say no more). To describe this film, only one word is required.

This review most likely adheres to the criticism most 1-, 2-, and even 3-star reviews have already observed: ""The movie is just about flawless technically, cinematographically, and conceptually, but juvenile and superficial (for the most part) in character creation and motivation."" Arthur J. Bullock's Question and Answer format Amazon.com review has already ingeniously encapsulated my and many others' views of logic lapses in ""Prometheus"". So, what's left to say? Well, I guess I'll just basically summarize the aforementioned logic lapses with the opinion that the Prometheus crew's lack of professional discipline grievously hinders the movie.

Contrary to what others believed, I felt that the numerous cave carvings outlining the Engineers' frequent visits to Earth ostensibly to initiate life were sufficient incentive to organize an outer space expedition to contact these progenitors (even if they DID look like albino bodybuilders). What irked me was the unlikelihood that a private corporation would be permitted, or even have the resources, to attempt this interstellar flight. I would have thought that searching for humanity's origins should be a paramount international matter. And yet somehow the wizened, apparently deceased Peter Weyland (Guy Pearce, looking like Goldmember from the third Austin Powers movie) has scraped together a trillion dollars for the half-baked purpose of going to the Engineers' solar system to somehow find an elixir of youth and immortality. Even more baffling, instead of amassing the crème de la crème of biologists, geologists, archaeologists, and other -ologists, Weyland decided to select the motliest of crews for this little space trip. With the exception of the competent, devout but intellectually curious, and surprisingly scrappy Elizabeth Shaw (Noomi Rapace) and the near-infallible but disregarded and even faintly malevolent and enigmatic android David (Michael Fassbender), the crew is an unorganized joke.

In actual charge of the gargantuan ""Prometheus"" vessel is the sinister, irritable icicle Meredith Vickers, with a gradually revealed connection to Weyland. The rugged, capable Captain Janek (Idris Elba) is reduced to being a passive spaceship chauffeur. Dr. Shaw's colleague and love interest Dr. Charlie Holloway (Logan Marshall-Green) is cocky, brash, unkempt, and unwisely disdainful of David. Rounding out this ragtag gallery is the really unprincipled doofus duo Fifield (Sean Harris) the geologist and Millburn (Rafe Spall) the biologist, who turn out to be the equivalent of the ""red shirt"" officers in Star Trek. What a bunch of winners! No Prometheus crew member - not even Dr. Shaw or David - follows any kind of protocol or discipline, military or otherwise. They seemingly act as if they're on some pleasure cruise, with time to play pool, swig vodka, make bets, and make love. Captain Janek occasionally and vainly issues orders. Usually he's idly staring at the schematic of the Engineer cavern stronghold on moon LV-223 or playing his squeezebox. Everyone else does whatever the hell they want without supervision, including Dr. Shaw's do-it-yourself Caesarean to extract a squid fetus. Therefore, it's relatively easy for David to explore the cavern, decipher the hieroglyphics, get samples of the Engineers' DNA ooze, and ""vengefully"" start the mutation havoc onboard the ship. Again, I recommend you read Mr. Bullock's review to get an outline of the genetic blunders the crew foolishly unleashes upon themselves that utterly unravels the mission for almost everyone.

Watching this movie, I couldn't help thinking that, for all the time-worn techno-prattle and tired, corny humanistic themes, the Star Trek crew (whether Captain Kirk's or Picard's) would have handled the momentous events on LV-223 more professionally and competently. Certainly some crew members would have been infected and even killed, but the main characters would have thoroughly analyzed the terrain, the Engineer corpses, the caverns, and the pods before going into action. The crew would also have heeded any information from Spock or Data and acted appropriately. Furthermore, the Star Trek crew would have had time to address evolutionary, theological, and even ethical implications of the missions meaningfully. Star Trek naval discipline would have made more epochal discoveries about the Engineers without blowing up their ship. But then again, this discipline would have bored some Ridley Scott or ""Alien"" fans who wanted their icky snake/squid/slimy tentacle thingie fix.

What a waste of a evolutionary/theological vision! Dr. Shaw is practically the only Prometheus member still curious about the Engineers. Others, like the doomed Dr. Holloway, thought that the revelation of the human/Engineer 100% genetic matchup solved the problem - Humanity comes from Engineers. Dr. Shaw perceptively retorts ""Who made the Engineers?"" The mystery continues, and only she and David's head are still around to pursue it (in the Prometheus sequel). Perhaps the sequel will also answer the questions 1) Are the Engineers attempting to correct their run-amok planetary DNA sowing, including that of Earth's?, 2)What did David say to infuriate the resuscitated, murderous Engineer?, 3) Where is the ""Neck-Pillow Shaped"" Engineer spaceship escaping to?, 4) Can Dr. Shaw and David follow them in another ""Neck-Pillow Shaped"" spaceship?, 5) Can Dr. Shaw really trust David? 6) How will the surprisingly humanoid xenomorph emerging at the end of the film figure in all this? Whatever the ""Prometheus"" sequel holds in store, I hope Dr. Shaw and David encounter a space crew that has more in common with the discipline, philosophy, and mentality of ""Star Trek"" than that of ""Friday the 13th"".","6"
"Schuriken","New Kind Of Prequels","22 September 2012","So we take a series of movies that are really famous and do 3,4 prequels instead of giving the fans what they want. You have to guess what the hell happens in the entire movie or watch it 300 times over to spot the meanings of every scene. Since we are all not under Ridleys payroll, another 3,4 Prometheus movies will rise just to comprehend what on earth happens to the entire crappy prequel series.

I can't believe the entire Alien Saga & Xenomorphs story is based on an old man's wish to live forever collided with sexual encounters of the 3rd kind. It sounds like a Giger concept only it's not and that's what spoils the whole thing. I do not care if Giger was brought in, the Alien Squids look ridiculous.

Last but not worst, it's stupid to do a film about another film but not exactly. The Charlize Theron addition saves the day which is rather too far from what I call a director's vision of a movie.

Mr. Riddley should do a Predator prequel without the Predators...see how that turns out for the fans....","1"
"Dragon_Eye_Morrison","Not gonna say ancient aliens but......ANCIENT ALIENS!","21 June 2012","A group of ""scientists"" who watched too many History Channel specials take a blind trip to a planet to discover what could possibly be an ancient alien race that created mankind. Problem is, these ""scientists"" behave straight out of a Scooby Doo episode, they do stupid thing after stupid thing. Then these ""superior"" beings appear and they behave even dumber, for such a ""superior"" form of life they behave no different than a pack of wild animals.

All the characters have paper thin motivations (as in none) there are situations that pop out of nowhere because the script said so and at the end we have another average so-called scifi horror flick. Forget about the director, or the connection to his previous superior sci-fi suspense film. This movie has no idea what to do with it's premise aside from being another loud bang CGI extravaganza that nobody is going to remember. An OK movie to kill some hours? Some could say that, there is some nice attention to detail and cool sets, but what's the point if the script is such a terrible mess? Real tension should come from well written characters and situations, not because we need a ""climatic"" scene where nasty looking creatures attack the hero. The movie is trying to be two things at the same time: a ""serious"" sci-fi story, and a suspense-horror thriller, yet it fails miserable on both areas, specially the first one. That this movie is taking itself so seriously is what makes it even more annoying.

In short, this is a mindless shock movie pretending to be ""high"" art. They even rip-off Carpenter's The Thing at one point. What else could i possibly tell you about this mess? It's a glorified b-movie, that will be quickly forgotten in a couple of months.","4"
"PlutoZoo","Inspired story development can't satisfy dulled minds.","17 January 2023","After the first three Alien movies, the franchise went downhill fast. Even the third and fourth films were essentially a repeat of the first one, the third set in a prison and the fourth back on a spaceship with a cloned Ripley resurrected. Then there came the Alien versus Predator car crashes and all hope was lost ... until Prometheus.

What unfolds in Prometheus is an intelligent merging of horror with wondrous adventure and the balance was struck well. The story played out with conviction and grabbed my interest so much that it felt exciting that they would Try to source the origin of those horrific Aliens and take it full circle back to the origin of humans on Earth. Exciting and very interesting with an ending that promised a huge jump forward in storytelling for what had become a tired broken record of a franchise.

Unfortunately, those who love being spoon fed the same dribble over and over again failed to see this film for what it was and that negativity influenced the sellhout that was the sequel to Prometheus, Alien Covenant. It was a massive step backwards from an adventurous smart story originating in Prometheus and a shame really because I can't help but feel that we've lost a story that would have stood the test of time due to studios caving into the lowest common denominator of fan.

Severely underrated, Prometheus is the only original story in the franchise besides the first film and it is endlessly rewatchable unlike the mediocre jump scare tropes of the other films in this series.

As the old saying goes, there's no accounting for taste. If you watch the first film and then Prometheus in sequence, it makes for a marvellous story.","10"
"eoinmcandrew","What the hell was that?","12 May 2013","Eh........... I saw this film the day it was released eager with anticipation. I then watched it last night again (a year later), I still don't really know what to make of this film. First off, visually its stunning! People who say Avatar was don't know what they're talking about! Blue people ain't visually stunning! Story wise it certainly raises a question or a dozen, I mean what was the story with that black goo? And why were they're loads of squids? and how could that machine perfectly remove the alien from her???? Overall it is rather compelling tho, and has that horror factor that's associated with the original(not to the same extent obviously). Worth watching,Michael Fassbender is the definite man of the match with this film. Nobody else really stands out, the girl Noomi Rapace isn't bad, tho she is no Sigourney Weaver. If your a fan of the franchise watch it (I mean after Alien vs Predator Requiem this is like the greatest film ever!) 6 out of ten I think, an interesting and compelling film that is lacking in the most basic sense!","6"
"forehater","Ridley, you mad, bro?","14 June 2012","The only phrase that describes Ridley's Scott's ""Prometheus"" I could think of is written above in the title of my comment. Don't know where to begin since it's really hard to express all things that I didn't like about this movie. I must admit there were things very clever and thought provoking but not complete or totally ruined by the end of the movie. To be honest, my expectations were really high since I watched all the trailers and presentations such as Guy Pearce as the young Weyland speaking about ""Prometheus"" and Fassbender in a commercial about David. Those things were really cool and boosted my opinion about this film. So sad I got punched in the face with something far from that.

It's not enough to be famous and hire some famous people to do a shitty job. They can't do it when the script is so fatally flawed. There are many things I would like to mention.

I really enjoyed and embraced the idea of the self sacrifice in the beginning where the nameless alien humanoid sacrificed his in order to create life on earth. I think that's what really connects the film's title with the ancient myth of Prometheus. The alien gave life to our planet though as it might be understood later in the film, his comrades weren't too happy about that and decided to exterminate those earth's abominations (in their perspective I guess) with some black mass that kills people in numerous ways and also creates... life? That just didn't make sense.

I also expected the alien race to be peaceful and that whole evil alien contamination thing to be an honest mistake, a fate that humans later followed too in the ""Alien"". The flute thing on the ship control panel convinced me that such an advanced and art loving race would never try to harm humans and would also be excited to meet their creations. I was wrong. Huge disappointment indeed.

Characters were bleak. I didn't care for any of them. Most of the so called scientists made some really poor and stupid decisions playing with contaminated stuff from the site and creatures they found in the caves. Even the main cast (Rapace, Theron, Fassbender) were so unfinished and unconvincing to me. It looked like the script was written in a hurry without even being read twice leaving all the support cast far behind the unattractive main characters. Well, maybe Fassbender was OK. His humanly robot role was a little bit illogical. A cyborg with something close to feeling and random rational thinking? Really? Evil robot.

Rapace's self inflicted stomach surgery provoked laughs in the movie theater. Stapling meat in a modern age era? Reminded me of some 80's slasher horror movie where the evil character just staples his hand to the torso and continues the killing spree. In Rapace's case she went jumping and running across ""Prometheus"" good as new. Ridiculous. Laughable. Ridley's Scott's name under the title. Even more ridiculous. Wake me up from the nightmare please.

The end was also a disappointment and a lack of respect to the events in the beginning of the ""Alien"" if it really tried to be a prequel. I guess everyone remembers the first moments when Ripley's crew entered the derelict ship. The space jokey was in his seat with a chest burster hole in it's chest. In the end of ""Prometheus"" the evil humanoid left his ship and the control panel, died inside the human ship and gave birth to a totally different looking alien which in my opinion looked terrible. WHAT THE HELL?

And there are many things that I simply forgot to mention. Much more bashing is left to be remember in further discussions with my friends how badly ""Prometheus"" really sucked.

4/10 Only for the visuals which were spectacular and the great idea which was raped in all possible ways by terrible scriptwriters.","4"
"sunnykanagi-82-388587","Atrocious!!","16 June 2012","Why did i see the reviews on IMDb and then go to the movies?

This movie is made only for those who appreciate quantity over quality. Don't get me wrong, the graphics were excellent. But oh dear god, the story was so bad, so clichéd, I felt like killing myself and so did my 3 friends i was watching the movie with.

Acting-wise they ranged from bearable to awful. I was rooting for the aliens to kill them off than hear another dialogue from them. They are supposed to be intelligent scientists, but they acted like dumb bimbos from some B-grade slasher flick. I was immensely disappointed with Charlize Theron, she is a wonderful actress, she let her talent waste with this flick.

"Msbnitski","Alien sorta revisited","27 October 2021","From the beginning I saw Alien footage everywhere. The entire movie was a knockoff of Ridleys previous movie Alien. As I watched, I was able to tell the story before it happened. Word for word, sequence after sequence.

100 years after Alien and the same crew was doing the same thing. Creeping around a structure that resembles the same mother structure on a different planet where the original crew from Alien was creeping around. Nothing was different. Pods that produced creatures, robots that wanted to sabotage the mission. Even the end, the creature was the exact same Alien 👽

What did anyone find interesting or unique in this film? Even when the ship landed on the planet, it was the exact same affect.

Sorry, this is a complete knock off of a very good film Alien that took place in our real time 20 years ago.","1"
"bennyhagen","A catastrophe","20 September 2012","The internet has done a fine job dissecting all the nonsense in this movie, so I'm not going to go into much detail. If you want a list of what's wrong with Prometheus I'd recommend the ""Red Letter Media asks questions from Prometheus"" video or the ""Prometheus Honest Trailer"" from Screen Junkies.

So humanity faces its most important mission, yet the HR department of Weyland industries, the single most powerful company of the planet, assembles earths dumbest, most incompetent specialists to go on it. These people bitch, moan, misbehave and generally mess everything up, nearly bringing about the eradication of mankind. Writers Jon Spaihts and Damon Lindelof unintentionally create a huge parody of todays intellectual decline. If this is our future, I have no questions why the 'Architects' want to eradicate us. Ridley Scott has shown us an authentic spaceship crew in 1979, yet he is willing to roll with retarded teenagers 33 years later. The other huge downer is the onslaught of plot holes. Don't you get fooled. Prometheus is a mystery exactly in the same way Michael Bay movies are. It just doesn't give a crap about logic. The anti-intellectual pseudo-philosophy dealing with faith randomly scattered throughout the movie doesn't help either. Honestly, I have no problems calling this one of the worst scripts that have made it into mainstream cinema - ever. How Ridley Scott of all people agreed to this is simply beyond me.

Nevertheless - as usual - he does a perfect job with the execution and the CGI is truly the best the present-day industry has to offer, so oddly all this is fantastic to look at. Nevertheless, as a movie Prometheus is simply insufferable.

"Unbilled_Role","Apologies to the Aliens, and Pity the Poor Actors","11 June 2012","A significant number of fellow reviewers have been disgruntled, and I must agree: all the CGI in the world does-not-a-good-film-make. Trust me, I do not enjoy giving out such a low rating.

In contrast, Roger Ebert described this film as ""magnificent"". Perhaps he benefited from an alien-induced iv drip that many of us common folk are not privy to.

This film was short on character development, and the story lapsed into silly, unsubstantial blather. I found myself chuckling at some of the more absurd moments, where comedy was clearly not intended.

I should have followed my instincts early into the film, and walked out, which I very rarely do. What was my first moment of realized-dread? When I was convinced that I had no investment in most of the characters, and no curiosity about their histories. This movie had several gruesome moments, but that in itself does not elevate the film's quality.

I knew something was off when I felt more sincere enthusiasm towards David, the soulless robot, as compared to the humans. I feel that this was a compromised choice for Theron. She appeared cool-as-a-rotten-cucumber, which is fine, but the seeds were sadly missing. What a waste of her fine skills! An actor can only do so much with shoddy writing.

I gave this 2 stars, because aside from Fassbender's lovely work, the production design was quite impressive.

Last but not least, when I peered into the darkened theater, I noticed what appeared to be several alien beings, a few seats over. They had no need for the 3D glasses. Biding their time, the aliens gleefully tossed Milk Duds towards the screen. Whenever they fluttered their silvery eyelashes, a discordant hum reverberated, and the fibers of the velvet seat cushions trembled. Approximately 10 minutes into the film, the human couple who sat next to the aliens simply vaporized, yet their scorched kernels of popcorn frenetically rotated overhead. Like I said, this film had some early warning signs.","2"

the alien series has never been blessed with a strong storyline but this would be comical if it wasn't so lame.

the special effects are OK but nothing has really moved on from the first two in the series.

the amount of dialogue between characters is stilted and the closest to a character is asking if someone wants sex.

"darkraven_109","Delivers as Promised and More","10 June 2012","I don't remember being this excited over a movie in a long time and by god, Ridley Scott's return to sci-fi PROMETHEUS is as close as we could get to a modern day masterpiece.

PROMETHEUS does as promised in the ad campaign and fan expectations; it serves as a semi-prequel to ALIEN but it's also a standalone story by itself. It delivers the space-bound horror in true old-school fashion similar to the original ALIEN; you don't really know what's killing the cast but it's still the stuff of nightmares. But what really impressed me was that the movie does a lot more than that.

The film throws in some existentialist themes that fit in the storyline and don't seem forced. Other films try to do this and instead of sounding deep, they look stupid. PROMETHEUS on the other hand does it seamlessly; nothing is shoved down your throat and no one idea is shown to be better than the other. Mysteries are dropped left and right; not everything may be answered by the end but as one character said in the film, the answers may be irrelevant. What I really liked about this film was it got me thinking a lot even by the time the credits rolled. Sure, connections to the ALIEN universe MAY help answer a few questions and speculations but there is no definite answer. It's really up to the viewer to figure out some parts for themselves. In a time when every answer and plot detail is served on a silver platter and very few movie makers want to make the audience think, PROMETHEUS stands out and confuses you and leaves you asking a lot of questions... and you'll love every second of it.

Visually the movie was engaging; what you'll see on screen is one of the most beautiful yet haunting settings ever imagined. It's also interesting to note that a good number of the places on screen were actually sets, not purely CGI. I've always had a thing for practical effects over CGI ones and the ones used in PROMETHEUS do not fail to awe. The world's desolation and hidden horrors come to life in one hell of a planet.

The cast did their parts really well (props to Rapace, Theron and Pearce) and as mentioned by a lot of people before me, the character David (Fassbender) stands out in particular. What's interesting for me is the fact that there is no one definite protagonist. The whole film could be Dr. Shaw's story of discovery as much as a story focused on David. The only comment I could give about the cast was that I wish Theron and the rest got a bit more screen time since their characters were all engaging.

Another very minor problem for me was the soundtrack placing. Yes, I agree, the score was beautiful but it popped up in some of the most inappropriate moments but this does little to hinder what I feel is the best sci-fi film I've seen since DISTRICT 9.

PROMETHEUS is a god-send; it's one of the few movies in recent memory that got me so pumped up I actually wanted to save money just to watch this on the big screen instead of waiting for the DVD release. Close to 30 years may have passed since Ridley Scott made a sci-fi film and yet he still shows us he's got the skills. It's horrifying, intriguing and makes you think a lot.

If you watched ALIEN from the start or you just love sci-fi, you should see this; it's really worth the wait. If you're new to it, you're still in for one hell of a sci-fi film. Sure, there are a lot of people claiming that this was a ""disappointment,"" ""a complete failure,"" ""amateurish,"" etc. but rest assured these are false. These kinds of reactions always pop up when some popular movie comes out... just look at the reactions that THE DARK KNIGHT, THE AVENGERS and INCEPTION got among others; expect these kinds of reactions every time a good movie comes out (case in point: THE DARK KNIGHT RISES). There will always be someone out there saying that ""X movie is such a rip-off of Y"" or something along the lines of ""OMG this is the worst movie EVAR"" and the like.

PROMETHEUS delivers one the best sci-fi stories ever put on the big screen; so far it's one of the best movies of the year and you won't regret watching it. It's worth the money, the long wait and the experience.","9"

Breathtaking....... all that I could have wanted and more!

Truly a brilliant masterpiece, as much as you'd expect from the original ""Alien"" director himself... Though, who better to seam his film together!! It's even on par or better than Avatar in 3D beauty.

Michael Fassbender is outstanding, and the original Dragon with the Tattoo actress Noomi Rapace a very respectable protagonist. Charlize Theron is stunning and Guy Pearce, well.. his acting was great, can't say he is looking much like himself in this one..

The pace is just right, and there are scenes that will shock you and actually it's the first film that has given me a fair bit of a fright since, perhaps the originals themselves when I was but a child.

It's total picturesque and gorgeous scenery, no doubt contributed to high production value and eye for detail incorporated with seamless CGI and 3D integration (which is quite rare these days). From it's opening to the final shots of the film.. Truly eye opening.

I loved it so much, I have issue with one part of it (where I shall minus the .5 from my total score) but that is to do with either how they will proceed, as it relates to the latter films.. if it is indeed meant to proceed along into their path at all..

I will be seeing this film again and again.. For the true Alien fan out there it will be greatly appreciated, and a definite viewing!!

"spiritof67","What's With Ridley Scott?","29 May 2013","I understand that Mr. Scott didn't much like not being invited back to do the sequels to ""Alien"", even though ""Aliens"" was almost as good as his effort. I understand that he maintained that ""Prometheus"" was not going to be a sequel, even though it has 80% of the elements of the first film.

I guess Ol' Ridley decided to let this terrible movie, with its inappropriately inadequate cast, be his ""gotcha!"" to the studios.

It's not just a bad, inconsequential movie; and it isn't that it returns to the ""stupid scientists"" ideas of his former work(""Hey, why not treat alien life forms like pets or cute fuzzy animals, ignoring any protocols we might have about that!""); it isn't even that it doesn't add anything really relevant to the Alien concordance.

It's a half effort by a talented director, and it isn't a very good half. If I had known what a letdown it was going to be (and I had my misgivings) I would've saved my money.

"james-2690","Stunning","2 June 2012","Firstly if you don't know anything about Prometheus and the sci fi mythology that surrounds it all the better. Don't go into this film with any preconceived notions. I think the team that brought you this never had a plan to bring you what you expect and it's all the better for it. If you are hoping for the same old with a quick set up with xenomorph on human action and people running around corridors for the rest of the film while they are picked off one by one you may be surprised. If you expect it to spell everything out like there is some master plan, well as I said leave your expectations at the door. This a beautifully rendered film with a much slower pace than others of the same genre. Prometheus is its own film and I think it's all the better for it. The nods to others are nice and for me it was enough, I think in retrospect I'd have been disappointed and bored if they had gone the familiar route. For those that know Prometheus' pedigree notice how I've tried to avoid mentioning it! For those that are coming into the film with no idea what it is about keep it that way.","10"
"zanghi_james","2094 AD: The Dark Odyssey","6 December 2019","Ridley Scott's a great director. I grew acquainted with his filmography after Gladiator, and he is a great film-maker. I enjoyed his films like Gladiator, The Martian, American Gangster, and Kingdom of Heaven, even his Hannibal Lecter sequel and his fantasy film, Legend. Only recently, maybe in the last few years, have I discovered that he created Alien and Blade Runner. And as the last few years have proven, he has made them even better.

I enjoyed Prometheus. It's a good film, and yes it has some flaws here and there. There's some great scenes and the plot is impressive. The only scene I can't stand is the infamous C-Section scene, which freaks me the heck out. Also, Much like Batman v Superman, Prometheus raises more questions than answers.

"c-arm-794-697897","monkeys typing Hamlet","11 July 2012","Like any space mission sponsored by a human corporation, this one has four leaders with no established boundaries between them: the corporate castrator representing the company financing the mission (who uses her personality for birth control); the two archaeologists who discover the message from an ancient alien civilization on earth (and thus instantly become fully qualified to lead an interstellar science mission to the sender of the message); and, oh yeah, the ship's captain (recently promoted from night-club musician).

Minor characters are too numerous and too stereotyped. When they wake up from hibernation, the different departments have not met each other, and immediately start telling each other to toss off. One scientist flies off the handle at another as if he has just discovered that his cracker jack box has no toy. There is even the expendable unattractive woman, who has no lines I can recall (make note, little girls in the audience: attractive women are worth saving; unattractive ones are expendable). One, two, and five at a time, these cardboard cutouts fall like plinking targets, until only the people whose lives are meant to matter are left.

Even the cameo appearance by Dave Bowman - an ironic homage to a far- better film in which hapless scientists and their AI projects go on a star-crossed deep-space mission to find humanity's progenitor - cannot save this film.

With the exception of some very good CGI, and Noomi Rapace's earthy effability (what this film is apparently about - since it has no other discernible purpose), this film is a small-wad masturbatory ejaculation.

If anybody from NASA will see it, I am sure they will commit suicide. Ship captain looks like rapper, no more comments on that one. Leave it, I do not want to spoil the story ... ah wait ...... THERE IS NO STORY !!! A 10 year old has written it. CG guys have done some good job, but sorry guys, it ain't saving this movie.

Movie has made some money though, proving that no-body is interested in your entertainment anymore. Just give a spectacular trailer or teaser one, reap the money in opening weekends or two before the word goes out. I do not even want to waste time writing about this.......just give me back my money .....

"Ken-Tajalli","Ridley Scott hammers the final nail on the Alien Saga's coffin!","8 June 2012","Don't know where to start! I am speechless - it promises to be ""2001 space odyssey"" and ""Avatar"" put together, but manages to be ""Flash Gordon marries the amazon woman"". If I was Sir Ridley, I would distance myself, as much as possible, from this expensive waste of time. Wait for the free download, don't waste your money or your time. Lost is space (the series) has more depth than this. An expert reviewer has said "" It is like opening a gift box wrapped by tiffany's, only to find a mug from the dollar shop inside"" , that about sums it up. The movie has as much scientific depth as George W, and answers as many questions as any Clinton! The story, what story? Characters? like the three stooges, beginning and ending? it's all over the place. Shame on you Mr. Scott.","1"

Lead hero dies in the middle of the movie without know how or why..!! why is the alien guy trying to kill humans..?? (No clue) why does the lead actress go in search of the creator of the aliens..that too alone and with the support of a robot head in her hand bag..!! ROFL..!!

1. I did not expect any ""Alien"" movie or ""Alien-like action"". 2. I did not expect any action at all 3. I did not expect any serious questions or answers.

I just wanted some decent movie, 2 hours of cool time in cinema, with some fine plot and decent cast. I received 2 hours of yawning, boredom and incredible stupidity. I do NOT demand logic in every aspect of the movie. I just want it to be reasonable, cmon - and.... Billions of kilometers from Earth, biggest project in human history and 2 guys, finding remains of some ancient civilisation, decide to go back to the ship, because they are a lil bit scared. More - how come did they just land on the surface of a new planet, without sending the drone/probe, more! - they put their feet on the ground as if they visited their grandmas garden, no worries, we just jump out of the ship, without even thinking what is it, how can it be, is it safe, should we check it etc etc. And it goes the same with every other thing - they ALL walk into huge cave of unknown origin (any beasts, fire, gas or whatever there? hehe, no, we just go there). They touch things, they take of their helmets. One dude tries to touch new organism, a specie that is obviously not so nice - cmon, imagine this - you find unknown snake-like creature, hissing at you, yet you try to touch it, 3 times. AFTER you chickened few hrs before because you preferred to be in safe place (ship). And one thing that really pisses me off - why they set 30-something year old guy to play an old man? Was he cheaper? Could not they give Wayland's role to true old actor, to make it real? Why all this fuss, with makeup etc? I don't get it. He certainly was not cheap, makeup either.

OK, something good about the movie. It ended, yay! OK, more - first 15 minutes was interesting. The expectations. Then it goes worse and worse.

I do not believe this is the same Ridley Scott who made Blade Runner or Alien. It just simply can't be the same person! What was he thinking after last film editing?? ""Ooo, this is good""??? NO,he MUST have thought ""We produced pile of warm sh..., but hey guys, let's try it in the cinemas out there, maybe people will not notice?""

We noticed, sorry Ridley.","3"
"qnihilism","Simply...a disaster","21 June 2012","As a first comment I will not compare this film to Aliens or any other work of Scott. This movie, being a prequel or not, should be judged on its own basis.

Now, it is true that the movie has a very good cinematography, very nice effects, adequate 3-d and, in general, it constitutes a very nice visual experience. Of course, there is still the awful appearance of Guy Pearce. His make-up, whatsoever, is SO CHEAP that makes you wonder whether they actually overcome the budget and had to impose austerity measures. Why not recruit an old actor? It would have probably saved some of the dignity of the movie.

BUT (and that is a HUGE but)...anything good about the movie begins and ends within the visual level. The plot is so sloppy, full of holes and irregular and illogical sequences of events. Further, the script is full of childish dialogues that many times do not make any sense. But, in any case, the characters are badly designed, unbelievable, not developed and full of illogical motivations (if any) and attitudes. Such characters, probably, could only comply with the current script.

As the for the level of Science-Fiction there is simply no Science nor fiction in this movie, not even for the Hollywood standards.It seems that the writer has absolutely no knowledge of basic first grade science for, otherwise, there is no explanation for what we were forced to see. The so-called ""top-scientists"" who crewed one the most important missions of humanity behave like anything but scientists. Actually, they resemble a crew of mindless mercenaries, exiled or just prisoners with zero scientific background. In good faith, even stupid and soon-to-die students in Friday the 13th or in C-rating horror films behave more rationally before dying.

Now, I will not go into specific details for the film's irregularities. There are many reviews herein that give thorough descriptions and they are absolutely correct.

In all, movies are not only visual objects. You need a script and a plot to make something watchful. Also, science fiction is not about visual effects; on the contrary, it is about a good story that incorporates scientific elements beautifully and cleverly mixed wit fiction. Simple etymology.","3"
"Yiannis_Galidakis","Disappointing^w","4 May 2013","Contains Big Spoiler......WARNING!

The reason for the big disappointment this movie has caused is actually simple. The movie Alien was horrific mainly because everything related to the Derelict, remained virtually unknown, even after the after- effects from th infection, etc. Prometheus has the right title, but it is far from a horror film. The Derelict was ONE ENTITY, for starters. That, was the crux of the horror. It wasn't a superhuman or genetically advanced humanoid who sat on a large chair-spaceship. This is a subtle point: The (possible) consciousness the Derelict might have carried, would be the result of a major integration of thousands of body parts, including the entire horse-shoe shaped object. THAT consciousness was what was ""hosted"" in that skull, had the Derelict been ever alive and THANK GOD, it was dead. The horror comes PRECISELY from the hidden/implied fact that the Creator of such an huge, immensely complex and fortuitously malignant organism, would be..., sort of unimaginable by any human standards. The main point the movie Alien tried to make was very subtle: That there possibly exists a ""dimension"", where such ""Creators"" might exist. That the ""creators"" were these confused, silly and bastardized humanoid engineers the movie Prometheus would have us believe, is close to a joke.","1"
"joe d","Should Have Read The Reviews Instead Of the Total Rating","22 November 2012","When I saw a rating of over 7 I went out and ordered the DVD. I wish I read the individual reviews instead because those who hated the film were so right on target.

Now I will admit that I knew it was a film by the creator of Aliens but did not know it was a prequel till the end when I recognized the monster. Also understood what was first to be a quest to find out how man was actually created which would eventually go haywire, but I expected a lot of plot twists and turns. It started out quite interesting but then slowly slipped into a combination of confusion and boredom by being nothing more than another repackaged survival movie.

But there were also so many unanswered questions which I thought would fall into place as the movie went on - but didn't.

1) Why did the alien at the beginning commit suicide? It was only at the very end that I gathered being the last survivor, he (or she? LOL) did not want to become a carrier and return to his (or her) home planet.

2) What was David really trying to do? It seemed he was there to try and find what he thought could extend the life of the dying old man who referred to him as son. But why not let the daughter see what he was doing? Did the father not trust her? Then why put a drop of alien fluid into one's drink? What was he hoping to discover - the fountain of youth? Did he expect the guy was going to make love, get the girl pregnant and give birth to a new specie? How would that save the life of a dying old man? Or did he simply want to see what happened for the sake of science?

3) Of course, there was no answer as to why those who created us now wanted to destroy us - if they were even our creators after all. However, I think that might come in the sequel but by now, as Rett Butler said to Scarlet O'Hare, I frankly don't give a damn.

Had I known how bad a movie this was, I would have waited to have seen in on cable rather than spent my money on a wasted DVD.","3"
"slayerjmk95","Prometheus: A New, Certain Epic from Ridley Scott","8 June 2012","Prometheus was a phenomenal and intense sci-fi masterpiece from the mastermind behind the 1979 classic, Alien, Ridley Scott, who has returned to sci-fi after 30 years, and his return is a big one. Prometheus is about a team of scientists and researchers who team with Elizabeth Shaw and Charlie Hollaway (played by Logan Marshall-Green and Noomi Rapace) on a search for the biggest answer to one of the most controversial questions; who created us? When they arrive at the planet of the creatures' supposed home-world, everything goes wrong and the search for our beginning may lead to our end.

Prometheus is loaded with great performances and actors/actresses, with two performances standing out, one of them being obvious; Michael Fassbender as David. Michael truly captivated and stole the screen as the new android who watches over the crew of the Prometheus, and as the movie progresses, you see a very mysterious and straight-forward change in his programming, which has you on edge, it being villainous in nature. The other character many people don't recognize much was Idris Elba as Janek, the captain of the Prometheus. For me, he stole the screen towards the end of the movie, and had various scenes before in where he was my favorite, one including him trying to get Vickers (played by Charlize Theron) in bed with him. The rest of the performances were fantastic, but i must move on. The visual effects: top-notch. There was no mistake whatsoever in the visuals; they were built around a ""shock-and-awe"" factor, as well as a certain beauty in creation, only explained if you see the film, as spoiling it would ruin most of the film. The directing was fantastic, with Ridley being at his A-game, capturing the moments some directors couldn't (one that was truly disturbing and grotesque involving Noomi). The music by Marc Streitenfeld was just spectacular, as it fit with every scene and the overall tone of the film, moving from an interesting, thought-provoking masterpiece to a bloody, terror-inducing epic.

Prometheus was, all-in-all, an instant classic worthy of the Alien saga. But that's the first mistake made; you can't truly compare this to the Alien movies, since its story is its own, but takes place in the same story universe, involving the Xenos. I just hope Ridley stays with this new set-piece in the saga and makes a trilogy out of Prometheus, because in a way, it can work.

"dhardee","Two hours of my life I can never get back","8 June 2012","I love science fiction and am willing to suspend my disbelief on a lot of things but this movie was so flawed and flat out ridiculous that it was impossible to shrug off any of the implausibility. I'll give you FTL travel, suspended animation, AI robots, and many other things. But it's an assault on my intelligence to ask me to accept a girl manually programming a laser and robot arm to perform a cesarean on her in order to pull out an alien fetus and then she battles with that fetus on the table while the computer staples her abdominal muscles back together. Then she gets up and goes running around, jumping and climbing with only a slight look of discomfort every now and then. And why do major corporations in the future spend trillions of dollars on technology but hire morons and the dregs of society to run that expensive equipment for them? And forget that we're made of the same stuff as the rest of life on Earth or that we share 98% of the same DNA as chimps -- we're instead supposed to believe that human DNA was dropped here by aliens with the only explanation from the main character being ""because I choose to believe so.""

"ivo-ivan","skippable","11 February 2014","You could safely pass on that film. Ridley Scott probably made it for the money only.

The story is not good enough. I mean really. The link between its pieces is often too loose or even irrational. At some points character actions feel like comedy, which stands in full dissonance with the tone of the film, which is fully serious.

At some points there are some OK questions being posed, let's not be too negative :).

The visual effects and the scenes are good though, you can notice some reasonable attention to detail. By that I would judge it is an expensive picture.

I cannot really comment on the acting part. But I wasn't in any way impressed by it.

"qubit01","One facepalm after another...","13 April 2013","== Spoilers throughout == Like many others, I registered for an IMDb account for the sole purpose of reviewing this travesty. As the film is obviously tied to the Alien universe, it is difficult to watch the movie without comparing it to the classics that are Alien(1979) and Aliens(1986), but I did honestly try to watch it without comparing it to anything, and review it on its own merits. With that in mind, what can be said that hasn't already been said, often quite hilariously? This movie is an insult to the intelligence of every sci-fi fan that has ever lived. A visually stunning insult, to be sure, but an insult nonetheless. The gaping plot holes, unanswered questions that seem to be asked just to be asked, the absolute moronic idiocy of the ""best scientists in the world"" who are on the ""most important mission in the history of mankind,"" the seeming lack of the writer's understanding of high school biology and physics, the pointlessness of just about everything that is said or done in this steaming pile of film. I will begin with one of the most important things in any movie- the characters.

Did you know there were seventeen, SEVENTEEN crew members aboard the Prometheus? Neither did I. Seriously, I honestly thought there were around six characters in this film, because that's all I remember. And the only reason I remember them is because of all the absolutely STUPID things they did. The only thing that I can think that makes any sense as to why the characters would speak and act the way they did, is that they were in reality all suicidal/homicidal sociopaths who were sent on the mission for the sole purpose of making it fail and killing themselves and everyone else in the process. Seriously, the attitudes and actions of almost every single character just seem sinister and evil.

Why is David (the most 'human' character in the movie, it seems) evil? Why is he programmed to sabotage the crew, a la Ash in Alien? Or is he? Is he self-aware and just nobody realizes it? Who knows, the movie never attempts to answer this question.

Why does Janek, when he sees that there are signs of life in the structure that two of his crew are trapped in, seem not only like he could care less about the safety of the crewmen, but act as though he actually wants them to die? Because his entire demeanor and attitude when informing them that he has just seen movement in the structure is such that I can only think that is the case. ""Oh well, it stopped moving, must be a glitch, you guys get some sleep, see ya tomorrow!"" before turning of the feed from the trapped crew. Excuse me? Why? Don't know, the movie never answers this question.

Why is Theron in this movie other than as eye candy? I guess according to her character it's because she didn't want to ""sit in a board room arguing over who is in charge"" while Weyland was off having fun in space. I think it was for the sole purpose of the writer having her crushed by a giant rolling doughnut. Speaking of rolling doughnuts, Lindelhof can take a flying f**k at one if he thinks I will ever pay to see a movie with his name in the credits again. Seriously, I wanted to burn my own eyes out so I would never again have to witness something that moronic in a film.

Why would any scientist in the world not be like, ""Hey doc, there's this weird worm crawling on my eyeball, could you take a look at that, please?"" Who knows.

Why does a super advanced, space-faring, genetic engineering race of beings start their ships with a flute solo? Why would ""the best scientists in the world"" completely ignore every single rule of the scientific method? Why.....

You get the point by now.

Two stars for great FX and a third for being set in the Alien universe. That is all. Instead of Prometheus, the title of this plopper should have been WTF?

"info-11400","Wish it had a story","21 August 2012","Good things first: Great visuals (really), good acting (Fassbender), no teeny-movie, dark and serious atmosphere, entertaining.

Unfortunately the story sucks. I ignore all the very obvious logic problems, it is a SciFi after all.

Yet all persons in the movie are very flat characters, except for the android David. It/He is in fact the only ""person"" with any dimension. So whenever somebody in the film was in danger, I hardly cared.

The film has a lot philosophical subplots, it seems at first: Relation between Creator and created; Parents and children; God and science; Believe and free will; Death and what is beyond; Emotions and androids; Being human; Life in the universe. A long list, and that is the problem. All these things are mentioned but never treated. It seems to me, they just put all this ""stuff"" in the script, to make the movie appear (!) to be full of deep thoughts. ""God and science"" mentioned, OK, make a mark on the list, go to next theme.

And there is this connection to Alien. Well, it adds some thread to the story. But to my mind it is just a marketing instrument. Prometheus the prequel to Alien sells better than Prometheus.","5"
"maartendierckx","7.1 for Prometheus atm","21 March 2014","I am a fan of the alien franchise. At the top we have Alien, a great movie and Aliens, the sequel.

Then Alien 3 happened. The franchise was getting strained. Cheaply getting rid of the other two survivors of Alien was the first of many mistakes. Perhaps holding onto Sigourney Weaver for the third instalment was a mistake. Still: not a bad movie.

Alien resurrection, Alien VS predator, Alien Vs predator 2, I might miss out on some titles here. Entertaining to a point, granted, but undeniably terrible films each and every one of them.

Then there 's Prometheus. I actually joined IMDb just to write this down. Prometheus couldn't have been worse, if it turns out the Aliens were being mothered by an Army of Angry Clowns. The cast dribbles flatly on an unbelievable series of weak premises, the dialogues are terrible, the story-line truly preposterous. Even seen as a film not associated with the franchise, this film would be a truly horrible dragon. An ugly and expensive dragon, that with a smaller budget would be some forgettable direct- to-VCR rubbish. (In fact, with a small budget, it could have turned out to be an enjoyable B movie.)

And yet it's rated 7.1? Perhaps some farty clan of nerds are desperate enough to hold onto the franchise even as it's undead corpse is being torn apart by maggots and film industry lawyers, perhaps there's a very large group of trendy art film lovers who think the mind numbing pain they get from watching this thing adorable. But I doubt it.

7.1 is such an obvious fraud the only thing that comes to mind is 'how much'. How much did it cost to have some people pretend to love this debacle? There's a struggling writer out there who's being paid to write lies about films he or she probably hates more than any of us. Maybe the writer explodes into a big black cloud of tentacles and creates a entirely new universe with his or her migraine induced suicide and maybe this could be the beginning of another epic fail!

"ilikeimdb","Truly an unmitigated disappointment","9 June 2012","I had high hopes for Prometheus given the direction and production team's pedigrees. Alien in particular has stood the test of time by creating a completely realized and contextualized vision. That is, even when you set a film in a fictionalized environment, the film becomes real when the actors/set/action make sense within that environment...and it's in that requirement where Prometheus fails badly.

The plot doesn't make internal sense unless, as Ripley put it in Aliens, ""IQs just dropped sharply"" between now and 2089. It's not merely huge plot holes but annoying inconsistencies making you question how the characters could act/think that way...and many of these holes/questions arise through various forced homages to the original Alien movie.

Sure, the film has stunning visuals and lots of excellent special effects (I saw the film in 3D IMAX) but they're wasted on a fractured plot. Not a single person clapped at the movie's end in a sold-out 7:30pm seating. Sadly, Prometheus' fire has been extinguished.","2"
"Matador07","Disappointed","17 June 2012","While not a disaster, it was hard to view this ambitious attempt to expand the Alien universe as anything but a disappointment.

And maybe it was the ambition itself that this movie tripped over. Trying to juggle too many themes, too many characters (doing amaterishly stupid things in order to move the plot along), even too many monsters without clear and focused connections, it just ended up feeling muddled and disjointed. Characters that you would have liked to get to know, only get a handful of lines. Situations that should have been built up and slowly dragged out to pump up the tension, are instead rushed over. Then other scenes are flashed to that look silly and cheap. Along the way most of the menace and wonder that should have been dripping from a movie like this was just lost, and that was just brutally disappointing. Every 15 minutes or so there would be a shot, an idea, an action that by itself was cool, but more often than not it was brushed over and forgotten about, or simply misplayed if not. Even the creatures created from the ubiquitous black goo felt like they were lacking in menace and imagination. Its very disappointing that we have seen similar creature work before in far less ambitious movies over the years.

As for the big mysteries that people complain this movie raised but did not answer, that did not bother me nearly so much as the mysteries which WERE revealed. The entire Alien universe, which started out so dark and frightening, felt like it was lessened by this movie. The awe of the engineers has been stripped. The curtain was pulled back from what lurks out there in the dark of space, and what lurks behind it just isn't terribly scary after all. They say what scares you in a good horror film is the stuff you DON'T see. Well I think the same thing applied to this movie -- it was the unknown terrors of a hostile universe that tickled the imagination in Alien. Frightening questions that would make you never want to leave home or set foot on an alien planet again. Here our very stupid scientists pop their helmets off to smell the air like they're on vacation, and get to reveal far far too many of the Engineers' secrets, and with the mystery goes the fear.","6"
"Aldri7","a forgettable mess","12 June 2012","I hate to sound cynical, but I couldn't help thinking (as I left the theater early) that someone has gone to an awful lot of trouble to create a movie and a whole theory of evolution just so as to lay a little schlock horror - sci-fi on everyone. Prometheus is basically just that. The whole Alien series is, in fact, arguably just that. And so try as one might to find a little meaning here, to find comfort and some peace of mind about our place in the universe, I just can't. I can't get past the main 'raison d'être"" or reason for the existence of this series. Its to creep you out, basically. Always has been. So prequel or no prequel, (and expect sequels to this prequel I guess) - what should one expect now and in the future? BTW, what do you get when you make a sequel of a prequel - you get the ORIGINAL MOVIE BACK! Heh heh, well maybe eventually, but of course no one would stand for that. In any case, unless someone wipes out the entire Xenomorph population, horror - sci-fi is what you are going to get, plain and simple. Slimy aliens invading human bodies, plain and simple.

Which is not to say you can't TRY and elevate the bottom line here. Lord knows, they've gone to a lot of effort to do that over the years. It does help some, but in Prometheus, the story is so weak and poorly thought out, its hard to care. I've enjoyed reading about Space Jockeys and Xenomorphs and really its an elaborately thought out world. But none of this gets translated from print to movie here as the visuals take over, adding a superficial gloss to everything while smothering any depth and insight. Yeah, the visuals at times were nice, but cynical me also looked at them like they were mainly a set up, i.e. setting me up to think I was going to see a movie more akin to 2001: a Space Odyssey than a horror - sci-fi one. This kind of ticked me off, actually. I mean, I'd enjoy spending an evening contemplating our origins as 9ft tall, hairless creatures that look sort of noble and serene. Except that I can't connect spiritually to them at all not knowing anything about them other than the fact that they are careless with their bioweapons. What does this all say about our lives here on earth? Our future, our destiny? Nothing that I can tell..but do try and avoid grabbing cobra like reptiles when you see them in the future.

So, but I tried to like Prometheus at the onset. I was in the mood. But there was not a kernel of quality, original filmmaking for me to grab onto. Man travels to a distant planet to investigate his species origins here on planet earth. OK, what else? They send a team of young and seemingly talentless individuals as well as some corporate types. What else? They start getting attacked by the same slimy creatures that killed off their species ancestors. Will we ever learn?? Anyway, I did notice that the blonds here were sort of the bad guys, almost like Nazi stereotypes. Why, I don't know, but Ridley Scott does like to equate teutonic looking gods and goddesses with androids. He did it in Blade Runner. But bad guys too? - I mean, what was their motive here? That was never really explained too well. Anyway, and the rest of the characters were even more forgettable. They did inexplicable, unscientific things. They behaved like amateurs. No one really seemed to have a well defined role nor credentials to back it up. Most of the time, they seemed to react to their surroundings more or less like children - prodding and poking things to see how they work, etc. And you know what, I almost found myself saying ""they deserve to get attacked by alien reptile creatures!"". As descendants of noble looking but careless 9ft humanoids, perhaps that is their fate. And is that perhaps OUR OWN fate as well someday? While others may have somehow found a deeper philosophical message in all of this, that is mostly what I left the theater concluding - that we humans are nothing more than careless, warm, oxygen breathing cavities for opportunistic slimy creatures. We are, after all, the stuff of those poor, unfortunate Space Jockeys. And that is the comforting message that I will sleep on tonight. Its not about Religion nor our exalted place in the universe. Its about victims and predators. And that man had to travel millions of miles just to find that out is really depressing. Why couldn't everyone have just stayed home and read a good novel about man's achievements here on earth instead? Thats kind of what I wished I had done tonight anyway....","3"
"hurricane_san","Rated for brain dead audience","31 May 2012","Prometheus is the kind of movie where a few shallow characters change from persona to fit what one could pompously call the ""plot"". The typical bad case of going from aggressive hard ass to puny little girl (with pig tails) (or the other way around).

It's the kind of movie where they try to scare you with a noise and something jumping somewhere ... but you expected it for a while (if you didn't fall asleep already, that is)

It's the kind of movie where nothing surprise you except the sheer stupidity of the characters. You can almost see what goes into the writer's head : ""okay, I want 'this' to happen, so this pawn and that pawn have to do that"". And who cares about coherence ?

It's the kind of movie where something physically impossible (random non-movie related example: a crippled boy that would make a 10 meter jump because else ... well ... the few previous scenes are making even less sense than they already are)

It's the kind of movie I would I had never lost about two (very long) hours to.

Actually : it's the kind of movie that didn't deserved to be filmed.

Why 3 points then ? The renderings and effects are pretty nice.

"tes-ter_sd","Awful Pretty -- Pretty Awful","13 February 2014","Hoo boy, what a mess.

The problem is at least partially due to the editing. Important facts and motivations were left on the cutting room floor. Apparently telling a coherent story wasn't as important as getting every penny spent on CGI up on the screen. It's like a prideful CGI artist did the editing.

Another major problem is the script. The characters are 2D, with no character development, no story arcs, no consistency or character integrity. Characters do things for no reason other than to move the plot forward. The script raises 100 questions while answering only 1 or 2 -- apparently a favorite technique of Lindelof (of ""Lost"" infamy).

The film is supposedly in the ""science-fiction"" genre, but many scenes can't work without assuming that something ""magical"" happens. Deus ex machina contrivances are everywhere. Very basic laws of physics and biology are violated time and again. Did 3rd-graders write this? Being generous, one might consider it to be ""fantasy"", but even that conceit is still a stretch as the movie violates the rules of its own universe.

Action scenes are sometimes so ludicrous that they produce laughter. Some action scenes could have (and should have) been left on the cutting room floor. Some were apparently included for no discernible reason other than some novel CGI was employed. You literally do not care about who lives or dies. There are some jumpy moments, but they are momentary, like somebody jumping in front of you and yelling ""boo"".

The movie is set in the ""Alien"" universe, but the monsters are all new: zombies, snakes, squids, shark-topus, etc. Supposedly these are new variants of the classic alien, but they generally aren't very scary or realistic. As a result, the tightly-conceived life-cycle of the xenomorph (displayed in ""Alien"") is now an unrecognizable mess. I think the Alien franchise was harmed by this ""creative"" decision.

The musical score is largely forgettable.

Then there's the direction. Scott presumably had creative control. Was he handed a weak script but didn't realize that? Did he spend all his time on CGI and give the direction of actors over to new assistant directors? Did he approve the bad edits? Did he lose control to the corporate suits? It's hard to avoid the conclusion that Scott is limited by his staff and is clueless about that fact. So maybe Scott's great films were just a matter of luck, i.e., he had better teams back then but never realized their critical importance.

Prometheus is just so much eye candy wrapped around a cluttered and highly derivative plot. Effectively it's visual porn with no redeeming value (unless you consider ""philosophizing"" copied from motivational posters -- ""Because We Can"", ""I Choose To Believe"", etc. -- to be redemptive.) If your brain shuts down while watching movies, this flick will work for you. Otherwise you'll need a lobotomy or a heavy dose of something to enjoy it.

Rating: 1/10

P.s., I've read reviews here that are largely a list of complaints or acknowledgment that other viewers have legitimate complaints, but still give the film a 7 or 8 or 9 rating. What's up with that? And then there are the reviews that read like they were written by a novice advertising copywriter. ("". . . a sweeping epic of ground-breaking proportions""). H-m-m-m . . . curious.","1"
"ApeLieUproar","Problemetheus","27 May 2016","I think if Prometheus were a real-life figure, he'd be embarrassed to have his name associated with this movie. Honestly, how can this have scored 7.0?

Practically everything about it is wrong. Nothing seems to happen for any good reason, not even story reasons. Other reviews have already mentioned the most prominent problems with the movie, but maybe I can touch on some that haven't been discussed as much.

Let's start with the (more or less) trifling stuff such as: Shaw, the protagonist of the story is British, as we see from flashbacks (scene as dreams) to her childhood. Yet, her adult accent is as poor an approximation of a British accent as I've ever heard. It doesn't seem as if she's even trying. What's the point? Why establish that she's British if you don't follow through? In her flashback dreams, her father is played by Patrick Wilson, who does a decent British accent (as far as I can tell). But, again, I have to wonder what's the point? Would it make any difference if a real British actor played such a minor role? Along the same vein, Guy Pearce, who is unrecognizable albeit under a very bad makeup job plays an old guy. Why? You might think it means he's going to regain his youth later on in the movie. But no, he just dies later on. It almost feels like the film is trying to trick the audience here.

Poor characterizations: when you're not even 20 minutes into the movie and you already want everybody to die, it's not a good sign. I had to wonder why some of those people are even there. For instance, they take the time to establish Fifield (a geologist, who does very little geology) as this incredibly surly fellow, who's only there to ""make money"" no to make friends, as he tells Millburn, a biologist (like Fifield, his skills don't come much into the story). The pair become buddy-buddy anyway, when both become lost in an alien spaceship (despite the fact that it was mapped out by Fifield's nifty flying mapping devices). What's the point of the earlier scene? Is it supposed to warm our hearts that they become chummy later and feel saddened by their eventual deaths. Sorry, no sale. Nobody cares that they die.

Flagrant plot devices: In one scene, there is an exchange between Vickers and Janek, and the latter assumes the other is flirting and wants to ""get laid."" She tells him she's not interested, to which he asks her if she's a robot. Her response is to invite him to her cabin for sex. To prove she's not a robot, I guess! Utterly laughable. This is just to set up the scene where Fifield and Millburn both die, of course; where no one is there to hear their agonizing screams as they are killed by aliens. The scene happens completely off-camera; we don't even see Janek entering Vickers' cabin. A sex scene between Idris Elba and Charlize Theron is not something I'm eager to see here, but the lack of such a scene underlines the sheer egregiousness of the reason for their having sex.

The squid-alien that Shaw ""aborts"". I put that word in quotation marks because although she has it removed from her body, it doesn't die. In fact, it later grows to an an enormous size, despite being locked up in a lab with absolutely nothing to eat.

Effects: they're very good but they don't help the movie. They only serve to emphasize how incredibly stupid it is.","3"
"nazztrader","The most ""alien"" creatures are the humans!","9 June 2012","I wrote up a long review but it's too long for IMDb guidelines, though after reading some of the other reviews I see that just about everything I wrote is covered, so I'll instead try to write up a summation of the major problems with this film.

1. The humans act in ways that are just not believable, unless the mission was organized intentionally to include stupid, uncaring, nasty people (depending upon which one) that any unbiased member of the audience will not be able to empathize with. Perhaps the worst example of this, though I'm not even sure, is at the end when an archaeologist tells the captain to crash his ship into an alien ship, which will mean he would die. I would have told the archaeologist, who previously had answered a scientific question with the response, ""because I want to believe"" (or something like that), while clutching the Christian crucifix pendant she was wearing, that I thought she might be delusional. Sorry Mrs. Fox Mulder, your beliefs do not warrant doing something like that (and how does Christianity view suicide?)!

2. The ""science"" is either ridiculous or it's not clear what the audience is being asked to believe. Other than things already pointed out (that I've read) how is the Shaw character supposed to not die from internal bleeding after a major operation was performed on her abdomen/uterus and she is kicked hard right where the incision was made, flung through the air, lasting hard on the ground, and must've dealt with a massive shock wave from a huge spaceship crashing right next to her?

3. Generally, everything was poorly done except for the special effects. The worst is a muddled plot with apparent allusions to Christianity that is so internally inconsistent as to make one wonder if each paragraph was written by a different writer who didn't have any idea what the person before him or her wrote. Moreover, this film can't even manage to be concise. For example, did the Vickers character add anything, or was she just a minor distraction?

4. Presumably, the audience is supposed to ponder ""big questions"" while watching this film, or soon thereafter, but the film presents an absurd context for these questions. I read a reviewer over at Rotten Tomatoes say that ""Prometheus"" makes you consider the possibility that a violent, destructive force created humankind. Perhaps this reviewer should read the Old Testament, in particular the commands to kill everyone in certain towns, leaving no stone unturned. At least that has context. Can someone please teach our youth basic history (not that I'm claiming that the Bible must be taken literally, but rather than such acts were viewed as acceptable by at least many people of the time if told that a supreme being demands it)?

Actually, this film could have been salvaged somewhat if there had been some basic editing done and if the Holloway character would not have been killed off, at least until the very end, so that he could have answered Shaw's ""deep"" question by pointing out to her that her Christianity is too focused on the ""nice"" aspects of the New Testament, and that she should have taken the Pentateuch more seriously. I would expect a student in his or her first year of film school to do a better job, again, except for the special effects. I was amazed at how awful it was; it gave me the impression that this was a ""mail it in"" type effort, for whatever reason.","2"
"RobNYNY1957","What a jangled mess of several bad movies","1 October 2013","What a mess of a movie. It's basically ten botched episodes of ""Twilight Zone"" badly edited together. There's the movie about the cave paintings, the movie about the snakes in their helmets, the movie about the vases, the movie about the storm, the movie about the exploding head, the movie about the old man with wrinkles, the movie about the octopus in her tummy, the movie about the big aggressive guy, the movie about getting back to Earth. I kept seeing characters getting killed that I did not previously remember seeing in the movie. Well, I just watched him die, but who is he? Did he have any lines? Basically, this is a movie about any random poop that fit into the CGI budget.

On the other hand, the music by Chopin was nice.","1"
"SaidNDone","Tries to be deep yet ends up inane","20 March 2022","Prometheus asks a deep question -- ""where did we come from?"" yet refuses to answer it even metaphorically (why ask then?). The big boi alien doesn't give us any info & in-fact ends up being functionally the same as the reptile alien in the original movie -- the second it awakens it just starts killing everyone then it dies because a door/airlock was opened. This leaves us with a contrived mess that goes absolutely nowhere. Maybe some will excuse this because it is a ""pre-quel"" and has ""sequels"" coming but that is not an excuse. A movie, especially one starting a new storyline has to have some sort of payoff independent of potential sequels (as they may find out if Alien Convent's awful box office take results in the death of this series before a single question is answered).

There are so many issues and contrivances with this movie beyond the lack of a payoff in its core plot (although that is the biggest one):

1. What was the point of making this a pre-quel to the Alien franchise? Outside of the last 5 seconds of the movie it had nothing to do with Alien and making it a pre-quel both locked them in narratively (they can't report back the answers or run away because we know humans have no reported outside contact in Alien) as well as telegraphed the movie's ending to the audience before they even turn it on (we also know everyone has to die or get lost in space because of the starting point in Alien). If they were going to do this they could have at least explained how the aliens ended up with broods all over the Aliens planet

2. The robot spends the entire movie sacrificing everyone + potentially jeopardizing the entire ship (thereby the old man's wishes) and it is never explained why.... also if this was a borderline suicide mission why would the old guy sacrifice his own daughter as well? And why did Shaw trust the robot at the end after he had betrayed her multiple times (including metaphorically r*ping her and leaving her to be exploded by the alien baby womb)? She also undoes the 'heroic' sacrifice kamikaze she requested to stop the other ship from leaving with weaponry by deciding to let the ROBOT THAT BETRAYED THEM literally fly another ship full of LIVING WEAPONS wherever it wanted to

3. Why would such an advanced civilization use biological weapons to wipe out humanity (especially since the entire point was that humans are bad and these weapons are even worse)? It makes no sense. Even humans figured out by 1950 that chemical and biological weapons are dumb because they almost always friendly fire (as we saw happen to the big boi aliens in the movie in-fact). The only two regimes dumb enough to use large scale chemical weapons in the last nearly 75 years are the Saddam and Assad regimes. And if even someone as stupid as Saddam figured out it is a bad idea by the early 90's, there's no way a more intelligent and advanced civilization would opt for such a dumb and uncontrollable choice of weaponry over various explosives, nuclear weapons, or precision munitions.

4. The characters randomly became braindead anytime the writers didn't know how to progress things organically-- who would take off their helmet on an unknown moon? Then take it off again on their next trip out after they escaped death by 5 seconds in the storm (likely wouldn't have gotten trapped in it if they didn't have to put their helmets back on when coming back to the ship?) Then take it off 3rd, 4th, and 5th times after seeing biological weapons killing their crewmates through infection and blunt force?

Similar issues occur in the scene where the two guys die because they go up to a v*gina snake that's clearly housing razor sharp teeth. And the scene where they refuse to take weapons on their first trip. And the part where they don't wait for scans to complete before entering. And the scene where they notice the dead guy suddenly has vitals again so they open the ship up so he can kill a bunch of people. And the scene where they have the captain (only guy who can fly) and medic both come outside with them (wtf?). And lastly the scene where they ran in a straight line from something rolling toward them instead of side stepping it (also the physics of that were beyond ridiculous.... there is no way a semi-circle does a complete 360). And these characters are supposed to have PhDs... lol

Basically the writers were unable to write organic reasons for the plot to progress so they essentially had to have the characters make immersion breakingly stupid decisions over and over

5. Oxygen suddenly becomes an issue in the very last two minutes of the movie when they need her to go back onto the ship. The entire movie they were running around for seemingly hours with no oxygen issues (and two people planned to camp overnight) yet suddenly she has oxygen issues after being outside for maybe 20 minutes ('90 seconds left')? Then when she needs to get off the ship suddenly her suit has no oxygen issues anymore (walks presumably hours to the next spaceship)?

Basically this is a half-assed unoriginal mishmash of the first couple Alien movies and 2001: A Space Odyssey with none of the action that made the Alien movies great or the payoffs that made 2001 great.","3"
"vitaleralphlouis","In Space No One Can Hear You Laugh -- or Snooze!","10 June 2012","Settled into Washington DC's fine AVALON Theatre, with curved screen and excellent stereo, we were anxious for veteran filmmaker Ridley Scott's latest effort.

It seemed, for about 40 minutes, that the movie might be breaking new ground in originality; but disappointment set in Big Time at about the point when the two space nerds get strangled by the snakes. Can anybody say ""boring."" It came to pass that we would get very little plot, no character development, and no suspense; just CGI nonsense and lots of noise. Nothing scary. Not the snake scene. Not the alien abortion. Nothing! Why? No reason to care about the cardboard characters.

""Alien"" was loaded with suspense. Even ""Alien Resurrection"" (wynona Ryder and the monks) was suspenseful. Both had character development and actual plots. In 2012, movies are aimed at the empty-heads and a swirl of CGI colors along with lots of noise is all they require to score a movie a ""10"". Think about the role models for the young audience: Be a dumb-bell in school and you might land a job in space exploration.

Not to be too negative, it was enjoyable as a Bad Movie. Shame on you, Ridley. You did a good job on CBS's ""The Good Wife"" but not here.","1"

"capra","Excellent Atmospheric Sci-Fi","8 June 2012","Prometheus lived up to my expectations. I was satisfied with the movie and would recommend it to all Sci-fi fans. Please watch the movie with an open mind and don't make the mistake of comparing it to past Sci-fi movies.The special effects were excellent. Michael Fassbender as the android is the standout cast member.

There are some minor gripes. At two hours in length the movie seemed to be too short; it should have been about thirty minutes longer. A longer movie would have allowed for better character development. Some characters appeared to be superfluous and could have been omitted from the final script.

Overall I was happy with what I saw and I was mesmerized by the alien world that Ridley Scott created for his audience. Sci-fi is a genre that allows us to escape the drudgeries of our earthbound existence and wonder at what might be. Prometheus did it for me.","10"
"alexbunardzic","Phenomenally stupid","2 May 2013","Thank god for Netflix, otherwise I'd be really upset about spending good money on this atrocious movie. Streaming via Netflix, I at least felt that the cost of viewing was sunken into the $8.00 per month streaming subscription, so the only thing that hurt was the sad fact that I've wasted 2 hours.

Same as many other disappointed (and angry) fans, I too hold the ""Alien"" (as well as the ""Aliens"") in high regard. That's why many of us find it simply unbelievable that the same person who created those classic movies could stoop so low to create this garbage. It must have been created by some geriatric Hollywood committee, there's just no other explanation for this mess.

One of the biggest disappointments of this movie are the visuals. The alien in the original movie (made back in the late '70s, more than 30 years ago), looks superior compared to the lame CGI monsters displayed in this movie. Seriously, the special effects in ""Prometheus"" are unbelievably lame and amateurish, a shocking fail for such a high budget movie made in 2012! Impossible to explain how could such low quality visuals make it through even the most basic quality control? People were making more convincing CGI monsters back in the early 1990s. Has the technology not progressed at an accelerating break-neck pace since then? What happened -- where did the CGI budget for this movie go?

However, the tragic fact is that even the most spectacular and ahead of its time visuals couldn't salvage the terrible concept, the terrible script and the terrible acting. To begin with, as someone had already noticed, the entire movie is drenched in a very uneasy 'been there, done that' vibe. It's all been done before, and many, many times over. So why bother doing it again?

Next, you sense that actors are just going through the motions, merely earning a paycheck. Insulting to the viewers, to say the least. It's almost as if they were embarrassed to be in this movie. A scene that best illustrates this is when the captain of the ship (Elba) is cued in to sing CSNY classic ""Love the One You're With"", but he just couldn't be arsed to do it. It was painful to watch, the way Elba's voice cracked under the enormity of the embarrassment.

Next in the fail department is the make-up: have you seen the terribly lame attempt to turn a young-ish looking actor (Guy Pearce) into a very old man (Peter Wayland)? That has got to be the lamest ever disguise, especially exacerbated by the fact that it's displayed in high definition. It's almost as if they hired some high school make up artists-wannabes, and paid them minimum wage to have a go at it.

And now we come to the bottomless pit that is the amount of stupidity crammed into the script. It doesn't seem possible to exhaust the list of topics where you are left scratching your head, thinking ""this has got to be the stupidest thing I've ever seen!"" I feel like I shouldn't even try to mine that ore, but here are just a few nuggets that come to mind:

What's with the old dude (Peter Wayland) pretending to be dead and playing a recorded message to the crew, only to later on reveal himself being on the ship all along? What was that all about, how was that supposed to further the plot? And how come no crew member gave a hoot about all that? No one in the known universe can riddle this stupidity.


Staying with the old dude, based on what was he convinced that his 'creators' could prolong his life? It is amazing enough if someone can engineer life, but that doesn't automatically mean that this engineer can then extend the life span.


Why was that clueless crew member attempting to pet a clearly agitated and angry space alien monster cobra snake? Was he on drugs or something? (come to think of it, it was not him but his colleague who was smoking something in his helmet).


A couple of scientists stumble upon some crude drawings in a cave, and from there they are able to accurately pinpoint the exact coordinates of a tiny moon 500 million miles away from the earth?


A desperate and greedy tycoon is then fully prepared to dunk one trillion dollars into an exploratory space expedition, based on the flimsy cave drawings?


Upon arriving (somehow, fantastically) to the destination moon, it took them just a few minutes of hovering over the moon's surface before they spot a man-made edifice with a nice landing spot next to it? Talk about blind luck!


Ship's android (why is there always only one android on these imaginary futuristic missions? Shouldn't they be dead easy to replicate with a push of a button?) then poisons one of the chief scientists, who subsequently, being a contaminated threat, gets killed by his peers, and no one ever gets upset about this android's unethical behavior?


A women performs a cesarian section on herself, receives a few metal stitches on her stomach, and is immediately after that (a few seconds later) able to perform athletic feats of strength? Anyone buying that must be brain-dead stupid!


And on and on, many other stupidities that abound in this movie have already been discussed ad nauseum. The only thing to conclude from this fiasco is that, judging from the commercial success of this movie, the age of Idiocracy is already upon us, so lord have mercy on our souls.

The only funny (and somewhat oddly redeeming) moment in the movie was the redneck zombie. Where did he come from, and what's the story behind that? Impossible to explain, of course...","1"

I still can't understand why Ridley Scott did this to us. The Alien saga had a couple of great movies with Aliens I & II at the top. A camel is a horse designed by a committee and Prometheus is like a class project where every team writes a bit ending up with an unconnected plot. The biologists decided they were too chicken to stay and returned to the ship and somehow they lost their way but never called for help. They just sat down waiting for the storm and when cobras show up they aren't afraid anymore. Tears start to form! Then the main character suddenly transforms after receiving a dose of napalm into a bionic spider-like flash creature. Hey! ... Is he done now?

"raiderreggid","Worst Sci-Fi Movie Ever","11 October 2012","Prometheus is a visually stunning but intellectually insulting, scientifically laughable, and philosophically vapid piece of money-inspired, fake-science-promoting, Christianist garbage of the worst kind. If I could rate this film at -10 stars, I would, for it is that poorly written. I can't imagine how many tens of millions of dollars Mr. Scott has made or will make from this film, but for his sake, I hope he finds his financial gain satisfying, because he has taken a giant, dollar-signed dump all over his ""Alien"" legacy.

I will not belabor to recite all of the countless, ludicrous plot holes and ridiculously undeveloped characters so ably documented by many previous reviewers. I will, however, join the chorus of viewers who have commented on the horrible, almost painfully unwatchable behavior exhibited in this ""film,"" if it even deserves to be called that rather than just a mash-up of random scenes and random, undeveloped and idiotic ideas. Suffice it to say that the characters act, react, and talk so illogically and unrealistically, and engage in such stupid, unbelievable, and inexplicable behavior throughout this film that it would be laughable were it not so disappointing. In virtually every scene in the film, there are multiple ""WTF"" moments, where one is left slack-jawed wondering how anyone, much less scientists and space explorers, would behave and speak as they are written in this abomination.

The biggest ""WTF,"" however, is reserved for the question of how writing this poor -- no, this mind-numbingly horrible -- ever made it near a film with a budget approaching $200 million. $200 million freaking dollars, yet it is written like the free association ramblings of a ten-year-old Pokemon addict hopped up on Red Bull and Mountain Dew. And this, ultimately, is why this vapid piece of junk should be given -10 stars, and why it is the worst sci-fi film EVER. With a budget so astronomically large to permit such truly beautiful, stunning visuals, the fact that it employs a screenplay of such horrendous quality makes this movie far, far worse than the worst of the low-budget B-movies where we might expect or even be entertained by such terrible writing. With an ""epic"" movie like ""Prometheus,"" however, it borders on criminal negligence.

"erfnation","Visually spectacle it might be, but it ain't no Avatar.","14 June 2012","The good old days of storytelling through film making is on the wane. Great film makers of yesteryear used to make great films. Now they're just about good. Steven Spielberg is one such example. Tintin was enjoyable but it was surely not your usual Spielberg fare. Another classic example in this league of directors is Ridley Scott. Lately the guy seems to be at sea regarding how to tell a gripping story. Robin Hood was entertaining but not endearing at all. Prometheus also suffers the same fate. It is at best a onetime entertaining watch. But it doesn't stay with you. Alien was one movie which haunted me, stayed with me. The tension while watching Sigourney Weaver going head on against the alien was palpable. In Prometheus you feel as if the things that happen were bound to happen. It feels strange that you're making a film on such a scale with loads of budget and you don't ponder over it as to what people would expect and how they would react. I'd say, the writers of fantabulous TV series such as Breaking Bad do better a job than these so called script writers. Noomi Rapace, the archaeologist is compelling, the android is portrayed by Fassbender with delightful precision and Charlize Theron is powerful in her short role. They got the right guys, but they didn't find them the right story. The movie is no doubt a visual spectacle, but it ain't no Avatar.","8"

You basically can make up anything you want that contradicts any known scientific theory. So I am not going to be picky about the discoveries in the movie. As a scientist myself, I have to say that the 'so-called' scientists in this movie are totally unprofessional. The writers need to have REAL scientists as consultants. Just like when you are making a war movie, you want to have real military personnel, pilots, snipers etc as your consultant, to make sure the things the actors do and say in the movie are authentic and believable.

At times, it is a bit over the top and a bit too violent, but then again, the universe is a naturally violent place. It is possible that the film could be viewed as an original exploration of the origin of mankind. However, since there are several scenes that mirror those of Alien, it might be wiser to go with the view that it is a prequel. And a very good one at that. The woman protagonist wins the survival of the millennium award, as she survives more disasters than ten Titanics. Make no mistake; this is a classic of horror and science-fiction combined. Ridley Scott has gone all out to outdo himself in comparison to his earlier efforts. The special effects are among the best in the history of cinema. The opening sequence is unforgettable.

This film is without doubt proof that even turds can be buffed to shine for the mass idiocy of the public viewer. The stupidity of the plot (or lack of it) is mind boggling at points it had me squirming in my seat, when the aliens definitely didn't. The lack of realism in physics equally so. Note: you do float in Zero-G, atmospheric re-entry requires ceramic shielding and after an operation, people require time to heal internal wounds. Physics people, physics! Whether its having an eye infection and not reporting it, running a marathon after a stitch-up for an alien C-section or having a space-ship (weighing N-many tons, not disintegrate under stress) roll on you and not kill you or depress the ground in any way. This can and does all happen in the world of Prometheus.

Dialog wise Prometheus is less thought provoking than wondering what the writers were thinking when they wrote it. They thought the CGI department could make up for their uselessness. I've seen the story placed in the realm of 2001: A Space Odyssey. 2001 is a thinking persons film and asks good questions. It has this thing called realism and subtlety. 2001 is the genius - Prometheus is the village idiot with good hair.

I'm not what you call an Alien trilogy fan boy. In fact I'm not exactly even a fan. Couldn't tell you the last time I watched one of them. They've never hit home with me. From my point of view they are monster movies than anything else. If the originals were set in a research lab in the south pole it wouldn't have changed much.

Prometheus is a sci-fi movie at its very core. It provokes the imagination. It will ask questions such as how where we made, why, by who, for what purpose?? The movie will take you on an enjoyable, thrilling and philosophical science fiction experience. Simply put Ridley nailed it. So much so he has simply set a new bench mark in movie experiences.

The visuals of this movie are amazing. Proof if anything that when it comes to special effects and eye candy none do it better than Ridley Scott. In my opinion the best use of 3D to date. Couldn't fault the cast. Having said that its clear to me Fassbender turned in the best performance. I feel thats largely due to the uniqueness and quirks of his character vs the more straight up working professional crew. Either way he turned in the performance.

Going forward I hope we see Ridley revisit the Prometheus story arc and treat us with some more outstanding science fiction cinema. If he doesn't then it would detract anything from what this film IS. My only fear is this film will draw criticism for what it ISN'T and the disappointment of the fan base for the more tried and tested formula of the Alien movies.

I guess that goes both ways though. The original Alien movies weren't for me where as Prometheus was. I guess only time will tell but at the time of writing this review there is a ground swell of fans who's expectations of ""an Alien"" movie were not met. Happily my sci-fi journey with WOW visuals expectations were met.","9"
"stevehallcharles","It's actually not as bad as all the uptight reviewers make out!","8 May 2023","So, just watched this again as I just felt like it on a rainy bank holiday afternoon...

Have just read a few reviews and a couple things to note:

1) the majority of reviewers have no idea what the 1-10 scoring system means. Let's assume we are talking about cars. A ""1"" would be a car that rarely started, wobbled all over the road, nothing worked, could not drive up hills, barely made 30mph and was shocking quality. A car that was in all effect totally unusable. A ""10"" is almost unobtainable. It is the perfect car in every way. Awesome performance, efficiency, quality and reliability. Everything is perfectly designed and has every option currently available - all for a reasonable price. There is no better car available. Every other car is in the scale - and to be fair, most live in the 5-7 range. Usuable, but flawed in some way. To rate a film ""1"" or even ""10"" is impossible. Even particularly bad B movies with terrible plots, effects and scripts are still only a 2 or 3.

To label this film as s 1 is ridiculous. It is flawed, and there are some pacing issues, and not Ed bough depth given characters, but a ""1""??!! Come on, it's perfectly watchable and even though most reviewers feel that they can only offer a 1,5 or 10, it really doesn't deserve to be thrown in the bin like that. If I have to be honest, a 6 or 7 is perfectly right.

2) stop comparing it to Alien. The original was a Good film, but not perfect either. It did well with a limited budget and technology available, but there was room for improvement. At best, I would give Aliens a 8, but they'd mainly for originality and working with the limitations of the era. You don't need to compare this film with the original. There are a lot of similarities to the plot, and both sets of characters are flawed and make mistakes. The key antagonist is very similar to a character in Aliens, although the build up is much more subtle. Always review a film on its own merits. On this basis, a ""1"" would be obtuse.

I have watched this film twice now, and although I would change a few things, it's perfectly watchable as I said earlier. More character development would have been better, though all the character mistakes such as removing helmets and other actions are spot on. They are not hardened experts. If this are a film about Tier 1 seal operators, I would expect them to be perfect in their actions. But this film contains a collection of mercenaries and subject experts that make irrational and illogical mistakes, just like you and me.

If you don't like creature features or science fiction, don't watch it. If you want to watch a film that about those chasing their dreams, only to find something else, then watch this film.

Just don' pay any attention to the reviews giving it a 1 and making it sound like a 1 legged centipede trying to bake a cake using only nails. 😎

It has issues, but give it a chance!","7"
"achyutaghosh","The new benchmark in film- making","8 June 2012","Prometheus left me speechless, it also left me feeling cheated, here's why.

There is something about science fiction that brings out the best in Ridley Scott, fires up his imagination to deliver spectacles of epic proportions- first it was Alien, then Blade Runner, and now Prometheus. With the Alien franchise having moved into B movie territory with the AVP series, and the need to satisfy the billions of Alien fanboys, Prometheus fuses two sci-fi classics- 2001: A Space Odyssey and Aliens into one- man's search for his creator leading to the encounter with its most insidious enemy, thus creating a feature that not only serves as a prequel of sorts to the first Alien movie, but also on its own emerge as a genre defining, standalone feature overflowing with visual splendor.

""Who does not want to meet his maker""-the starting sequence of the movie sets an appropriately majestic tone-in an apparently lifeless world a long time ago, a humanoid alien sacrifices himself- his body disintegrating and flowing in with the water, and then later forming the first living cells. Is it blasphemy to believe an alien is our creator? The film fast forwards to the year 2089, where archaeologists Elizabeth Shaw (Noomi Rapace) and Charlie Holloway (Logan Marshall-Green) discover a number of drawings from different ancient cultures that depict the worship of a set of planets that are about 500 billion miles, or 2 years away from the earth. A few years later, a trillion dollar discovery mission is launched, sponsored by Peter Weyland (Guy Pierce), of Weyland Industries. Because he stole fire from the Gods for man, Prometheus is often toted as the link between man and god. Prometheus, the titular exploratory spaceship in the film is aptly named as the vessel that aims to unite man with his God, his 'Engineer""- as they call the alien species.

While the astronauts are in cryosleep, they are watched over by the star of the movie- an android who knows or can figure out anything, named David, played by the guy- who-can-do-nothing-wrong Michael Fassbender. Early in the movie his creator claims that David is his son, but pity he cannot feel anything as he has no soul- there cannot be a wrong-er statement than this one. He is inanimate, but he seems to have more soul than anyone else in the cast. With or without his head, Fassbender plays his android with subtlety, wit, charm and humor Upon landing on the planet, the visitors find out that all but one of the Engineers that they have been seeking are long dead, and that the planet is inhabited by a reptilian parasitic species that spews acid, likes to hug faces, do mouth to mouth (literally), and of course, do the iconic chest bursts. Predictably, one by one the crew members of the Prometheus meet their gruesome deaths. Even though this one is more of a scifi thriller than the slasher horror that Alien was, i loved the gore content, wished there was a bit more too. 'Stop the ship or there won't be any home to go back to- says Shaw, as the sole surviving Engineer sets out to launch the infested alien ship towards earth. Heeding her, the pilots of the Prometheus collide their ship in an electrifying climax. Speaking of Noopi Rapace as Shaw, hers' is a gutsy performance. She is particularly effective in one of the most harrowing scenes in recent movie history- where she conducts an impromptu c-section on herself to take out an alien fetus. However unforgettable this scene is, she still cannot carry a film on her own like tough girl of yesteryear's Sigourney Weaver did.

Why the Engineers are set upon destroying what they created is never explained, as is the presence of the lovable face hugging/chest bursting xenomorphs. David says ""who doesn't want to kill their father""- does that mean the Engineers were fearful of their creation, of man coming to destroy them? But then in a different tangent, David muses that sometimes it is necessary to destroy first and then create- so were the Engineers again trying to start a creation cycle by destroying all life on Earth? Does Armageddon consist of chest bursting aliens? Was it necessary to get the origin of man angle?

That is the unforgivable thing about Prometheus - that it provokes many questions, but holds back all answers for the sequel. On one hand you have arguably the most gorgeous movie ever made. The attention to detail is fantastic, the direction mostly mesmerizing, and the grandeur of it all is unparalleled. Watch this in the best 3D you have got around you, because like Avatar, in the hands of an intelligent director, 3D morphs into an experience rather than a few tacky shots that come all around you. Ridley Scott literally transports you to new worlds, you can smell it, feel it, fear it even. It has an incredible sense of occasion- the planet and dome exploratory sequences are downright awe-inspiring. There is human on alien, alien on alien and robot on alien action, and of course the fan favorite Alien Queen makes her presence felt. But there are plenty of plot holes and unanswered questions, and however it may try to breakout as an independent franchise, it will always have billions of pounds of expectations.

On its own, Prometheus is millions of dollars spent in the right direction to give a maximum cinema experience. Prometheus is all at once entertaining, thrilling, and spiritual and asks thought provoking existential questions- whether all that is too much to absorb from one movie is an individual choice. After a spate of duds, Ridley Scott is back with a bang with a compelling story, and fascinating film-making. He has opened new doors in addition to creating a flow to his original epic, I just wished it answered a few more questions. 9/10- DO NOT MISS!","9"
"james-still","Bad, Really Bad","2 July 2012","Most of the positive reviews of this movie must have been mass generated from people who were paid to do so. How else to explain it?

I love sci-fi in general and intelligent sci-fi in particular. And I'm willing to forgive an awful lot if the writing is good. This film is visually stunning but the writing and character development is so bad that you end up not caring about the visuals. I can think of not one single character that I cared about. And why was Theron in this movie? She didn't do anything but walk around in a jumpsuit. Minor spoiler: Let's say you're an archaeologist who has spent his entire adult life excavating and uncovering evidence that aliens visited earth thousands of years ago. And then your dream comes true and you travel to their planet and discover ancient ruins. Do you spend exactly ONE DAY looking around the ruins and then go back to your tent and pout and get drunk because you can't find a living descendant? Even Indiana Jones would have stopped to read and study some petroglyphs for a few minutes before smashing up the place. The whole movie was frustrating, juvenile, and ridiculous.","1"
"KiltedGreen","What a waste","7 June 2012","An earlier reviewer says ""ignore all the negative reviews"" - well I say don't!

I paid £12 to see this. I've only got 15 DVDs at home and Alien is one. I went to see this because this is Ridley Scott - the creator of Alien, Blade Runner & Thelma and Louise.

It was such a disappointment for all the reasons most (honest) reviewers have already said on here. Illogical and incomprehensible with no worthwhile script to speak of. No character motivation or common sense. People do the craziest things for no apparent reason and yet these incidents frequently take the story nowhere.

I liked the way that, overall, the film dovetails into Alien but the details of Prometheus just don't add up to a coherent narrative. It is not believable given the environment that the ship's team find themselves in. How is it that a team member who is an archaeologist suddenly, later in the film, manages to re-program a very rare medical device? Where did this remarkable skill suddenly come from? This is only one of a barrage of questions that this film throws up that really have no answers but seem to be done only to create an 'event' in the film.

Avoid. Such a shame and an opportunity seriously missed.","4"
"MBunge","Somebody should have told these filmmakers there was an episode of Star Trek: The Next Generation with this same premise.","11 June 2012","Well, that was disappointing. Not that Prometheus is such a bad film, particularly by summer blockbuster standards. It's just that the falloff from the idea ""Ridley Scott doing a prequel to Alien"" to the finished product is so long and steep that it can't be ignored. I think we can all agree that it's better than the last two Alien movies (the Aliens vs. Predator ones don't count), but it doesn't come close to the first two in the series. As wonderful as it looks and as effective as some of its moments are, I think we can also agree that sometimes even the best directors and most gifted casts can't overcome thoroughly uninspired writing.

The story features far too many characters with far too few defined roles and is stuck in between appealing to the audience intellectually and viscerally. The plot turns on the concept of aliens being the creators of humanity, which may have been daring when somebody first came up with it in sci-fi 40 or 50 years ago, but though it repeatedly poses the question of why they did it, nothing even vaguely resembling an answer is suggested. Then, with that unresolved query hanging in the air, a second question is posed of why would the alien creators of humanity now want to destroy it. Again, without even an allusion to a possible reason ever being offered. The script has aliens with the technology to travel the stars planning to destroy mankind not with death rays or anti-matter bombs, but with a bio-weapon so ludicrously elaborate that it had to have come from the laboratories of Rube Goldberg Industries. The ending is one of the least satisfying examples of sequel begging I've ever seen, made all the worse because I don't think Scott realized that's how it comes off.

Michael Fassbender is quite good as the android David, though his performance apparently blinded everyone involved to the fact that his character's actions don't make any sense and his role in the story abruptly flips from pawn to villain to object of sympathy and back again. I have come to love Noomi Rapace and she's pitch perfect here as the script, again, fails to give her enough of a character to play. She's a scientist who came up with the whole alien creator theory and not only has to share that with another character, she and Fassbender have to take turns playing the moral center of the whole production. Charlize Theron is aboard as an evil corporate executive who never does anything all that evil and is reduced to cannon fodder by the end of the film.

Prometheus is also a poor example of a prequel with Scott and screenwriters Jon Spaihts and Damon Lindelof going out of their way to leave a huge gap between where this movie ends and where Alien begins, to the point where there's room for another prequel or two. The impression I was left with is that Scott and company either started off with the plan of doing an Alien prequel or doing a sci-fi flick about the origins of Man and somewhere along the way the other notion got thrown into the mix and could never get pulled back out. With Alien and Aliens occupying two distinct genres, horror and action, perhaps the temptation of continuing the cycle with something more purely sci-fi was irresistible.

Now, this movie is visually impressive and certainly never boring. It is intellectually and emotionally hollow. I mean, humanity's alien forefathers turn out to be giant albino bodybuilders who, rather than push a button and utilize some amazing piece of technology, prefer to beat and main their enemies with their bare hands?

I hate to be so negative about Prometheus because it's better made and much more ambitious than your standard summer spectacle, but this is one of those cases where the storytelling might have been better and more enjoyable if it had been less ambitious. I wouldn't shoo anyone away from this motion picture because they might easily get a lot more out of it than I did. I can't recommend something, however, that flounders so badly on what it's trying to do and why it's trying to do it.","5"
"kkboyd-603-991354","Gigantic Waste of Time","17 April 2022","You think Ridley Scott, you think drama, excitement, scares. But not here. The story makes no real sense at all. Promising characters come to nothing (David), old monsters come creeping out from Alien, the token love story ends badly.

The whole thing is lit by a 25 watt bulb to hide, I suppose, a schlocky set. It seems Ridley has phoned this one in. Even the lovely Charlize Theron comes across as a robotic Rhine Maiden, and she's one of the more interesting characters.

Our female scientist reveals an amazing amount of grit: undergoing major abdominal surgery without anesthetic, then, with no time to rest or eat, off to fight the bad guys and run all over our mystery planet.

The main premise of the movie is totally ludicrous. We must find our ancestors on this whatever planet to tell us why they created us. Obviously, God had nothing to do with it. Problem is, they're all dead. So much for finding the key to eternal life.","3"
"evilpinklolita","A big stinking pile of . . . disappointment","13 July 2012","How much more hype can a movie get than this one? I went to see it last week since I don't like being trampled to death by going to an over-hyped movie the first weekend it comes out. I should have stayed at home and washed my hair ten times in a row instead. First, the good. The CGI was breathtaking. Every scene was full of special effects that were unparalleled in quality. However, any movie in 2012 can easily have that with a bloated enough budget. Other than that, the movie had absolutely nothing going for it. I am a person who doesn't require every movie to be fast action shoot-em-ups. I also enjoy a simmering psychological drama, but this movie moved along at a snail's pace. It was so slow I seriously considered leaving and doing something else. I waited an hour for something to happen. The first hour was nothing but boring dialogue and scenes which seemed to go nowhere.

The plot was also full of holes large enough for an entire herd of stampeding elephants to trample through (anyone remember M. Knight Shamalan's Signs? I noticed marked plot shortcomings.) Nothing about the storyline made any logical sense if one stopped to consider it for a millisecond. Several of the actors also appeared as though they were only in the film to occupy space. They did not add to the movie at all. It seemed like Ridley Scott crammed preparing this movie using the classic procrastinating college student's tactic of ""pulling an all nighter."" I generously grade this film a C-.","3"
"wandernn1-81-683274","The Trick William Potter, Is Not Minding That It Hurts.","26 November 2021","Wow it's almost been 10 years now since this.....'thing' was released. I didn't like it when I first saw it and I still don't like it now after several rewatches. Now don't get me wrong. On its own, the movie is entertaining. Not good! But entertaining. But as far as fitting in as a prequel or introduction to the alien universe, it sucks.

Okay so lets do this a bit different. Lets start with 10 stars and see how we do as the plot of this one reveals.

At the start, we have some advanced human life form? On another world. He finds some delicious river berries and decides mmm, i better eat these. So they mutate his DNA and he breaks into a zillion pieces. Not sure how he ever lived long enough to reach maturity. Roll Title and credits? Wow okay. That uh, hooked me??? No, it did not. -1 Star

Next we get intro to Dr Halloway and Dr. Shaw. Some archeologists I assume digging on the Isle of Skye. Experts in their field! Perfect for the team that is...going on the soon to be intro'd expedition. Here we have the Prometheus. Exploratory Vessel. People in hypersleep, cryosleep, whatever you want to call it. Patrick Wilson with a very small role. And David, the wonderful 'robot'. David is very adept with a basketball. David the robot has been assigned to run the ship while all the humans, sleep. This ship, the Prometheus, much bigger and much more sophisticated than the poor ill fated Nostromo. But no matter, destination reached. Time to wake the crew. Cryosleep wakey wakey. A little bit similar to....oh yeah Alien and Aliens both. A little copy catty storywise eh? What I really want to know is where is the CORNBREAD???

Okay so moving on. The crew lands on the moon. Exploration of caves commences. Like the cool vehicles they have. Already more advanced than Nostromo. Okay so about an hour in the geologist and security guy encounter a snake like thing. It latches onto dude 1. Dude 2 cuts it and it splatters acid all over his mask, eating thru the mask killing him. And dude 1 the snake breaks his arm enters his suit and drills its way into his throat. Killing him. Already you have a creature tougher than Alien. Badder even faster killing when it goes on offense. -1 Star

Coms are down so they couldn't transmit what was going on with them. Convenient. Or definitely inconvenient for THEM. -1 Star

But wait, David's feed works to Vickers panel on the ship. But the other guys theirs didnt work. Got it. -1 Star for inconsistent....

I do like the drone that maps out the complex. That part is cool and needs to be in some sort of space game for sure. Oooo David cuts off his feed to Vickers. He's such a naughty boy.

Halloway infected with whatever, he sacrifices himself to Vickers flamethrower! That in itself is probably the best part of the movie. +1 Star for HALLOWAY.

Then we move on to Dr. Shaw being preggers. The seed is in her! David likes this.

Weyland is still alive!!! He's looking for the secret of life! They go. They revive Superman. Superman kills Weyland and rips off David's head. Superman is taking off in his ship, which is heading for Earth. To bring death to Earth in the shape off Alien eggs. Janek and his 2 pilots decide to suicide into Superman's ship. Okay the willingness for 3 guys to just commit suicide is not convincing. -1 Star for illogic

Oh no two ships crash down, debris starts falling. All Vickers and Shaw ahve to do is run to the side! But no, run straight ahead. Two massive ships. Shaw ROLLS out of the way. LOL, ROLLS. Vickers is crushed. Seriously? -1 Star for stupid.

Shaw gets to the escape pod that Vickers was supposed to live in. Or the med pod, whatever. Wait is someone else onboard??? Oh noes! Snakey snake is on there and it's HUGE NOW. And also, Superman is coming. Shaw releases Snakey. Snakey and Superman fight. Shaw gets away! Snakey kills Superman and gets him all preggers. And let's face it. This Snakey is more like Carpenter's 'The Thing' at this point. David, who is just a head now, talks to Shaw. The com system works fine for them. Just not for the 2 guys earlier. Shaw finds a working vehicle. Shaw goes and finds David The Head. Shaw is going to where Superman came from. Shaw wants to know why the Supermen created them and then wanted to kill them. Shaw and David find another ship and take off. And Shaw leaves behind a message for anyone. Don't follow them. Elizabeth Shaw, last survivor of the Prometheus, in a final message that's totally rip off of Ripley's Alien signoff. And the epilogue, an ALIEN like creature bursts out of Superman. Snakey and Superman had a lil baby!!! -1 Star

"zanzara19","How to spoil the Greek myth","24 September 2012","Really. I have no idea why I spent so much money to watch this THING. It might be possible that I am missing the whole meaning of the film, as I don't know the alien films and had to watch this one dubbed in Italian (alas, the translation matters).

First of all, how does this unknown old billionaire (who by the way looks like a plastic monkey) manage to recruit ""scientist"" for the most important mission for humankind without even telling them what they're in for? I mean, they should be allowed to know whether they are being sent to Mars to monitor the weather or to a mysterious artificial planet to be consumed by a vicious black substance which spoils everything it touches. And I really don't understand why the one who puts the money should hide on his own ship.

Secondly, all is good and fine in Hollywood, but they could have bothered to make those scientists a bit more scientific. Touching everything they see (with weird hard gloves while they are outside, with their bare hands on the ship) and spoiling the alien environment does not seem like the best way to go. Taking off the helmets while on a creepy alien planet looks like the best plan for Scott though.

Apparently the main idea is that those muscular white ""men"" created a substance which has killed all of them but a few. This substance is kept in vases and there are huge rooms stuffed with them. First question: why are the first discovered vases underneath a giant human face which resembles the aliens more than the humans from the Earth? Second question: all the corpses the ""scientists"" find are crammed by the doors that lead to the chambers containing the vases and it looks like they really wanted to get in there. If the vases contain the substance that killed them all, why the hell are they trying to reach for it? Third question: if someone managed to freeze some aliens, why did no one bother starting the ship?

One last question, which is really bothering me now: what is the ""weapon"" the aliens wanted to use against the Earth, the black fluid thing, or the creepy octopus-looking creatures which come out from the wases? Are they the same thing?

This film is really not worth watching. It's just a mixture of elements picked from better films, and it doesn't make sense.","2"
"bdawe14","disappointing","23 June 2012","After reading all of the other reviews I'm not going to add in detail to the exhaustive list of plot foibles of which there are many. Whilst this movie would be passable in it's own right I am saddened by the way it's linked into the aliens universe. The dead host alien in Aliens turns out to just be a big human dude in a suit which clearly wasn't the case in Aliens and I might be mistaken but didn't they use it's skull in one of the predator movies? And Aliens are created from this big humans biological weaponry??? Really???? Adding an alien in the last 5 seconds was a pretty weak link. The visuals were stunning the plot was poor the characters were as in both the two AVP movies bland and alien fodder non of which do you empathise with at any point. Fass was awesome and Theron was great and is stunning as always but most of the characters couldn't die fast enough the 3d (I have to confess this was my first 3d movie in a theatre) was stunning inside the ship everything popped out everywhere else it felt a bit lack luster and for me the story just detracted from the Aliens universe. As a HUGE aliens fan as a stand alone movie this is worth a look as a aliens movie it's not good.

Alien - awesome Aliens - AWESOME Alien 3 - it grows on you Alien 4 - tat a poor rip off of 2 the only thing worth watching is Ripleys basketball shot Predator - awesome Predator 2 - OK Avp - complete tat Avp2 - more tat Predators - great movie Promethues - so so, although the visuals are very slick","6"
"YaumingYMC","A potential epic movie turned into a B-grade horror","11 July 2012","When I was a child, I used to marvel at the awesome Science Fiction art done by Chris Foss, Vincent Di Fate. They were magnificent artwork, awe inspiring stuff.

Watching the first half of the movie I felt drawn back to that time - I was pure joy at the sheer brilliance of the set design, props and mesmerized by that delicately elegant, and strangely ominous piano soundtrack - Chopin's Raindrops. I liked the homage to other films - David's voice and sinister child-like curiosity echoes Hal (Space Odyssey 2001) and the 1972 sci-fi film, Silent Running.

Unfortunately, the story was ghastly written.

So let's recap - Big ivory colored alien spacemen nicknamed ""Engineers"" came to ancient Earth and created life - hence the drawings in different civilizations and times. However 2000 years ago - during the time of the crucifixion of Jesus Christ - something bad happened and the Engineers on the distant planet all get killed mysteriously, possibly by the black goo infected by humanity's evil. We are meant to deduce that its somehow people's fault.

So back to the present - two Scientists - Hollo ""woohoo"" way and Elizabeth ""I believe what I want to believe"" Shaw discover ancient drawings which point to a distant solar system that contain a planet like Earth which they believe contain our Alien makers. They convince Weyland, a Rupert Murdoch archetype that this could be the place where the Alien Space Gods live. And he spends one trillion dollars to sent them into space to track down the planet.

Inflation must have spaced out in the future because even with one trillion dollars Weyland could not hire a more professional group of astronauts. So we're saddled with motley crew made out of the ""Wrong Stuff"" - the smart-ass Captain, the ""I goofed up"" navigator from the Spaceship Icarus (IMDB:Sunshine), a geologist from the School of Scottish Soccer Hooligans and the usual idiots, standard space monster food.

This haphazard approach extends to everything they do - they land their giant spaceship straight on the planet without first sending a probe to check for danger. No thought is given to whether the atmosphere is hostile to the spaceship.

When by some luck they come across an Alien Space Temple they immediately rush to check out. No thought is given to the possibility that life or other cities may exist on other parts of the planet.

Its as if they had driven 6 hours to the shopping mall.

The amateurish attitude carries on - the scientists remove their helmets in the Alien Temple allowing themselves to be infected by whatever bacteria human science hasn't encountered yet. Then they make the Greatest Discovery, a decapitated 2000 year old alien head which by some miracle is still alive. They zip-lock it back to the ship and predictably it explodes.

Considering that they are suppose to be top scientists, it is infuriating to see them behave with the aplomb of first year high school students.

The only one who seems to have a clue is the humanoid robot - David, who strangely knows precisely how to operate the Alien doors and equipment. But he behaves like a child, curiously constantly wanting to touch things and conducting his own secret experiments with alien goo and helping a alien fetus to germinate.

Predictable the humans constantly remind ""Pinocchio"" that he is not a human and has no soul or emotion. Wow, I hope the human-like robot doesn't develop a human-like complex and try and kill them.

There are many religious metaphors and parallels running through the show - adding them would be a nice touch if they were delivered with skill and subtlety. But Ridley Scott hammers it home like a schoolboy.

1. Prometheus, the god who gets his abdomen ripped out for giving fire to the humans.

2. Female Hero Scientist, rips out her belly to take out the human alien hybrid fetus.

3. The hybrid fetus impregnates the Giant Alien and their offspring rips its way out through the host's stomach. Predictably we get to see ""The Alien"".

4. An Engineer Alien, wearing a ""Jesus Christ"" cloak just in case we didn't get his point, has to drink a cup to kill himself to create the world.

5. Holloway allows himself to be burned to death carrying on the Prometheus theme.

This is ""Rain in Spain/Plain"" theme is predictable and boring.

Then there are the shoe horn moments - like Weyland's last dying words ""So there's nothing out there?"" And I see Ridley slapping a fat yellow post-it sticker marked ""Atheism vs Religious"" here.

The plot stinks. What we needed to see was a great sense of foreboding, dread, and an inescapable despair - see Shutter Island, Inception, and the first Alien movie. I thought the Chopin's piano music was foretelling that? Instead, we get slapstick horror!!! Loony Tunes stuff.

Ridley Scott seems to have lost his killer touch. To have clouded his film with 3rd rate religious metaphors, stupid scenarios. Its so sad to see a film with million dollar effects and the materials for an Epic get porked into a B-grade horror flick.

I think the problem with many famous directors is that as they become powerful they become complacent. Like the Emperor who was conned into wearing fake clothes made out of air - no one dares to contradict him, former colleagues who were instrumental in their success get forgotten. Only people who know how to stoke their egos get chosen to help. The end result is that we get mediocre stories like this.

6 points for the CGI, set design, and overall layout, 1 point for Ms Theron who looked stunning. Minus three for the story plots.","4"

"FabD1","Not bad, but disappointing","30 May 2012","I saw the movie some 7 hours ago in 3D. Where to begin? The 3D seemed remarkably natural, not forced onto the picture, and that was a real delight. I went to a topnotch theater in Paris, yet ghosting was present all the time. It did distract me often, but I adapted to it. The film is well-done, extremely well-acted by most but the script is a major letdown, and so are, to a lesser degree the sets. i'll focus on the script. First, there is essentially nothing new in it, and the whole feels like pieces of Alien, Star Wars, Star Trek, you name it sewn together simply to earn some extra bucks. Second, and perhaps worse than the rest, the movie is based, not on an extrapolation of what we now know about the appearance of species, but on an assumption which essentially brings us back to pre-Darwin days. The film is thus not science-fiction, but obscurantism-fiction. The writers try to confront the issue head-on, but it does not help much. There are other liberties taken with current scientific knowledge, but I could live with them, were the basic assumption not so blatantly stupid.

So, what are we left with? With a decent escapist movie, but certainly not with a masterpiece, by far. It's not even scary, there's only gore, not terror. Main culprit is the script, but who is more guilty, the guy who writes a bad script, or the director who directs it? I can understand Ridley's desire to revisit sci-fi and the alien franchise, but that was not the right way to do it. He had better left Alien stand alone as his seminal entry in the franchise.

As you may know, there are talks of a sequel to this prequel, and the ending will only confirm these talks are probably well founded.","6"
"Abolla","How has this film bypassed everyone's basic physical knowledge?","9 June 2012","How can people, that is anyone, get swept away by this film's total lack sense? I have seen people, in real life, say this film is good, incredible. How, when a lady character goes up to the only automated medical bay machine, in another lady's room that has it only for herself, ask it to give her a cesarean and it say that it's unable because it can work on male patients only? You have got to be kidding, why was it in her room to begin with if she couldn't use it? A trillion dollars is spent sending 17 complete idiots, not intelligent people who are undoubtedly plentiful on Earth, but the stupidest people conceivable. You have two guys who bail having seen some remnants of past killings, but who then fail to find their way out and who - when confronted with a creature that may have killed the piles of dead alien bodies they saw earlier - decide to pet it. Weyland looks at least 100, and his daughter looks 30, how on earth does this get past people. This review is terrible because it is almost pointless listing the many atrocities these screenwriters have some conjured up. That begs another question, where did they find these screenwriters? There are so many great writers who cannot find any work who could nearly all do a better job at this. The God thing in this film is horrific, end of review.","1"
"sd-forum","No character development.","30 May 2012","This movie tries to tell a bigger story than Alien. You can say that Alien is just a small action spin off.

The movie raises big questions about existence and where we come from. So on paper it sounds good but ultimately I didn't like the movie. It just left me cold. I think it was poorly executed and I didn't care about any of the characters and there wasn't much character development.

This shows that just having a great idea/story doesn't make a great movie. You have to create interesting characters that make you care about them. So for me the movie ultimately fails even if it has an interesting idea.

The only interesting part for me was David's motivations for his actions (played by Michael Fassbender).","5"
"Nyx_Selene","It's bad, plain and simple","5 February 2013","Meet the crew that must have been assembled by the lowest bidder, with a captain who's a crap pilot in need of ""all the help (he) can get"" to take them across some thousand billion kilometers of space to find what some woman chooses to believe is the creator of the human race. By the time they get to the designated planet, they find some remarkable structure at first glance, and when they get to it, they remove their helmets, since the carbon dioxide level looks okay. Never mind all kinds of airborne stuff there could be.

They find a stone panel full of goo, play a bit with the goo, and then go on to randomly press buttons until something happens. After a while, they encounter an alien corpse, by which time the biologist is too bored to do anything, and the geologist, although standing in a rocky tunnel on a foreign planet, concludes that there's nothing there for him to do since he likes rocks. They are now standing on dirt and gravel with worms crawling in it, but they do not take any samples of these. Instead, they take a severed alien head back to the ship and start poking it until it explodes, on the thesis that electricity can trick a presumed nervous system, in a life-form they know squat about, that's been dead for 2,000 years, into thinking it's alive again - whatever that would do for a severed head.

Back in the tunnels the biologist, who couldn't be bothered with a well preserved corpse, discovers an alien cobra-like creature that simply pops up out of black ooze. He gets incredibly happy about this and attempts to play with it. It's okay, he's a biologist who knows about these things. Oh wait, it's an alien and it breaks his arm and melts the face of the geologist. It's a bit different from your average little snake then. Who could have guessed? The soulless robot on board has now started experimenting on his own, by mixing some alien goo into a crew-mate's drink. Said crew-mate soon starts noticing worms in his eyes. If it was me, I would have run screaming to the nearest doctor, but this guy doesn't say a word until he collapses while looking for the snake victims. Although he looks like a zombie and is clearly infested with something strange, the doctor in charge of the ""fail-safe"" quarantine procedures insists on bringing him back on board the ship since ""he's sick"". No sh*t, Sherlock - he's changing color! A more cautious crew-member has to torch the guy, since no-one else seems to care about safety. Not until then the doctor starts thinking along the lines of ""hey, maybe someone else has been infected too"".

The doctor (and by now I'm thinking that ""doctor"" must be her first name, 'cause it sure as hell can't be a title) has actually been impregnated with an alien squid thingy by her infected now-dead boyfriend, but will not hear of being frozen until some actual surgeons can remove it from her body. (Who takes on a quadrillion mile journey without any kind of medical personnel, by the way?) Instead she finds some sort of automated surgery machine, presses some state-your-problem-buttons and voilà! The machine cuts her open, lifts out the squid and staples the skin (never mind all other tissue) on her stomach back together, and she's ready to go again. In fact, she's ready to run a marathon and jump hurdles. The thought of telling anyone she's had an alien squid-baby doesn't cross her mind, and no-one is interested in knowing why in the hell she's covered in blood and has a fresh surgical cut across her abdomen. Instead, they're going to go say hello to the one surviving member of the alien creator race left on the planet, so that the old fart who funded the expedition can hopefully cheat death.

For no apparent reason, the crap pilot/captain is convinced that the creator race came to the planet to create a biological weapon, and a closer (probably first too) look at the scans of the tunnel shows the outlines of an alien space ship. After this actually, f**k it. It just keeps on being stupid, and everything in the ending just happens to make sure this movie can be connected to Alien in some way.

All in all, it's so bad that I'm wondering if Ridley Scott actually made this himself, or if he just gave the project to some interns.","2"
"cowboyerik","ALIEN v. Prometheus - I want a Prometeus 2","5 January 2013","I had a TERRIBLE 2012, I had no chance time to see any movies. I'm taking 2013 OFF. My first objective was to CATCH WITH 2012 MOVIES. Ridley Scott was one at the top of my list. I'm a HUGE FAN of ALIEN movies. The stories, the sounds, effects, the thrill of being scared outta my mind. I was a teenager when ALIENS (Alien 2) came out; I was hyped for it, I was young and was fresh off the memories of watching Alien. ALIEN 2 blew me away; absolutely top notch. I was delighted and surprised that Prometheus was a branch off ALIEN, exploring that original seated Alien now known as an ""Engineer"". Absolutely brilliantly written, thought-out, filmed and cut together. I could ask nothing more from this film after my initial screening. Yes, I was a ""director's"" cut.

After all, he made my #1 movie of all time (Blade Runner) and the best horror movie ever (Alien) and the most engaging feminist saga (Thelma/Louise) and the most romantic cop story (Someone to Watch....).

But if anyone else had made such a disaster of a movie (Prometheus) other than Ridley Scott then he should have lost his movie license and deported back to England. This film's story and characters are so amateurishly fumbled that the writers should be paraded around Hollywood wearing red marks on their bald heads.

"padiyark","Above average sci-fi film in the Alien universe (but not making the alien the star)","10 June 2012","I loved ""Alien"" and ""Aliens"", mainly because of the older, mature cast in different situations: The first Alien was a horror movie, while the second one was an action film.

That being said, when going to ""Prometheus"", know that it takes place in the universe as Alien/Aliens, but occurs many decades out, on a different planet, and touches on the actual alien itself in passing. I feel that too many viewers are expecting a direct Alien prequel, which it definitely it isn't. Also, I would classify this more as a sci-fi mystery/drama.

I actually appreciated this film a lot, as it touches on some pretty interesting concepts from ""Bladerunner"" (many reminiscent of Roy Batty's quest to the Tyrell Corporation). The most fascinating character in the film is easily David the android (played brilliantly by Michael Fassbender), whose cool and calculating demeanor are in some ways central to the emotive mirror in the second most fascinating character, Elizabeth Shaw (Noomi Rapace, who I thought was on par with Sigourney Weaver's Ripley).

Special effects and set designs were fantastic. There were many Giger elements in here, and the sets and landscapes were beautiful. I did not see the 3D version, but I may reconsider as there are some beautiful scenes that 3D would have accentuated well. If I had an issue, it would be that the tech shown appeared to be much more polished and advanced than what was seen in Alien/Aliens.

As for the story itself, I have seen many reviews ripping on the logic of some characters and their motives as well as some of the scenes. I think a lot of it can be explained away (there is a nice ""FAQ"" on this site on the forums explaining the many issues). If I did have a criticism, though, was that the movie was paced a little faster than I expected. I would have really liked hear more of the David/Elizabeth interactions, which would have brought a more intellectual bend to the movie. As for the Lindelof treatment of leaving things hang, I actually do appreciate it. At least that way, I know I am expecting a sequel (I am sure there will be one). I will, however, be let down if the sequel has nothing to do with path followed by the lead characters at the end of the film.

Overall, great film. I would recommend those who have not seen at least the first ""Alien"" to watch it for some (small) background. I also think that time(and quite possibly the sequels) will determine if it is a great film or not.","8"
"jamesgg","Awful, just awful.","18 June 2012","I _HAD_ to become a registered member of IMDb, just to write this review.

I think I speak for every man, woman and child with at least an ounce of active brain matter left, when I say that the FBI should launch a formal investigation into how a movie as terrible as this was allowed to come into existence, and the people responsible should be tracked down and prosecuted to the full extent of the law. Preferably, a public b*******g or g*****g should take place, and if laws to enforce this are not in place, they should be written and applied retroactively.

I clicked the ""Contains Spoiler"" check box when writing this review, but I'm obliged to say - there is really nothing to spoil. The movie fails miserably at coming even remotely close to anything that makes any sense whatsoever at any point in time.

The writing, the acting, the directing, the editing ... _EVERYTHING_ is way below par. I can't really think of one good thing in the whole movie. It's awful, really, just awful.

There are only two things that could have possibly allowed this atrocity to be unleashed upon mankind: 1) Ridley Scott has started doing crystal meth. 2) Ridley Scott's family was abducted, held at gun point, and he was forced to make some of the worst, most despicable and vile decisions ever made by any man.

I hope to God it's the latter, and Ridley has been running some kind of underground film-rebellion-guerrilla-unit that has managed to secure some decent footage, and we'll be fortunate enough to see a Director's Cut of this, that, as opposed to the original, does not suck donkey balls in every way imaginable.

P.S. Ridley, if you need help springing your family from captivity, let me know. Whoever made you produce this ... this ... piece of ... cinema ... is now a sworn enemy of mine, and I'd rather die fighting for your rights to make films the way you used to, than have to endure another two hours stuck in a dark movie theater with something like THIS.","1"
"leoperu","Gods save us from Prometheuses like this one !","2 January 2013","Almost 700 external reviews of such a failure ! Lately, renowned professionals are seriously discussing lame-brained movies with visuals which we used to label ""breathtaking"", while mainstream movie theatres long ago became a place for brainwashing audience with a flood of meaningless, often wantonly disgusting CGIs. No wonder ""Avatar"" got almost 6OO reviews. Call it the triumph of form over substance, or symptom of deep cultural crisis ... - art it ain't.

Ridley Scott is the man who in the seventies/eighties gave us one small but truly old-master-like canvas (""The Duellists"") and two groundbreaking sci-fi spectacles (""Alien"" and ""Blade Runner"") ; after that his creative power quickly waned never to be recovered. Recently he, stealing from himself, Kubrick etc., comes up with another feast for the image-devourers, ""Prometheus"".

Surely the strategy of passive resistance is what could save us from such unwanted gifts. What's the point in judging M.Fassbender's performance in a silly role in an even sillier film ? Or in wondering what goes on in heads of some loathsome couple of adolescently Faustian researchers ? So better let me stop writing ; there are greater pleasures, e.g., to pretend I never saw ""Prometheus"", and to read what someone like Mr. Chaw has to say about it- he seldom disappoints me.","3"
"NicolasHunter500","An idiotic film that insults the audiences intelligence","17 October 2012","Before viewing Prometheus, I was hugely anticipating a well written film with great visuals and characters who are sympathetic and easy to root for.Alas,if you view this film expecting all of this, you're bound to be disappointed. After watching the film, the only worthy aspect of the film that's worth praise is the visuals.

While the set design and visuals are grand and quite breathtaking, The film sadly suffers due to a terrible script and characters so idiotic and unlikeable that literally the film leaves nothing to the imagination other then the question as to why you bothered watching it in the first place.

The script, the story, the characters, are all horrendously written and the execution of the narrative is in fact so boneheaded and half baked that it makes you question why this film was made to begin with.

The story is about a space crew who journey to a distant and mysterious planet to discover about man's existence, and about how life started, but of course, in alien fashion, everything goes awry and the crew find themselves in incredible peril. Sound's great, right? Exciting so far, well, on paper maybe, on the screen its anything but.

The story is rife with colossal plot holes, and the characters, all apparently intelligent,well educated scientists, act so moronic and they do absolutely ridiculous things no one would do, such, in one of the moments of the film, the crew venture inside a cave, and, one of the characters takes off his helmet, despite the fact the air surrounding the cave outside is dangerous and toxic, yet all of the scientists, proceed to take off their helmets, despite being on an alien planet they've NEVER been on before, and the air could harbor a virus or any type of bacteria in the air, or anything could just leap out while they have their helmets off yet no one ever considers that, and they all decide to remove their helmets based on what one of the characters say, despite the potential risk of getting infected is still there. Its hard to believe this script actually gets the green light, and one of the studios agreed to use such a dense and feeble script for such a hugely anticipated film.

Here is more eye rolling moments for you. During the first expedition, two of the scientists, who apparently know the layout and designed the map of the area, suddenly get lost in the caves, even though they said they were going back to the ship, however, being as thick and stupid as they are, they take a different route through another cave, and the ship, which is capable of seeing where the crew are, because of the cameras built into their space suits, don't ever bother to notify them that they're going the wrong way and they simply let them get lost. And then, days later, when the missing two geologists come across an alien, in a cringe worthy and frankly ludicrous scene, they begin to freak out like little children before then, all of a sudden, start to at like idiots in front of the creature, and one of them even get up close and try to touch it, even though the creature obviously looks dangerous and intimidating enough. All of the characters lack any common sense and to sum them up, they are the equivalent of dumb teenagers out of a slasher film, they blatantly do idiotic things that result in them getting killed. And most of the characters in the film, besides Elizabeth shaw, have no development or emotional depth, and the majority of them are just fodder that are in the film just to get killed. The whole film is a deeply flawed, effortlessly conceived mess and it makes the viewer feel more frustrated then thrilled. The only positives in the film, however, were some parts that due to the particular ineptness of some scenes, ended up being funny. Elizabeth Shaw, who learns there is in fact a creature living inside of her, has to have an operation before the creature emerges or potentially kills her. When she reaches the machine, it tells her it only operates on male patients, despite the fact its still able to operate on her, and, above all the machine doesn't even bother to sedate her before performing surgery on her, which is ridiculous, because she could possibly die of blood loss during the operation if she wasn't. And she is still able to walk PERFECTLY after having a life threatening surgery and having a massive octopus creature pulled out of her stomach. And no one even asks her why there is blood all over her stomach, and why there are stitch marks across her belly.

I'm not going to continue on here, you get the picture as to how idiotic and poorly thought out the movie is. The sad thing is about the film, despite being illogical and ridiculous, as that it actually manages to destroy the mystery some of the original alien had, and it tries to appear intelligent by asking all these questions about humanity's existence but it never answers them. Ridley scott's direction is incompetent and childish, and the lead acting is either mediocre or worse. Overall, the film really shouldn't have been made, its simply feels like another insult to the alien fan base, a fan base thats was already beaten up previously by two atrocious AVP films. I don't recommend Prometheus, unless you enjoy watching bad films.",NA
"agore3","Movie was great until they woke up the crew!","2 August 2015","The movie was great until they woke up the crew.

I just do not like movies where supposedly trained specialists make dumb decisions. The story is missing a lot of the plot to connect the stories on why some did some things.

I never understood the rationalization of the android doing what he was doing along with most of the rest of the crew at the cave / ship complex and yet the moon had other ships too. When given a choice between doing nothing out of caution or doing something, they always did something that usually ended up killing them.

It was hilarious that someone could go through a cesarean on machine only designed for men (!) then with a belly stapled together was able to outrun and outlive everyone else.

"bbjonw","What? Why? Where? How?","25 June 2012","I went to see this near the end of its run in the UK, and was forced to ante-up GBP10 for the privilege of watching it in 3D.

I'd read the mixed reviews, but (as a big fan of Deep Rising, which is universally hated by even moderately-minded film fans) decided to give it a chance anyway. I have to say it was a complete waste of a tenner. Apart from a few nice touches showing it as the prequel to the Alien quadrilogy, the only good thing was the SFX - except that they could have filmed the whole thing in some remote part of Iceland and saved themselves a few million dollars in CGI.

Apart from that, my summary of the film is a series of questions about the absolute stupidity of it all, as described in excruciating and accurate detail by previous reviewers.

The up-in-the-air ending does indeed leave one wondering if there is going to be a Prometheus II (or should that be Alien 0?) which explains some of the rubbish proposed in this epic. Leaving aside some of the more specific inanities (like why did they not use an old actor to play old man Weyland, instead of a young guy in poor make-up?) in favour of the bigger picture....

Why did the aliens leave cryptic messages giving the location of a bioweapons development planet, whose apparent 2000-year-old delayed mission was to destroy life on Earth (having created it for no obvious reason in the first place)? Surely that's the last place they would want us to visit, in case we blew up the ship they intended to use to kill us. Oh. Ooops.

Why did mankind spend a trillion dollars sending a bunch of squabbling retards and misfits to investigate this strange new world instead of a team of clever people?

What screen writer fresh from his First Grade biology exam designed the life cycle of the aliens? Where did that Cobra thing come from? Why did the black cloudy stuff turn humans into indestructible monsters (rather than just poisoning them dead), who could then impregnate other humans leading to an embryo that could gestate in 11 hours, before turning into a giant squid? Uh? What? Why?

What was all that garbage about bringing the head back to life, and it then exploding? That woman was an archaeologist, was she not? When did an archaeologist ever manage to bring a two-millennia old alien head back to life - and then fail to turn off the juice so it goes 'bang'?

And what was the story of the 'mechanics'? How come all of them were dead bar one, who had spent 2000 years in stasis. If the ship still worked, why wait 2000 years to wake up and complete the mission?

Why did Weyland hide out on his own ship? What was the point of the blonde ice-maiden being his daughter?

Why have a sophisticated medical scanner/diagnostic/operative device on a ship with male and female crew programmed to only work for men?

Since when did stapling someone's skin together after an operation allow them to perform superhuman feats within minutes afterwards? I had my appendix out, and with all the resources the NHS could throw at it, I could hardly walk for a week afterwards.

And the silliest bit of the film is where the alien spaceship crashes, and then starts rolling like a giant wheel towards the two women, who then run - in the same direction the craft is rolling. I mean, come on, Mr Screenwriter - this is supposed to be serious sci-fi, not College Co-eds meet the Wolfman!

Words fail me. As some have pointed out, maybe there will be a Director's Cut which explains some of the greater idiocies - for instance that the crew are cretins because of budgetary limitations at NASA.","3"
"qljsystems","Flawed but dazzling movie about psychopathic individuals that fails to deliver in its own genre","31 October 2012","Ridley Scott's prequel to the eponymous Alien is both flawed, easily misunderstood, and underwhelming.

The main premise is a manned mission to find ""the architects"", the giant humanoid sentient beings who are credited with being mankind's progenitors, who are recorded as strange giant figures in cave paintings and stone carvings pointing to a configuration of stars which closely resemble a star system too far away for the unaided eye to see. Yet, after travelling such vast distances, to meet their ancestors, the humans discover instead a trap, a deadly mutating force that turns worms into muscular glistening snakes. Everything the black goo touches changes and adapts into something menacing and less than welcoming, and the situation worsens as the story rushes towards its inevitable and puzzling conclusion.

The real disappointment in this movie is that it answers neither any of the questions raised in either Alien nor Prometheus itself. Why is this? Well, it's unlikely by design, however probably as a consequence of focussing on creating spectacle and bedazzlement and huge set-pieces rather than a strong, well-crafted story. Any sense of awe and mystery evaporates quickly as the characters prove themselves to be emotional adolescents, unfascinated with their discovery, and who all possess the perceptiveness of Mr Bean. Any promise of menace leaks away in concepts too lofty against such an assortment of caricature characters and there is no pay-off on this as well. The only individual who is well-formed and engaging enough to live up to this movie is David, the android.

I feel that one of the reasons why the movie is misunderstood is because, rather than a discussion about razor-toothed exo-skeletal extraterrestrials or otherworldly astronauts, the movie's throughline concerns the monsters within and among us. The plot weaves a story that is so exquisite in its subtlety that it is easily drowned out by the story's inconsistencies and irrational plot-threads. The tycoon who finances the space mission is as conscience-less as his emotionless android, David, who while the humans are in stasis during the 2 year spaceflight watches endless reruns of Lawrence of Arabia - itself a movie about a troubled man struggling to discover his identity. Worse still, David the android, the only ""son"" of the tycoon carries his own dark secrets and sinister resentments, which catalyse the chaos and destruction, until - decapitated - he coldly bargains his escape with the only remaining human survivor.

Furthermore, it turns out mankind's fictional ancestors are just as psychopathic as the tycoon who is hidden away in cryostasis aboard the ship in the eager hope that their progenitors will grant him the secret of eternal youth. Stuck in the the terrible waltz weaved by the dysfunctional trio of tycoon, daughter and David, the crew is stranded to become the hapless victims, until - finally - the movie's dazzling and awesome finale.

To say that the movie is a total flop is unfair. Nevertheless, it is a story focused on a subtle concept which is hard to depict no matter where and when the movie is set. Also, to say it's brilliant is stretching the point too thin. Even so, it is a cleverly constructed story that attempts to throw a light on the emotional detachment and psychopathic personalities of rich and powerful, and to spin us a story on a par with any Greek tragedy about absolute power corrupting absolutely.","5"

How could a movie with this many big name actors, a huge budget, and Ridley Scott add up to a mostly unwatchable sci-fi absurdity? After watching it I couldn't even tell you what it was about. None of the characters were worth investing even the remotest bit of interest. It was like Scott was trying to make a blend of Aliens and Avatar and even if he did who the hell would want to see that movie considering that Avatar was a blend of Lord of the Rings and Dances with Wolves? I can only hope that this thing is/will be a huge flop at the box office. And IMDF doesn't allow profanity? Is it a movie review site or a religious organization?

"InternetOfZings","A beautiful mess","9 July 2013","Well, I'm disappointed. The movie started very nicely but began to fall apart after they landed on the planet. Yes, the movie is beautifully shot and it had some of the best 3D work I've ever watched in a theater. This is to be expected from Ridley Scott.

But the script is just bad. Well, Damon Lindelof of Lost wrote it so maybe I shouldn't be surprised. The film raises many questions but provides very few answers. The actions of the scientists were also so baffling, reckless and irrational that I just couldn't help but shake my head for most of the movie. These guys are supposed to be smart scientists but then the mapping orb geologist gets conveniently lost, the biologist tries to pet a clearly hostile alien organism, everyone just disregards quarantine procedures and so on. Did these guys get their degrees from some online university? I don't know, maybe this is just a very crude way by Scott to imply that all humans are no better than monkeys intellectually. Particularly silly was the surgery scene where a female scientist has abdominal surgery and then just proceeds to run around for the rest of the movie. I know people do impossible things in movies but that was just preposterous. It would be impossible to walk let alone run after an operation like that.

Character actions were only taken to advance to the next plot point and not to flesh out the characters. This made it so much harder to achieve the 'suspension of disbelief' that is required in these kinds of movies. In Alien the crew's actions were understandable because they were just regular towing ship pilots and mechanics, not scientists of such caliber that they're being invited to a trillion dollar space expedition. These issues make it almost impossible to feel any sympathy towards any of the crew members and therefore it diminishes the tension in the film. When everyone's acting like an irrational idiot, you don't care if they die or not.

The movie was also 30 minutes too short because the characters basically never stop to discuss anything and they don't react to what happens to the other crew members. For example, no one seems to react to the female scientist running around the ship after the surgery. You'd think someone would notice the massive staples on her stomach and make a comment about it. Similar thing happened for Scott with Kingdom of Heaven but I'm not sure if this mess can even be fixed with a director's cut because of the idiotic behavior of the scientists.","3"
"trashgang","some good moments but also disappointing","23 June 2012","And again I was afraid to see a movie in 3D. I mean, most of them are done to attract people because producers are afraid that their flick would flop. The same here, everybody was expecting so much of this prequel to Alien (1979) also directed by Ridley Scott. Naturally Ridley also moved forward in film making and were Alien didn't had a big budget, Prometheus had big money and it shows. The effects used are really unbelievable at some times but of course effects doesn't make a movie.

It does, but that's for other science-fiction flicks with no history. But here everybody wanted to know what happened with the ship found in the original Alien. Remember that the crew of the deep space mining ship Nostromo are awaken from hypersleep to investigate a strange signal from a nearby planet. While investigating the signal, they discover it was intended as a warning, and not an SOS. This is what Prometheus is all about. Why did they send that warning signal.

I was expecting aliens and facehuggers and all of that but nothing here at all of those creatures. In fact Prometheus was out in space to search for the origin of mankind. It's done by archaeologist couple Elizabeth Shaw (Noomi Rapace) and her boyfriend Charlie Holloway (Logan Marshall-Green). They discovered that star maps of different ancient cultures (Sumarian, Maya's, Egyptian,...) all show the same configuration. Of they go to find the planet (LV-223) with money from Peter Weyland (Guy Pearce). Weyland do rings a bell toward the original Alien but the planet was LV-426.

From there on we do have resemblances towards the original one, they have an android (Michael Fassbinder) on board and they do travel in hibernation. Meredith Vickers (Charlize Theron), the mission director is a bit afraid of the planet and warns them not to touch anything. Of course they do due circumstances and things go awry on the planet.

From that moment I thought that it all would start but we already had a lot of talking and special effects. Sadly the monsters do attack and enter throats of humans but they leave soon and we have to wait until the final before some kind of octopus alien returns and attacks.

The special effects do their work but still it is a bit of horror science-fiction and I was left with a hunger for the aliens to attack. This movie is more about the origin of mankind then were the aliens were coming from. There's indeed on alien to see in the last minutes, not as in the other alien flicks but an earlier version of it.

On part of the acting I found Noomi Rapace doing well and somehow she reminded me of Ripley. Fassbinder was also doing very well but Charlize Theron couldn't convince me. Again she's playing some kind of ice queen and we all have seen that before.

This prequel did remind me a bit of the prequel to The Thing (2011). It was just made to earn some money on the cult status of the original flick. Although that the ending of The Thing (2011), in fact the scene's seen in between the end credits, was stronger than Prometheus.

Overall it wasn't that bad at all but it would have been better that it didn't had anything to do with Alien and it's followers. Here we do see the Gods (called Engineers) out there to destroy mankind, Nothing of that in the other flicks. Okay, maybe when they enter that terrestrial spaceship in Alien you can see an Engineer sitting in some kind of chair but nothing is said about that. I really was left with a bitter feeling. People who hasn't (anyone?)seen Alien will love this, you will see attacks of a squid kind of creature but for the followers it just doesn't deliver and explain.

"basilisksamuk","Excellent film hidden inside a really dreadful one","1 June 2012","Watching Prometheus is a frustrating experience. This is mainly because there is a very good film which has been folded inside an exceedingly bad film. I can't make head nor tail of Ridley Scott's pronouncements about this not being an Alien film but happening in a parallel universe. This is without a doubt an Alien film so why pretend otherwise?

Let me talk about the good film. At its best this is a great monster movie with lots of action and scares. It delivers on the monsters and it delivers on the hardware. Even the CGI is excellent for once. The cast is just about perfect. I have my reservations about Noomi Rapace but she is pretty good as the Ripley-alike. Michael Fassbender, Charlize Theron and Idris Elba are all outstanding and the supporting cast is equally good. It is (the good part) a worthy addition to the Alien mythology and Ridley Scott proves he can still deliver the goods after a long run of mostly forgettable films. This is clearly set up to allow for a sequel too, though I can't imagine Scott doing it. Could James Cameron be tempted?

Except it's all wrapped up in some embarrassingly lame plot about the meaning of life and who made us. Worse, it's tied to an utterly awful story clearly derived from Eric Van Daniken; God was a Spaceman; cave paintings prove it etc., etc. The dialogue is just about the worst I've ever heard in a blockbuster movie and that's really saying something.

There's a clear and compelling way to improve Prometheus that would make a killer director's cut. First, cut out all the drivel that happens in the opening act and start with everyone already on board the Prometheus. Remove all the ""God was a Spaceman"" references and insert some short scenes giving a more believable motivation for the expedition. How about – we've seen some weird anomaly in a far galaxy, let's go and investigate and see if we can find new bio-weapons for the company? Remove naff dialogue where characters discuss their beliefs. Turn up the background sounds so you can't hear the worst of the remaining dialogue. You'd be left with a 90 minute film worthy of the Alien franchise and we could all believe in Ridley Scott once again.","7"
"namashi_1","Magnificent!","11 October 2012","Ridley Scott's 'Prometheus' is utterly Magnificent. A shocking, thought-provoking, disturbing Sci-Fi flick, that's amongst Scott's Most Accomplished Works to date!

'Prometheus' Synopsis: A team of explorers discover a clue to the origins of mankind on Earth, leading them on a journey to the darkest corners of the universe. There, they must fight a terrifying battle to save the future of the human race.

'Prometheus' is extremely unsettling & unforgiving & the execution to the Magnum-Opus is of paramount proportions. Scott's Direction is brilliant, probably his bravest effort since 'Gladiator'. The Legendary Storyteller is in complete command this time around & deserves distinction marks. I loved the bleak atmosphere Scott creates from the very beginning, it goes with the film's structure most appropriately.

Jon Spaihts & Damon Lindelof's Screenplay is excellent, it offers shocking & thought-provoking moments. Dariusz Wolski's Cinematography is award-worthy. Pietro Scalia's Editing is proper. Graphics are outstanding.

Performance-Wise: Noomi Rapace is terrific, as always. What A Splendid Performer! Michael Fassbender is exceptional as the android. I love how Fassbender is shown as a Peter O'Toole fan here. Logan Marshall-Green is very convincing, while Charlize Theron steals every scene she's in. Idris Elba is first-rate. A creepy Guy Pearce leaves a lasting impression. Sean Harris & Rafe Spall get limited scope.

On the whole, 'Prometheus' is A Must Watch. Two Thumbs Up!","10"
"hellspawn77","Alright Ridley, where's the real movie?","11 June 2012","I've now seen Prometheus. movie? I'm serious. I know you've got a sense of humor. Remember the poison food gag from Gladiator? We all had a nice chuckle over that one.

Really, where's the real movie? You know, the prequel to Alien you went on about for a bit on the DVD to the wonderful film you made back in '79. That movie is very good. Where's the prequel I asked for? Oh, that's right. I never asked for a prequel. Just like I never asked if Deckard was a Replicant.

The movie I saw in the trailer for the movie Prometheus looked very good. It had that nice Alien trailer music from the trailer for Alien. That led me to think that I was going to see an Alien movie. THERE'S the ship from Alien. THERE'S the Space Jockey, right there in the trailer. So, where's the other Alien stuff? Oh, I see it now, Ridley. You're not kidding. Prometheus IS the final product of 30+ years of anticipation. 30 years of wondering what those eggs were doing on that ship. Wondering how that Space Jockey ended up dead like that IN HIS SEAT! Wondering where this whole Alien thing started.

But hey, at least we got to see a guy smoking pot out of his space suit respirator. At least we got to see that these Space Jockeys are just big humans. At least we got to see Guy Pearce play an old man when an old man in the part would have been just as good. At least we got to see the Kraken from Pirates of the Caribbean back on the big screen.

But hey, at least you want to get back to Blade Runner. Judging from this... movie, Blade Runner 2 is gonna rock.

PS David Fincher, sorry about what I said regarding Alien 3. I thought you made the worst Alien film... I was wrong.","2"
"tmilionis","Over-reaching, ambitious and flawed....","2 June 2012","Spoiler Alert -------------------------

If one is going to make a movie about exogenesis, I would suggest that more that a couple of hours needs to be dedicated to tell the story.

I left the cinema elated, but with an uneasy feeling that the movie would begin to unravel in my mind as I took time to reflect, like a bad restaurant experience which gets progressively worse as you tell your friends over time.

Let me take some time to list the great bits. It is visually stunning. The space sequences are gorgeous. The star-map is brilliant. The dream-sequence is magical. The 'Space Jockey' is excellently linked to the Alien version. The essential archetypes are all there; an android with a hidden agenda, a bunch of disposable and irritating crew members, a corporate 'droid', perhaps, a egomaniac trillionaire who does not want to die and a resilient heroine.

The lousy bits swamp the movie. The science is hocus-pocus at best. The script is diabolical; people do not behave rationally and do not seem to be motivated logically. Back-stories are started pointlessly; who cares about Shaw's father dying of ebola, by way of example? Events are left hanging as if the film needed to be cut by a blind surgeon to fit the transit time of 60oz cola through the bladder of an average viewer. Did Vickers and Janek get to consummate their brief flirtation? Do we give a damn?

The horror is there.... but somehow diluted and unreal. At one point, whilst Shaw was submitting herself to the aborting scalpel, my wife leaned over and whispered... ""The Clawwwwwwww! The Claw is our master."" The fake suspense was shattered by the indelible image in my mind of a green, three-eyed alien from Toy Story, popping its head out of Shaw's sliced abdomen. So much for updating the 'chest-bursting' sequence of the original.

I await the corrective action of a 'director's cut'. Nuff said.","6"
"grant-dewar","Do not trust the rating of this film","14 June 2012","It is garbage. Trumped up, over-hyped and over marketed garbage. The only thing that was passably good were the effects but any film with a decent budget can put together some comparable SFX these days.

My biggest problem with this film was the characters or lack thereof. So this is apparently a trillion dollar mission to potentially make first contact with an alien species and yet it is populated by characters so stupid that they make George Bush look like a bright beacon of the Intelligentsia.

A prime example being Charlize Theron's character who wants to run a multi-trillion dollar corporate empire and yet has difficulty with a simple 50:50 decision on which way to run when a long thing spaceship is falling towards her. Imagine asking an 8 year old child 'You are at the base of a tree, it starts falling towards you. Do you: A) Run along the length of the tree and get crushed to death? or B) Step aside and watch the tree fall?' This is not even the worst of the stupidity displayed by the characters, for whom there was also zero development during the film. I did not care at all when any of the characters died and in most cases was happy to see them get what they deserved. There was no suspense, no real drama, no atmosphere and far too much stupidity to make the film palatable.

I have never walked out of a film in my life and the only reason I stayed in the theatre was to see if they explained the Jockey from Alien. When, unsurprisingly, this did not occur I was upset with myself for not just leaving earlier when I realised that the writers were treating the audience like magpies and basically going 'Look at the shiny shiny!' I can't actually be bothered writing any more about how awful this film was, it has stolen enough time from me already. See it on netflix when it will cost you couple bucks - even then it is probably not worth your time.","1"
"deimos47ca","HORRIBLE. Implausible. No atmosphere. No horror. No sense.","19 June 2012","I gave a very generous 4/10, only because it pays some homage to Alien series.

The movie is a mishmash of ""Contact"" (ie religion/belief/first-contact) and ""The Thing"" and ""Blade Runner/AI"". First 1 minute of movie reveals the robot, David.

There is no suspense. There is no atmosphere. If you like horror flicks, you WILL be disappointed.

There is no SCI-FI. There is no cool tech. Or moral dilemmas for that matter. Those who grew up with Jurassic Park (technology lets biology run amock), or Star Trek (how to deal with first contact), will be very disappointed.

What this waste of a movie does have is an incompetent crew and plot with more holes than swiss cheese, some scare gag aliens killing people at random times, and of course those huge awe inspiring shots of a giant head / space ship.

If your idea of a good time is staring at the big head poster for this movie, with your buddy jump-scaring you every now and then, then you're in for a treat. However, if you're looking for at least B-Movie logic and some logical plot progression and character development, then like me and 99% of audience, you'll be warning others of seeing this.

"pazu7","Shiny and vapid. MST3K material.","10 June 2012","Prometheus is a glossy CG driven farce of 'neo'generic and comically idiotic characters, magic technology, predictable plot points, hackneyed dialog (made all the more insufferable by a pretentious innuendo of depth), absurd and superfluous action scenes and a non-stop score that is as trite as ineffective. Seriously, I don't even know what to say to express how freekin bad this is. And Ridley Scott? Are you serious? See, I just didn't believe the man who started the 'Alien' franchise with that innovative and exciting first film, could return to produce something awful. And that's why I went. Many years ago after some other big budget industry insult, I had vowed to never see a film on opening weekend; but to wait for word of mouth from people I trust. But this time I figured, 'Hey, it's Ridley Scott. What could go wrong?' Prometheus. That's what went wrong. And I love escapist romps, man. That why I went. But, omg... what a stinker. It's not even funny. I am genuinely p*ssed. P*ssed that Scott could create such horrendous pap and p*ssed that anyone could sit through it and give it a positive rating. How? It's beyond me. This film deserves to fail. After all that hype, it's a freekin insult. Be warned. There is something evil in the universe. And it's playing at a theater near you. Stay away, for the sake of humanity.

Addendum: I wanted to add that if this had been just another AVP type knock off, it wouldn't have made me angry because I would have expected porridge and just waited for the DVD. Like I said, I enjoy mindless fun now and then. But this was made by Ridley Scott and that is the only reason I went to the theater. And that is the reason for the low rating and the anger.

"interquam","goofball","8 June 2012","The story itself doesn't follow up and is completely goofed up. Is this supposed to be a prequel....i heard someone said its not a prequel and then it is a prequel..

A very decent film but a failing plot. Actors are a fraction of the other films in the franchise...... The ending where the ""superhuman"" comes to the pod to kill Noomi rapace, a proto-facehugger shows up....born of Noomi herself with no correlation in form nor appearance just seems ridiculous as far as accuracy is concerned. the logic of how the crew of Nostromo finds this derelict spacecraft with the superhuman with its helmet on with its chest busted and transmitting a WARNING signal into deep space .......doesn't quite fit in.

How does Noomi perform caesarean section on herself in that surgical pod seems amazing but then looking like a million bucks and running and screaming all over the place.........duh!

By indication my guess is that the superhuman and the spacecraft are at least 2000 years old once they conduct a carbon dating, give and take 200 years before Alien-1

Im assuming how did the Nostromo guys not be able to fire this craft up in the firstplace..... This movie doesn't justify that....

In this film The crew were a bunch of dud's with idiocy lurking amidst. With absolute no common sense, everything is left to technology. Very predictable. No amount of human sharpness and ability to scrutinize can ever be compromised ..... this is clearly shown in Alien with Ian Holm's character as an android. It is clearly confused and nobody will ever trust ""him"". How do the crew of prometheus trust a droid with homosexual tendencies!? How does he spike Logan's drink with that bug. How does Logan-Marshall greene turn into an alcoholic at some edge of the universe? Immaturity at its finest.

In the end after doing everything Shaw and David take off to another place in some other star system to ask these super-humans why they made humans on earth and some other questions.....operating the derelict spacecraft with the help of David ......just seems flamboyantly outrageous.

"fedor8","Budapest, Turkey - on a new moon.","22 December 2012","Weird intro a violent demise intriguing so far so good (although we never find out this scene's relevance) an obviously nepotistic couple holding hands, like some wide-eyed teens, inspecting some gobbledygook alien-contact cave-drawings not good but acceptable; this is sci-fi after all i.e. BS is allowed not quite sure how they found this star-system based on these vague little kiddie-scribbles; it's hardly a map to uncle Bob's next-door garage let alone to a distant planet... 4 years later, a squeaky-clean ship (not adhering to Lucas's ""used universe"" approach) is sent to look for our ""makers"" Darwin's out the window, defeated by the superior intellect of a Hollywood writer the producers/writers/liars of ""Ancient Aliens"" would whole-heartedly support this, but this IS a sci-fi flick, so I won't complain A cheesy android who looks like a young SS officer manages the ship fine why not But who's in charge?... Oh no Ohhhhh noooo

Not Charlize! The same woman who thinks that Budapest is in Turkey, the same blond bimbo who mugged her way through ""Monster"", and that poses with Mandela just so she could lend herself ""seriousness"" i.e. escape her ex-starlet bimbo image - is in charge of a one-trillion-dollar space-exploration expedition. Ridley, have you lost your mind? I'd rather see Captain Pickard's testicles run this ship – and he's a bloody bald pacifist.

OK, fine so Ms. Theron, who looks like a High School dropout, is the boss sort of; there seem to be 5 different crew-members calling the shots here: ""The couple is in charge, but so is my daughter, and the Captain, AND me the aging loopy bastard later on"" Who's the captain?... The black guy, who looks like he arrived straight from football practice... Oh, brother, this is starting to approach Avatar/Sunshine/Armaggedon-like levels with leaps and bounds But is the rest of the crew similarly balmy? Yuuuup The annoying/unappealing couple who found the cave-drawings was actually invited, no clue why(superstition? duh) The others aren't any better; some of the crew look/behave/talk like a bunch of young MTV slackers from ""16 & Pregnant""... Ridley might as well have cast the ""Jackass"" bunch as these ""astronauts"" I see neither scientists nor astronauts here; I do see however a bunch of (mostly lame) actors lost within the confines of a shitty/confused script directed by a once-worthy director The silliest one is Red-Beard who ""came just to make money"" Oh no, that reeks of crap; I bet he'll do and say many dumb things in the course of this flick Predictably, he dies first, leaving him little time to ""shine""...

I was right: Red-Beard is yowling like a wolf as they enter the cave Perhaps prolonged cryogenic sleep turns adults into imbeciles?... Minutes pass What's he doing now? He is suddenly terrified because of the dead alien body?... Is he actually shouting, throwing a hissy-fit?... Evidently, Ridley didn't deem it necessary to have either an intelligent/mature-behaved crew nor to have psycho-tests for space-travelers prior to sending them on mega-expensive missions... I guess such evaluations had lost their usefulness by 2091: everyone in this future is calm, rational and smart – as is so plainly obvious from the moronic/immature behavior of nearly everyone involved in the mission

""The most significant discovery in the history of mankind,"" lover-boy says. But do the rest of the crew share his very understandable enthusiasm? Hardly; most of these ""astronauts"" seem positively bored, as if finding ancient aliens is part of their daily routine. I was half-expecting to see them yawn. The Captain even looks bemused half the time, grimacing, as if treating the mission like some sort of in-joke. Absolutely retarded.

Next up, the examination of the alien head Suddenly, that fish-faced nepotistic anthropologist is a medical expert as well Hooray for feminism!... Or not (I was hooraying too early): sheesh, the two women managed to blow the head up into bits after mere minutes So much for girl-power And what's Charlize doing? Anything meaningful? No: she is striking poses, as usual, her uselessness as a character is becoming ever-more apparent She looks more like a sex-kitten/ship-mascot/eye-candy-for-the-viewers than someone in charge of anything What's this? She is acting all tough, threatening the vastly superior android? The tough-chick shtick did not work even when she played a serial-killer - let alone as a cat-walk(ing) astronaut, where this Budapest-fumbling Turkey-challenged blond may as well be a piece of furniture

So let me get this straight: two men are stranded on the surface (stupidly splitting up from the main group), but the Captain would rather shtoop Charlize than look out for their safety on his pyramid-hologram thing? Wow And THIS is the guy who saves us all eventually?!... In the meantime, the boring in-love-couple are also shtooping. It's one big shtoop-o-rama on this trillion-dollar mission. They have nothing better to do on a fascinating new world where they'd just discovered aliens; Noomi is getting all teary-eyed when the subject of having kids comes up. Ridley, you ought to have your director's license revoked

Red-Beard and his sidekick see a cobra-like creature not cute in the slightest; menacing more than anything But they wanna PLAY with it And then predictably die in true slapstick fashion. Was Ridley shooting a sci-fi/horror comedy?

""I need to visit their planet, find out why they'd changed their minds, decided to destroy us,"" says the amphibian-faced actress picked here just because her parents are successful show-biz people, in her obviously phony English accent. The answer is as obvious as Danny de Vito's bald head: mankind had turned ""Avatar"" into the biggest commercial success ever, so obviously our bald-headed makers were disappointed and upset with us. Who wouldn't be?

A ground-breaking film though, in the sense that the first half is moronic, but the second half a lot of fun. Usually it's the other way round.",NA
"tclarkoreilly","There must be a space pony in here somewhere!","21 June 2012","As many others have pointed out, ""Prometheus"" is visually spectacular yet fails miserably on a story-telling and acting level. The story lurches clumsily from one disconnected ""surprise"" to another, to no point at all (epitomized by the ""surprise"" of Vickers' paternity - why the hell do we care???) The characters act in completely unrealistic and stupid ways, and represent the shallow one-dimensional stereotypes we've come to expect from 'B-grade' science fiction movies (the brash risk-taking scientist, the tattooed in-your-face Limey with attitude, the world-weary ship's company-man pilot, just doin' his job...). There is virtually no development of these idiotic stereotypes. Amazingly, there is no real suspense, beyond the premature discharge of an accordion (I wish I were making this up, but I am not). There are plenty of lame attempts at suspense that don't work (exploding alien head, fake rubbery-looking cobra beast, ridiculous robo-surgery scene). All of these detract fatally from the movie as a whole - this thing is actually painful to watch! And yet I see that some claim that ""Prometheus"" is a misunderstood masterpiece like ""2001"", if only we'd look beneath the surface of horrible scripting to find its ""deeper meaning"". Yes, ""Prometheus"" is a lot like ""2001"", except that ""Prometheus"" sucks and I hated it. Ye gods, ""2001"" was sublime and mysterious where ""Prometheus"" is a tangled, reeking mess of botched writing and editing. Truly sad to see the director of ""Alien"", ""Blade Runner"" and ""Gladiator"" reduced to this garbage. Move along folks, nothing to see here...","3"

Now, for those of you who prefer to read, I'll leave it at this... This movie sucks at being what it wants to be. Suspense is lacking to non-existent, the sci-fi aesthetic has been done better in the 'Mass Effect' series, but it seems like everyone is copying that space-travel design. The characters aren't likable to the point of irritation and eagerness to let them die. Our lead, despite her acting talent in other work, is teeth-grinding annoying and an insult to scientists. The antagonists are obvious and the shocker isn't that shocking. Bottom-line: It FAILS compared to so many better sci-fi movies that push the limits of our science and morals.

"dmvaux","Never have I been more gutted leaving a cinema than I was that night!","5 June 2012","OK, so I feel the best place to start on this is from the end, more specifically the end of my cinematic experience as I had experienced something I had never experienced before in a cinema which was when the credits began to roll there was a very noticeable but mumbled ""WTF?"" from virtually everyone in the audience followed by uncountable confused looks and almost deathly silence as everyone filed out and it summed up everything that I was feeling myself.

I have waited on this film for longer than care to think about but I was keeping my expectations as realistic as possible, even if it wasn't great as part of the franchise, given the director, cast & money behind it this should have been a surefire hit as a standalone film but how wrong I was. Dreadful doesn't even come close and rather than try and explain in detail all my gripes I will try and briefly summarize...

1/ I'll start with my only non-gripe, Fassbenders opening was brilliant, when he is doing the housework as it were there is a real feel of the original Alien film about it and it's mood is wonderful.

2/ Fassbenders character for the rest of the film however cant seem to decide whether he is essentially a bit of a nasty sod or not.

3/ A conveniently discovered alien temple.

4/ We genetically descend from an angry 8ft strain of a blue man group member who wants to wipe us out for no discernible reason. Depending on how you interpret the opening sequence it's possible that a rogue jockey created us by sacrificing himself to do so but you never really get to the the bottom of that. TBH I wanted them to stay as out of proportion, elphanty-faced aliens but the cop out ""wow they're human"" bit was the beginning of the end. I don't see how it's possible that something that looks so different to us can be an identical genetic match and if they had created all life here why is everything else on the planet NOT an identical DNA match too???

5/ The characters on the whole were just terrible with zero development, 2 examples would be the ""moment"" between Vickers & Janek that destroys all the mystique that Theron had been attempting to build up to that point leaving her little else to do that meet her fate because she can't work out how to run in anything but a straight line...or then there is Fifield who shows us that in the future psychological testing clearly doesn't take place anymore for anyone planning on going on a long space mission.

6/ The ""caesarean"" scene was nothing short of laughable not to mention the complete lack of...well, a mention of it to anyone else afterward.

7/ ...much like any other scene involving anything alien. the attempted cuddling of the cobra-hugger was right up there in top 10 stupid film moments for me.

8/ The overbearing music was nothing if not distracting.

9/ The ending featuring the xeno-man-penguin was pretty dumb to boot.

10/ The plot holes & religious waffle that essentially meant the story had no proper point or realistically sensible outcome, it did seem to be a metaphor for the film in as much as that to get it you need to take a giant leap of faith.

11/ The general pacing of the movie was dreadful.

12/ None of the characters had ever seemed to have met up until the point that they all woke up, how did that happen?

13/ The ""Daddy"" moment that carries no point and just lists as another terrible cliché in a list of many spread throughout the film.

14/ The captain who ""can't fly worth a damn"" according to his crew before they kamikaze into another ship based on nothing more than a hunch.

15/ The aimless nature of the evolution processes and the ridiculous speed at which that all happens. From worm to white cobra- hugger in no time at all, not to mention the rapid growth of the squiddy giant facehugger which did it without any intake of food. Everything grew fast to suit the rushed nature of the film.

16/ The medipod which is ""set up for men only"" yet is stashed in Vickers living space...For what earthly reason would it be set up for men only and does this mean the big twist was that she's actually a fella but that they just never got round to that?

17/ The Electric stimulator jammed in the Jockey's neck was supposed to achieve what? He wasn't going to talk to them mainly because his body was still lying in a corridor...it then explodes. WHYYYYYYYY???

18/ Was the goo in the earns a life creator or a bio weapon?? It doesn't make sense to me for it to be both.

19/ The over obvious lead into an implied sequel. This was just insulting and lazy!

...I could go on, for a LONG time but this review has a limited word count & I simply cant fit in anymore than a fraction of my annoyance!

Like many others have said it is beautifully set out to start with and the visuals are stunning (which is why it gets 2 stars) but it loses the plot fast and never looks like it wants to rejoin the rest of us opting for it's own LSD fueled trip to Narnia instead. It's lazy, badly put together and seems only to ask questions rather than answer them ...it treats it's audience like they are utter morons.

Ridley Scott has a lot to answer for because even a directors cut isn't saving this patient and in doing what he has he's also managed to inflict real damage on the franchise and mythology as a whole too.","2"

Well this time is completely different. I have to tell you about this one.

We went in the theater we huge expectations. The house was SOLD OUT and the rumors ( started by the fantastic trailer ) announced a stunning film.

We waited half an hour for the action to start. Nothing happened. The best known actors were killed in the first 40 minutes. The acting was that of a TV movie. The story is a very poor rip off ( he had Alien on his mind ). The alien in the film is actually a very cute starfish.

Bottom line, we left the theater 4 minutes before the credits and heard buuing because it left room for a sequel.

O please for the love of god....don't! I am a great fan of Scy Fy and Fantasy and have been waiting for Prometheus with very high expectations. This film changed my opinion on Ridly Scott. So, so...so Bad.","2"
"staleofte","Illogical","19 June 2012","Read some of the other reviews with low score for an in depth explanation of why this movie sucks big time. As many of the others who loath this movie I also only signed up to say: Boooo! Sure, the movie starts well enough, but soon goes down hill as the crew wakes up and starts to vomit.

If I had written this script I wouldn't have shown it to any one, I would have burned it. That Ridley Scott decided to direct it only confirms that truth often is stranger than fiction. I hope he got well paid for staining his reputation for ever. As the movie - it just makes no sense.

As Spock of StarTrek would summarize it up: ""Illogical.""","1"

Since the first time I saw that a movie called PROMETHEUS, a prequel of ALIEN, my favorite movie and franchise of all time since the age of 11, was to be made by a great great director such as Ridley Scott I was looking forward to watching the movie with religious yearning!!

And the time finally came...The movie begins and I see the movie title appear on the screen with the same fashion (although quite faster and not as profoundly..) as the original ALIEN... Goosebumps...""Maaan, I hope I am in for the ride of my life!"", I thought to myself.... OOOHHH MY GOD WHAT A HUGE DISAPPOINTMENT!!!!!!!!!! (Honestly, the speed that Prometheus was revealed came as kind of a warning to me that something wouldn't be quite right about this movie.....) and then came the music....

Almost every aspect of the movie was the closest thing to crap. My personal biggest disappointment was the music... never have I heard a worst score in my life especially for a movie that heavily depends on the music to contribute to the weary atmosphere.... and just remember the EXQUISITE scores of Jerry Goldsmith for ALIEN, James Horner for ALIENS, Elliot Goldenthal For ALIEN 3.... oohhh I shiver only thinking about it.... even John Frizzell's music on ALIEN Resurrection was great comparing to this disaster!

Second disappointment, the story line..... a story line that was as we say in my country: A total and utter AHTARMAS!!! Fellow Greeks will understand and agree, I believe. A prequel of Alien, but not really...an independent story, but not really.... as you try to walk through the story line, there are so many holes in every footstep you take, that you cannot make any sense characters that were supposed to be scientists but not really interested in the science they came up across... everything a bit of something but not really anything... Scott borrowed from all the previous Alien movies and ended up with absolutely nothing!! The actors had nothing to work with... nothing... even Michael Fassbender's character, the most interesting one acting-wise, was so clinical and sterilized to the point of having no point!

And last but not least...the actual design of the aliens..... If Alien Resurrection was stigmatized cause of the silly hybrid, then Prometheus spits on all alien designs and takes its rightful place, both in design, presentation and material, as the VERY WORST EVER!!!!!!!

I will close my notes with Ash's final words to ""aspiring"" Prometheus as compared to ALIEN:

"" You still don't understand what you're dealing with, do you? The perfect organism. Its structural perfection is matched only by its hostility. I admire its purity. A survivor  unclouded by conscience, remorse, or delusions of morality. I can't lie to you about your chances, but  you have my sympathies. (he smiles)""","1"
"pemiteo","Almost a complete waste of time","22 July 2013","While the average rating made me think this could be an enjoyable movie I ended up completely disappointed. Another SciFi big flop... Terrible dialogues and the useless script were not overcome by the nice imagery or the presence of Charlize Theron in her tight spacesuit.

I am not sure I understand why producers in Hollywod seem to believe that all a SciFi movies needs are only some cool visual effects - and nothing else - to become a success. What about some intelligent dialogue lines between the characters? What about a plot that would have some ""substance"" in it? Come'on people read some Frank Herbert or Orson Scott Card before you even decide to start a project like this. Understand what kind of stories make the SciFi fans tick. What kind of characters we like.

I really hope the likes of Hollywood will not make a mock of Ender's Game just like they did with the Alien series by releasing this good for nothing Prometheus movie.

I've seen all of the Predator movies - all of the Alien movies. They are ALL 1000x better than this excuse to play on their names and plots. Oh - a plot? There was a buildup to what could have been a ""plot"" but ultimately - there is NONE! We don't know what led them to this planet - who the characters are (we aren't invested in any of the characters - know little to no back story) - what the point is (except for a couple of thinnest blah blah at the end) - how an android knows so much (would that we did). Geologists (an intelligent, well-educated population)should be TOTALLY insulted - as you will see. Overall - guys seem to like the action - the props and special effects were there to make a good movie - too bad there wasn't a screen play with a story that made a good movie. Surely someone should have known not to have wasted their $ making this movie until there actually WAS a story. You should save your $ - wait to watch Prometheus on NetFlix (when it's free)!","2"
"jizzman99","Love Alien? Don't watch this film","11 June 2012","I just saw this film last night and the travesty is still fresh in my mind. First up, every negative review on IMDb is 100% accurate. I wont therefore reiterate what has already been said, and said well, by many distressed fans of the original Alien film.

I didn't read anything about the movie before going in. I didn't even know it was a prequel to the Alien film. I thought I'd surprise myself for a change. I found myself laughing at a movie that had less scientific integrity than Star Trek and soon realised the target audience age was probably somewhere between 12-20. All the way through I kept thinking what a shameless rehashing of Alien film concepts this was and that Ridley Scott must be hard up for some cash. Worse was that some primary elements of the story reminded me of other films (i.e Stanley Kubrick's 2001). Then, it happened. Towards the end of the film it became obvious with out any doubt that it was a prequel to Alien. My laughter turned to crying and I realised something cherished in my life had just been taken away from me.

This is a story that should never have been told. The origins of the derelict ship, the 'Space Jockey' (or Engineer as it's now known), and more importantly the Alien creature, was part of the mystery of Alien and gave the film its soul. I watch Alien at least once a year and enjoy not knowing - it's a critical ingredient to the story. Our imagination is left to run wild at the possibilities.

The last time I had a gut reaction like this was when Star Wars episode I revealed what the 'Force' was. Great. I really needed to know that. And I'm sure many of us of a certain vintage remember the horror of Highlander II unfolding and the attempt at a back-story that couldn't possibly work no matter how hard we all tried (and I was about 15 then). And these films are hardly in the same genre. What conceited, arrogant writer thinks they can possibly pull of such a task?

And that's another good point I haven't seen mentioned yet: the back-story doesn't work. Take a look at the Space Jockey in Alien and you'll see it is much larger and doesn't look at all human (go and google it). Its sternum connects to its forehead! And would the Alien creature/'Space Jockey' back-story, if it had to be told, likely to have involved humans? I don't think so.

They had no right to make this movie. They had no right to tread on what is sacred ground for those of us that admire Alien.

I'm very surprised at Ridley Scott.","1"
"robert-383-208198","A Great and Unexpected Prequel to Alien","30 May 2012","Having attended one of the first showings of Alien in 1979 in Los Angeles, it was with much anticipation that over 30 years later I was able to see a special early showing of Prometheus in 3D in Geneva, Switzerland.

If you are a sci-fi fan, you'll love it. In sum, it's a great prequel and beautifully shot. It slots into the original Alien in a way I would have never imagined and ends with the possibility of a new spin-off to the Alien series (who makes only a minor appearance here).

The opening shots of Ridley Scott's ideas of how genesis took place on earth are beautiful if not poetic. And throughout the film, you can only gasp 'wow' at the fantastic big scale special effects and nature shots.

Once the film arrives on the planet and they start to explore the ruins where our 'makers' potentially come from, it pretty much keeps you on the edge of your seat (and off for a few 'jolt' scenes) for the rest of the film. The normal slimy creatures do their effect well and the standard expendable cast members meet their demise in a sufficiently nasty way.

The mostly UK cast does a pretty good job but you don't seem to really connect with the characters (except oddly the robot, Michael Fassbender, who does a fine Peter O'Toole in Lawrence of Arabia type persona). At times, you feel that parts of the film have been cut out as characters make odd transitions (like Logan Marshall-Green suddenly hitting the bottle) and new characters appear out of nowhere (ah, they were on the ship too?). Charlize Theron looks good but posed and you never really warm to her.

One has a sense that the film could have been another one half to an hour longer and perhaps they'll be a longer 'Directors Cut' that will help in some of the transitions and those who want to feast more on the wonderful special effects.

A nerve wracking but great 2 hours and worth every penny for entertainment value.","8"
"grantss","Entertaining","13 February 2016","Good, but not great. Good action and special effects, and broad plot. However, the finer details of the plot contain many holes, which erode the plausibility of the story. Ultimately, the movie degenerates into twists-from-nowhere and action for the sake of action. A tighter, less twisty, plot would have made this a great movie.

Also, the deliberate attempt in the movie to link this to Alien, so it could be billed as a prequel to Alien, was silly. (Yes, I know Ridley Scott directed Alien too). The movie doesn't have to exist as a prequel to Alien - it is fine as standalone movie.

Good performance from Noomi Rapace in the lead role. Charlize Theron is surprisingly unconvincing in her role - maybe she just had the worst dialogue, or was involved in some of the sillier plot holes or random jumps.

Disappointing, but entertaining enough.","6"

I saw this on cable the other night and tried to find something to like about it. It wasn't happening. The plot sucked, the acting sucked. In fact, the acting was annoying if that is possible. Without giving it away, the movie just had stupidity all through it. When you watch it you will see. Charlize Theron seemed like this was her first acting gig. I like her too but this was weak for her. The hype this movie got and the delivery you get from it is disappointing. This same night I watched the Total Recall remake on Starz network and liked that better, and that movie wasn't that good. Good luck all you viewers. This is going to be a total let down.","2"

I found this movie to be a very pleasant surprise, it's an edge of your seat, nail biting action packed sci-fi thriller that has the story, acting, direction, and special effects to make this a top notch entertaining sci-fi film. There are several reviews on this site that you can sift through, but I'll just cut to the chase, this is an excellent movie well worth owning and watching. While there may be many unanswered questions with this movie, I'm hopeful that a sequel is in the offing.","10"
"darkness_is_your_ally","Don't pay attention to the critics!","5 June 2012","Why the negativity on this film, it is absolutely crazy (although people might think I am for this review), but when I saw this movie this morning in my local cinema, in 2D(why even bother with 3D, you know it's a gimmick), I thought it was brilliant, entertaining and great action summer flick that highly recommend. What this film offered was stunning visual effects, great performances from Fassbender, Rapace and possibly Therone (I beg to differ on others opinions), and a great starting story for what should become a trilogy, to build up the franchise and really start to show how the events of Alien(1979) came from this team of scientists looking for the origins of mankind. Now before going any further, this film does have some flaws, some which did confuse me, but after researching possible theories, it seems to make more sense than I realised at that given time; some might complain at this but check out the sixth sense and fight club if you want to talk about films you need to watch again to really grasp everything properly. My real opinion on why I though this was a great film was the events that take place, although some consider a messy plot-line, there wasn't a single moment in the film where I thought nothing important is happening here, skip ahead already, (unlike in my opinion the original alien where not a lot happens for the first 20 mins) and it grips you and makes you think what's going to happen next. The ending wasn't as good as the rest of the movie had built it up to be, but it leaves it open to sequels, which is where we can find out more about what really happened and why some of the scenes were needed for Prometheus. Overall apart from the odd plot holes and wining fan boys that say it isn't alien, which it is not, and by the trailers clearly shows it's not set out to be; we are given a stunning show of what can be done when a series franchise needs a prequel/s, unlike star wars, and how much it keeps you wandering, even after the film, about little details really makes this a decent prequel that alien deserves (even if it's not as direct as it seems, but hey-ho we shall wait for the sequel). Great film, I highly recommend it, and just an over all good watch even if you are not familiar with the rest of the series.

"azathothpwiggins","Full Circle...","27 July 2022","Much has already been written about Director Ridley Scott's PROMETHEUS. Many who detest it see it as dull, talky, and lacking enough action or ties to the original monster. Those who love it see it as a ""thinking person's science fiction film"", with a tremendous story full of suspense, excellent characters, and astonishing visuals.

Personally, I fall somewhere in between these views. Scott's movie is actually far better than it might have been if studio ""geniuses"" had gotten their way. As it stands, my only real complaint lies in its length. At just over two hours it feels rushed, and another 45-60 minutes would have enabled the story to unfold without seeming to be in such a hurry to get to the climax. Some tales need time to be told, and this is one of them.

From the moment the crew lands on the mysterious orb, the pace of this movie quickens. Scott allowed the original ALIEN to take its sweet time, and Cameron's ALIENS, for all of its explosiveness, had a nice, slow buildup. Is PROMETHEUS ruined by its speedy delivery? No, it just would have benefitted greatly from a slower pace and a longer running time.

Still, in spite of this, PROMETHEUS is a very good, modern science fiction film. Noomi Rapace is a solid female lead, the story is intriguing, and, yes, the CGI is used sparingly, and only when practical effects wouldn't work. There's also a thick atmosphere of dread that aligns with the horror aspects of the first ALIEN. This movie can be viewed as either a prequel or as a standalone film...",NA
"paulcf-510-910462","A trillion dollar science fiction train wreck!","23 October 2012","OMG! What happened here? Was Ridley Scott on vacation? The master of SF's reinvention came up with this lackluster film? Tons of inaccuracies (noisy engines in space!) and story disconnects to abnormal actions (maybe they already were all infected?).

I had high hopes in the first few minutes but I lost it soon after when these so called 'scientists' were basing a trillion dollars expedition on some cave paintings done thousands of years ago. Must have conveniently forgotten that the stars have all moved quite a bit since they were painted/drawn in the caves.

Then I started laughing out loud when they find an alien head and immediately bring it on board the ship...why? And on what basis do they decide to inject it with electricity? Is this a frigging' frog that they want to make jump? POP goes the microwave experiment! Oh I am sure you can find your own aberrations of logic and intelligence based on grade 9 science.

So who exactly is voting this movie up to a 7 anyways? I can only cough up a measly 4 and I'm being generous.

As I said, watch it as if you were there...would you do all that nonsense? And when Dr. Shaw takes off into the wild unknown, I am wondering how far she will get before she starts to get very hungry and discovers that there's no fast food or sandwiches on board the alien ship she has absconded with. Oh yes, what about a shower and a bathroom? When you undertake to spend millions of dollars of your investors money to make a movie, I would have thought that just one of the money people would have a teenager who would review it and point out all the bad stuff, otherwise I am going to go into the movie making business and surely they will buy anything?","4"
"Al_The_Strange","Fire from the Gods","7 June 2012","Expectations for Ridley Scott's return to the universe he established in ""Alien"" have been high, to say the least. So bloody high that the film falls short for lots of people. While I suspect that most viewers went into this movie expecting a deep, mind-blowing cinematic masterpiece, I went in wanting nothing more than a solid piece of science fiction. I didn't want my mind blown, I didn't expect the film's quality to surpass ""Alien"" at all, and I didn't even expect the film to move all that fast.

In spite of that, the film met my expectations. The film is gorgeous throughout, sporting impressive visual effects and camera-work. Its far better paced than I expected; I find ""Prometheus"" way more eventful than ""Alien"" (even though the two films were originally meant to be separate and distinct, it's too hard not to compare the two). There are some gnarly, disgusting, and agonizing scenes of creature horror. There's even a nice bit of action and peril towards the end. With a sense of mystery in the first half and a ton of crazy horror in the last act, the film is pretty darn thrilling. If there's any drag, it'd be in the middle, after the initial discoveries, and before all heck breaks lose.

The story for this has some interesting ambition (although its achievement will be questionable by some). The nature of the story prompts frequent theological discussion, but it never really states anything conclusive. The plot for this mirrors ""Alien"" quite a bit, hitting up a lot of the same plot points. What makes ""Prometheus"" more engaging is that it's not just a straightforward man-vs-alien struggle; it's fueled by curiosity and the need to solve the universe's deepest mysteries. The film manages to bring up a lot of strange, interesting, and mysterious things as it goes on, and never fully answers everything. This will leave many to claim that the film is shallow, pretentious, or just plain stupid. Others may be confused and frustrated. Personally, I found myself wishing for more answers, but ultimately arrived to my own conclusions (I'm not even sure if a sequel is really warranted, but if it brings more answers, then I think we'd all welcome it). As far as ""Prometheus"" being an ""Alien"" prequel: the connections between the two films were very slight, up until the very last shot, which was likely tacked-on to please the fans and provide more sequel bait. And as far as characters go, they met my expectations. It's not like ""Alien"" had really grand depth in their characters, so ""Prometheus"" pretty much provides more of the same.

The film is quite slick. I loved the photography and imagery. Acting is swell; I thought Michael Fassbender was perfect; I generally enjoyed Noomi Rapace's performance; Charlize Theron's character was not particularly likable, but was still interesting; everybody else fulfilled their roles just fine and dandy. Writing seems to be the culprit of the film's issues; the dialogue is not very sophisticated (even though it is lively and amusing enough), and the plot overall could have used some refinement. This production does have wonderful-looking sets, props, costumes, and special effects. It is especially interesting to see a lot more influences by HR Giger (including one of his rejected designs for ""Dune""). Music is pretty elegant at times.

""Alien"" was released thirty-three years ago with mixed reviews, but is now regarded as a masterpiece. ""Blade Runner"" received a mixed reception on its release thirty years ago. Now ""Prometheus"" is outwith mixed reviews. Time will tell whether or not Ridley Scott's latest film will be revered in the same light as his older works. As it is now, I can only recommend it as a rental when the disc comes out.

I am trying to think of something good to say about it, but all I can come up with is this: after 2 hours it finally ended. Charlize Theron served no purpose in this film.

"robybaggio18","A perfect example of modern brain-dead cinema","6 June 2012","First of all, let me explain why I give these 2 stars in the first place - because of Fassbender. I think his presence and performance on screen (in some way) save at least one fraction of this very bad movie. Without him this movie is a clear zero, no questions asked.

This movie's budget is about 150-200 million dollars. 150-200 million. With that kind of money you can run a small city for a whole year. To waste it on this crap is an insult to human kind, especially in this time of financial crisis and austerity. This is nothing more than a very expensive mousetrap designed to squeeze money out of young audience. Why? Because young audience is caught with expensive, but not very complicated bait - CGI and advertising. After all, if you look at it from a financial perspective, why make a smart movie in the first place? 90% of target audience will not care, the smart ones who avoid the movie can't hurt the ticket sales that much. Play it safe, dumb and beautiful. It always works, you can't miss with that. I remember the Playboy interview with Jerry Bruckheimer a few years back when he was very honest about all this - they make movies for idiots because they see lots of idiots out there. It is not art, it is a product which needs to be sold to millions of viewers worldwide, preferably many times again. OK, I'm not dumb, this was always true about Hollywood, but somehow there was more intelligence in older blockbuster movies. Those movies produced stars, produced memorable quotes, there is some sort of legacy behind them.

Most of all I am disappointed with actors. I have watched the movie 3 days ago and I can't remember what the leading actress looks like (Noomi Rapace or whatever). Such a poor attempt to make the equivalent of Sigourney Weaver as Ripley, such a poor character to begin with, was Ridley Scott on drugs when he made this? Some ridiculous plot where we have a fragile scientist who doesn't really believe in science, she chooses to believe whatever she wants depending on circumstances? Nonsense, complete nonsense. Everything, from beginning to end.

I don't know what is waiting for us in 10 or 20 years time, I'm not optimistic. But if it does get any better maybe I will be able to say that this was THE low-point. I hope for that, because otherwise there is no point in going to cinema anymore. I'll stick with books for a while, usually there is no industry behind it.","2"
"paskamaha","21st Century Letdown","2 June 2012","I was - like any half decent scifi/Alien series nerd - expecting this film for quite some time. I could be described as the person who camps in front of the cinema, just to get a ticket. I mean, I am too old for that exactly, BUT also fanatic enough to be 'that weirdo'. I kind of am. Really now.

I did not want to study the subject too much; not read many reviews, not rerun all those trailers... yeah, I did not, but I still did go back to the trailers/teasers, because this was going to be a Big Event for me.

Now, to any old school Alien/Aliens/Alien III/hate Alien whatever the 4th was called (apart from Winona, hi) - if I was ME, I would stop reading this now. OK, so you don't? I know you will go see the film, regardless. And 99% of you will be bitter and angry after wasting 10+ /$ on this piece of heartless, soulless garbage.

Because that's all it really is. There is no magic.

Yes, we get to see a mediocre space soap that has as much depth as The Vampire Diaries. Millions of dollars worth of COOL FX's. And... seriously, what? There is nothing to fall in love with, or even feel remotely connected with. There is absolutely ZERO charisma. I don't even remember the name of the captain. And he was GOOD.

In a funny and self-knee-shooting way Michael Fassbender's role as the android David... just falls down as the most lovable and interesting off the whole piece.

As I am a decent human being, I have already saved you from the so called ""plot"". I will continue doing so, and just add a spoiler here: THERE IS NO PLOT. Uninteresting humans (what's his name, Noomi Rapace's ""husband"", who the f*** hired him?) find traces to go to space - cut - to find what turns out to be an ""invitation"" to go there - cut - VERY impressive looking set design - cut - B movie slapstick with obvious cannon fodder characters - cut - alien life forms - evil looms - cut - danger - cut - FX/fight/gimmicks (no spoilers, I promised) - cut - THE END.

The cuts do not serve any purpose apart from taking the saga closer to its ending. In between the cuts Charlize Theron looks cold. And the wrinkled old Weyland man is about as sinister as a puppy.

It is, in a nutshell, a feast for the eyes and starvation for the brain.

The plot is so ill-thought through, so dumb, so full of plot holes it begger's belief. The opening is spectacular but ultimately makes no sense. But before we figure that out we are introduced to the crew of Prometheus who are awoken from stasis. The engineer with the tats? Who would employ him? WHO?!?! Or the rest of them come to that? It's a trillion dollar mission and this bunch of losers are the best they can get??? And from the get-go you know the film is going to be a pile but you sit through it, hoping in vain...

Countless reviewers have listed it's faults and foibles. I can only agree. It's a senseless mess. An insult to the intelligence and Ridley Scott should be ashamed.

"jaredcbrooks","Ridley Scot's Phantom Menace","9 July 2013","Truly the worst movie to disgrace the silver screen in recent years, Prometheus will leave you with a profound sense of confusion and emptiness that is hard to rival.

Many were unaware that this movie was intended to be the prequel to the movie Alien that spawned three sequels and a plethora of other forms of media (namely graphic novels). Those viewers were the lucky ones.

Aside from butchering his own history, the movie itself has no merits to stand on. Otherwise accomplished actors flounder as they attempt to portray characters with as much depth as a thimble and the murkiest motivation imaginable.

Between supposedly educated scientists acting like horny teenagers from an 80's slasher flick, an android with poorly defined abilities reminiscent of Data (Star Trek the Next Generation), and the most forced plot ""twists"" in recent memory, the audience is left with nothing but a deep sense of dread that Ridley Scot has been attending private tutor sessions with George Lucas.","1"
"quinnox-1","What a letdown","8 June 2012","Prometheus is a highly anticipated movie, and many were looking forward to it, expecting a sumptuous steak, and instead it turns out to be no better than a common fast food hamburger.

The plot starts out slow, and makes little sense, to the point of it being confusing understanding what is going on. This feeling is pervasive throughout the movie, with an incoherent plot, and it never makes much sense. When the real ""villain"" pulling the strings is revealed, its almost laughable. Some no-name actors in the major roles don't help matters. Michael Fassbender is the exception, and tries his best, but even he seems to make little impression as an enigmatic android. He is given too little to work with, it wasn't his fault.

The only really good element in the movie is the scenery, which is visionary and occasionally awe-inspiring, with desolate and rocky vistas on an unknown planet, its quite well done. The advanced futuristic tech is pretty interesting as well, with cool gadgets and neat ideas about how the technology might be in the future.

Everything else besides this is disappointing, and its a shame they couldn't have made the story and characters live up to the mysterious far away planet vistas and the distant lonely space atmosphere they created.","5"

The primary concept: big aliens seeded earth with DNA which was the precursor to life forming. We have a lead on where they came from. Let's go speak to them.

The asinine small mistakes:

1. Major characters apparently haven't met each other before emerging from the deep freeze minutes before landing on the planet. 2. Sending scientific mercenaries on a mission most every other field- leaders would kill to go on for free. 3. Biologists (exo-biologists?) taking helmets off 20 minutes into the mission on a hunch. 4. Archaeologists suddenly becoming pathologists. 5. Mummified heads exploding. 6. Geological mapping specialists getting lost within 20 minutes of being left alone. 7. ad infinitum....

The final stupidity to add insult to injury is the character running from a rolling tube. In a straight line. It's almost tom & jerry-esque. The self surgery comes a close second...

How on earth did all of these idiotic decisions get made on the same movie? Why didn't someone call a spade a spade and fix each and every one of these issues?

Switch off after the first 10 minutes (just before the dream watching sequence) and make the rest up. Your prometheus is now better than mine.","2"
"Laakbaar","Enjoyable, fast paced, visually beautiful","3 June 2012","I enjoyed the movie and recommend it to anyone interested in the Alien movies. It is just visually beautiful, particularly the scenes of space, the primordial earth and the alien world. The special effects are also impressive. The futuristic human and alien technology depicted is fascinating.

This movie transports us 80 years into the future, when space travel, human-like robotics, anti-gravity devices and automatic medical operation chambers are a reality.

Charlie and Elizabeth are two latter-day Erich von Danikens who have convinced Peter Weyland, trillionaire, of their theory that aliens not only have visited the earth but planted the genetic seed for mankind and then returned many times to explain this to later civilizations who integrated this revelation into their cultures. These scientists have even deduced the planet where these aliens came from.

Weyland is convinced this theory is true. (And indeed it is. We are shown it at the start of the film.) He mounts a space mission to this far-away system. He puts ice-queen Meredith in charge. It takes years for the ship to reach this planet, the crew in suspended animation during most of the voyage. They are under the care of David, an enigmatic life-like robot both fascinated and repelled by his human creators.

When they get there, they find evidence of intelligent design in the form of ancient hollow structures filled with corridors. After further exploration the aliens (called the Engineers) are revealed to them. They have left behind still-functioning chambers filled with strange urns and devices. Holographic recordings of the aliens are operating. Their bodies are preserved, even after 2,000 years. And finally they find a life-support pod with a live alien -- the very thing the scientists and Weyland were hoping to find. The alien is revived...

During all this, we see that David and Meredith have agendas of their own. And we see that Weyland himself is still alive and on board. David has enough knowledge to deftly use some of the alien technology -- for unknown reasons -- to infect Charlie, knowing that Charlie would impregnate Elizabeth and knowing she might give birth to an alien creature. She doesn't though -- she is able to have the thing medically extricated from her. It is not killed however. At the same time we see that there are also living creatures in the alien structure. They attack two of the crew, one of which is used as a host to wreak havoc on the ship.

I went into this movie with high expectations. From the trailers the movie seemed to be original and epic in the way that Avatar was. I was not aware that this would be an Alien movie. I enjoyed the Alien movies because of their gritty science-fiction realism, but I was disappointed that this turned out to be another movie in that franchise. This movie should have been marketed as an Alien movie.

Normally I can suspend disbelief quite readily in an entertaining movie. However I had problems this time around.

The rationale behind mounting such a huge, expensive space exploration operation was not sufficiently explained. For something like this to happen, wouldn't all of humanity have been aware of it and the reason for it? And yet even the crew apparently didn't know all the details.

Why would Weyland spend so much to mount a mission of this kind and then select a ragtag group of people to crew it, especially an unstable person like Fifield? It seemed so pointless. These are people that a fast-food restaurant wouldn't hire. They engage in behaviour that co-workers at an ordinary office would never do.

I know what happened: in the earlier Alien movies one of the interesting themes was ""Marines in space"". Marines are edgy people, but this was a scientific mission. It was annoying to see Fifield on board. What you would want are the solid people you find on a NASA mission.

The people on this mission were so...clueless. They didn't seem to know each other. It didn't make sense that everything had to be explained to them when they woke up. And that they disagreed with each other about aspects of the mission (eg whether to bring weapons with them). Surely there would have been massive preparations and long training sessions before launching a trillion-dollar spaceship?? The intent was for these odd characters to make the movie more interesting, but it went too far.

It was groan-worthy that they allowed themselves so freely to touch, and be contaminated by, this alien world. Not just once, but many times. The viewer of course is fully aware of the dangers, so it is implausible that these space explorers wouldn't have been. A flaw that screamed at the moviegoer, even sympathetic ones.

When the mission of the Engineers became clear to Elizabeth, it just didn't seem, well, right. How did she draw that conclusion from what we had seen? And it seemed implausible that the crew would sacrifice themselves because of a few words shouted at them.

Michael Fassbender's portrayal of David was astonishing. This ubiquitous actor's range is apparently limitless.

Elizabeth and Charlie were too young and didn't come across as scientists. However, Rapace delivered a great performance as a tough survivor. I look forward to seeing Elizabeth and David in a sequel.

Why did they use a young actor to play Weyland? Guy Ritchie was fine, but it was clear that this is a young man in old-guy makeup. Why didn't they just find an old actor? I suppose there must have been a reason for it.

Theron (another great actress) played her character well, but the character's role in the movie was not dramatically effective. It's realistic to have someone like her on board though.

One final comment: It's a good movie, a beautiful movie, an enigmatic movie, but not an original one.","8"
"watcher52","Technical effects--8, Story and characters--0","16 June 2012","As a former Ridley Scott fan and a film reviewer with nearly thirty years of experience, this pathetic attempt to pander to the dumb-and-dumber contemporary film audience was simply appalling. As I watched, I was either stunned by the fateful attempts to create faux drama or driven to breakout laughter when chunks of dozens of old science-fiction classic films or scenes were cynically and mockishly linked together with bubble gum--for a bubble-gum viewer.

Amazingly, in this production we get random pieces of everything Ridley Scott ever directed or wished he'd directed (including the line, ""He cut me off!"" from ""Top Gun""), as well as direct knock-offs from ""Star Wars"" and ""Star Trek."" (God, please-- ""I'm your father, Luke""!!) These woeful derivatives actually encompass ""Contact,"" ""Little Big Man"" and even ""The X Files"" (with that ol' black magic oil).

Even the ""characters"" are nearly all knock-offs. Several reviews have praised Fassbender; but he's merely trying to live up to the original cyborg from 1979, played by the great Ian Holm. All of these rather pristine primary elements have been tossed into the film marketer's blender and whipped into a witless, terrible glue. This is Hollywood techno-garbage entirely without shame, with no concern for the integrity of coherent plot or story or mythic narrative or character or anything necessary and decent. Yet in the theatre where I saw the film, it was fairly clear that virtually no one had any clear notion regarding what was actually occurring on screen.

I used to teach a course at Virginia Tech entitled ""Religion and Science Fiction."" At the time, there was nothing in existence like this in film that so tortured everything that great SF represents, even the older B films. When you get to select among ""2001"" or ""Alien"" or many other fine or interesting features for screening...and then barely manage to sit through this nonsense (which has only a marginal relationship with the mythic Greek Prometheus--except in the Romantic tradition), you know you're in a different cosmos.

Along with the recent ""The Cabin in the Woods,"" this is one of the WORST 10 or 20 films I've ever seen. Every actor in this work should be ashamed of himself or herself, especially Theron and Pearce. In today's world of film making, actual integrity and the pursuit of high-quality story (and its production) are becoming increasingly marginal. Thanks to the advancing failure of our higher educational system, the average viewer can now be anesthetized with nothing more than technical fireworks.

Where is the next ""Schindler's List"" or ""Momento"" or ""Good Will Hunting"" or ""The Departed"" or ""The Matrix""? There are so many great SF writers whose fiction remains unexplored, like Ursula K. Le Guin.","1"
"strong-122-478885","Is This Ridley Scott's Homage To Ed Wood?","18 October 2014","Here's an ideal double-bill - Prometheus and Plan 9 From Outer Space.

After viewing the inept Prometheus I can now see how much in common Ridley Scott has with Ed Wood.

But, the thing is, when it comes to ""Plan 9"", I consider it to be so bad that it's actually good. (Well, almost) - But, on the other hand, with Prometheus - I consider it to be so bad that (judging by its director, its budget, its cast) it's actually frickin' awful.

Believe me, this film really peed me off. I think that director Ridley Scott deserves to have his ass kicked, but good, for this misfired dud. This piece of certified rubbish, whose story explains nothing, hardly had enough intelligence in it to even come close to passing itself off as a satisfying prequel/sequel/whatever to 1979's Alien.

If, 35 years later, this was the best that Scott could come up with as a continuation of the Alien story, then this is the sort of tale that should've just been left well enough alone.

This film was clearly nothing but a blatant cash-grab for Scott. And, of course, while Scott was greedily grabbing at all that cash (millions & millions, I'm sure) he was also farting right in our faces and laughing behind our backs (all the way to the bank) all at the same time.

Here are 4 of my biggest beefs regarding Prometheus -

1 - The entire crew on this dazzling spacecraft all looked to me like a bunch of skid-row derelicts, or something to that effect. You could never, ever convince me in a million light-years that these dislikable freaks were supposed to be brilliant scientists, and such. No way, Jose. I mean, they even talked like clueless morons.

2 - The whole business with the Elizabeth Shaw character and her self-induced cesarean abortion - Now, that really took the cake. With her belly neatly stapled back together this woman immediately started running around and doing all sorts of amazing stunts that would have surely caused the stitching to tear open, but, no, not for the astonishing Elizabeth. She just kept on going and going and going (with an occasional wince) until she made me sick just to look at her.

3 - Then there was the totally anorexic-looking ice-queen (""This is my ship!""), Meredith Vickers (played by Charlize Theron) with hair so frickin' straight and flat that I was tres' pleased when she so stupidly got herself bulldozed under by a crashing spaceship.

4 - And, last, but not least, there was that mincing, little nothing-of-an-actor Michael Fassbender as the condescending and decidedly queer (Aw-shucks! Ain't he cute?) android, David. Sheesh! Why do so many people think this guy is such a great actor? I think he's positively terrible. He couldn't act his way out of a used condom.

*Special note* - According to Greek Mythology - Prometheus was a Titan who stole fire from Olympus and gave it to humankind. For this Zeus chained him to a rock and sent an eagle to eat his liver, which grew back daily. (Hmm.... Nice)","4"
"blackflame-3","This was a good movie","11 September 2012","I was a little stunned at some of the other reviews to be honest.

The film is not that bad at all, not as bad as some are making it out to be. I am not a religious follower of the Alien films, in fact, never much liked them to be honest.

However, I thought this film was good. The story was just right, too many films these days rely on high action scenes which seem to almost dominate movies. I thought there was a good focus on the story itself. Not to mention, the CGI was pretty amazing.

I would certainly like to see a second movie on from this.

And just to add, also amazed at how serious and literal some people are. It is a FILM for goodness sake. Are we really saying all films need to be accurate or plausible? Seriously? I couldn't give two hoots about how in reality something could never happen etc, or whether someone stumbled around half cut open for too long. I don't care now and didn't care in other films like DOOM.

This was actually a really good movie and I recommend it.","8"
"deadbull-95171","Brilliant cinematography meets 1954 Flash Gordon science.","2 September 2022","And so what? Though the majority appear to attack this master's piece because precise current scientific knowledge and theories are often ignored in favor of effect, there is no way this diminishes what this movie's about.

This is science FICTION. Sometimes this category is spot on in terms of physics, and sometimes even predictive of stuff in the reality pipeline, and who goes to movies for exact depictions of reality anyway? Do Monkeys get as King Kong?, and I won't bother listing the other ""transgressions"" that are some of the most successful and justifiably famous productions that have come into being since the beginning of what we call art.

Art may be grounded in reality, which changes on a daily basis as human understanding changes, or completely ignore the vulgate understanding and go with an interior reality.

The first Alien was wonderful, largely because of the casting and the character development. The science was paired down and somewhat more consistent with known physics, but the essence of that film was horror/suspense, not science.

This is an almost casual throw away exercise by a true master of the medium. The composition and cinematography is as clean and deft and pretty as it gets. The inconsistencies with the rigors of modern knowledge are subordinate to the story line, which is largely a continuation of Kubrick's 2001: Our origins.

If you look at early Polanski movies like The Tenant. Or Rosemary's Baby, then compare it to the easy virtuosic filmmaking of The Ninth Gate, there is no comparison in terms of the quality of film making itself. The director has learned a vast amount in 40 years. This is not to say the later work is better or worse, evaluated through different subjective filters.....

Likewise, Scott's easy command of movie- making is overwhelmingly presented here. It's a pleasure to watch this kind of prodigy in action.

And, it happens to be a good story, albeit told sometimes with science fiction physics from 1950 TV shows. Do you suppose a guy as gifted as Scott was unaware of these ""inconsistencies"" with modern contemporary understandings? Of course not. The directorial decision was to emphasize his story line with it's abstracted suggestions.

It's something like John Carpenters work but far more sophisticated with a budget that allows that, which is no put-down of Carpenter's great work. But do the inconsistencies of Escape from New York, .or The Thing damage the overall great parts of those films?

I'm spending more words here defending the basis of attack on this underappreciated film. So, focusing on the plus side, the shots are beautifully conceived and shot, the acting is well in service of the story, which, especially as a prequel, is interesting, and the way old school notions and state of the are cinematography merge, gives the movie charm, more then diminish it.

Though it by necessity references Alien and its spin-offs, it is its own movie, hanging on it's own hook, takes creative chances and succeeds at them, and is very impressive in its sheer demonstration of the enormous growth in the skill of Scott to make a beautiful looking movie.","9"
"mraz-zoltan","Unintelligent","5 June 2012","I saw Prometheus on Friday with my girlfriend who was really waiting for it. Ihad my doubts and unfortunately now we both agree I was right. Prometheus is a bad and stupid movie. Still I waited a couple of days to think it over and read other opinions. It seems we are not only disappointed ones here.

Ridley Scott is (or was) a great director, who directed at least cinema classics, but it seems he doesn't really know what makes a good screenplay. He made great movies... when the script was good. So, for me it all came down whether the script was good.

It was not. I had to join those who agree that the visuals and 3D were above average and that's all the good thing we can say about this movie. And it is because of the script.

Many critics praise Prometheus as an intelligent sci-fi, and say that those who don't like it simply don't understand it. Well, I think an intelligent sci-fi story (as a matter of fact every story) must be LOGICAL. I'd like to point out a few problem with the logic of Prometheus.

Remember the trailer when they talk about ancient separate civilisation? In the movie they name them among the usual ones(Egyptian, Mayan) they mention Sumer, Akkad and Mezopotamian as well. Now please check Wikipedia: it's the same civilisation with different names over a couple of hundred years (yeah I know it's a bit more complicated but we they were not separated from each other and lived on the area of modern Iraq). Is it really a sign of an intelligent story? The writers didn't have internet access? Or they just didn't care? What about those signs these civilizations left for us? An image of a solar system? A star constellation? According to what the story suggest we were created by the Space Jockeys and that image is their guide for us. How? Human evolution took hundreds of thousands years. How could an Egyptian scribe draw that image if the whole thing happened hundreds of millenia before his time? To make things worse stars and our galaxy itself moves, which means that particular image cannot show us the way because the stars had moved away. Why didn't the writers think about it? Maybe they didn't have a clue, which is fine after all they are not astronomers (as matter of fact me neither and still I know these things) but please don't call this movie ""intelligent"" please.

About Prometheus being a stand alone movie without any real connection to the classic Alien and that we shouldn't compare it to Alien.

It's a sci-fi in which a group of people travel to an alien planet and find there horrific creatures. When I see a movie with the above premise I automatically compare it to Alien. It has nothing to do with whether it is an Alien movie or some other space slasher. The original Alien IS the standard here, every sci-fi/horror fan compare any new space horror to Alien.

And in the comparison Prometheus fails miserably.

SPOILER If you want to watch Prometheus chances are you are a horror fan which means you saw a lot on-screen death. Let me tell you how Charlize Theron's character dies in this ""intelligent"" and ""impressive"" movie. She dies when the alien space ship falls back to the planet and rolls over her. Yes, she's out there and sees the giant spaceship rolling towards her. She turns back and starts running. Not sideways just... from it. So I write it down again: a rolling spaceship squashes her.","1"
"blogurious","Revisiting the horror","31 May 2012","As a big fan of the very first ""Alien"" movie, the third and fourth installment brought me nothing but disappointment, regardless of Sigourney Weaver's efforts to revive the one and only Ripley.

""Prometheus"", as it should be, is a prequel to everything I always wish I could further understand: the birth of the acid bleeding monster we so much love. It's a big production that leaves nothing to be desired, from the hands of our beloved Ridley Scott. If too soon to become a classic, it should not take long to belong in that category, making me believe that, if ""Alien"" was ever destined to be a trilogy, this is it. It doesn't really start with the first movie, but actually with this one. It's sleek, subtle and most of all, has the special touch of a great director who understands his craft and the passion for the story. It's great not only for the fans, but for everyone who fell in love with the franchise a long time ago. Now it's time to experience it all over again.","8"

"masterjk2","dumb just dumb","8 April 2013","Surely it takes more than just a lot of very good special effects to make a movie. At least I think it does. This had probably the worst plot of any Sci Fi movie I've ever seen considering the amount of money wasted in making it. There wasn't one original. idea in it and they stole concepts from about every Sf movie made in the last 30 years. It starts with explorers finding a cave in Scotland in 2089, yet they look like they just stepped out of an LL Bean catalogue circa 2000. OK, move on. They have discovered wonderful hieroglyphics which point at the sky. They match others who point at the sky. From this pointing they deduce how to find the planet the aliens came from. Amazing. So a rich man funds the project and off they go. he sends a hologram in which he says he wants to help mankind and will soon be dead. Only the brain dead cannot see the plot coming... aliens found...alien secrets of life found... rich man gets eternal life. Hovering in the distance in is cold hearted daughter. They land and discover a large mound that's hollow and seem mysterious. Mysteriously, they leave their weapons at home and head out in a large craft that could hold 100 but only has 5 and trailed by two golf carts that hold four... this way they will be threatened more when the big storm comes. Hello...Ever seen Red Planet? A dead steal from that movie. They discover wonderful things and of course since everything in the world is just beautiful, don't worry about monsters or evil. Bowling pins start oozing goo, little things slither through the muck and become spitting cobras which kill and they find monster #1. Meantime they have to scurry back to the ship because a big storm is coming. One woman gets pregnant with an instant alien (think Alien movie), rips it out of herself, stitches herself up and goes back to battle. The movie title should have been Artemis. Meanwhile, David, (think HAL-2001 with a body) goes goofy. Mad wealthy man appears ON THE SHIP... big surprise. How many movies have had a wealthy man dash off into space to live forever? They all head back to Magic Mountain to find the one true alien. Like a sleeping Prince, they kiss him awake and he goes bananas... tossing them all aside and going to his giant console, like Quasimodo, playing a giant organ, bringing the ship to life. The unlucky scientists flee, trying to get off the ship. Our fierce captain tries to ram his ship into the other ship (think Independence day) and does. It goes down with all hands aboard, except the undaunted female scientist who escapes, finds another alien ship that she navigates with David, who is now bodiless, except for a head. She heads out to find the other Aliens and see if she can persuade them into helping mankind...HAHAHAHA. Of course, on board is another alien, think Alien. The sequel will feature Segorney Weaver.

"grumpy-3","pretty average and just a repeat","31 May 2012","Unlike most people i had no high expectations for the film, i am not a great fan of the first Alien movie, lots of howlers and scenes that did not make sense. The same goes here, people do stupid things to move the plot along and there are at least two maybe three completely pointless plot devices that do not add to the story or characters. Basically what you get is a great deal of walking around enormous and impressive sets and scenery, the film is a treat to look at, although Scott does nothing with the 3D potential it could have been much better. The plot is very thin with not much going on, and as for any serious philosophical theme there is none. After the first hour or so, you just want the film to finish, as really very little happens, there is an action sequence triggered off by a really bad plot device where a character assumed dead returns and is let onto the ship, by a very stupid captain. there are quite a few scenes reminiscence of Alien but not as effective. all in all a pretty underwhelming experience.

"siddharth_b","Prometheus - the great expectation","22 June 2012","Why am I happy I saw Prometheus today? Answer: 1. My brother-in-law treated me so I didn't have to pay for the ticket. 2. I had really tasty ice-creams after the movie. 3. Now that I've seen it, I won't be trying to see if a DVD rip is available...ever.

Why Prometheus sucks? I sometimes really believe that sci-fi movies are the only kind of movies one should watch. This is because sci-fi movies usually deal with the eternal questions - ones that modern science cannot answer. Question like: - Origin of man (2001 Space Odyssey) - Perceived superiority of man over all other creatures (Planet of the Apes) - End of the world (2012) - Man's obsession with control and biotechnology (Outbreak, Contagion)

just to list a few..

Out of these, the 'origin of man' is perhaps the most complex and most interesting topic. So, when you pick a topic of this magnitude, you just DON'T, I repeat you DON'T treat it lightly.

Prometheus' first ten minutes is awesome. The premise of other-worldly beings responsible for human-kind's existence should be the most important finale/punchline/climax. If this first scene was the last for a movie then that would have made a lasting impact on a viewer.

However, Prometheus decides to start the movie with this. Fast-forward >> you have the familiar team of people in space-hibernation while an android takes care of the spaceship till destination is reached. This is followed by familiar mission briefing >> followed by underground cave exploration.

Seeing the holographic images of the 'engineers' was also pretty impressive. I must say the special-effects especially the way 3D has been used (if you watch in 3D) is great. The expectation from the movie is at maximum around this moment.

This is the point after which things start going horribly horrible :). Sequence of events: Maggot spotted >> turns into large snakelike creature >> kills crew. Everything beyond this is as predictable as a Tom & Jerry cartoon where Jerry has the last laugh except that the cartoon is a lot more entertaining.

Did the makers of the movie expect the declaration of 'yes father' by the character 'Meredith Vickers' a breaking moment for the movie? I think most people would have guessed it. In any case this revelation has absolutely zero significance in the movie .. so moving on.

The 'old man' responsible for the entire mission is found to be still alive & sitting in the spaceship the whole time; maybe not predictable but it still does not have any significance in the movie since he dies soon afterwards.

The most important moment where I still had some hope was when the crew finally meets the other-worldly 'engineer' .. and then what? He (the engineer/God etc) just acts like a 'gansta' and kicks the hell out everyone. The old man dies almost instantly (maybe that's a good thing since this character slowed down a lot of scenes) followed by just one human-survivor and a robot's-head.

It's all negative from then on and the end really does not close any of the things.

There is a line where one scientist says something like 'so they(other-worldly engineers) made us (humans)' and the other says 'then who made them (other-worldly engineers)?'. Now I think this particular line has immense potential - a movie could end with such a line and we would then have a sequel. Yet again Prometheus takes this too lightly and does not explore the most important topic i.e. man's origin in the spirit it should.

The problem with Prometheus is that is sets up a huge expectation in the first ten-to-fifteen minutes BUT the main concept is birth of aliens which I believe pales in front of the question about man's own origin.

Yup - though I can watch every sequel of Aliens as many times as they air on TV, I do admit they are all brain-dead movies. So, brain-dead movies are better off NOT trying to include complex topics like the ones mentioned above. What happens when you do that? You just end up really really pissing-off the SCI/FI community.

Prometheus R.I.P.","1"
"chaos-rampant","The Desert","11 November 2012","This has been coming a long time now. To my knowledge, the earliest mention is in promotional interviews for the first Alien, with Scott explaining he would like to explore 'origins' in a possible next film. And again when he was contacted in the early stages for the third film, which he would only do if he could 'go back' to the Engineers. So, Scott had a lot of time to think about ways of messing this up, and by the time he finally secured the funds and go-ahead, enough clout as a movie man to do it his way.

His way is never really interesting. He is, like Kubrick whom he has modeled some of his best work after, someone who makes films by obsessively inch-by-inch controlling as he envisions, it never just springs - unlike Kubrick, he doesn't graft this in some bold narrative gambit. Because of this, he has made some epic but soulless films, or of artificial soul.

Alien was so powerful because it wasn't done his way. He had some control. He was as still is on occasion, a powerful cameraman. But, the fabric of the film was the product of visionaries other than whoever happened to be on studio payroll - Moebius, Giger, Foss, guys who designed in coherent damage. And he was open to the adventure of working with these guys, open to incorporate lights from a nearby rehearsal of a laser show by The Who, Texas Chainsaw in his visual arsenal -at the behest of O'Bannon- and so forth.

The result was something machine-controlled -reflected in the Mother-Ash controlled narrative- but injected with chaos from this journey of discovery. It had many kinds of logic, different walls and types of camera - wonderful stuff all-around, one of the best.

This is a failure in a number of ways. The frequent complaint is about the script, which incorporates ideas originally left out from O'Bannon's first script. The whole business with astral visitors for one, typical Von Dainiken crap. Tying this to religion in an obvious , non-intuitive way. Unimaginative 'xeno' creatures. All sorts of other things.

Mainly though, you will see why he gets it off in the replicant. He is our main anchor in the film - someone who is empty inside, so has capacity to be filled by anything he encounters.

We're shown clips of Lawrence of Arabia, which he watches on the long journey to discovery as everybody else sleeps in cryobeds, the only one awake among dreamers. Two quotes by Lawrence, both of them powerful stuff.

""There is nothing in the desert, and no man wants nothing"" is the first - the desert of existential soul-searching, which is the main narrative thrust.

""The trick is not minding that it hurts"" the second, even more resonant about the quest for answers and meaning.

The thing is, we didn't want to know about the Engineers, none of us. We only thought we did all these years, because as viewers we don't know how or why storytelling affects us deeply. We don't know that when you set us up for nothing, you rejuvenate our capacity to imagine and see unobstructed horizons. That this blank spot in the first Alien enhanced everything else.

We don't know that we incorporate this in our lives every time we surprise ourselves, by loving, by creative passion, by inexplicable inspiration. That we don't ""mind"" that these things often hurt, these intangible non-things. Deep down, that when we lose ourselves in something, this invigorates because we only lose the self that ""minds"" in the narrow limits of thought.

Scott should know. The main reason we come to see the more serious stuff is because the filmmaker knows better than we do, he can tune and play us in a new way. This closes portals, limits us as viewers.",NA
"generationofswine","An Honest Review","14 January 2019","What? Seriously...WHAT?!

I don't understand what I watched.

Alien was a monster movie in space. It was a great movie, it was scary and you could taste the tension....but it was just a monster movie in outer space. It was really just a merger of horror and science fiction.

Aliens was a fun movie. But it was just Space Marines v Monsters. It was just a merger of action and science fiction.

We can go on and on and on but, I think Scott is buying the fanboys that are reading too deeply into the Alien franchise. It's not ""The Last Temptation of Christ"" it's just the Alien movies.

Prometheus was just too much for the franchise, FAR TOO MUCH. Watching it felt like that moment when you realize that the top came off of the salt shaker and now you're going to have to just bare threw the mess bite by bite.

There was so much that, in the end, there wasn't really anything at all. Everything that was good about Alien and Aliens was totally forgotten here and you were left with, well, pretentious ramblings.

This is a monster movie that thinks it's ""Taxi Driver."" It's putting on airs and you can see straight through it.","1"
"filipemanuelneto","With a somewhat confused story, the film is worth the visual and technical spectacle, as well as the good performance of the cast.","10 October 2021","I don't want to pretend to have an audience, but I believe that if a more patient and kind reader has taken the time to read some of the notes I've written in other films, there's something I let on when I write: I don't usually read much about a film before seeing it. I follow my instincts a little and let myself be surprised or disappointed, leaving the readings for before writing these notes. That's what I did with this movie, watching it without realizing that it was a kind of prequel to the ""Alien"" franchise. I realized it later, in the final part of the movie.

The film begins with the stellar voyage of the exploration spacecraft ""Prometheus"", which sets off in search of a moon where there supposedly would be conditions for life, the home where primitive astronauts who, millennia ago, gave rise to life on Earth will have come. Of course, there are latent tensions within the crew: some believe strongly in the existence of these ""engineers"" (that's what they call the so-called ancient astronauts), others not so much, while the ship's commander seems to have a kind of agenda of her own. What will they find? It's better to see the movie...

The movie was a lot better than I expected. I'm not a fan of the ""Alien"" franchise, and I'm not the best person to judge how well it articulates with existing movies. I think the script makes good use of the ""ancient astronauts"" conspiracy theories, which were heavily publicized by TV shows dedicated to them, but I confess that there is a lot of confusion in the script, things that I just don't understand. There are somewhat disconnected, loose scenes, and moments that I couldn't understand. The direction was in the hands of Ridley Scott, who did a very satisfying job, basing the film on a mix of sci-fi with visual effects and quality CGI. Unfortunately, I think a lot of the scientific concepts used in the movie are more sci-fi fantasies than serious science.

The cast has several strong names, and almost all of them are in excellent shape and give us impeccable work. I particularly liked Noomi Rapace, Idris Elba, Michael Fassbender and Logan Green. Despite being talented and fluent in her role, I think I've seen Charlize Theron in better shape and more at ease with other characters and in other works.

Technically, the film is remarkably visual: in addition to the best CGI you could find, the film makes good use of very careful and skillful cinematography. The extraterrestrial world we are introduced to is as familiar as it is strange and unusual, and it manages to create in the audience a sense of permanent tension that becomes increasingly sinister. The visual, special and sound effects are the best there is and work well. The soundtrack is critical to the tense environment and works satisfactorily.","7"
"JoelChamp85","Great Start To New Beginnings","2 April 2021","I love the way Scott let's tension and terror play out. In combination with a killer soundtrack and stunning visuals Prometheus explores a lost world ripe with danger. I've watched this over and over again and David is one of the best characters created in sci-fi. His constant disappointment of his creators continually pushes him towards the realisation that he is beyond their limits. The Engineers look awesome and I love that they are both extremely advanced but also extremely primitive all at once. The only thing I'd change is maybe some of the cast, and maybe flesh their characters out a tiny bit more.","9"
"rrfpaf-99858","Not without flaws, but beautiful set up.","25 April 2021","Right off the bat the bare bones of this movie are one of the best I have seen. The structure is solid, the motive makes sense, The villain has an interesting agenda, and the discovery process is exciting. As I said there are some flaws. A few characters are a little stereotypical, some parts can be a little cheesy and predictable, and it's not quite as scary as you would expect an Alien movie to be. However none of those flaws were enough to quell my love this movie. I will definitely be watching again.","8"
"james-218-791197","Disappointing, without direction, nothing new or noteworthy.","27 November 2016","The original Alien film was as groundbreaking as Prometheus is mediocre.

The plot is aimless, it meanders through a series of clichéd sci-fi non-events, relying on grand visuals to get through.

I honestly had high hopes for this film. I missed it at the cinema (not my wife's kind of flick) and last night finally got round to watching it.

The cast, whilst grand in scale, talent and cost, is disappointing - with the exception of Fassbender, who once again shows his diversity. Pearce is entirely unconvincing as an elderly Weyland - who's involvement as that character is pointless unless a sequel shows a younger Weyland of course.

At the end of the film there's a minor twist (no spoiler here) but not one that makes the viewer sit up and be shocked or excited. It's entirely predictable and leaves a flat ending.

If there's a sequel, I'll not be wasting my time on it. Such a shame and missed opportunity, I expect far more from Ridley Scott.","5"
"mathom-620-240051","Huge disappointment","24 July 2012","I'm a huge alien franchise fan and I love scifi movies, especially deep space horrors, but this one ... I can't believe what I just saw and what to make of it. The CGI and 3d were amazing, but the rest: - it's boring from the beginning - it's not an alien movie, it's not a horror movie nor action movie. I can't classify it. - plot is really cheesy most parts don't make sense - shallow dialogs, unbelievable characters and actions (for eg running after surgery, removing masks and many many more) - no suspense AT ALL - the alien planet isn't even a bit scary (including alien craft)

Alien was so great because it was plain and simple. This move has ambitions to be epic and profound but finishes like a B action movie (and a bad one).

that's it - really disappointing :(","2"
"mrkevvy","Disappointing, full of bad science, unexplained events and plot holes","8 July 2012","As expected from Ridley Scott, the visual effects and sets are stunning. Unfortunately, this doesn't save Prometheus from being uncomfortably close to bad.

The science in the movie, and the actions of the ""scientists"" are terrible. As others have noted, here they are on a planet where human life supposedly originated, so there is a strong biological similarity and risk of contamination, infection and disease, and within five minutes they're (including the ""biologist"") taking their masks off and breathing the air in a dark, wet cave? Finding a possibly hostile organism and not avoiding it? Touching random brown goo without worrying about what it is? Ridiculous, contrived and it stretched believability beyond the breaking point.

A couple of things that I haven't seen mentioned yet: The ""biologist"" states that the idea that these beings created us would throw out three hundred years of ""Darwinism"". This term is used by creationists to make evolutionary biology sound like a religion or philosophy rather than a hard science with millions of pieces of evidence behind it. While it's slipped into popular lingo and used by those who might not know otherwise, a biologist would be unlikely to use it. It's evolutionary biology, thanks.

Vickers, Charlize Theron's character, appears to be second-in-command of the ship and thus intimately familiar with the distances involved. Yet she asks the captain why she would join the mission to get ""half a billion miles"" from the men of Earth. At the beginning of the movie it's indicated that their distance from Earth is in the 10^14 km magnitude (maybe 50 to 100 light years from Earth.) So, she was only off by a factor of two to four hundred thousand times. (Coincidentally, or not, this is about how far creationists are off from the age of the Earth/universe.) The science consultant must have fallen asleep during the readings. I don't blame him/her as I nodded off once myself, and my wife twice.

You can attempt to rationalize some of these (such as the carbon dating device working in an alien environment where the long-term C14/12 ratio is unknown) by claiming that hey, it's future technology, but the errors above and others tell me that they were simply mistakes.

Nothing is explained properly. There's no explanation how we could be ""created"" by something extraterrestrial yet still demonstrably related to everything else on Earth. It's never explained why, or even if, the parent race wanted to wipe us out. It's certainly not explained how the crew suddenly knew that this is what they intended, with enough certainly to commit suicide to stop them, or why that last surviving ""Engineer"" was asleep waiting for them to find and awaken him (and possibly stop him) rather than just going and doing it! The story is a muddled mess full of plot holes.

I'll give it a 5 for the effects and the sets, and Michael Fassbender's performance was excellent, but there's nothing else redeeming in this film.","5"
"evans-lester","Great visuals, moronic writing","28 October 2012","After watching the film, it came as no shock to me that the writer of Lost (Lindelof) had a hand in the writing of this much hyped prequel to the Alien franchise. Lindelofs writing and plots are disjointed and incomprehensible, and this is exquisitely demonstrated in Prometheus.

Lindelof being paired with the genius of Scott is like having a Michelin Star chef preparing a banquet with ingredients from Lidl. The resulting production is a beautiful shot but ultimately nonsensical mess.

The plot starts off with grand aspirations, making contact with visitors from another world, but quickly descends into a story about a bunch of morons (or alleged 'Scientists') fumbling around an alien planet looking for its inhabitants with total disregard for common sense.

There are so many problems (that many here have covered) with the nonsensical behaviour of these 'scientists' that one can only assume the writers have never met a scientist, have never watched a program about anything that involves science or even know what science is.

If a real group of Scientists were to travel to an Alien planet that they suspected of harbouring intelligent life, they wouldn't fly into the atmosphere unannounced and take a stroll around like a bunch of sightseers. They would spend weeks or even months (or longer) studying the planet from a distance - yet our intrepid bunch or half-wits fly straight on in, disembark and start fumbling around like teenagers at their first make-out party.

The writing is abysmal.. The behaviour of the characters is totally illogical and totally inconsistent with anyone with any common sense, let alone Scientists, who are notoriously down to earth, meticulously methodical and consistently cautious - not these guys, they are like a group of gung-ho dimwits who do things like stick electrical probes into the decapitated head of an alien just for kicks, only to see the most important find in human history inexplicable explode.

Then there's the reactions of these people.. Scientists who are afraid of a body, a captain who ignores his crews please for help instead choosing to go to bed, half the crew ignoring a woman with an 8 inch wound across her stomach covered in blood, the entire crew being utterly underwhelmed by the most important discovery in human history, the stupid-duo scientists who try baby-talk with the first living alien species they encounter (yet these are the two idiots afraid of the body), then the suicidal pilots who's demeanour stays exactly the same even though they've just realised they're all gonna die.

And inevitably the writers had to involve religion.. From the off it leaves a bad taste in the mouth. The existence of aliens, even ones who potentially spawned us has nothing to do with religion, particularly amongst scientists, who are almost exclusively atheist - yet religious symbols, religious references and talk of the afterlife is rife in this film. And note to the writers, abiogenesis and evolution do not cancel each other out, so why would Darwinism need to be discounted, by a scientist of all people?? I literally could go on all night..plot holes and stand-out plot devices aplenty throughout.

This film attempts profundity, but the only sense of wonder that I was left with was why would a woman and her psychopathic robot choose to fly to yet another alien planet full of aliens who hate humans?

Good points: Fassbender, the scenery, the special effects (which were impressive even by todays standards) and the idea (even though it was appallingly executed)

Bad points: Everything else, especially the inevitable sequel(s).","4"
"ScottSF","Disappointing as a science fiction movie.","28 June 2012","Yet another science fiction movie that has an anti-science agenda. I wish they could learn that getting things closer to real science actually makes for a better story. Science fiction as a Genre is great because it makes us think so if you have to say ""It was a good movie, as long as you don't think about it too much,"" then it's not good science fiction.

As an Alien movie it still doesn't measure up. I'm actually not a fan of the horror Genre but I liked Alien because it is good science fiction in its execution.

Where the movie worked was in the unspoken parts. In the beginning I believed I was in for a Kubrician treat with top notch cinematography and a very compelling first character introduced. Sci-fi fandom as grown much more sophisticated so I would have to say that this movie was made more for mass consumption than the core niche audience for the genre.","4"
"andykessinger","Lame story told for the fifteenth time.","7 January 2014","I saw this movie thinking ""this looks cool"" and I was disappointed. So, a massively expensive space exploration goes under way, and a bunch of bumbling babbling baboons who often know hardly anything about science. All I ask is why? Why did they have to do it that way, why is there hardly anything in the movie that's original? Example? Carnivorous space creatures that wind up killing everybody by the end of the film. Sound familiar? Try Apollo 18, Alien, Creature, etc. It's a story that's been told many times, and it's not any more entertaining or interesting the fifteenth time it's told. I was not pleased with this film at all. Even the acting performances weren't very good. Fassbender did a great job playing an emotionless robot, but other than that, i saw nothing special about this movie especially after all the pre-release hype that it received. Final score: 4.2/10","3"
"trans_mauro","Science Fiction it ain't","13 September 2012","I guess Prometheus should be renamed. A more appropriate name would be ""The Marx Brothers Go Camping in an Alien World"" or ""Exobiology with the Three Stooges""

I never understood why Hollywood insists on doing Science Fiction movies with total disregard for science and scientists.

Hollywood writers are dumb, politically correct motivated, and so anti- science that they could not figure out what science and scientists are all about. They always use those stereotyped idiots.

A film that could be so much better end up looking like those slasher teen movies where a bunch of retards are, for instance, trapped in a haunted mansion or are chased by a demented killer.

To make thinks worse, Prometheus is rip-off of a much better movie (characters and story wise): Alien Versus Predator... The idea of an old very rich dying guy assembling a team of experts is nothing original..

"blankenshipdk","Scott rips off his own quality movie, yet manages a dud.","8 October 2013","Although this movie started echoing the ""Alien"" saga pretty early on, it nonetheless showed some promise based on an interesting premise that has gained some traction recently, namely that a race of giant aliens came to earth(Sumeria)and bio-engineered the populace into what is now modern man. While this may sound like a far-fetched theory it nonetheless may lend itself to a possible explanation of some evolutionary gaps that are known to exist. The movie then takes this imaginative speculation and turns it into a couple of hours of dull sci-fi punctuated by some convincing gory effects in a heavily computer generated environment which is great if you're into that however, some character development and compelling story telling couldn't hurt. Even Charlize Theron can't save this one. At one point another crew member asks her if she is a robot and I'm thinking, c'mon her performance isn't that wooden. This movie was so dull I started watching the Jets-Atlanta game and it was a lot more entertaining.","4"
"hac555","This was a thoughtless exposition of special effects","14 June 2012","SPOILERS: Simplistic plot, underdeveloped relationships and characters, no resolution (certainly no answers) and so many nonsensical elements and holes you could call it Swiss cheese.

Some examples: The ""engineer"" in the opening scene commits suicide to inject his (now dead?) genetic material in to the ocean (because while they are really smart they haven't figured out a better way to do this than to commit suicide).

The ""engineers"" have a really advanced ship but had to blow a flute to start it up; The two ""we're scared"" idiots got lost (while their drones are mapping the interior?) but yet when they encounter a slimy alien worm thing they think it's ""cute"" and want to play with it; The old guy had to trick them to get them to go on this (2039 trillion dollar?) mission by faking his death (although he was apparently paying them to go anyway); The fact that his hired ""team"" looked more like a high school class of idiots than some high-paid team of scientists; That the Robot (who isn't human and has no real motivation to do so) feeds the black goo (why? who knows?)of gene altering slime to the suddenly ""I'm drunk because the Aliens are all dead scientist"". Who turns in to a ragged werewolf, gets fried but nevertheless comes back with super-human strength. That this magic goo is kept in bomb type containers that have screw caps - sometimes they are stacked in piles like weapons and other times they are stood up and surround a giant alien head with no real purpose.

The most absurd thing (of course) was then they bring back an ""engineer"" from his state of suspension and communicate with him (in his alien (assumed?) language - how they got that I have no idea, although clearly if you are a robot that knows 10000000 languages you automatically are fluent in the native tongue of the ""engineers"") this intelligent ""engineer"" doesn't have a single thing to say - instead this intelligent advanced being (who created us) turns in to a WWF beast and starts ripping heads off.

"robkenyonuk","The further destruction of the Alien saga...","1 June 2012","This review contains spoilers, so please, if you've not seen this movie DON'T carry on reading.

OK so I don't usually write reviews, but in this case I feel I HAVE to review this movie, perhaps mostly to vent some frustrations. Being a massive Alien(s) fan (a self confessed alien junkie who owns several copies and knows perhaps a little TOO much about it) I think this why I am so let down.

Let me start by saying I have been waiting for this movie with great anticipation since the concept was revealed to the media. Then the gradual release of the various trailers just added to my excitement, especially as the trailers looked SO good, they just oozed reference's to Alien and had a wonderful creepy atmosphere to them... but that's where atmosphere stayed I guess...

The film starts off well enough, beautiful scenery, beautiful 3D, and then... we are greeted by a hooded figure walking near a waterfall, who looks suspiciously like a rubber Vin Diesel, but okay, I can accept that. My curiosity and research into the movie had already told me that this guy was a Space Jockey. The film then carries on well enough with more visual treats etc and a nice part with David and his introduction into his creepiness.

The film starts hitting confusion when they land on the planet they discover in a star map (one of the LV planets - presumably near to LV-426 from the original Alien) I can only presume (you'll notice I use the word 'presume' a lot - mostly because this film is riddled with plot holes and things that will leave you wondering 'why'?) that the scientists knew exactly where on the planet to land as they seem to find the 'tomb' straight away, however the film makes out they just randomly stumble upon it by accidentally flying into the right area... okay fair enough. The young scientists want to go looking straight away - brilliant we could see some action / suspense, space jockeys! Well not really, it seems to be a rather brief trip, but a least we see some space jockeys. One thing that annoys me here is the character 'Fifield' - every films likes to have a 'hard man' and quickly he is established at being just that... mo-hawk, tattoos, attitude etc but he is the first to run away when they stumble upon a dead jockey!? Fair enough he's not that hard man or the cool guy everyone likes in the movie... who is? So some things happen, things that leave me feeling very disappointed, mostly due to the space jockey concept. The helmet. The exploding face? why? and then the rest of the plot starts making no sense... David the creepy robot decides to poison someone with Alien goo, wicked, lets see him transform and kill some people or something? okay maybe he'll turn into the space jockey we see in the trailers? nope, okay lets see him commit suicide and be forever forgotten from this movie once again (one can only presume he was poisoned the impregnate Shaw - but who knows) otherwise his poisoning is pointless and his death needless.

Fifields return... a chance for some action? not really, its short lived, although I did enjoy the little 'Aliens' reference in his death.

Everything that happens beyond this point in the movie just adds to the confusion of it. I read the small amount of reviews on here before going to watch the movie, and I noticed a theme, a theme that I REALLY did not want to believe, but in the end the negative reviews are just right. I don't want to believe it, but they are.

This film could have been so much more, and its biggest problem was moving away from being an Alien prequel and trying to be its own movie, instead it is just a mash up of different ideas which ultimate destroys my passion for the evolution of the alien. This film should have been unconnected to alien OR it should have been a direct prequel to alien. Instead we just have some kind of mash-up of ideas and some space jockeys thrown in for the fans. I idea of a space jockey being an engineer was something I liked, but I hated that they were big rubber men in suits, I would have preferred them to be a separate race of alien who created man, not aliens who are men.

The End was the worst part of the film, never have I been so disappointed to see a Xenomorph (or some breed of) or how it was ""born"", (big squid facehuggers?) I much preferred the original concept of them being a biological weapon to destroy planets. Elements of that idea where there, but quickly forgotten.

The film lacked suspense, there were no scares, and just when I thought something was being set up for a scare I was just left bored.

The film has great ideas which are ultimately destroyed by it trying to be connected to Alien which in my opinion is its downfall. It is riddled with plot holes, pointless characters (Weyland and his makeup, Vickers and her star wars ""father"" line, and pretty much every other character besides David, Shaw and Janek).

Ridley I had high hopes and you destroyed them, this film could have been amazing. Instead it fits in between Alien Resurrection and Aliens Vs Predator (I can't class it on its own since you decided to tie it to the alien saga sorry).

"chandanshivaramu","This Visually Stunning masterpiece is 100x the 1979 Alien...!!","8 June 2012","I just watched this movie in the theater. My first reaction was to watch it few more times..!! I think i should thank Ridley and his crew including the Lost creator.. for helming this superb piece of cinema. I know after today, this movie will be reviewed and criticized further more till we get a Directors cut..:-). For me, having watched almost all 1970+ to 2010+ sci-fi thrillers, this is for sure the best movie i was ever watched. Why i say this is 100X the 1979 alien.. the original alien has a simple sequential single threaded horror story .. which in itself was a masterpiece and trailblazer, setting benchmark for other alie**nistic movies. I cant describe enough to say how visually stunning the special effects are for this movie.. its simply outstanding..

On the acting department, Noomi, Charlize, Idris excel and make us believe their excitement. Michael Fassbender is a revelation and gives one of his best controller performances.. I think this movie can spawn multiple sequels and spin-offs .. firstly on the origins of the engineer and their planet.. secondly the plant like alien which thrive on this planet, thirdly the egg containers and their alien like creatures.. fourthly how these creatures spawn the evil xenomorphs.. aka aliens. There are lots of open ended questions that remain to be answered.. and perhaps will be answered in at least 2 sequels i think.. I wonder those who criticize this movie .. what were they thinking in their head.. to see another horror story of alien rampage of humans?? I think this movie is beyond all of it.. and more importantly the ever curious notion of the origin of mankind. One thing i want to warn the viewers is that .. this movie doesn't start slow and ends with a bang.. it just opens up in few different directions and ends with too many directions.. which is why this may not be as horrifying as the 1979 Alien classic. This is a pure sci-fi breakthrough movie which will surely leaves you in awe and speechless. Another note is.. please watch it on 3D.. as its multi-layered screens hots and its so complex scenes can only be enjoyed with 3D. Someone said.. the music in this movie is loud and deafening.. its nothing like that.. and music is actually good and effective. I look forward to the following sequels.. Space Jockey, Engineer, David, Weyland enterprise the beginnings.. Alien.. origins.. etc etc..!!!","10"
"adamjohns-42575","It has to start somewhere!","6 April 2022","Prometheus (2012) -

I believe that this is an appropriate film to continue the franchise and it has been given the budget that the 'Alien Vs Predator' (2004 & 2007) films should have had at least half of. It continues along the same vein as the original films with its exploration of other planets, whilst explaining how those other films all started.

Michael Fassbender is brilliantly creepy in his role as the android, David. Having witnessed the exploits of both Ash and Bishop in previous 'Alien' (1978, 1986 & 1992) films, it is difficult to know how much to trust him and his enigmatic performance is enjoyable to watch. You can't tell if he will be more like Bishop or Ash and what he will ultimately do.

So with him doing so well, why don't I like Charlize Theron? It's not just in this film, but in anything she does? Is it that she's a bit two dimensional? Or is it that she just doesn't have the presence that some of the other starlets have? I could see Cate Blanchett or even Rosamunde Pike doing very well in this role.

Maybe they were directing her to be overly masculine and aggressive like Sigourney Weaver's character, Ripley, but it didn't work.

I'm also not that keen on Elizabeth Shaw in, what I suppose is, the lead role. She should stick to making mints, because she just seems a bit ""Meh"" for me.

The rest of the cast are all fine, but let's be honest, we know that they are just fodder for the alien machine.

All of that aside, I actually love this film. I would like a little more clarity regarding the origins of the beings and so on, but for me it really wins as a predecessor of a franchise which is already very well established.

It reminds me of 'Rogue One' (2016) in that it is a history told without changing what we already know, with thought applied and a nod to the fans as much as they can. And it's all done without cheapening the world already created, unlike 'AVP: Requiem' (2007) and 'Predators' (2010).

Some of the creepier bits turn my stomach, but that's because I'm a pussy. It's only what is to be expected from a film like this.

I honestly don't see why others have criticised it. I would happily watch this film every year if I had the time.

Their mission is the most expensive, the largest undertaking in the history of mankind, and these guys wake up from years of deep sleep to immediately disobey orders, run around a completely uncharted alien planet without taking even five minutes to study the damn thing. Did they not hire any technical advisers? I just get really irritated when Hollywood types, producers and directors, have zero clue about how things would have gone, and simply have the characters act like a bunch of idiot mitten screwballs, believing that the kid doing the special effects will make up for the really, really bad direction and complete lack of technical advice.","1"
"mtiller12","We were wrong, We were so wrong!","2 June 2012","Disappointed is an understatement here. As noted in several other reviews the visuals are fantastic but the script itself is an absolute mess.

Yes Fassbender is great as David but that alone does not save this film. The rest of the cast aren't so great although its difficult to blame them considering how little they are given to work with. The majority of the crew are underdeveloped, two dimensional and at times down right unlikable. As I found myself hating the majority of the characters I never once cared for their well being which led to a complete lack of tension or interest. Some of the dialogue is so poor that I actually laughed and the 'twists' are predictable and presented in melodramatic fashion.

The themes and concepts are also underdeveloped with the majority of questions going unanswered. Prometheus attempts to cover too much in a short amount of time without ever really committing to anything. Ideas of faith and motherhood appear to be thrown in to give the appearance of depth that just isn't there. Although you have to admire the film for attempting to deal with these ideas in a summer blockbuster context it just does not work.

The thing i hated the most is the ending which is insulting and a desperate attempt to appeal to the fans. A really bad apology for the mess of a film that came before. Prometheus is a flat and uninvolving picture that never achieves the tension or excitement suggested by the trailers. Its sole purpose appears to be setting up a new franchise and is so committed to this that it fails to be a self sufficient film. Despite Mr Scotts attempts to distance the film from the Alien series it is absolutely reliant on that franchise to keep the audience even remotely interested and looks set to be even more reliant on sequels to justify its existence.","4"
"toygun_999","Pro-Idiotheus and horrendous","23 September 2012","The first thing can be noticed from watching this commercialised trash (money, money, money these days, eh Scotty) is the strikingly poor execution to an otherwise potentially good plot.

The film revolves around a valid question(s) and a theme, like where humans came from, mortality, if there is a creator (in the philosophical and theological sense), and off course, an added cherry, where THE Aliens came from,and so on. However, the ehm...""movie"" was a trillion light years away from rational and minimal expectations. Here we have a multi billionaire (Waylen) funding a team of ill disciplined morons to get his elixir of life and couple of answers from the big bold guy -who for no apparent reason, like some sociopath who dislikes his invited guests, after trillions of miles he wants to kill his own long distant relatives, and every one who gets in his line of sight. No explanation what so ever.

Sorry Waylen, Darwinian at work here, next time pick real scientists and crew, now you're dead- dumb sob.

The behaviour of the characterless entities are so random and idiotic one would wonder how could these ""scientists"" were picked; on what criterion. Then again, Waylen must, himself, be a total moron (how he got to be so rich?) The whole sequential themes and the way each event follows on to the next is just horrible; it's like watching multiple events happen at an interval times; no connections from A to Z . The behaviour of the ""scientists"", the robot, the pilot and his buddies, and all therein about this rubbish were so dry and unrealistic that even asking 'why' has no meaning, anyway.

A good example is the Geologist (he looked like a meth edict, mind you), now who would behave in such manner knowing he's going to make history? And the biologist who brags about Darwin, yet, he wants to hug a totally alien, and perhaps even hostile, creature? He probably forgot that rule #1 in Darwinian dogma is: caution, what a moron he was. Plus, these bright ""scientists"" have forgotten about something called health and safety procedure or bio-hazardous materials; if NASA was to follow Hollywood and Mr Scott's perception of reality and science, well, who knows.

There where so much crass in this ""movie"" enough to make a volume out of it. The irony is the movie started to get a little bit interesting only at the end, with the heroine starting her own adventure by travelling to the bold guys' home planet- despite the absurdity and lack of explanation for that behaviour.

The only redeeming quality is the sceneries and music, yet contrasting with the ""movie"" made the whole thing stands out like a deadly alien spores. Avoid.","1"
"taw862","I'm impressed","14 May 2015","This is such a great film. The only one that I have seen over and over again and yet it keeps on surprising me and above all making me think. There is clunkiness and it does try to do too much. It is too dense, I admit. But it is still a great film, full of obvious horrors, well documented and very clear but along with them much more subtle ones. The subtle ones include: Robots who can read your dreams and then use the knowledge against you; mans desire for immortality – at any expense, including his daughter's life; A robot made by men, which has utter contempt for men at the same time; A realisation that we are the SAME as the Engineers, with matching DNA, and the Engineers are ruthless creators and destroyers of life. Continual references to biological weapons – both man made (Ebola?) and Engineer made, and references to the Holocaust (both man made and by the Engineers). David is the key, he is a horrifying creation, ruthless, judgmental, deceitful, manipulative, lying, cruel. Yet created by man. This makes the film very complex and interesting. If we created David and he is such a terrible creation, then who created us and why and are we equally terrible? Maybe. So is the act of creation a foolish act, which leads to disaster for the creator. We never find out what David says to the Engineer, why not? No translation is provided, and again to me this is a clue as the what is going on, the thing that is created, whether it is us or David, becomes uncontrollable and dangerous.","10"
"browha","Mediocre","31 May 2012","this film is beautifully shot, nice 3D. The plot line is okay, but the character writing is absolutely pathetic.

At no point during any of the film did I feel any empathy for anyone in it. The decisions made by characters (will not spoil) are completely incomprehensible, and the last scene actually caused laughter in the cinema.

Its alright, at best. But, considering the hype and expectations around the film, it is a disappointment.

The atrocious use of the characters is terrible. Previous Ridley Scott films I've seen utilize characters far better than this film does.

"TxMike","Examines the possible alien origins of life on Earth.","9 November 2012","There is a 1970 film ""Chariots of the Gods"", based on the Erich von Däniken book. It examines the theory and possibility that centuries ago some alien form from another world visited Earth and was responsible for the origin of the human race.

This movie, ""Prometheus"", is aligned with that theme. Instead of examining supposed evidence, it branches off into an entirely fictional treatment. As the movie opens we see a strange life form, that looks in many ways like Earthlings, open a container and consume its contents, presumably on an ancient Earth, falls into a waterfall, is spontaneously broken apart, and its DNA begin to form new life. This is meant to represent a type of beginning of life here.

Cut to modern times, actually almost 80 years into the future, and scientists exploring a region of Scotland, the Isle of Skye, find ancient drawings, perhaps 35,000 years old, that has style links to other ancient drawings found in different parts of the world. Too similar to be coincidence they theorize all of them were references to a far-away world. And they use the patterns of celestial references to figure out where it is.

A few years later a deep space mission, in a ship called 'Prometheus', complete with an android and suspended animation chambers, travels to the location suspected to be the ""origin of life."" When they get there they find a number of things they never bargained for.

The cast are all good actors, including Noomi Rapace (the scientist), Michael Fassbender ( the android), Charlize Theron as the space ship's captain, Idris Elba (the pilot) Guy Pearce in very heavy makeup as the dying old man financing the mission.

We enjoyed it, two hours did not seem long because the story was so interesting. It appears a sequel is in the works, as the movie ends with a survivor headed away in a space ship with questions still unanswered.",NA
"drew_atreides","Ridley Scott still has it","9 June 2012","...I have to admit that, when I heard about Prometheus, i was EXCITED, but cautiously so. Mr. Scott had made some exceptional films over the years, and that he was somehow revisiting the universe which really put him on the map, way back in 1979, i was quite intrigued.

At the same time, Mr. Scott's more recent efforts (Kingdom of Heaven, Robin Hood, American Gangster, A Good Year) hadn't exactly been spectacular (I know many people tell me to watch the director's cut of Kingdom, but i was so thoroughly disappointed by the theatrical cut that i just can't bring myself to risk it.)

My excitement got the better of me so I decided to go to an opening IMAX 3D screening of this one, and boy... Am I glad i did.

Ridley absolutely still has some big time films in him. To take a film billing itself as a prequel to ALIEN, and turn it into a grandiose adventure to attempt to meet our g(G)od(s) was just incredibly unexpected and bold.

But good gosh, what a beautifully shot, cinematic adventure!

More science fiction then horror, there ARE a couple of segments that will turn the stomach of the unprepared, including one scene that i swear hearkens back to the intensity and stomach-churning horror of that classic scene in ALIEN...

The best thing i can say about this film: When it was finished i wanted to get back in line and see it again.

A must-see on the big screen.","9"
"Jothos","Annoying. This movie has NO idea what it wants to be!","10 April 2013","This movie was ALMOST good. But it was like u could almost picture the writers getting excited coming up with all these new ideas for where the movie should go, but then not having any idea where those ideas were going. And then they just filmed it like that. It was like JJ Abrahm's writing style in LOST. Which I loved. But he had so many ideas that were cool in the moment, then annoying when they never got resolved. That's how this movie was. It shouldn't elude itself to being some kind of prequel to Alien, then have all these things happen that make NO sense with the Alien movie. Even if it's not supposed to be a direct prequel to it, your mind still goes that way, and is like ""Wtf? that makes no sense in correlation with Alien"". Even if it wasn't associated with Alien, there is too much crap that happens, then never gets explained. In the end, it was just annoying as hell, and a big disappoint to me from a great director like Ridley Scott to come up with something so ridiculous. Unless he's got something up his sleeve for part 2 that will make part 1 look genius, I dunno. But it doesn't look like it. All in all, just too many dam loose ends to be a good movie.","4"
"mac_martino","Not at all Alien Worthy..","21 June 2012","I will not go in to too much detail, but spoilers are mentioned beyond point 2

Please for Honesty, I watched this Movie with my girlfriend who had not seen the Movies Alien, Aliens, Alien 3, Alien resurrection.

But I can tell you THIS, SHE FELL ASLEEP DURING THE MOVIE!!!! no really, I mean it, this movie is mind-numbing boring.

I myself am a big fan of SCI-FI Horror amongst other Horror Movies, and Alien I still remember being scared up to the last point.. The thrill and suspense and unexpected shocks. unequaled for a long time..

But I think Ridley Scott has forgotten what he has made.

Prometheus starts of promising with 1 big question, which is never answered. During the movie you will find out that the characters have no connections, they simply do not add to the suspense and are poorly setup. Choices made by so called scientist are so poorly that you believe you are looking at the original startrekseries.

to simply state, this movie is not worth watching, especially if you have seen the originals. It is Like having seen Starwars IV,V,VI and then having to watch the phantom menace..

Yes indeed it is that bad","1"
"filled_94","Fail","3 June 2012","I hated this film for a few reasons. First, it pretends to be ""science fiction"" when it isn't. It's a dumb horror movie. To qualify for science fiction it has to show a bit more intellectual clout than flat stereotypes that characters flip into. Second, and perhaps connected, is the stereotypes of scientists being the silliest caricatures of human beings, unless they ""believe because they choose to believe"" which somehow makes them human.

Ridley Scott's sends to space a crew of unvetted, nervous people, some of whom you wouldn't let pour your drink, let alone entrust them with a ""trillion dollar"" space mission. Incidentally, these are the ""scientists"" as he imagines them. His explorers take off their helmets in alien atmosphere just on the proportion of CO2 vs O2. They stroll into places without precautions and get lost randomly.

Ridiculous to it's core, this film wasn't worth the money or my time. Hope this helps a few souls spare themselves.","2"
"sean-devitt","Art and Science don't always mix.","3 December 2012","The first time I saw Prometheus I thought it wasn't as bad as some were saying. The cinematography was great and the performance of Michael Fassbender made it a largely enjoyable experience. I didn't like the 'scientists' Shaw and Holloway at all but I tried to endure.

Then after a second viewing the plot holes and poor dialogue that others had pointed out became apparent. My third viewing was on a flight from Seoul to Taipei. On the small screen the great cinematography wasn't there to save the movie. I now think this is close to awful but I gave it a 4/10 because of cinematography and Fassbender.

The problems are too obvious to point out. From watching Ridley Scott being interviewed it was clear he thought he was making a masterpiece. Whether it was hubris or self delusion I don't know but one thing that became clear was that he had no grasp of the material.

Scott is an artist and he's good at his stuff. He's not so good at science. This was also clear in Alien and Blade Runner. With Alien it didn't matter because it was just a horror movie in space. With Blade Runner the poor science, story telling and editing was hidden by the praise of critics telling us that it was a classic and that anyone who didn't think so was an idiot. The poor dialogue, confusing storyline and the lack of a clear ending were all signs of genius at work. Forget the fact that no one in the movie knew what it was about and that the studio execs were horrified by the final product. Obviously they were all idiots and didn't understand the majesty of the movie! I think that's what Scott thought he could get away with in Prometheus. Any plot holes would be covered over by the critics and his fans. Scientific inaccuracies could be dismissed as nitpicking, poor character development could be explained away by 'symbolism' and a stupid ending as just the set up for a sequel.

As for the characters. As I said Shaw and Holloway were awful. I was so disappointed that Noomi Rapace's character survived the movie. She didn't deserve it. In Alien, Ripley deserved to survive. She was the most sensible, level headed and resourceful of the crew. Shaw was written as a blind and arrogant fanatic. At the end of the movie she was still a blind and arrogant fanatic. No development at all.

I would write about the other characters but there weren't any.","4"
"CrazyBomber","Oh My...","10 June 2012","I'm so disappointed. I had high hopes, but then the rating went from 8.5 to 7.9... That's never a good sign.

So apparently the world's foremost scientists are lacking a brain. Not just that, they are completely 0.5 dimensional, and make typically poor decisions.

I'm completely disappointed at this especially because in Alien we saw much more credible characters. Ripley took the standard procedure to the letter, and the crew outside was screaming to get in. That's realistic, and what you would expect to happen in such a situation.

In this movie? Surreal right from the start. What better way to explore an alien structure than immediately removing your helmet when it indicates the air is breathable? Who cares what else might be there. Who cares if all of the sudden some vents open and the air gets toxic. Well not the characters, obviously.

Oh that biologist... amazing that he got a degree, actually. What biologist is so dense he can't even recognize obvious aggressive behavior? Even if there are such biologists, why select *them* to bring on such an important mission?? And that geologist... what was he supposed to do, exactly? Deploy a few probes? Nicely done, mate. Too bad between the two of them they can't figure out the way out. Or to even *call* the ship to point them the way out. Seriously? Finally, that annoying David robot thing. Yes, the most interesting character in the whole movie. Too bad he's supposed to be a robot, though. Seemed less of a robot and more of a person throughout all the movie.

Oh well, is it even worth it pointing out how this movie gets all the science... WRONG? Mr. Ridley Scott, I expected more of you. Much much more.

Read with me: Science is our friend! It's not a made up concept you just adapt to fit whatever your needs are. ""Don't be a skeptic"", the girl-scientist says to the boy-scientist. Dare I say being skeptic is what science is all about? Oh... if their DNA is identical to ours... how come they are so different? And how come at least 35k years of evolution (oh wait... did they disprove evolution in this movie? Hmm... asking a bit too much there aren't you?) still resulted in a perfect match? And worse, how can chimps share 97-98% of DNA with us?? Were they created by the aliens too?

Amazing how paintings in caves ""clearly indicate"" we were created by an alien race. Which is 100% similar in DNA to us. But then again doesn't look like us entirely. Oh no wait, that whole concept (along with the ""engineers"" title) was entirely ""on faith"". Nevermind countless other explanations for the drawings. You could even say they were some alien race that once visited our planet and left us a map to follow them when we were ready. But no, they had to be our creators just because. And sharing DNA. Ignore how that conflicts with everything we actually *know* about life on earth. Nothing in this story made any sense. Suspension of disbelief has limits, sorry to say.

One final note for that auto-surgery, which was definitely the high part of this mediocre movie: What happened to the two guys who were trying to put her asleep? Did they stay ""out"" that long? Why didn't they go after here? I got the impression she didn't even lock the door.

Mr. Scott, I'm not 15 anymore. I am older, and my brain is functioning pretty well thank you. Please take that into consideration when you plan your next movie. Or if you don't, at least be kind enough to make it PG13 or something, so it's target audience can see it too.","2"
"amesmonde","Scott's intriguing LV-223 Sci-fi","2 June 2012","The near future 2089 Earths historical artifact's and ancient paintings prompt an expedition into space to find our makers but puts the crew of the Prometheus in grave danger when they land on LV-223 in 2093.

Veteran director Ridley Scott gives Prometheus its own unique look and rightly so as the action, suspense takes place on LV-223 not LV- 426 as in Alien(s). Without getting bogged down with Alien (2122A.D) comparisons, this is a science expedition not a mining vessel. This change in location allows Prometheus to sit as a stand alone film.

Questioning our origins in a reasonable intelligent way the story written by Jon Spaihts and Damon Lindelof is intriguing and makes this film stand above your average sci-fi. That said, Prometheus does raise more questions than it answers yet it's ambiguity is what makes this film special and allows for the set-up of future instalments. 

It's excellently cast and includes international actors Guy Pearce (who is sorely underused) Idris Elba as everyday man Janek and Logan Marshall-Green to name a few. Charlize Theron is astounding as Meredith Vickers, a hard nosed corporate mission director. Notably is Michael Fassbender as David who is every bit as interesting as Bishop and Ash with added a quirky 'fondness' for Peter O'Tool. Main protagonist Elizabeth Shaw played by Noomi Rapace is not your typical Ripley clone and carries much of the emotion for the film. 

The effects are first rate, with the Space Jockeys, scenery, ships and Aliens wonderfully realised and rendered. Some of the effects are practical and look organic for the most part. The location and environment feels real and makes everything more palatable. A nod should go to Dariusz Wolski's cinematography and Pietro Scalia's editing.

Scott delivers a few standout creepy scenes some particularly gut turning, notably the arm breaking, infection and decontamination scenes-  it captures some xenomorph magic. 

Marc Streitenfeld's music score is an effective mixed bag although is a little over used. Both writers and Scott ensure to include a few character twists and wisely incorporate some elements from the Aliens series (in keeping with that world) whether it be a vehicle, a line or setup to possibly appease die-hard fans but for the most part it feels fresh. That said, some character motivations need to be teased out by the viewer for clarification, not all the t's are crossed and the i's dotted.

The film took the Alien series in a direction I was not expecting. As a long-time fan of the Alien series, and with this new Prometheus course I can say I'm satisfied, it's edge of your seat, gory-suspense - director Ridley Scott is on pretty good form.

Prometheus tackles themes of origin, mortality and biological warfare to name a few and although it feels a little rushed it's a grower just like the spores themselves.",NA
"gregory-37-29204","Alien Resurrection 2?","20 June 2012","OK, so I went to see Prometheus last night and can't help but feel unsatisfied with the conclusion.

Firstly, I will start with what I enjoyed about this film as it was not all bad.

1: Michael Fassbender's performance 2: Cinematography 3: Visual Effects 4: This is a prequel not just some smart ass movie that is based in the same 'universe' as Ridley's original. 5: Idris Elba (although I did question a few of his actions)

Unfortunately, thats where it stops. I'm not going to go on about the behaviour of some characters as I agree with other reviews that some of the decisions, actions of some were questionable. My main gripe is with the emotional detachment I had with the actors. Aside from Fassbender there wasn't really any characterisation for anyone else which unlike Alien I cared for each character.

When a mutated Fifield returns to the ship and goes on a mini killing spree, who does he kill again? I don't remember seeing any of those guys before?!

Another thing that really annoyed me about this film is that all the way through you are kind of in awe with the Visual Effects and the advanced technology that is being used, then we get hit with an unrealistic, prosthetic 90 year old Guy Pearce? I thought to myself half way through, there must be a scene where Weyland miraculously ages backwards or something but no, hes just an old man all the way through! I'm sure Ian McKellen could have done those scenes?

To conclude, watching this film has made me want to do one thing, watch Alien again. The question you have to ask though is, do I want to because I've just watched the prequel or do I need reminding of what a great sci/fi horror is?","6"

I don't know what all that guff was about ""keep it real if you can and holding back on the CGI"". I mean the technical credits at the end of the movie were still rolling when I got up the next day.And the day after that....

I liked all the Alien franchise, and have a very soft spot for ""Aliens"" but.... I did wonder why it was, when there were helmet cams to keep everyone tracked, that two characters were bumped off and nobody noticed.

Unless they were all shagging at the time.

I did wonder at how well a person can abseil and perform gymnastics after having her body held together with a few surgical staples.

I'm not sure where in the alien life cycle we've noticed that it takes over a human body and turns it into some sort of homicidal zombie.

I really didn't think this bunch of losers would be trusted to get a can of beans from the local store never mind rediscover a new civilisation.

"GuigaWayne","One of the worst movies i've ever seen","6 May 2013","Inspite of the awesomely and beautiful full of effects trailer, this movie has more logical failures then Spongebob. First of all, they come to an unknown gigantic alien planet, and in about 30 seconds they already find what they were looking at, makes Colombus and Cabral look like two retarded brainless dudes. Secondly, within about 3 minutes inside a horrifying alien cave, due to an simply scan, those who call themselves SCIENTISTS simply TAKE OF THEIR HELMETS, and a moment later they think ""Oh god, we contaminate the environment"" - OH GOD, REALLY?

But the thing that made cringe mostly, is when Dr. Holloway (yes, this is the ""doctor"" that makes the greatest discovery of mankind and wants to drink like Jack Sparrow because he didn't get to FREAKING TALK WITH THE ALIEN) sees that he has an Alien-type-kind of worm in his eye, and his eye is red like China's flag, so he is obviously infected... and what does the most-genius-doctor-and-scientist-who-is-in-a-trillion-dollar-mission does? Oh yeah, he DOESN'T TELL -ANYONE- THAT HE HAS BEEN INFECTED WITH AN *ALIEN WORM* and simply let EVERYONE go inside the alien-cave again... WITH.NO.FREAKING.HELMETS. But you might think... ""oh, but.. does he wear the helmet this time?"" - NOPE. I guess he was afraid everyone would get jealous of only him being infected. Jesus Christ.

Don't get me started on the robot who doesn't have lungs playing a harmonica, not knowing what ""casualties"" means, being able to understand alien-codes that he never saw before, and.... oh my god, I could go on with this all day.

Prometheus isn't much to get excited about, but even those who are only tepid fans of Alien or sci-fi in general can find it okay.

I'm willing to let go some of the borrowing of original content, but here is an example of a movie where director, writers, and editors fail to tighten up dirt-poor script-writing and don't do a good job with the cast. I get tired of the over-trodden clichés where foolish characters behave ridiculously to suit the story - examples, the 2 engineers ""playing"" with an alien like it's a pet snake, or crew-members opening the outside doors of the ship with abandon. The whole crew besides the android was blase...you have supposed PHD's acting like nothing of the sort taking off their helmets in a foreign atmospheres, and mostly behaving and sounding like children. Charlize Theron's character was was way too obviously written in as the token antagonist - no subtleties or shading whatsoever - smack me in the face with plot-devices why don't you. The captain of the ship didn't stand for anything and was spineless. This was supposed to be an expert mission? On the other side of things, the many effects were generally outstanding although some of their alien concepts were blatantly ripped off from STTNG episode content (specifically ""Time's Arrow"" Multi-part episodes). So Scott and the troop of 4+ writers should know better (the more writers involved usually spells trouble). Correcting a lot of this laziness and doing your homework with the script may have turned things around - oh and to boot, the music and sound effects were mostly unremarkable and paled in comparison to the original as well. Disappointing.","4"

Sure, it looks fabulous. The sets and special effects are terrific. Even his judicious use of 3D works, for the most part. But really, so what? Scott forgot that story is the most important part of any movie. Prometheus glosses over essentials like character development, backstory and suspense in its rush to get everyone into space as quickly as possible so the extraterrestrial slimefest can begin. It's not even all that scary. There's nothing that even comes close to the famous chest bursting scene in Alien for shock factor. It's all rather tame. You never gain any insight to any of the characters so you never have a clue what their motivations are. The movie opens with an archaeological expedition on Earth and suddenly in the very next scene we're in space enroute to meet our makers. Huh? Care to provide us with any plot development there, Ridley?

I did watch this twice to make sure I was not missing some deep and profound meanings here, but no I wasn't because the whole plot and story is just really dumb. It feels like he was pounding a square peg into a round hole with a sledgehammer and expecting it to be entertaining art when it's really just a very poor use of force completely lacking in subtlety.

We knew who Michael Fassbender (David the Android), was because that was clearly pointed out to us. It wasn't until the last half of the movie we knew who Noomi Rapace played. She was Elizabeth Shaw and her name was bandied about quite often in the last half of the movie. (Hey, she is not exactly well known to American audiences and without that dragon on her back it was hard to tell, ha ha). And, we did know that Idris Elba was Captain Janek. Okay, so much for character development or recognition or none of the above.

But some things boggled my mind: You don't send out a probe on a unknown planet to investigate a hive or pyramid structure that appears man made? Hey, you have a gadget to map out the hive! You don't let it go and do its job? You don't test the air for air pollutants inside the hive even though your instruments tell you the air is breathable? You don't touch a black liquid ooze not knowing if it would liquefy your fingers even with gloves on. You don't bring back an alien head back to the ship without knowing what it is all about. You don't decide to animate the head with electricity and end up blowing it up? Why would you touch a snake-like form you have never seen in your life thinking you could make a pet of it with soft, soothing and endearing comments like you were getting to know a pretty kitten? You don't perform a C-Section on yourself to get the thing (not a baby) out of your stomach? Okay, maybe in 2091 that would have been possible.

Many, many other things didn't make sense., but too numerous to list here. The scientists acted more like kids in a candy store than actual scientists, hence there appeared to be no order to investigating this planet and the hive structure. Like I said, Mr. Spock would not be amused.

The billionaire who promoted and financed this venture wanted a cure for old age and thought the aliens on this planet would provide that. He was made up to really look like ""old age personified."" Really bad. Who was this person? Who played him? For a minute I thought it was Christopher Lambert, but no..it was someone else. He was the father of Ms Vickers (Charlize Theron), but there was no one else in the credits with Vickers as a last name. Bummer.

Why did Blockbuster go out and buy 20 additional DV Ds for this one store? The only thing that comes to mind is that this movie is treated like a date night movie. Yes, there are many scary parts in the second half of this and your date may be inclined to cling to you for dear life.

So what was good? The CGI, of course. Very , very good. Also, you can keep your SUVs, and foreign sports cars. I want the ship Prometheus. Very impressive. Great sets. I think fewer scientists would have made for a better, more controlled, more logical story. In many way, this was rushed as there was just too much to cover. Or maybe it just seemed that way. Pity.

This started out really good and there was reason to believe we may have "" learned"" some things about our origin even though they would have been made up. Hey, this is still a fictional story. But, at times, Star Trek gave us something to think about, but nothing in here did that except for one thing: The aliens who may have been us back in the day wanted nothing more than to destroy us. That seemed to be the overriding theme when all was said and done and that was never explained. Prometheus 2? Hmmmm. (5/10)

"raulfaust","Alien trip","18 February 2013","Given that I highly enjoyed 1979's ""Alien"", from the same director, I believed this one would be even better-- mainly due to the great technology they have nowadays. However, things didn't happen as I wished. ""Prometheus"" begins with a promising story, good cast and beautiful photography. As the movie goes, sometimes we have some philosophical thoughts about life and its creation, which led me to believe it would be a thrilling moving in the end. I am not saying this movie is bad, but with such cast and budget, it could've been a million times better. There are no big suspenseful or thrilling scenes; in most of them director prepares us to buy the premise, and when it's time for us to get frightened, or moved, or anything, it fails. The only scenes which really entertained me were when that girl took the alien out of her stomach and when the alien went into a guy's mouth; other than that, nothing strong really happens. I can honestly say ""Prometheus"" isn't what everyone was expecting, and that's a shame.","6"
"steveh46","Hugely disappointing","12 October 2013","What a disappointment. Ridley Scott has made two of the best sci fi movies of all time, Alien and Blade Runner. Estimable accomplishments. So where did this go so wrong?

Visually there are some beautiful moments, particularly when David starts up the navigation system and sets the stars whirling around the chamber.

On acting though, there's nothing here. Who are these people? Who cares? There was more personality in one of the crew of Alien then there is in the whole crew here, with the possible exception of Capt. Janek who seems to have a thing for Stephen Stills. But even that seems like an assigned quirk rather than any part of a real person. Fassbender is good as the robot, but his actions make no sense.

But the biggest problem is the plot. These people mounted a trillion dollar mission to another star system to discover humanity's origins. Do you think they come prepared? Heck no, they didn't. Contaminate themselves, contaminate the site? Why not? Some unknown thing is knocking on the back door of the spaceship? Open the door, let it in. There are innumerable stupidities committed, against the actors and the audience. For a major motion picture, isn't there anyone who can say this doesn't make sense? No group of scientists would act this stupidly.

Enjoy the first two Alien movies, ignore this. It doesn't fit in the ethos and it doesn't hold a candle to those movies or Blade Runner.","2"

When I saw ""Prometheus"" first time, I had exciting experience. Great visual effects, drawing, views – it was on highest level. Second time I saw interesting story with different turns, good acting. Special acting is acting of Michael Fassbender, who acted robot David. He was brilliant. Film gave us a lot of questions. When, how and who created us? Meeting with Creator is the greatest dream of our world. Author of the film gave us own version of answer. Greatest race, Engineers, created humanity from its DNA. Price of this was the life of one of them. May be, it was Prometheus – atlas, who kill himself for life of next generation creatures – people. There are many questions without answers.

"IsaacBadly","Oh God, what has been seen...","12 June 2012","I've read quite a few defenders of this movie refer to the disappointed viewers as mostly just overly nitpicky Alien fanboys who are only complaining because they didn't get their literal prequel, or because they're science nerds who just can't ""suspend disbelief"" enough.

So, just as a thought experiment and to get away from the biased Alien universe for a moment - How would you feel if, in any *serious* movie made by Ridley Scott, James Cameron or any other well known famous director setting out to raise some *serious* questions in a way that *really makes you think*, and all that...

...a family decide to take a vacation road trip in their nice big silvery Winnebago. They depart on a fine summer morning in June, driving off down a beautiful scenic road from Orlando, Florida and exactly 2 hours later, just before lunch time, they arrive at their first destination - a sunny beach in Athens, Greece. You know, the Europe one.

...one of the worlds top biologists hikes deep into unknown thick rain forests looking for a new species of snake. Suddenly, a two-headed cobra emerges. It appears extremely hostile, making loud hissing noises and fierce stabbing motions with its two heads toward the scientist. The biologist then pulls a baby face, goes ""oochie-coochie coo-coo boo-boo!"" and tries to pet it. The cobra hisses louder and makes more stabbing strike attempts, but the biologist persists in his attempts to cuddle the reptile and, eventually, finally manages to pet it, get bitten, and die.

...a female mountain climber is seen hanging from a protruding rock tip high up along a mountain side somewhere in the remote Andes. Suddenly, she falls and completely severs one of her legs on a sharp rock edge beneath, cutting it completely off across the thigh bone. However, she fortunately brought her handy field medic kit with her. She takes it out of her back pack and staples the leg together again, securing the staples with some dental floss and chewing gum just in case, and then sprints the 5 miles down to her base camp where she pole vaults onto a dirt bike and races for the nearest hospital.

If this is the sort of ""suspension of disbelief"" your mind is willing to accept (or perhaps if ""thinking"" simply isn't really your thing), then I'm sure you'll feel right at home following the adventures of the escaped mental patients of Prometheus as they waddle randomly about on their galactic quest to defy the laws of physics, biology and sensible filmmaking, trying to stay as anonymous as they possibly can before getting themselves killed in the most predictably stereotypical ways possible.

If not, then you'll probably walk out of the theater feeling something like how I felt, and perhaps you'll understand why I'm giving this film only two stars, for its visual effects ONLY.

Hint: It isn't because it was ""a poor prequel to Alien"".

Oh, and, if you think the above examples are exaggerated to a ridiculous degree just to make a funny point - they are sadly not. This is actually quite literally the kind of stuff you're in for if you go see this film.

Enjoy your popcorn, because they will likely be the highlight of your evening.","1"
"mawriz","Just another hack and slash film nothing more","1 January 2013","This is just another hack and slash film. This is not an exploration of the origins of man. Basically, when they meet ""The Engineer"", the one that they have been searching for all this time, he just smashed them to bits.

It's also hard to believe that this crew just hopped on a ship and travel that distance without knowing exactly what they're supposed to be doing or where they're going.

How can Shaw still believe in Jesus Christ (along with God the Father and the Holy Spirit because they are supposed to be treated as one) after it has just been proved that he is not the creator and therefore not God? I know one of the themes is belief vs. knowledge but this was not done very well. How would we treat someone today who still believes that the world is flat after it has been proved incorrect by solid facts? I thought Charlize Theron would have a significant impact on the plot but it turns out she is just the typical heir apparent who cannot wait to take over.

When the cast doesn't have personality, character build up, or background story it's hard to care when they get obliterated.",NA
"realdimonty","Great expectations often lead to great disappointments","15 June 2012","When I first saw the teaser of Promethesus, I believe it was January. Man was I excited. I couldn't wait to see a science fiction blockbuster. Then there was the trailer. Wow! I was amazed, and it was a sure thing for me: it's going to be something to remember. But it isn't. I went a few days ago to watch it. Amazing special effects, a great beginning of the movie, but then there was nothing. Sure, the movie looks great. It has some overwhelming views, some effects that knock you down. But when it comes to the scenario, it sucks big time. The movie has no line to follow. Some things happen with no reason, other things just don't happen, although they should. There were some ideas in the movie that were brilliant. But the way they were presented in the movie sucked. I had great expectations from this movie, so the disappointment is ten times greater.

It's something that could have been always remembered, but it's something that will be quickly forgotten. Unfortunately...

For me things are clear: we shall never have science fiction movies based on the aliens subject so good as Aliens, Predator, Predator 2. Seems like scenarists just don't have anymore ideas to do something great. It's a pity, but it's the truth. When you have the technology that you have now, it's a pity. But I guess the subject is over, so, again, it's a pity. Man, am I angry...","5"
"dld2012","Horrible.","2 June 2012","Really. Absolutely atrocious. I won't bother with a lot of detail because the many flaws have already been touched upon by the other negative reviews on this site. The entire thing suggests that Ridley Scott does not understand the first thing about science - he must have slept through the science lessons in primary school, even. Acting... I'm embarrassed for all of them. Those performances seem to have been pulled out of cans. Pork-n-beans acting, that's what I feel like calling it. The look of it seems to be impressive to many people, but it is only so in the sense that it looks very expensive. It's very *big.* Everything is big, flashy... but there is no beauty or subtlety to the images. Even the bigness of it all gets a bit tiresome, eventually. The only way to see this movie as a success is if you place it in a category with ""The Room"" - take a group of friends and make like you're on MST3K. It's so jaw-droppingly bad, you can actually have a lot of fun with it.","2"
"Sergeant_Tibbs","A few scares and good effects but suffers from not knowing what it wants to be.","26 June 2013","This is another really delayed review, except this review is nearly 8 months late. I saw this film when I wasn't in a place to write reviews and I never got around to doing one but now I want to review all of my 2012 viewings, so Moonrise Kingdom review will be coming soon but not until after a third viewing. Unfortunately, this review is based on that single viewing but I don't really want to see it again. I don't get why people are still making a fuss about it, I never gotten into its blockbuster marketing campaign and I only saw it out of general hype. I am a huge Alien fan, and the prospect of a prequel was very intriguing, but after the disappointed reviews came out, my expectations were very low. I did have one expectation, and that was great special effects, which it does actually have. Way more impressive than Avatar or any of the visual effects films which creates whole worlds.

Unfortunately, the screenplay has lots of problems and that's mostly due to not really knowing what it's doing. It ends up feeling like an accidental homage to the B-movies (breathing on planets, monsters, etc) while it's trying to take itself far too seriously. Granted, a fun Alien film would have stuck out like a sore thumb, but it really would've benefited this film. Michael Fassbender is great as David, but he and every other character is under-utilised and used as mere props. It does have a few scary moments, particularly with the surgery machine, but it lacks a lot of tension, and any moment it tries to build with tension, it's ruined by illogical moments and clichés. Prometheus may have been better if it actually was a prequel to Alien, but the ending lays the tracks for another pointless sequel. At least it was inconsistently entertaining when it wasn't doing its wishy-washy spiritual stuff.

"ferguson-6","Where did you come from, where did you go?","9 June 2012","Greetings again from the darkness. Director Ridley Scott jumps back into the sci-fi genre 30 plus years after his two classics: Alien (1979) and Blade Runner (1982). Since then, he has avoided sci-fi and had some ups (Gladiator, American Gangster) and some downs (too many to list). Of course, in the film world, one need only create a single masterpiece to be forever worshiped ... and the Alien lovers have always held out hope their master would return. With a sly approach, Mr. Scott has delivered a prequel that should keep the geeks happy, while also having the ""wow"" factor to generate multiple viewings.

In the year 2089 we witness an archaeologist played by Noomi Rapace (The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo) discover an ancient cave map. With remarkable efficiency, four years later, the Prometheus space ship is landing on the moon depicted in the drawings. It's mission is to discover the origin of life. The crew make-up is almost identical to the crew in Alien, only this time we get an ice queen corporate director, played by Charlize Theron, to emphasize corporate greed and the lack of love for science.

Once the ship lands, we pretty much know what the search crew will find. That doesn't ruin the impact of the images. The strength of the movie comes from the visuals and effects. We never doubt that we are in a far away galaxy or that the aliens are real. This is one of the RARE times that the 3D version is recommended. Despite the dulled images caused by the glasses, this one was actually filmed in 3D and the effects really pop a few times.

There will be much debate over this film because it looks effectively creepy and fascinating ... downright phenomenal. However, it has many of what I call ""stupid movie character moments"". You know, those times when a character does or says something that just makes no sense - other than to create an opportunity for the filmmaker? There are plenty of those present here. The script is co-written by Jon Spaihts and ""Lost"" guru Damon Lindelof. The overall idea is brilliant and worth pursuing, however, the details and gaps are quite disappointing. We know there will be minor characters sacrificed in the name of creating fear in the survivors, but couldn't we have more than one strong character? The Noomi Rapace character has much in common with Sigourney Weaver's Ripley, but the others here are pretty generic.

Idris Elba plays the ship's captain, Guy Pearce plays Peter Weyland, the old man funding the mission and seeking immortality, and Logan Marshall-Green plays Rapace's partner and lover. The only other character of interest is Michael Fassbender's android David. He models himself after Peter O'Toole in Lawrence of Arabia, right down to the golden locks. Android technology has come a long way since Alien and David can be quite a wry smart-ass.

In the end, the sci-fi geeks will decide if this one deserves to live on, but for me, despite the breath-taking technological effects, it's not at the level of Alien. It was kind of humorous to hear a score that bears an uncanny resemblance at times to the iconic score of Inception. It seems that film's impact is nothing short of never-ending.","7"
"allmoviesfan","Prometheus","24 November 2022","Ridley Scott is back in the Alien universe, reminding us that he is one of the best filmmakers in the world via a taut and well-conceived origins story that answers a few questions about the titular creature that has for decades thrilled and terrified filmgoers. The crew of the Prometheus are on a mission to discover the origins of humanity, via star map they found in some ancient Earth artefacts. Of course, they reach the planet and discover they aren't alone, leading to some very tense scenes in a pyramid of some kind. There are a few good surprises late in the film. If 'Prometheus' starts off a little slowly, it certainly comes home with a wet sail.

I liked Charlize Theron as the no-nonsense. Vickers, a Weyland Corporation employee in charge of the expedition and Australia's own Guy Pearce, who plays an aged Peter Weyland.","7"
"marc-daniel","This could have been so damn good...","18 June 2012","With such a classic, already established story to play with from the sequels to this movie.. What happened here? Visuals are 10/10...but so are most movies these days.

I sat in the IMAX theatre with my 3D glasses on and after the initial 30 mins of draw dropping visuals, the stage was set... my brain sat there waiting to be taken into the story.... and there it waited... and waited .... for about the next 90 mins..

The big question that went through my mind during this movie was, did Scott actually read the script before he started making this movie? I could write this script, I really think I could, it's trivial. As a stand alone movie - outside of the Alien buzz, would anyone rate this higher than a 5 or 6/10? I'm from the Aliens era but loved Alien too. I actually saw this with some folks from my work, who are in their mid 20's and they thought this was a big let down. The movie as a whole is just weak... What is with the Guy Pearce story/makeup/space suit that helps him walk? Almost comical.

Mr Scott...Ridley, this is clearly an attempt at an Alien sequel, so let it be one, don't try to make it be something it is not.

Reading the comments from other viewers, there are loads of permutations of story that could have been or shouldn't have been but think the underlying tone here is - This movie could really have been a movie that we're all still talking about in 25 years time, just like people are today with Alien and Aliens.... Don't think that will be the case here.","5"
"Tweekums","Enjoyable if slightly messy 'Alien' prequel","9 January 2014","This much anticipated 'Alien' prequel opens with a humanoid alien standing above a waterfall and drinking something; he then collapses and breaks down into his component DNA. Flashing forward a group of archaeologists led by Elizabeth Shaw and Charlie Holloway on the Isle of Skye discover an ancient cave painting depicting people worshipping a giant who in turn is pointing to what their believe to be an alien solar system; an image that has been replicated in ancient art around the world. Shaw and Holloway believe these images indicated the location of a planet where a group of aliens they call 'Engineers' live and they believe these Engineers created all life on Earth. A few years later they take part in a mission to the indicated system and find a huge apparently artificial structure.

Inevitably things soon start to go wrong; the team trigger a holographic recording that leads them to an alien skeleton that has been decapitated by a closing door. David, the robot in the team, opens the door and they find hundreds of strange cylinders. Soon things start to go badly for the team as two members encounter strange creatures which attack and contaminate them, David deliberately infects Holloway with a liquid found in the cylinders and Shaw finds herself pregnant with something far from human. If that wasn't bad enough they discover a direct threat to Earth that will require extreme measures to prevent.

After hearing some fairly negative comments about this film I was a little wary about watching it as I really enjoyed the original 'Alien' films. Now I've seen it I can see why some people didn't like it but I thought it was pretty good; perhaps having low expectations helped. The first thing to say is that it isn't really an 'Alien' film; it is merely set in that universe. The treats were scary at times although nowhere near as frightening as 'Alien' with the possible exception of the scene were Shaw uses a medical device to remove her 'baby'.

The cast features a number of fine performances; most notable is Noomi Rapace who played Elizabeth Shaw; a protagonist who is quite different from the iconic Ellen Ripley; she is a more vulnerable character and it is by no means certain that she will survive. Michael Fassbender is great as David; nicely modelling the character on Peter O'Toole's T.E Lawrence. Other notable performances come from Idris Elba and Charlize Theron. One rather strange casting choice was having Guy Pierce playing a very old Peter Weyland in heavy makeup; I can only assume there were plans to show the character at a younger age at some point.

The special effects looked really good although at times I thought they were overused; holographic recordings and controls looked good but at times it felt the creators were showing off what they could do rather than do what was needed. The lead characters were interesting but there were a few too many minor characters who didn't serve much purpose other than to be killed off unfortunately before one could start caring about them. The plot was solid for the most part although it got overly convoluted at times; especially when we learn the real reason Weyland bankrolled the mission. The conclusion nicely tied in with the original 'Alien' film while also setting thing up for a sequel which could go off in an entirely different direction.","8"
"xnoblesoldierx","Why do people not like this?","4 June 2012","I thought it was very good. Although I had not previously seen any of the Alien films, I still expected much from this because of how successful those films were and how Prometheus was hyped up. So maybe people who really loved the Alien films had this too much hyped up and when they saw it, thought it was worse than it actually is.

Now, I have to say, on no account is it a masterpiece. But it is a very enjoyable, well thought piece of cinema that is worth watching more than once. The visual effects were amazing, as were the sets. And the 3D was very good.

The acting was terrific from all of them, especially Fassbender, who I assume will be soon getting into bigger and better films with Shame and this.

By the ending I assume they will make a sequel, which I look forward to and I will be first in line to watch it. A very good film. 8/10","8"
"joebloggscity","Reboot that just alienates....","30 December 2013","Okay, we've had plenty enough 'Alien' franchise and cross-over movies. Like most I love the first two and can pick & mix the rest.

But here we have a reboot from the majestic Ridley Scott, taking back the reins on this franchise. What we have is a beautifully made film with an interesting feel. Hankers back to the feel of the original film, and this 'prequel' doesn't opt to follow in the footsteps but takes an original way.

The main star is the majestic Michael Fassbender, who is fast becoming one of the best actors around. Loved him in Shame, and he excels here too with his fellow actors all chipping in well. Much to admire.

However, for all that I was just not immersed in the whole experience. Not much necessarily happens, and I was bored. This was not anything wholly new. I won't spoil things as there is some surprises and changes but not enough to make me wish to rewatch it.

There are themes of interest, but I wouldn't read too much into what was scripted. It just left me cold.

Bit underwhelmed with this film sadly, but I hope the next installments bring it all up to scratch. I really hope so.","5"
"MrGKB","Coulda, shoulda, woulda...","25 November 2012","...but didn't, mostly thanks to a script that yearns to live up to the 3D surcharge but can't quite cut it. I'm sure ""Prometheus"" looked great in the theaters, no doubt, but the story is too boneheaded at times to allow significant willing suspension of disbelief. Most anyone reading this already knows what I'm talking about. Although the story provides a genesis, of sorts, for the ""Alien"" chronology, ""Prometheus"" concerns itself with loftier conceits while ignoring a lot of common sense and natural laws along the way. The cast is fine, with Michael ""Band of Brothers"" Fassbender a standout as the morally ambiguous android, and Noomi ""The Girl With..."" Rapace as the dauntless heroine destined for a sequel likely to be just as loaded with ""oh, c'mon!s"" as its progenitor. The less spent the better, but worth a watch if only for the meticulous production design and special effects, basically a B-movie with an A-budget. Charlize ""Monster"" Theron groupies will not be sated, but neither displeased. Ultimately, ""Prometheus"" promises fire but settles for routine sci-fantasy with top flight visuals.","6"
"Loobster8","Can I get a refund of 2 hours and $21?","12 June 2012","Wow. Just wow. I am a huge fan of the Alien movies, and I refused to read or watch anything about Prometheus so that I could go in and watch it at the Imax without any expectation.

To start with, the cinematography and CGI is amazing. And Fassbender's performance is pretty damn good, hence the 4 stars.

And then everything else fails.

The plot was lame, the characters were devoid of personality, the aliens (10ft humanoids and a 4 armed squid are a MASSIVE disappointment after H.R. Giger's beautifully scary creations of the previous movies) and there are so many plot holes that I was left confused and full of questions.

One thing that I haven't read so far in the reviews here is how Holloway, after spending 6 hours on a new planet, with new lifeforms and a working alien terraforming facility (all of which would have a normal scientist jizzing all over the walls) is so angry and depressed because (from what I can gather) he hasn't quite found what he was looking for and so drowns his sorrows. Dude! What more could you want?! He was so ludicrous I laughed. And the caesarean? I sat there stunned and speechless! Charlize's death had me face-palming my forehead as I thought ""Just. Turn. Left."" And it clearly would have taken Noomi more than 1 minute 30 to run from the crashed ship to the pod. Plus she was running = uses more oxygen = would have died much earlier.

The musical score just didn't work. The music from Alien creeps me out so much that I have to skip it when it comes on my iPod. The music for this movie seemed like it was triumphant and for a completely different genre, like The Avengers or so. Prometheus has little to be triumphant about!

I know in many movies we have to just accept weird things, such as aliens and androids and superheroes, but we can't accept the nonsense this film throws at us. And most of that nonsense is the humans. Aliens can go ahead and do weird stuff for no reason because, well, they're aliens and we have no idea how they would react to anything. Humans though, USUALLY tend to get scared of unknown things and vagina-faced-snakes and get upset when someone in their vicinity gets scared/attacked/dies. Scott has lost touch with reality and the foundations of film making. Go away and retire!","4"

"arutha10002","When it wasn't boring, it was busy making no sense","13 June 2012","I wanted to love this movie. Instead, I got something that had some aliens in it, but neither the humans nor the aliens did anything logical except the mindless aliens. Charlize Theron's character did absolutely nothing in this movie. I'm being quite literal when I say if you took her out of the movie, there would be no changes at all.

Can't write much more without spoilers so ***SPOILERS*** OK, so it turns out the Engineers that created humans decided to wipe us out. Instead of doing something that makes sense, like crush us like the insects we are, they decided to create Xenomorphs/Aliens to destroy us. Not only is this dumb, because it'd make the planet uninhabitable to them in every conceivable way, it ends up destroying all by one Alien Engineer. It's funny, there is even a picture of the Xenomorphs as we later know them in Alien/Aliens, but they never appear this way in this movie. So where did that picture come from? That's just one example of how poorly done this movie is.

There's a robot, who is of course evil. However, he's not really malfunctioning or programmed to screw everyone over. He just does it because...no reason. He does it because the plot needed something to happen, I guess.

Then the one surviving Engineer is revived and doesn't miss a beat trying to destroy Earth. Does he care he's been asleep 2,000+ years? Does he care that everyone else is dead and that his bioweapon is uncontrollable? Nope, superior, genius life-forms don't need logic, knowledge or order.

There's not really much to recommend this movie. The acting is good, and the story is interesting, but most of what happens makes no sense. It happens because it supposed to happen, not because it makes sense to the plot or motivation of the characters.","4"

*** 1/2 (out of 4)

Ridley Scott's sci-fi/drama centers on a group of explorers who head out on a mission to another planet to try and see if they can discover who or what created life. I'll admit that I haven't been the greatest supporter of Scott over the years and I'll admit that this genre isn't always my favorite but I think it's clear that the director and genre go perfectly well together and PROMETHEUS is quite an achievement. I guess you could say that this here was one of the most anticipated movies to come out in quite a while and I think for the most part that it met most of its demand, although I'm sure repeat viewings will help it. I think what made the film so special to me is the fact that it was a real throwback to when sci-fi movies didn't have to be all special effects and no story. It seems for the past couple decades the majority of films in this genre have had zero brains and instead they've been replaced with loud explosions and poor CGI effects. This film here is pretty much all story, although those other elements are certainly on hand. I think it's clear that Scott wanted to take his time letting the viewers get to know the characters as well as making sure he could build up the actual story of what could be the end of Earth. All of the characters are extremely well detailed and thankfully so is the main story. The movie really does ask a lot of questions about the past, present and future situation of humans and I think the film does a very good job at letting the viewer make up their own minds. The screenplay is extremely well-written and perfectly gets all of the themes across. The performances are also exceptionally good with Noomi Rapace doing an excellent job in the lead role. She can perfectly play that strong female lead but also give emotion to the character. Charlize Theron is also very good in her role of the ship's leader who might just be hiding a few secrets of her own. Guy Pearce is also in good form even though he doesn't appear for too long. I think the real stand out was Michael Fassbender who plays a robot. Often these type of movies use CGI or some sort of stunt to give an actor a more robotic features but that's not the case here. The entire role is 100% acting and Fassbender does a terrific job and I sure think that it will stand up to being one of the best of the year. It's quite original, authentic and incredible believable considering he's playing an emotionless robot. The visual style of the film is also very impressive and especially the opening bits that really set up the mood of the film. The stuff dealing with the planet was also beautiful to see and the futuristic computers and visuals were also extremely well done. The models used for the aliens were quite good as well. I would say that I wasn't overly impressed with the 3D in the movie so I think saving money on the regular version would be just fine. PROMETHEUS is a film that doesn't try to dumb itself down for more mainstream appeal and instead it delivers good, R-rated adult entertainment. It makes you think with its story and makes sure that the story remains it's main goal. While the film falls short of being perfect I think it's certainly something original and something we haven't seen in a long time.",NA
"joe-is-sexy","Some great fun in 3D","10 June 2012","This movie was AWESOME. It had awesome CGI, some great graphics and some mind blowing 3D. The movie was at times VERY scary. But please see this movie, I will tell you in my review why you should...

The movie was highly entertaining and kept you looking, even in the gruesome and disgusting parts. The movie, as I mentioned before, had awesome CGI and a great storyline. The 3D was made perfectly.

The script was magnificent, as was the acting. This movie was directed by Ridley Scott, a director that can do a good movie and a bad movie, but this time he pulled it off. The acting was MAGNIFICENT, it was truly special.

Even though I wouldn't see the sequel, if they made one, I will still give this movie 10 stars, for being highly imaginative and really entertaining.","10"

"andrej-zvolensky","Disappointment","13 June 2012","First and huge disappointment is that Prometheus has at this time 7.7 score at IMDb.com. It is a bad joke.

There were lot of irrational scenes in this movies that made me sick. Guy drinks virus and is killed at the very beginning (pointless scene), people meeting each other at the end of the Prometheus journey. ""Hey father! You are also on this ship, that's great!"" Yes. I am. There are only 17 people on board and you haven't seen me boarding. Of course not. I hibernated myself in dinning room and asked my servants to put chamber with my body on board. So there was no chance to see me, but hey! Here I am trillion billion kilometers from earth. Yipiii.

""Action scenes"" worse than pathetic. And status ""horror"" is the same as ""comedy"". None of those is the correct one. Aliens made me sh*t my pants and I was scared in the nights many weeks after I've seen them. My life was over several times, cause I was sure there is a monster alien in our toilet. I am glad there were none, cause I can write you guys about this crappy movie Prometheus is. No scary scene, nothing what you could be expecting. While I think about it, it was a parody to aliens. Yeah, I got it now! Main point - our ""engineers"" going to destroy us to be able to create. So make me conclusion - they created us, they are going to kill us so they can create us again. Wow. What a magnificent idea! This is the greatest idea of all movies!!! First half hour was good but then I was watching time and was praying for the end. At the end, I was willing to accept it and swallow it. But no, another stupidity came along. Huge alien aircraft is rolling over last 2 people alive. It makes sense to outrun it (about 1 kilometer). Why would you make few meters to the side and - surprise! - you are saved.

Prometheus is one boring, pathetic and irrational piece of 2 hour sh*t. Only valuable thing on this movie are the computer effects - planets, equipment and everything. It looks really nice and life-like. Sorry Ridley, try again.","3"
"gnm-5","The movie has 3D... I have 7+ questions","22 June 2012","I saw it and I didn't like it. What is more, I am so disappointed that I am posting now my first ever review in IMDb just, for the sake of it. Too much is missing there, and above all - logic. It rather looks like a bad patchwork.

OK, I know this is meant for entertainment but still the pseudo-science in this movie is brought to unbelievable lengths. So, here are my 7+ questions:

1) Where is the logic behind the following: The engineer that ""infected"" the Earth with his DNA, was he some DNA-kamikaze? Come on, does that mean all life on Earth should have human DNA in it?

2)Where is the logic behind the following: The way the human scientists approached the unexplored planet, just flying over to see any artificial signs on its surface. Is a planet supposed to be that easy to explore? Like, let's fly over it and see from a bird's eye view if we can find something out? Really?

3) Where is the logic behind the following: On the 5th second of analyzing the atmosphere in the forsaken alien ship, and they removed their helmets, come on?

4) Where is the logic behind the following: In order to exterminate humans on Earth, the ""engineers"" had created some new alien-snakes? The ones that sow life on Earth could not think of anything smarter?

5) Where is the logic behind the following: The first thing the awakened ""engineer"" did was to start his ship towards the Earth to destroy life on it? Why did he have to spend 2000 years in cryostasis in the first place?

6)Where is the logic behind the following: The android infecting its superior with the alien DNA? Was the android curios? Any motives behind it? Or what was its motive to await the alien baby of the female doctor?

7) Where is the logic behind the following: The android at the end was trying to bargain with Elizabeth over its ""life""? Like ""please help me and I will help you""? Was it scared?

And I just don't want to go through all the goofs there...

I am sorry but I really wanted to enjoy this movie... and at the end, I did not...","3"
"naturalborndirector","H. R. Giger is credited in the end","31 May 2012","Both Dariusz Wolski and Arthur Max are underrated. Both masters of their craft, both outstanding visionaries and their talents collide here guided by great Ridley Scott. Visuals are always stunning and 3D is used as a powerful tool to underline the mesmerizing sets. The critics as often have no idea what this movie is really about. They keep blathering about lack of philosophy (what philosophy?). Make no mistakes, this is pure Alien franchise (read the header). I really don't get how can anyone, let alone movie critic can miss this. That is why Scott succeeds here, he reprises the perfect combination, which he has pioneered many years ago of Sci-Fi and Horror genre. What philosophy? The summer has just started, you movie critics. This movie is closer to ALIEN than ALIENS ever was. Ridley Scott's direction here should be taught in film-making text books. It starts off as an adventure, progresses into the thriller and ends up a hard-core gore monster horror, all the three inside the science fiction genre. Never it is an action movie, like ALIEN and unlike ALIENS. Never it is boring or outdated. Some scenes are if not revolutionary then unique in their technique of execution as well as their dramatic impact. During the birthgiving scene, I actually was dangerously close to fainting. Basically, if you prefer ALIENS over ALIEN, then I got nothing to say to you, but if you don't, then you are in for a ride you will never forget. What philosophy?","10"
"toropfc","So close to be good","3 July 2016","Imagine the most epic mission in the history of human kind. To discover our creators, meet them, to make the first contact with extraterrestrial beings in our history. Would you send a bunch of idiots on that kind of mission? I wouldn't. It's unexplainable how unprofessional Prometheus crew is. More likely they look like a group of rouge bandits, an outlaws who have hijacked the space wessel. Especially if you consider that they are carefully picked team of experts. It's a dangerous, deep space mission, and you would expect team of highly skilled professional soldiers, armed and disciplined, and a few scientists. Instead, we have cynics, smart guy's, booze drinkers and cowards. Next thing, we have two guys who were so stupid to get lost in the hostile alien complex, after they lost their nerve on first sight of decapitated alien body. Of course they were terrified when they saw a pile of mutilated alien bodies later, that's reasonable. But why they tried to pet a snake like creepy monster which emerged from muddy liquid, that I don't understand. I felt a certain joy when it broke his arm. And doctor who was contaminated by robot ( liked him the most), why he didn't say that something is going on with him? At least to his wife? I mean, they are on a deep space mission, it's reasonable to report if you see a hostile specimen in your eye. But never mind, I forgot that they are group of undisciplined morons. I think I would handpicked a better crew in some local tavern. And the last thing, Sharliz Theron is running away from gigantic spinning wheel, and she is not moving from it's direction. Oh common!!! She had plenty of time to run like 10m on either side and she would save herself. Hope the sequel will be better.","5"
"psalfate","A worthy dollar movie","3 June 2012","Movie starts with an amazing landscaping takes and a bunch of archaeologist that seems to find one of the many proof that man have had previous contact with advanced civilizations. Then we jump 3 or some years in the future to a start-ship which location is mentioned to something like 10^14 away from earth, wow that must be really far I thought. So at this point I'm trying to figure it out what's the connection between some rustic paintings and a ship so far away from earth.

After the alien introduction, playing alone on the ship, and the whole crew waking up, the plot starts to develop. apparently a wealthy guy (like in contact 1997) paid the expedition to these archaeologists to go there and see if they find the ""creators"" or the ""engineers"".

As is explained this guys were able to convinced the wealthy guy to go there with no more argument that the paintings and a Hunch from one of the archaeologist. pretty weak reason I said.

Dialog were bad, specially Theron's one, she is not able to perform as the bad one, she is not able to set the necessary tension between the eagerness to investigate and her personal ambitions.

So I think this is one of the worst human alien contact recorded on a movie, they have a robot who spoke his language, yet this alien who suppose to be more advance that everyone in the room , starts trowing punches everywhere. I laugh at that on the theater.

I watched Mission to Mars (2000) and its almost the same plot, just one difference, those aliens were good

anyway, somebody explain me how a woman get into surgery and 5 minutes later starts jumping , fighting and running everywhere.

The director forgot to introduce the whole cast on the movie as well, He doesn't give the chance to we as viewers to connect with them, so there is a bunch of people that hardly had a line.

The robot is the only one who can have save out of this madness of movie, but the movie is so long , and at the end this robot cant keep his mouth shut, that was laughable.

the inconsistencies dialog tried to cover the big holes on the script a real shame.

Go to the dollar theater for this one, you will just loose that and 2 hours and 23 minutes of your life.","2"
"rzajac","Great premise; disappointing execution","10 October 2012","Prometheus is a fantastically made flick; some truly great dialog; fine acting; superb effects; from a mythic aspect, a damn sight better than most high-toned sci-fi.

But I found myself, at one point, sort of shouting at the screen, ""What are you *doing*?!?!"" And what were they doing? Is there absolutely no way they could have continued exploring the carefully groomed thematic premise, without sidelining the whole wondrous business by falling back on a stinger involving a bio-weapon bestiary? I guess that's my point: It's the tone. A good story has to manage the tone. The flick was doing very, very well, having settled on a tone involving a major step forward in the unraveling of the greatest mystery; the mystery of where we come from.

But then there's this abrupt plot shift; an arbitrary-seeming looming danger. After a while, characters make the connection, and let us in on why the danger is there. OK. And the story sort of sews everything up at the end, as the hero whizzes off to further research this surprising and unexpected fillip in the story.

But that doesn't change the fact that the effect, as the abrupt shift presents itself, is one of being slapped in the face and not treated like a discerning consumer of narrative.

You kind of have to see it to understand. I'm not saying that the story ""let me down"" by daring to shift gears. I love narrative that runs off the rails, if it's done well: I love the Coen Brothers' work. I'm saying that, in the context set up by the first third of the work, the introduction of scary little monsters really takes a steaming dump on something delicate and tantalizing. It did not make it more tantalizing, or artfully change the tone of the interest.

It's interesting to note places where the writers thought they could plop in lines that would ameliorate the weirdness of the tone shift.

Anyway.... I guess I have to say that, for all the fire and passion the producers invested in making this technically incredible artifact--and for all the obvious passion and clear-headedness they invested in the even-tempered and engaging first third--the net product is severely wanting. You should probably skip it.","6"
"dcobbimdb","What a waste of time","8 June 2012","So honestly I was so anticipating this movie that I had broken the cardinal rule and looked at ratings and even skimmed the first couple pages of reviews on here and the interesting thing is most times the figures and the reviews coincide. However this time that certainly wasn't the case and I can tell you honestly that did not alter my review or even skew it in any way. I have no idea how this movie got such a high score but it isn't true by any means

This movie was overall boring and very predictable... I went there opening day along with a work morale event. Now if I'd paid for my ticket I would have been even more disappointment. As it was I was overall very unsatisfied and expected much more from Ridley Scott. Hell even Legend which was much more of a bomb than this had so much more to offer. There was absolutely no suspense at all but more importantly as a Sci-Fi (and I'm a total Sci-Fi guy) from the start I was never reeled in at all, not once as it was just so flat. I felt like I was in a seat at a theater bored out of my skull and at one point I looked down at my phone to discover I was an hour into the movie and debated about walking out as it was that boring. However I stuck it out because I had nothing better to do than go back to work (tough choice huh). So I stuck it out and the second half wasn't any more suspenseful or action packed than the first half and I really felt let down on this flick as I was so looking forward to it. Talk about missing the mark.. Great job Ridley, you flubbed t his one up big time...

The suspense or tension was obsolete. The acting was nothing memorable other than the captain of the ship whom I don't even know who he was. the two main big stars (Charlize Theron and Michael Fassbender) were flatter than flat although Michael was decent I suppose for his android role he was given, but seriously they could have given away Charlize's role to some other lesser paid actor as her role was so wooden and stone cold that there was really no dimension or acting ability there.

So other reviews had mentioned the spectacular effects and IMHO I didn't think they were at all that notable at all, which was the films other saving grace. nothing from the ship, the planet, the atmosphere, the tunnels, nothing at all left me going ""ahhhh..."" So in the end this movie IMHO fell flat on it's face. The co-workers that I went with gave it a little more than I but not much. This is by no means a gem and should a sequel be done it should not be directed by Ridley who as far as I'm concerned was a well respected director who apparently doesn't have the juice anymore. And such a disappointment being he directed the first Alien movie...","1"
"abbash","The Big Picture","24 February 2021","In my opinion, Prometheus is a very misunderstood movie. I believe it is a good sci-fi movie with great visuals, action, and mystery. It raises great questions about humanity's place in the bigger universe and how the xenomorphs from the original Alien came to be. It doesn't answer every one of the questions it raises, rather leaving most of them up to the viewer's interpretation. I think this bothered a lot of people who wanted the answers to all the questions the movie raises. I like the fact that the movie encourages you to do some research after you've watched it to fully understand it. This makes a second viewing even more enjoyable as the things you didn't understand the first time make a lot more sense on this viewing. You could argue that it shouldn't be necessary for the viewer to research a movie after watching it. I enjoy it when movies are left ambiguous. This leads to a movie lingering in your mind days after you watched it.

Like many people have pointed out, there are some faults with the movie. I feel like Weyland's surprise reveal near the end was unnecessary and I wasn't sure why he was faking his death to meet the Engineers. Instead of just revealing his true intentions to the crew from the start. Another thing that bothered me was how Shaw and Holloway just assumed that the Engineers were the creators of humanity without any proof. Shaw's line that it's simply what she ""chooses to believe"" was ridiculous in my opinion.

Yes, the characters make some pretty dumb decisions. The scene where the biologist is trying to pet the mutated worm is a great example of this. I can forgive this however because what follows this is a pretty epic scene where the worm breaks the biologist's arm, enters his mouth, and kills him. I chose not to be too bothered by stuff like this and simply enjoyed the movie. Movies are meant as a means of escaping our lives for a few hours. Nitpicking everything the characters do is going to spoil any movie you're watching. Instead of focusing on the small faults in the movie, I chose to enjoy all the movie has to offer. The opening sequence and the 'David in the Orrey' scene are stunning to look at. The alien removal scene, Fifield's mutation, and the Engineer/ Tribolite scenes were intense action scenes that kept me on the edge of my seat. I also really appreciated that props were given more importance over CGI.

In conclusion, Prometheus is a very entertaining movie with stunning visuals, great acting, intense action, and a beautiful soundtrack.","9"
"greghoroski","I feel like i felt when I learned Santa wasn't real.","21 November 2012","This was very poorly done. Guy Pearce and Theron phoned in their roles. The story premise had real potential, then al la European movies leaves the motivations a mystery to the viewer. This has no place in classic sci fi.

Fact based assumptions and potential outcomes are the film makers responsibility. Ridley must have phoned in his work as well. Idris Elba very talented Brit uses a ghetto voice? Really what the heck? Even the elongated shooting techniques left me cold because they only work to exaggerate an already taut script, which this by no mean was.

The ending was a throw in so the Alien movie stands in continuum. Of course based on this movie to what end is it to travel to their home planet? The humanoid awakened in the movie had the personality of the Howard Hawks the thing from the 50's movie. The disdain and brutality towards humans will be only magnified on their home planet after killing their emissary. Leave little to discuss.","4"
"oliverthered","Well I didn't fall asleep","21 June 2013","Basically this movie is like a very expensive b-movie (though only one funny 'horror' moment) version of 2001 a space odyssey without the music or suspense and the end is the only bit worth watching.

I would elaborate, but it's hard to do without putting any spoilers in, since there is so little to this movie; probably 10-15 minutes that are notable, then the rest you'll have to get some matchsticks out to stop you're self falling asleep. I think it took approximately 50 minutes into the movie before anything happened ymmv.

The acting was a little dry and the scant plot elements where so brief that it became difficult to work out what had gone on in the few minutes that something did go on. On several occasions I was left thinking, did that actually happen, Oh I must have missed it.... maybe I did nod off, who knows.

The horror elements are b-movie esque with poor special effects that aren't in keeping with the polish of some of the visuals throughout the movie, though the visuals enough are not enough to create a kind of atmosphere you'd find in 2001 a space odyssey and the lack of, well anything, along with dry acting leave very little, if any, in the way of suspense through the long, slow parts of the movie.

If you liked the other films by this director you'll probably be very disappointed.","2"

The plot, such as it was, did not hang together. There were holes a- plenty, as pointed out by countless others in the reviews and message board.

The characters had no apparent motivation for what they did, and some of what they did made no sense. The android, at least, had an excuse--he's a machine. Machines can be incorrectly programmed. The humans, however--inexcusable.

The acting? Mediocre. The best thing I can say about the movie is that a few of the special effects were good. Aside from that, don't waste your time.","1"
"lost-in-limbo","Caught in two minds.","23 June 2020","I remember looking forward to Prometheus when I heard it was going into production, and the intrigue only grew to see it when released. When I got back from the cinema. I thought it partly delivered on what I expected. And I still feel the same years later after a rewatch. A good Sci-fi/thriller to watch on a big-screen with its grand ambitions and spectacular special effects, but in the end I still felt rather underwhelmed by the storytelling. While inventive, I wouldn't call it enjoyable. Visually enticing, but lyrically muddled. What starts off as collected and rational, only becomes a rash of ideas that are messily pieced together. Sometimes agreeable, but other times not so. Quite hot and cold. Disappointing since its themes are indeed ambitious. I would even throw in its use of suspense. Outside one or two sequences, it just lacked the punch and the momentum to sustain its long-winding build-up. The environment was alienating, but the increasing danger lacked any real sort of impact. Maybe this is because of the writing... mainly due to its rigid character development and choppy plot threads. Outside of Noomi Rapace and most notably Michael Fassbender, no other actor (Charlize theron, Idris Elba, Sean Harris and Guy Pearce) really stands out or leaves a lasting impression. Ridley Scott's direction crafts out many striking set-designs and backdrops are jaw-dropping. While not perfect, it does get you talking after its finished about the flaws, but also its strong themes and imagery.","5"
"joewa","Sack the writer!!","21 July 2012","I hadn't heard much about this movie when I saw it at the cinema, and only realised towards the end that it was the prequel to Alien so my expectations weren't artificially raised.

In my humble opinion there are four key areas where the writing of this film fails:

Believability: I expected the usual blockbuster continuity errors and lack of logic however the amount in this film was so significant it became irritating, and I'm normally a lot more patient with bad films at the cinema. I'm not going to go into each one but believe me there were many. Also there seemed to be very little 'science' involved in this 'science' fiction flick.

Character empathy: There was absolutely none, even less than Alien. So when characters were killed, you didn't really care either way.

Story pace: Very erratic, seemed almost unplanned.

Film Empathy: (**Spoiler Alert**)With this sort of film I feel the audience should be given what they want as the story unfolds. I'm all for twist or two in the story, but telling us at the beginning of a film you are going to explain how we are all created and then move the story on to a pathetic slimy unseen enemy which has nothing to do with the former seems a real let down.

In short this is not a film for anyone with any intelligence. You'll just get angry with it.

Apparently Jon Spaihts was originally asked to write two Alien prequels by Ridley Scott, lets hope Ridley chooses someone else instead!","2"
"DietCoke13","I guess in the year 2093, they don't have any pre-flight protocol","19 May 2013","Apparently, a corporation that was willing to spend a trillion dollars on an expedition to find other ""life"" in the universe, didn't bother to spend any money on the viability of a crew for such a mission. It becomes immediately apparent that one of the crew members, the ""geologist"" (who, by the way NEVER gets any rock samples), exhibits extremely anti-social behavior. It boggles the imagination that this extreme character flaw was not detected in any pre-flight examination. Also, the ""biologist"", whose job, just by his title, should be excited that they actually find a life form (even if it is dead), absolutely freaks out at the first sight of said life form. The two of them react so unbelievably ridiculous and start crying that they want to go back to the ship. They also have what is supposed to be a ""meteorologist"" on board who apparently cannot see that an extreme weather situation is approaching. Even a local TV weatherman has better skills than this guy. The absurdity continues when they ""bag"" this dead head in what appears to be a zip-lock bag. Even more ridiculous is how they ""examine"" this head when they get back to the ship. There are so many examples of the stupidity of this crew, that IMDb doesn't give me enough space to point them all out (the ""surgery"" that is performed and her super-human ability to run, jump, etc. afterwards...the guy who just opens the door after the Captain says something appears outside of it, etc.etc.etc. Are there no quarantine procedures in place on this ship other than a flamethrower? I could go on and on and on. The only interesting part of this movie was when they wake up the huge, really pale guy from his hypersleep chamber. It doesn't take this guy but a few seconds to figure out what I have pointed out above, as he immediately starts killing them off. I guess I expected a better movie considering that Ridley Scott was the director.","2"

No new fibers or textiles? Hipsters in space?

Alien and Aliens worked well because the characters were real, and the environments were familiar; industrial plant, research building. That's what makes a bug hunt scary, bad things in a familiar environment. Bad things in an alien, creepy environment begs the theater comment ""Don't walk down the tunnel, fool!""

One more question - 2,000 years the alien bodies have been in the moist warm tunnel and they are still there?

"DimitryVanLaere","Disappointing beauty.","31 May 2012","(31/05/2012, Antwerp)

Yesterday evening had finally come. There I sat in the best seat of the theatre, the air teeming with the smell of hyped anticipation and slight nervosity. There was a healthy amount of Belgians and Dutch people present in Kinepolis Antwerp, but I wouldn't say the theatre was chock-full.

With 3D glasses on (for the first time) I was in anticipation of awesomeness. The first thing I noticed, while watching a cool trailer for The Hobbit, was that I found the 3D absolutely awful. Luckily it wasn't bad at all during Prometheus, which did a very good job as far as the 3D goes. Anyways, I will not be watching movies in 3D again, as I still find it incredibly gimmicky.

Okay, on to the real deal. Prometheus.

You'd think a search for the origin of mankind would be full of danger, conflict, excitement, wonder and probably a little bit of terror as well. Prometheus shows us it's primarily quite boring.

Even people who have never before written a novel or screenplay know the necessity of tension and release, of carefully paced out highs and lows, of a gradual build-up towards a climax. Prometheus proves us even well-paid professionals can be quite oblivious to these basic writing rules and that they can be happy about a story as flat as sweet Noomi's bosom, even though it looks stunning on the whole.

I can only tremble at the foresight of the vast tidal waves of hate that will soon reach a certain screenwriter, but I won't add to that. I will however be very wary of any film that this person is involved with from now on, that's for certain. (In case you're still unsure who I'm talking about, it's NOT Jon Spaihts, as I know he is capable of great things.)

However, even though it pains me to do so, there is someone else who I'd like to point my finger at in disappointment, someone who I know to be incredibly skilled: Sir Ridley Scott. Someone of his calibre should've recognized the weaknesses in the script and demanded they throw entire pages straight in the recycling bin. ""A very interesting and fascinating take on things, boys, but please do rewrite most of act 2 and especially act 3. At once, if possible."" That's what he should've said.

Alas, he did not, which means he was pleased with the result. A very painful mistake, Sir Ridley.

Just as troublesome is the fact he didn't deliver what he promised: ""I'm looking to scare the living crap out of people."" The etheric smell of rosemary and mint my boxer shorts are still spreading upon inspection (as always) is proof of the contrary. For an evening of intense terror I'd recommend watching another film (Alien would be a great place to start if you haven't seen it). Even the (minimal) work of H.R. Giger couldn't get me into the state of anxiety I longed for. By the way, it doesn't take long to realize the monster design in Prometheus did NOT spring from Giger's sinister brain, that's for certain.

If Ridley truly lost it, then I'm afraid I'd rather not see a sequel to Blade Runner.

Okay, all this would almost make me forget all the good things about Prometheus. The cinematography and special fx were absolutely breath-taking (we CAN thank Ridley for the former), the music was really fitting and well-placed during editing (even though it isn't particularly memorable), the acting by primarily Noomi Rapace (I still love you <3) and Michael Fassbender was excellent, and the set design was hot. Yes, hot.

To conclude: + cinematography (also excellent 3D when compared to the trailers before the film) + effects + sound + acting (Rapace, Fassbender) + set design - script is ridiculously flat, very underwhelming ""climax"" (if you can call it that) - story tries to be deep, but it really isn't - most characters feel like nothing but cannon fodder, one-dimensional - little emotion - monster design

Others did kind of like the film however, so I recommend forming your own opinion. But be warned. I also want to point out I had high expectations, like most of us. But it pains me to tell you I was wrong. We were so wrong.

"stefanosk27","Watchable movie, Rubbish script, Unorthodox characters","5 October 2012","I'm a big Sci-Fi fan but I have to say I hate 90% of Sci-Fi movies that are out there. Prometheus was not an exception either. While the movie is not boring, there are so many flaws on the script that makes it just another flat, Blockbuster Sci-Fi movie.

Nothing makes sense on that movie. The ""scientific"" personnel of the spaceship acts over the top all the time, just as if they were mindless criminals or something. On several life-changing revelation scenes where we'd be expecting an analog reaction from the characters, we just a ""oh, what the heck"" line. Most of the astronauts from the very beginning are making it clear that don't want to be where they're going (that is an alien habited planet). For God's sake, why did you get on that ship on the first place??? Everyone acts in a completely unorthodox way.

More than that, the plot itself is nothing unique. A similar story has been told a hundred times on the cinema, most often with a better outcome. Prometheus is just another Action Sci-Fi movie with swallow characters, a common plot and completely unorthodox reactions at almost every scene.

Please, if you have to make a Sci-Fi movie, for God's sake make a good script first! Kubrick was not stupid that hired the best Sci-Fi writer for his 2001 movie!","5"

"ExploringFilm","Bad... just bad.","2 June 2012","Let's not beat about the bush, Prometheus is bad, two hours plus of Absolute Nonsense. Poor script, plot holes like a bloody minefield. Quasireligious references placed not-so-subtly throughout and annoyingly, unbelievably stupid (or lack of) characters and character choices. Just wondering, is Ridley going mad or senile in his later days? I seriously hope he stops making blockbusters; his oeuvre has been utterly terrible since that movie where Orlando Bloom plays a blacksmith that saves Jerusalem and/or the world from a bearded guy or something.

I can't even start to pick apart this film, it's too much and frankly it's not worth it. Just imagine Alien upside down, take anything that was good about it, ram a black, slimy Hollywood's development execs CGI tentacle through it and watch the irregular, black splotch on your screen.

"socrates99","Ridley has made a personal plea for our species here","10 June 2012","Mr Scott is the only filmmaker I'd ever want to sit down with and enjoy a long conversation, I think. The vision displayed in Blade Runner and Aliens is as sharp and deep as it gets. I wish I could conjure up such landscapes but I'm glad someone can. Prometheus is not in the same category as those other films. It's more an addendum to both.

I enjoyed watching it, Ridley is too good at what he does to not make an enjoyable film, but it's rather clumsy in its basic thrust. That's mostly to do with the screenplay which doesn't seem to direct the action in an optimal way given what the movie is really about. There should have been far more made of Weyland's quest to know his maker, for example. (He's the dead billionaire who finances the deep space expedition.) And there are problems with motives for some of the other major characters as well.

Unlike many of the other reviewers, I think Fassbender, who I think is pretty much single-handedly rewriting acting standards, is not the natural focus of the film. Instead it falls on Noomi Rapace who as Dr Shaw makes me a bit uncomfortable. She's a little too odd to play the hero, or even take the lion's share of the screen time, in my opinion. I also didn't think Theron's role was well-advised. It's a little too inexplicable and cold for my taste though I generally eat up everything Charlize does.

In the end I was left a little dissatisfied though I had plenty to think about. And that's worth quite a bit more than the price of a ticket.","8"
"musickrev","A complete mess","4 September 2013","I borrowed ""Prometheus"" and the original ""Alien"" from the local library and watched them back-to-back.

It's striking how much ""Prometheus"" borrows from the original film. The lingering opening shots of the spacecraft, the on-screen data specifications, the waking from hibernation, crew members moving through poorly lit corridors, a mercenary android who loses his head but continues a conversation, aliens who delight in killing, the sole survivor a strong-willed woman - these are just some of the similarities.

Sadly though, because I expected more, much more, ""Prometheus"" fails on every level compared to ""Alien"". The script is very badly written and poorly acted by the majority of the cast. Noomi Rapace is particularly unconvincing and Guy Pearce is completely wasted acting an old man. The only actors I warmed to were paradoxically playing cold characters, Michael Fassbinder's David8 and Charlize Theron's Meredith Vickers.

Obviously a lot of money was spent on sets and special effects, and it looks good. The explorer's spaceship looks far more technologically advanced despite being chronologically younger than the tatty old ""Nostromo"" with its cathode ray tube computer monitors and graphics- challenged screen displays, but as a believable space ship, the craft from ""Alien"" is so superior.

""Alien"" worked well because Scott had learned a lot from Kubrick's ""2001"" about pacing and atmosphere. ""Prometheus"" again borrows from ""2001"" but without any sense of originality being put to good use, it simply makes ""Prometheus"" look derivative. A shared scene is an astronaut about to run out of air just making it into the airlock in time. This ended up as a completely ho-hum scene compared to Kubrick's similar take.

Thinking about ""2001"" merely adds to the dismay I feel about ""Prometheus"". Both films share very similar concepts - alien life acting as an evolutionary stimulant in the development of humanity and the attempt of a future generation to locate those aliens - but whereas ""2001"", despite its glacial pacing, enthralls me from beginning to end, ""Prometheus"" left me simply puzzled or uninvolved.

OK, so it's science fiction and I don't expect real science or even real philosophy but the shallowness evidenced throughout the film was breathtaking.

I did like the opening scene, some very Kubrickian aerial landscape shots, and the title music with its opening horn call, very Vaughan Williams (think 5th Symphony), is pleasing.

But overall, a complete mess.","3"

I have to wonder if it's the 'me' generation, entering theatres to simply criticize without letting the story carry them into worlds of fascinating adventure. I've been watching movies since The Thing From Another World (still a favorite) scared the hell out of me, and have watched as sci-fi movies just keep getting better.

All I can do is advise people to see a movie before consulting any online set of ratings, as they may well lead you away from a movie you might have loved, had you watched it first. Prometheus gave me two hours of total enjoyment, but I was soon after sickened by what I read about it here. Oh well... Live and learn!","9"
"meeza","Ridley Scott is a real sci-fi PRO!","11 June 2012","I promise I will not reveal too much about the plot of the Ridley Scott sci-fi sensation ""Prometheus"" because that would put me in an illegal alien status for cinematic spoiling. But what I will reveal is that ""Prometheus"" is so far the best movie I have traveled to in 2012. The film stars Noomi Rapace who was the girl with the alien I mean dragon tattoo. Rapace stars as Dr. Elizabeth Shaw, a scientist who travels to the darkest portions of the universe in trying to discover the origin of the human race. In her quest, she is accompanied by her scientist boyfriend Dr. Charlie Holloway portrayed by Logan Marshall-Green. They travel with other explorers in the spaceship Prometheus. The P.E.T. (Prometheus Explorer Team) includes the stellar Michael Fassbender who portrays the robotic David with android precision. And there is Idris Elba who plays the ship's captain Janek; and not-to-be-forgotten is the luscious Charlize Theron who portrays Meredith Vickers, the mission's orchestrator who is just going along for the ride due to external pressure from a certain ""Guy"" as in Pearce; I will not elaborate on that one. But the star of ""Prometheus"" is really the iconic sci-fi auteur Ridley Scott, whose directorial hand was phenomenal in bringing us another sci-fi cinematic discovery. I enjoyed the craftiness of Jon Spaiths and Damon Lindelof's ""Prometheus"" screenplay, even with the human-origination discovery quest inclusion which a few critics thought was a bit too clone-like of the one in ""2001: A Space Odyssey"". What is definitely looming in the future of Academy Award mankind is Oscar nominations for ""Prometheus"" in the visual effects, cinematography, art direction, and editing categories; just some major technicalities there for you. Rapace overacted a tad in the picture as Shaw, but still proved that Noomi is looming for a bright thespian career. The acting showstopper of ""Prometheus"" who keeps on ticking throughout the movie was Michael Fassbender as David; there is a scientific possibility that there will be several supporting actor nominations quite possible here for Fassy in the future of the world of award circuits for the year 2012. ""Prometheus"" does move a bit slow during its onset; but remember that ""big things have small beginnings"". ***** Excellent","9"
"Animus","An amazing idea that is ruined pretty quickly","20 October 2012","The opening sequence was the best part of the film, the idea is that on a barren world capable of sustaining life, one of these ""engineers"" sacrifices himself to start the evolutionary process.

Beautiful.

BUT the question that keeps popping up in the movie is ""Why""?

Why would it be necessary to do so, I mean they have interstellar travel capability, why not just mix up some ""evolutionary soup"" and drop it in the ocean, why sacrifice someone?

************************Spoiler alert*****************

If the planet was supposed to be earth then why did we evolve into a genetically identical species after 3 billion years?

Even if it wasn't Earth, then why would they visit us several times and leave us a map of how to find them, when the map only points us to an outpost world where they park ships?

Why were the engineers fleeing through their ship into a room full of hyper-evolutionary bio-juice? What was chasing them and what happened to it?

Why does the last of these engineers, asleep for 2000 years, want to kill everyone the moment he wakes up? Why would he want to wipe out our world? I know I can be grumpy when I wake but that's a bit extreme.

Some thoughts occurred to me that maybe these bio-warfare engineers were not the same as those seen in the beginning sequence, but that would mean more than one species of genetically identical sentient beings arose on different worlds in roughly the same time frame which would take us into whole new realms of improbability. If they were the same engineers as those in the beginning and that was Earth, then they haven't evolved much at all in 3 billion years. Too many questions, no where near enough answers.

And that's not even going into the ridiculousness of the crew and the Prometheus.

Between archaeologists who poke everything and contaminate locations that have been sealed for 20 centuries, space suits with GLASS bubble helmets, hyper advanced auto-docs that can't handle the difference between male and female anatomy, reanimating alien heads that have been dead for 2000 years, frail old men who survive hibernation which we see makes healthy people weak and sick, and scientists who don't know the difference between carbon dioxide (CO2, not deadly at 3% purity) and carbon monoxide (CO, deadly at 1.2% purity)

I have to say the movie fails on almost all levels of sense-making.

"hwaite","Easily Avoidable","17 June 2012","Prometheus follows the same formula as 'Event Horizon' and a thousand other sci-fi horror flicks before it. Incautious scientists discover alien life. Shady corporate interests get involved. A dormant evil is released. Characters make poor decisions and get picked off one by one. A lone hero survives -- queue ambiguous ending. It's difficult to follow this recipe and deliver something that is both exciting and plausible. Unfortunately, Ridley Scott fails on both counts.

It's a shame that the man behind 'Alien' and 'Blade Runner' has sunk to such mediocrity. Scott makes beautiful movies but needs a good writer to pull things together. Collaborating with Damon Lindelhof doomed Prometheus from the start. Not since 'The Matrix' has a dying franchise spewn so much pseudo-intellectual drivel. Prometheus is little more than an absurd collection of clichés masquerading as a 'deep' film. It seems that no one could agree on the characters' motivations or even a consistent set of rules for the alien lifecycle. In the end, they just threw together a bunch of slick-looking nonsense and called it a day. That Lindelhof is the deranged mind behind 'Lost' explains a lot.

I don't expect complete believability but Prometheus is a bridge too far. In addition to making mockeries of biology, physics and chemistry, the movie infuses no logic into its characters' behavior. The handling of the most important discovery in human history is just stunningly incompetent at every level. If we ever send such a collection of morons as interstellar emissaries, the human race deserves to be exterminated. It's not just that the cast seems unfamiliar with basic safety protocols or simple contingency planning. Rather, they seem to be actively pursuing catastrophe. As Prometheus' crew stumbles from one easily avoidable disaster to the next, the viewer is left wondering ""what did they think would happen?"" In this movie, death is rarely the result of unlucky cascading failures or unpredictable turns of events. Instead, characters' demise is simply the most likely result of their own reckless actions. Everyone in this movie has a death wish.

'Prometheus' is similar to 'The Thing' and 'Star Wars' prequels. In each case, directors take a beloved classic and try to fill in the blanks. Not only do the new movies fail but they also suck the life out of the original films by ruining the mystery of it all. Someone needs to take the Alien franchise out back and put a bullet in its head. It's the humane thing to do.","5"

"andreipaul812","Alien(s) with magic flutes! IN SPACE!","13 June 2012","Prometheus endeavors on a noble quest, striving to demystify the origins of the Human race. It touts a mighty fine cast, big production values, ""the"" Ridley Scott, Weyland Corp., 3D Aliens and aliens, sharp sticks and electronic ball breakers, but ends up asking even more questions and answering too few.

This film is largely the brainchild of cult director Ridley Scott and Damon Lindelof. On the latter, suffice to say he is credited as the creator of the television show ""Lost"", best known for its cliffhanger galore as it seems to enjoy an either love it or have nothing to do with it vibe from viewers. Mr. Scott has been present at the inception of the Alien saga, as director of the film, fleshing out on the creature and mythos behind it with H.R. Geiger. Alien ""bursted"" into a multimillion dollar franchise with countless sequels, cross-overs (AvP), video-games and pretty much whatever else there is that you can bank on.

Prometheus opens with beautiful shots of what seems to be pre-historic Earth, and within the first few minutes we get a wide shot of an alien ship and a human looking alien, bowing and frolicking around a waterfall. Back to the future, it's 2080 something and we learn that these beings are called engineers"" and deliberately left signs all over Earth for us to come and find them. Luckily, a future Richard Bronson in the person of Peter Weyland, an eccentric billionaire who owns a mega-corporation with his namesake, funds the mission.

And we're away! In space!

Mr. Scott manages to recreate every sci fi movie (including his own) about an expedition gone wrong, as the scientists and personnel go into a pyramid / temple. We can see things from the suit-cameras, of course, since Cameron did it in Aliens and even Scott dabbled about it in Alien. Suddenly, a nasty storm erupts, (yes, just like Alien, I will not mention this from now on), and a race ensues to get back to the ship. Needless to say, throughout the temple scenes tension is absolutely lacking, since we saw the engineer"" at the first minute mark of the movie. When you show the audience what the protagonists are searching for before they actually find it, there is no more mystery, despite of what the film's score tries to tell us. The characters are lacking substance and completely forgettable, as even the movie tends to forget them from time to time. During the storm mentioned earlier, 2 of the crew are left unawares in the temple, even though they obviously heard what was going on through their suits. When the shot comes back to them, they seem to only serve the movie as to be the protagonists of some sort of ""snake-rape"". One of them survives, somehow, and emerges in zombie-fifield state and attacks the rest of the crew. Don't worry, he only kills nameless characters who didn't get even a frame before the money shot came.

""David"", Michael Fassbender's character, spends half his time aboard the ship and half insider the temple, opening doors and pushing buttons. As he tries to learn how to manipulate the alien technology without success, a breakthrough comes in a form of a holographic replay of the previous occupants of the temple. So, we learn that with all their technology and gene-manipulation, the engineer race used a flute to turn on their machinery. Yes. Playing a flute will start up all the gadgets in the place, so David plays it exactly like in the holograph. How did he know which notes to play, you say? Nonsense. This is space flute playing at its best. IN SPACE!

Some more shocking revelations later, the (in)famous chestburster scene from Alien is avoided when Noomi Rapace's character, ""Shaw"" learns that she has a huge parasite baby living inside her and decides to perform surgery on herself. Yes, you read that right. On herself. Live. This is arguably the most memorable scene and ironically the anti-climax, as she is stitched back up and the extracted squid-like creature is left in stasis. Actually the rest of the movie she spends on her own two feet, running from all kinds of nasty. So, nothing bad happens, but ehmhorror? Nope, doesn't work that way, sorry.

The film ends with a cliffhanger a la Lost. We catch a glimpse of the proto-Alien and Shaw goes out to ""get some answers"" from the engineer homeworld on her own. Actually, she is not alone as she is sporting an android head in a duffelbag. Sequel away!","6"
"derinquizitor","Spectacular and entertaining but...","30 May 2012","...beware. If you enjoyed ""Alien"" and ""Aliens"" and have very high expectations as I did, you will be disappointed. Not by the visuals, extremely good, and the acting, good IMO, but by the script. In a way, I feel I fell in a marketing trap.

This film was marketed as an Alien film, in this way : ""A separate story that precedes the story of Alien but is not directly connected to that franchise.""

Not directly connects ? The Weyland corp. is there. The ship the crew of the Nostromo finds in ""Alien"" is there. The ""space jockey"" is there. The usual robot passenger is there. And finally, the Alien monster is there. With the story of Prometheus, I don't see those elements interesting to use, besides an easy marketing.

The script hadn't me asking questions about the story, but rather about its cohesion.

One example - Weyland and his daughter come on the planet to get answers about humanity, and eventually find eternal life, and have created the robot (David) to work for them. Yet when Weyland dies and says ""There was nothing"", the robot says ""I know"".

Another example, arrived on the planet, David seems to know what the Aliens are, and wants to bring one back on Earth. If in ""Alien"" the robot was on a secret mission for Weyland corp. to bring one back as a biological weapon, here it is the same, excepted that it obviously wouldn't be the Weyland corp behind it. Besides others humans sending David for this mission, it could be the ""Engineers"" themselves, or Aliens, or of course, even something else ? Which would for me make lame ""explanations"".

Of course these plot ""holes"" are most likely ""secrets"" that will be answered in the next installment, because there will be one : it's unfortunately the law of marketing. Anyway, I won't be in the theater to hear them.","5"
"secondtake","I'm a total fan of Alien and Aliens, and this is a worthy pre-cursor...a visual explosion","26 June 2012","Prometheus (2012)

Prometheus in Greek myth created man from clay. This is the key to the movie, and the original notion of this creation is told in a brilliant vivid opening sequence before the titles. Prometheus's body dissolves into the waters, his DNA disconnects, and then it reforms, as if from nothing, and a more known sense of evolution begins, with the pre-ordained final outcome being a human species. When the current story begins it is openly an exploration to find the origins of human life, which are thought to live on a distant planet.

Prometheus is also the god who gave fire to humans, and this is a secondary but important aspect to the story. Not only does the space crew find hints of the creation of man, but also the creation of man's ingenuity and destructive potential. It's good stuff, well done.

This story does not on the surface rely on the Alien movies but it does connect to them both in chronology and in feel. The director Ridley Scott is the same as for the original 1979 ""Alien"" and he's probably the best of the ""franchise,"" (no offense to James Cameron and his second, also excellent film, ""Aliens""). The set design is inspired by (with acknowledgement) the brilliant H. H. Giger, which is now archetypal and remains terrific.

The plot line is similar in a broad sense--a group of rag tag mostly American-seeming space travelers find this planet with some suspicious looking traces of civilization and, eventually, new life-forms. Things are not benign from there. There is the familiar inclusion of creatures inhabiting, and bursting from, human hosts and there is a great android/robot central character. And there is a fight to the end and a near death for our heroes, male female and otherwise.

This gives nothing away, unless you've never seen a movie before. In fact, these are requirements for this series, because the audience is there in part to see how everything is faring. And to see how the Sigourney Weaver ""replacement"" is doing. And this younger actress (Weaver in her 60s was not right for the part of a young doctor with dreams of having a baby) is Noomi Rapace and she's very good in her own distinct way. It's inevitable for awhile that she is identified as the original ""Girl with the Dragon Tattoo."" She is less fully filled out here, but I think that's because of the kind of film this is, where all the characters play types rather than real full blooded characters. Any attempt to fill in her psychology and inner being are short-circuited by having to survive the ongoing threats all around. And I mean ongoing and all around.

Likewise for the talented Charlize Theron, who is stiff and wooden to the point that even one of the other characters asks if she is really a robot. The confirmed robot is the second main character names simply David, played with perfect restraint and cool detachment (he's a robot after all) by Michael Fassbender. Robots are complicated in nature but emotionally rather simple, and this conflict is a fascinating aspect to the film.

The biggest draw, and the best reason to see the movie, is the experience of being there, of seeing and feeling the places so incredibly conjured up and atmospheric. It's amazing stuff, and the director has to share credit with a whole slew of art directors and set designers. And editors and photographers (photography being the first step in a heavily post-processed final image).

Don't expect an emotionally deep drama, of course. And you'll have to look the other way at a few improbabilities, even in this world of wonderful improbability. For example, why would a billion dollar several year expedition have several disgruntled and apparently unprepared and uninformed crew members? And can someone really have a major abdominal operation and then spend the next hour running, leaping, and gasping (at least)?

But if you do in fact look the other way briefly, you'll be swept away and blown away, and generally pretty darned impressed by yet another take on the confrontation of mere humans with superior species. Which may or may not be related to our own, as you'll see.","7"
"Sulaimone","Don't bother with a sequel just yet.","25 March 2014","I don't know what went on behind the scenes of this debacle but the result, as I've seen it, is a film stuck in potential. Much like Coppola's ""Dracula"", its look is ""neat"" while almost everything else about it is a mess. There are too many elements competing for screen time, too many side stories started and not finished and way, way too many references to other films in the genre. In fact, the earliest chords of the score sounded so much like the music from Star Trek, I half expected them to be followed by voice-overs from James T. Kirk or Jean-Luc Picard. Atrocious does not begin to describe the ""acting"" but, more pointedly, the characters seemed to want to get away from each other as much as they wanted to get away from their situation(s). Given that individually and collectively they came across as ridiculously annoying, shallow and self-centered, who could blame them? Without convincingly sincere camaraderie between at least some of the characters there is no real cohesion to the film and what has ended up on screen is a patchwork of scenes attempting to present a coherent story. Uh, no. Be that as it may, I'll have to watch it again (and again?) because, while mired in the film's ample flotsam, I forgot whether or not the reason(s) for the engineers changing their minds has/have been definitively clarified. In summation, I find this film to be all over the place. Perhaps it is intentional since it does, in effect, lay the groundwork for sequels. However, if the recent Star Wars films are any indication and given the impatience of this generation, I question how much time will be spent awaiting.","3"
"paris_whitney_hilton_nyc","Illegal Alien : Deport this mess back to Planet LV-426","9 June 2012","In 1979 Ridley Scott directed a wonderful science fiction thriller named Alien . The plot was not terribly complex yet very effective . The crew unknowingly brings aboard a merciless creature that captures and kills then one-by-one in a Ten little Indians fashion . We all remember the 7 crew members on board the ill- fated Nostromo, Captain Dallas , Ripley , Parker , Ash, Brett , Lambert , Kane , Jones the Cat , and Mother the ship's computer . In 1984 Aliens was released as the sequel to Alien . A good movie that had more action than scares . In 1992 Alien 3 came along and was just plain awful . 1997 brought us Alien Resurrection that was only slightly better than the previous Alien 3 . The Alien vs Predater movies I never bothered to see . So now we move ahead to 2012 and have Ridley Scott back in the driver's seat with the prequel to the 33 year old classic Alien masterpiece called Prometheus . How can we go wrong? First, I would like to say how disappointed I was with the cast . Except for Charlize Theron , I was totally unfamiliar with everyone in the film . I couldn't care less for any of the characters and was very happy to see them being killed off one, two, and three at a time . Something must have occurred while they were writing the screen play for Prometheus . I hate to think Scott would have intentionally want to direct this overly long and confusing mess of a film . The first hour is pure boredom and nothing exciting happens as we travel to and arrive at the forbidden planet . The interior of the Premetheus looked more like the Costa Concordia in her better days than that of the Nostromo . As for monsters , we have lot's of laughable squid like rubber creatures coming out from everywhere . There is a huge and threatening humanoid creature reminiscent of James Arness in the 1953 version of The Thing . We're seen this creature's remains in Alien, and now he's back and has run amok as he battles our crew and another fake alien monster . We also have a very old gentleman that reminded me of the elderly astronaut from 2001 A Space Odyssey . The CGI's looked better at the beginning of the movie but later became too very fake looking . Almost every action or sci-fi movie now-a-days suffers from that same phony video game /cartoon effect . Beautiful Charlize Theron's talents were wasted in this awful movie . She added nothing to the story and could have easily been replaced by Paris Hilton . I'm not sure if she was supposed to be human or android ? Her character had no human emotions and she walked & talked like a robot . While Ridley Scott may have had the recipe for a truly great Alien movie , he didn't have all the proper ingredients . This film failed in several ways . A dumb storyline and a poor choice of unknown actors was my biggest complaint . There was nothing scary about Prometheus . If I could rewrite the script and replace all the actors , I would have used the entire cast of Ghostbusters and made a silly comedy out of this very forgettable movie . I gave this flick only one star because I waited with great anticipation for Prometheus only to be disappointed again . Definitely Not Hot ! Send Prometheus and all future sequels back into deep space and please leave the Alien franchise alone ! .. PWH","1"
"jordangross","Simply put, amazing!","9 June 2012","The long awaited movie ""Prometheus"", directed by Ridley Scott, has finally hit theaters and I couldn't be happier. This is a film that I have been waiting for sense it was announced and to see it finally done and ready for the eyes of the public just fills me up with so much joy. I love Ridley Scott's ""Alien"" and thought it was such a well done and beautifully directed movie. Did ""Prometheus"" capture that same Ridley Scott feel? Why yes, yes it did.

Let me start off by saying this is not, in terms, a prequel to the original ""Alien"" film from 1979, its more of an origin story taking place within the same ""Alien"" universe. I can laterally sit and talk for hours about how I can connect ""Prometheus"" and ""Alien"" together. I have thoughts and theories of how the story, characters, evolution, and more can connect and make sense, but I will not go into that because I don't want to bore you for hours on end.

The story in ""Prometheus"" is that a group of explorers set out to find the origins of mankind which takes them to a far away galaxy to search the only planet (which is just a moon to a bigger planet) that can sustain live forms on it. While the explorers are there, they discover major secrets, and huge discoveries that may just be looking bad for the human race. Personally, I thought that the story was awesome and it brought a lot of back story or added story to the lore of the so called ""Alien"" universe. I didn't find any weak points in the story, and I felt it was a tense, suspense, and flat out entertaining thrill ride.

The movie stars Noomi Rapace (The Girl with the Dragon tattoo, Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows), Logan Marshall-Green (Devil, Brooklyn's Finest), Michael Fassbender (Inglorious Bastards, X-Men: First Class), Charlize Theron (Hancock, Snow White and the Huntsman), Idris Elba (Thor, Takers), and Guy Pearce (Memento, The Hurt Locker). While all the performances given in the film were solid and believable, four stuck out the most.

Fourth, Charlize Theron again just kills her role as a more evil/mean type character and just gives off a cold, but powerful, performance. Third, Idris Elba just knows how to deliver a believable, really human like, role by not feeling like he is forced to read lines, but make it sound like a normal, everyday, human conversation. Second, Noomi Rapace really showed me, in this film, that she can really act and be a really awesome lead role/heroine type character. First, Michael Fassbender delivers probably one of the best acting jobs I have seen in a very long time. He plays an android/robot character, built to look like a regular human, except he doesn't really show emotion, and he is exceptionally talented in almost anything. Seriously, Michael Fassbender deserves the award for best actor in every award show there is.

I went to see the movie twice in IMAX 3D on the same day (opening day) if that says anything. The IMAX experience for this film is incredible, with the sound cranked all the way up and the picture quality looking to good to be true. Now the 3D was actually really well done. It didn't have to many things flying out of the screen (except for the storm scene), but the depth in this movie is so well done and looked so good compared to some other movies who just had lazily done depth just to make a movie in 3D and earn a few extra dollars. I recommend seeing the IMAX 3D version of ""Prometheus"" in theaters.

I really do love this film and I like all of the story elements that it adds to the ""Aliens"" universe. Also, the use of practical and CGI effects blended so well together, that everything looked so real and I felt that the set was a real place and not just a staged/built set. If I could, I would go on and on about everything I liked about this film, but I don't want to spoil anything. In my opinion the movie is fantastic and its a must see.

Rating: 10/10","10"
"abcprivateemail","Wish I had stopped watching sooner","27 October 2021","I made to about 1 hr 4 min, but wish I had stopped sooner. The movie seems to be made for 13 year old boys who care more about special effects and scenery than they do about realistic characters or plot. Started out damaging my suspended disbelief by having a bunch of supposed professionals in various fields agreeing to go into stasis for 2 years on a long journey across space without even knowing the general scope of the mission they signed up for. The characters are written blatantly extreme in personality differences to artificially generate character conflict, and that conflict ends up super cheesy. Way too much time is wasted on that character conflict instead of developing what little plot there is. The premise of aliens who brought life to earth could have worked if the movie had been written better.","1"
"standinghere-1","More weakly scripted CGI nonsense...","2 June 2012","I went to see this film in the vain hope that it wouldn't be more of the usual Hollywood CGI claptrap that has ruined cinema over the last ten years, degrading the noble-art of storytelling into a disconnected sequence of meaningless 3d explosions and shouting flying men in suits.

The fact that Ridley Scott had been encouraged to return to the project, and the high score on IMDb initially reassured me.

However...

You will see that a lot of the positive reviews have been written either by children or those for whom readable grammatical English appears to be as Alien as the original monster. I haven't written a review in years, and like many many others felt compelled to do so to try and bring this huge behemoth of offensive gibberish down a peg or two.

The main points are addressed adequately elsewhere - the characters are unbelievable, they do daft unbelievable things, the alien itself makes no sense - endlessly mutating - and the only good thing is Michael Fassbender's Lawrence of Arabia impression.

Two things I especially hated were : a) the tired TV-movie clichés, like the CGI worm in the eye and so forth. At times it felt like one of the weaker episodes of the Outer Limits.

b) the whole 'accelerated pregnancy' trope - a sure sign of lazy scriptwriting. Quick, let's get the alien / vampire / devil child out before the end of the film! What a surprise, it's developing at an alarming rate. Naff.

I never really got into Star Wars, but I now feel that I can really appreciate what it must have been like for fans to sit through the Phantom Menace.

I would only recommend this film to the fifteen year old boys who insist on drinking and knocking over the bins outside my house, it's more on their level, and I can at least get a good night's sleep.

Lame.","2"
"premium90","Prequel or not a prequel? Really good film (spoiler ish).","2 June 2012","SOME SPOILERS IN THIS.

It is difficult not to be really love this film. Waiting for over 1 year for this release was bad enough but when it was released, you just had to watch it.

This film was filmed in 3d and the only choice for me was to watch it in true 3d hd in odeon. I watched it in real3d and was really surprised how good the 3d effects were. Ridley Scott made sure it was not overwhelming and not too much 3d. I would say a fine balance. I would need to say to the real die hard 3d filmers, this film is not too dark for 3d. Ridley Scott made sure this was just about right. As there are not much mention about the 3d, I would say roughly 30% of the film was in 3d. The tunnel part early in the film was amazing. You felt that you were in the tunnel itself.

Enough about the 3d and more about the film.

Although the film is mentioned that it is not a direct prequel of alien and more a new film. I would say for the die hard alien fan, that there is enough to answer most of the questions about the alien in the cockpit. Plenty of nice little clues about the alien!

I don't want to go too much about the film as it would ruin it. I believe the advertisements of the film was kept to a minimum, in order for everyone to understand the film from start to end. Thank you for not ruining the film due to advertisements.

I got to say that visual effects are very much superior and very very good.

I myself, would say this film is a direct prequel to alien. No matter what they did to the film, it was much better than thought.

8 out of 10 for me.

Although there was a classic ending to the film, I would like Ridley Scott to make sure that he takes a clever decision on if they want to continue this film via a sequel or not. All I can say, if he did leave this film like it is, it will definitely be good as it is.

Anyway, everyone enjoy.","8"
"rdgmb","Just plain awful!","12 June 2012","Must be time for Ridley to retire - after creating a video game and marketing it as a film! There is nothing redeeming about this effort. Script...terrible. Acting...often terrible. Character development...terrible. Ending...beyond terrible! This film was so bad, I may never watch anything from Ridley Scott again. What happened to Mr. Scott's ability to create a masterpiece. He has been responsible for several amazing films, thus I can barely comprehend this embarrassment. If I had to write one thing that could be a positive from it, I can only say that hopefully it will falter at the box office and minimize the chance of them making another one. One basic bit of advice, if you're an intellectual, trust me and spare yourself from this disaster...","1"
"cattjones","Prequel.... You Decide","8 June 2012","It has been 30 years since Ridley Scott has dabbled in this genre and I have to say that I am glad that he is back. A lot of things that I am going to say in this review are going to sound negative, but I want to say right up front that I liked this film. Mr. Scott said in an interview that he hasn't done a Science Fiction film since Blade Runner because he could not find a script that he liked. Apparently he just dusted off the Alien script and restructured it a bit. I saw the film in 3D, but I don't think that it was really necessary. The visual effects in this film just didn't require it. The sets were over the top along with the CGI. It has also been stated that this film is not meant to be a prequel to the Alien films .. whatever!!! It sure looked like one to me. I think that the whole premise of trying to find out where we came from was pretty interesting and not too far-fetched since there is now several television shows geared toward explaining the unexplainable by attaching the possibility that aliens have visited this planet before. Towards the end of the film I found myself shaking my head (smh) a lot. The physicality by Elizabeth Shaw (Noomi Rapace) was so incredibly unbelievable, especially after all the stuff that she had been through. I don't think so. The android David (Michael Fassbender) was very stoic and vacant (which I guess that is how a robot should be). I was once again shaking my head when some of the scenes had me thinking ""where have I seen this before"". Meredith Vickers (Charlize Theron) was almost as robotic as David as she represented the company financing this little venture. Janek (Indris Elba) and his crew was the voice of reason in this journey into the vastness of outer space. If you are an Alien fan, then you will be a fan of this film. There were some parts of the film that were slightly gruesome, but you come to expect that with this type of film. I have been a fan of monster movies every since Godzilla first graced the screen and this film reinforced my loyalty to the genre. This is one of those times that I wish we had a light between green and amber, but I'm going to stick my neck out and give it an orbiting green light.","8"
"subhabiswas","LOST in space","1 June 2012","Prologue

Albino Watchman downs a caviar/tequila slammer next to a waterfall then disintegrates into the stream. Project Mankind or a renegade's gift to the third rock?

Project Prometheus

A sci-fi epic, 33yrs in the making, turns out to be a two hour, 500 yard shuttle run between two spaceships. The mythological core mirrors Prometheus (Space Jockey), his gift of fire to humans (evolution via Black DNA Caviar) and his subsequent punishment by the Gods (genetic vengeance via the Evil Caviar). Hence we have a Clash of the Titans: White Super Engineers vs. Evil Black Goo, with Mankind, the accidental product, caught in the middle. I could try to explain the story to you, but here's a better idea: You explain it to me

Fire (DNA Caviar)

Location: Planet LV-226; Space Jockey stomping ground. In a cemetery of thermos flasks, in a worm infested H.R. Giger museum. This caviar is genetic plutonium, primordial evil, the evolutionary fire of the gods. Brush against a single thermos and the whole exhibition transforms to a living, writhing pool. This black temple introduces the film's heart of darkness: the consequence of playing God. Humans invent androids because they can. Engineers invent humans because they can, but the unexplained question is, why then try destroy us? Fassbender's android gifts us the closest answer: ""To create you must first destroy"". So is our black caviar the evolutionary equivalent of a forest fire, and its purpose the purification of the gene pool? If not purification, then perhaps weaponisation, with humans as guinea pigs? But 2,000 years seems an awfully long manufacturing period. And let's be honest, why not just build a Death Star? The most sensible explanation seems that, after their experiment turns on them, the Engineers realise that the black goo is inherently evil (d'uh!) and Mankind, an evolutionary vessel of said evil, becomes an experimental error they seek to rectify through genocide. Bu why lead us to LV-226 in order to destroy us? Likely the original invitation was a peaceful one, prior to the revenge of the black goo. Alternative explanations include a lone stranded Prometheus Engineer with a life spanning millenia (where is he now?), or, following the evolutionary weapon theory, the 2000 years delay could, in essence, be cooking time for the optimum genetic recipe, awaiting our technological advance to interstellar travel.

Here now is a quick recap of the Xenomorph life cycle: Queen – Eggs – Facehugger – Chestburster – Xeno

Not content with the biological plausibility of this, the screenwriters of Prometheus have added the following variations:

DNA Caviar + worm = Vagina Cobra DNA Caviar + champagne + archaeologist = Zombie Zombie + sexy time = Woman + baby squid Little baby squid + a few hours = Giant Kraken Kraken + Space Jockey = Skinny Mocha Xeno

Prometheus

Elephant masks? Really? Over 30 years I've developed a fond image of Space Jockeys as herbivore stargazers. Turns out it's just a suit. For a race of interstellar engineers, the elephant look seems a little dated. If they're only helmets, why are they wearing them indoors, on a spaceship, on a planet with an atmosphere breathable for them? Maybe they're for navigational purposes, but then why would the holocaust pile-up victims in the corridor be wearing them?

Continuity whores take note: How can the original space jockey with a fully intact mask, have a chestburster hole in his sternum? Which hole was the point of entry, if not through the mouth? Butthuggers, anybody?

Next question: What does LV stand for? 226 is not 426 but both have (apparently multiple) crashed croissant ships carrying mutilated Engineers, indicating that the outbreak was spontaneous and galaxy wide. This in turn suggesting that the DNA Caviar was no hand-me- down recipe amongst the Engineers, and the Engineers are not nearly as clever as you think.

Casting

Remember the colonial marines of the starship Sulaco. Vasquez, Hudson, Drake, Frost... how could you forget, right? Now compare Prometheus: Name the captain? (clue: it's not ""Idris Elba""). How about Noomi's boyfriend? The two stranded scientists or the oriental co-pilot? I'll tell you what their names are: Fodder, Filler, Token, Guy Person and Chang. OK, I made the last one up. Thanks Lindelof. Go ahead and throw in the fat guy with curly hair. You know you want to.

Finally a section I like to call

WTFLOLMFAOMG

1. Android attempts fluent Space Jockese, by studying ancient human texts? Did you just call his mother a slag? Don't lose your head over it.

2. Guy Pearce acting as an old man? Why not useAN OLD MAN!

3. Heavy face and neck padding on Guy Pearce? Why not useA FAT OLD MAN!

4. David deciphers every control code at first touch. Hey Engineers, stop using ""password"" as your password.

5. Engineer 1. ""Gentlemen I'm tired of pushing buttons. Any new ideas on how activate this navigation deck?"" Engineer 2. ""Well, I used to play the flute."" Engineer 1. ""Good work soldier. Now lets go eat some more of that delicious caviar.""

6. Oh my god, Weyland is her father!!! So maybe that means they're going to Oh wait, they're all dead. So it doesn't matter.

7. Hey Dr. Grey, you've just discovered that the human race is threatened and you have access to an alien craft. Do you a) Use it to race back to earth, and use the alien technology to build the human defence. b) Confront the entire alien species on your own, with a severed robot head in a duffel bag

In closing I must borrow from another review who states simply that the sheer number of questions is a testament to the failure of the scriptwriters. Or maybe just one of them.","7"
"ivern-326-711636","Ridley Scott Returns to the Alien Franchise to Direct a Prequel","1 June 2012","Prometheus is about a group of people who travel to a planet where they believe the alien race that created mankind lives. What they find, though, is most definitely not the meaning of life.

Now Prometheus is actually a prequel to the 1979 sci-fi classic Alien, also directed by Ridley Scott. Even though it is a prequel, it is at the same time a completely different movie. First of all, the creatures in this movie are way different than the Xenomorphs we met in the Alien franchise. Also, the cast of characters is totally different. The movie takes place 96 years before the events of Alien, so the setting and the story is very different. However it does include some references to those films, and also some well-placed fan-service that most Alien fans will appreciate.

The movie isn't as good as Alien. The progression isn't as great, the creatures aren't as scary and the movie overall isn't the sci-fi masterpiece it wants to be. It's still a very good movie, just not as amazing as you would want.

Overall, Prometheus is a very good prequel to a popular franchise and Alien/Ridley Scott/sci- fi fans will most likely be pleased.","8"
"basford_mark","should have been renamed to ""****heads in space""","1 August 2015","Alien and aliens are my favorite films. One reason is that the characters are believable. They really do seem like marines or space truckers but the characters in prometheus are almost opposite of how they would really be and they are really dumb and inconsistent in their behavior. The 6 rating is based purely on the great set design and special effects. But even the ship itself is nothing particularly original. The head designer max states how they invented the ideas of the rocket engines that turn into landing gear. Avatar beat them to it. I remember Scott arrogantly announcing how great the film was before it was even released. I am not going to go into details as it has all been covered before. It is better watched as a silent movie. francis ford coppola said in an interview about apocalypse now. ""If you aspire to make something really great and meaningful and don't pull it off, the film is scum"" and that pretty much sums it up for me.","6"
"Ar_Pharazon_the_golden","Tries too hard, doesn't know what it is","7 June 2012","Prometheus is not a prequel to Alien. OK, we get it. Personally all I wanted was for it to end with terrified giant elephant-man trying to run, but we all know what happens - obviously it doesn't. The problem isn't that Prometheus isn't an Alien film. It's that it tries too hard to pretend it's not an alien film, when it actually is. First things first, the 3D is great. The acting is very good too. The aesthetic part, though apparently much praised, didn't really impress me. In a nutshell, TOO LITTLE GIGER. But the major trouble is the plot. Here you have mr Scott, telling us after 30 years that oh, you know, that's not a trunk, it's just the helmet of a giant human. Half the wonder around the Space Jockey was that he was a mystery creature who knows from where who got killed by a xenomorph who knows how. Well, the best answer they came up with was ""giant humans who created mankind""? Why then not stick with the Predator idea (even that)? Oh, and it's not the Space Jockey, just some other guy who does the same job. Then, you don't want to focus on Aliens. So you come up with facehuggers who aren't facehuggers, except they are, just with a different design. That will fool people. It's not like aliens already have a gazillion different forms and reproductive ways, let's now make them come from gigantic octopuses too. Most amazingly of all though, for a film that claims it explores a different story within the alien universe, it tells you next to nothing of this new story; and by next to nothing, I mean actually nothing. Giants who made/carried cylinders that slightly remind of alien eggs but contain worms that kill you or impregnate you for no obvious reason wake up a few thousand years later to go to earth, where they created life(?) for no obvious reason, to attack it for no obvious reason*. And no, a ""wait for the sequel, it will have an Alien"" simply won't do. It's not a bad film; but if you're an Alien fan, it is disappointing, even if you knew it wouldn't be directly linked. *PS: also, the android (easily the best character) poisons one of the doctors for absolutely no reason.","5"
"zombywoof101","Ridley Scott's biggest sin","1 July 2014","First and foremost: ALIEN is my favorite film and yes I do love ALIENS but loathe ALIEN Resurrection and the AVP films (actually loathe and hate are not strong enough for the AVP films).

Secondly, I enjoyed Prometheus though grudgingly probably because of Ridley Scott's production values and attention to detail and the acting except for the unseemly behavior for scientists.

The biggest sin committed by Ridley Scott and the screen writers of Prometheus is that they took the alien out of the ALIEN franchise. And to be clear I mean ""alien"" as in foreign, strange and unknowable.

The imagery of the original 1979 film by now has been imitated enough to seem familiar but back in 1979 ALIEN was more than just a title and a reference to the titular creature; it was a short and to the point description of what you were going to see and experience. The world conjured in one's mind of the derelict space craft, the space jockey, the xenomorph with its lack of eyes and acid for blood truly stood out as something completely alien especially when compared to earlier attempts at alien creatures and civilizations which were laughable when compared to ""engineer"" culture. Even Lucas' cantina scene in Star Wars, while very popular, was still depicted in a totally familiar setting with the aliens reduced to bar patrons engaging in typical bar patron behavior and with biological systems not too unfamiliar to our own judging by the fact that seem to be drinking human compatible alcohol.

In choosing to make the space jockey's race nothing more than a race of giant snow white humanoid males which, in retrospect, thanks to the above mentioned imitations look a little like the Borg Queen but without all that messed up stuff on their heads, Scott whisked away the mystery and a good chunk of the horror that would have gone into contact with a civilization that is totally unrelated and un-relatable. Like it or not there is a tendency in us to feel a heightened sense of fear when life is on the line at the hands of a foreign and unknowable agency and that was as much a central part of ALIEN as any other important horror element.

The one area in the original film where there was something familiar to grasp onto was the vaguely sexual overtones found in engineer design: the trio of orifice openings in the derelict ship which itself resembles the bottom half of some massive alien female creature pregnant and with deformed legs splayed as if ready to birth and of course there is the very phallic shaped head of the alien. The inclusion of these familiar archetypal features on such an alien design coupled with the fact that Kane was forcibly sodomized served to make it even more unsettling.

The design of the derelict stood in stark contrast to what we perceive as a space going vessel as represented by the Nostromo. One can easily imagine several dozen blue collar ship builders cranking out the Nostromo and other sister ships with familiar materials and tools but the derelict looked like it was grown in some strange, weird alien manner. The fact that prior to Prometheus the space jockey was perceived as growing out of his chair suggested that individuals of the engineer species were designed for specific tasks, but now, no, it's just, a suit a helmet and a special chair that somehow connects with the suit.

Back then, I personally pictured a widely variant species in design, suddenly fearful of this new upstart primate hominid with a propensity for violence. Indeed, the art of HR Giger would have been a veritable goldmine for engineer variants. In my imagination they kidnapped and experimented on humans in order to craft a bio-weapon that is itself a variation of their own species (like the space jockey mentioned above) but modified to pattern itself with human genes in order to be able to ingest the kinds of food we eat and even to sometimes eat us in order to grow, subsist and multiply in a human environment. It was through this activity, I imagined, that ""The Company"" became aware of the species and the derelict ship which caused them to reroute the Nostromo.

Sadly not only are the engineers no longer ""alien"", they're familiar. Heck they're actually related, perhaps they're our 15579th cousins twice removed.","6"
"prettyinink1970","Seriously Disappointing!","26 June 2012","I originally had no interest in seeing this movie when I saw trailers of it; it just seemed like yet another alien movie... same old premise, same type of storyline...

After seeing its rating on IMDb, my husband and I decided to check it out.

The plot had way too many holes to make it anywhere near logical to a reasonable, semi-conscious viewer. Yes, it's set in the future, yes, it deals with a subject that is debatable at the best of times, but still, there are ways to draw people in and make them believe even the most unbelievable things.

We chose to see it in 3D, which, to be honest, I have no idea why they even bothered making a 3D version... it did absolutely nothing for the film. It's a shame when 3D isn't used to make the film more exciting and enjoyable.

It wasn't the worst film I've ever seen, but I really suggest waiting to see it when it comes out on blu-ray. I personally find that we wasted our money going to the theatre to see it.","4"

Can someone tell me what the hell happened at the Shaws 'lying down on the bed talking to David then running her way to the surgery bed' sequence? Why no one tried to contain her after she knocked the other scientists unconcsious so easily and after the surgery?

"majesty327","Good, but shouldn't have been an Alien prequel","7 September 2012","Oh Ridley Scott, you've done it again. Well, to be perfectly honest, I really like this film. I had a lot of fun watching it. The ideas were honestly pretty cool. But there's just one tiny problem...What was it again? Oh yeah. Why does this film HAVE to be an Alien prequel again? That is the real fault to this film. Why? Because it forces you to notice every single continuity error. It forces you to sit impatiently and ask ""Where's the Aliens?"". I admittedly did that, and it was only through a second viewing (after I detached this film from any other Alien film) that I realized that this film really had a lot going for it. The acting wasn't top notch, but the actor that played ""David"" really did a good job. The writing was...okay. There are certain things in the film that will make you scratch your head in confusion. The design was fascinating and a joy to look at. The special effects, while a CG fest (which I usually frown upon) looked fantastic. But let's get into the flaws, and in case the little spoiler warning above the review didn't catch your attention, there will be some plot elements spoken about. First of all, what exactly is that black goo stuff? What does it do? I saw it make a woman give birth to a squid. I saw it melt a 10-foot-tall alien. But what does it do? It's never really explained what this ""Bioweapon"" is actually supposed to do. Second. Why do the Engineers want to destroy us? I mean, I understand that they were setting up a sequel, but I just felt left in the dark in a particularly cruel joke. Third. Why is this film an Alien prequel in the first place? I mean, think about it. It's has almost nothing to do with Alien, the sequels, or the characters in the Alien series. Seriously. Just mute the film, and turn off subtitles. Does it appear to have anything to do with Alien aside from the planet the film takes place on (which could just as easily be another planet), and the fact that Weyland Industries is involved? And again, it FORCES you to notice every single continuity error. Over all. This film really is a very enjoyable movie if you watch it as a Sci-fi Horror flick, instead of an Alien film. Go watch it. 7/10","7"
"Danny_G13","Not spectacular but better than the reputation","16 October 2012","I wouldn't call myself a MASSIVE fan of the Alien franchise but I've generally rather enjoyed them. The original was classic sci fi horror cinema from Ridley Scott, with its sequel indeniably the best entry in the whole series, coming from the master of sci-fi action/horror James Cameron. The subsequent films were admittedly not staggering, but something about the atmosphere of the Alien stories kept audiences nevertheless coming back for more.

There hasn't been an Alien film since Resurrection (excluding the Vs franchise) so there was certainly a bit of expectation about this; it being a prequel explaining where it all began, and also being the only one in the series without 'Alien' in the title.

Prometheus sees a project ship of the movie's name traveling to where it is believed the creators of mankind originate; 2 scientists, Charlie and Ellie having discovered what appears to be intergalactic maps pointing to the destination are aboard said project ship leading the expedition, trying to find out answers. Naturally they get more than they bargained for.

Prometheus wasn't made to be a masterpiece, it is pretty clear it was made as an enjoyable tale which endeavours to explain the backstory of the Alien arc, and in that respect it does a pretty good job.

Michael Fassbender is technically the main character (David) as the ship's 'host', an odd-job handiman employed by the project to, among other things, learn multiple ancient dialects in order to communicate with alien civilisations. He is not human, and in a very subtle nod to Scott's earlier masterpiece Blade Runner is an effective replicant - a manufactured human without 'a soul'. He does not want, desire, or feel emotion. He serves. And is pivotal in the progression of the story, with possibly questionable motives despite his limbo state. Fassbender puts in a fine performance and steals every scene he is in.

The cinematography is impressive, with some eye-catching panoramic scenes and Scott's direction is its usual impressive self. One thing this isn't is boring.

Other performances are decent if not striking, with Kate Dickie's Ford particularly struggling. Whether it was just her Scottish accent contradicting the others I'm not sure, but her lines were rather forced.

One thing I'm confused by is the really poor reputation in terms of word of mouth this movie has. It scores 7.3 here but most people I've known who've seen it did not like it much, and the critical reviews were scathing. Yet, I'd agree with the 7.3 overall.

Sure, it's not as good as Aliens, sure, it's not Scott's finest. But it's still a pretty decent couple of hours of entertainment which does a better job than many prequels of filling the gaps in.","7"

"geotech-27507","Masterpiece","7 March 2021","Prometheus is a sci-fi horror masterpiece. I was floored by the cinematography, the acting, and the horror. This is arguably one of the best sci-fi horror movies ever made. The Christian protagonist is a welcome change in a positive role. The story and film-making were as good as you can expect. The cast and acting were excellent. Ridley Scott met my expectations after his Alien film and James Cameron's Aliens. Although Alien 3 and Alien Resurrection were tolerable and entertaining, Prometheus returns the high quality film making and script writing, and problems associated with artificial intelligence robots, back to the franchise. My only disappointment was the portrayal of the geologist, does not appear realistic. This is supposed to be part 1 of 3 in a series of prequels to Alien 1, which explains why we do not see the recognizable ""alien"" or xenomorph until the end, but other horrors precede this. Noomi Rapace and Michael Fassbender were spectacular.","10"
"hughrhythmics","surely Ridley Scott didn't produce and direct this turkey?","13 June 2012","It takes a lot to tempt me into the cinema, but the prospect of a prequel to Alien, directed by Ridley Scott himself, seemed too good to miss.

Dear oh dear, how mistaken I was.

My forebodings began when the ship's crew came out of hibernation, and I saw what a bunch of totally unbelievable and totally clichéd characters were being foisted on an unsuspecting audience. Take Fifield, for example. I can well imagine those planning this trillion-dollar mission saying to one another ""we're going to study the rock strata of an alien world in a distant star system, so we'll need the best geologist alive today. So let's look for some bloke with facial tattoos and a Jedward haircut, who speaks in a dopey mockney accent, dresses like a tramp, is about as bright as a fifteen-watt light-bulb and is afraid of his own shadow. That should just about fill the bill"".

The other characters are no better - for the most part, they're beyond risible. And the main female character - the one the audience is clearly supposed to identify with more than any of the others - has all the charisma of a soggy rice pudding. No-one expects another Sigourney Weaver - you don't get that lucky twice - but surely, Ridley Scott could have found an actress who could have stirred even a smidgen of empathy?

And if the characters themselves are tedious and unconvincing, their antics are often laughable - I sometimes felt I was looking at a bad remake of a Laurel And Hardy film.

And just try watching the scene near the end where two of the crew are being chased by a rolling alien spaceship without thinking of Wile E Coyote in a Roadrunner cartoon.

Just, ""Are you seeing this, Prometeus""? ""Yeah, we're seeing it""... ""What is that thing""? ""I don't know, but don't touch it""...

What if they did 10 or 15 minutes of the archeology back-story, and putting the puzzle together?

"AntachNurbach","I needed a drink","14 June 2012","Take an uninspired director, a writer with no imagination and throw in a composer out of his element and you have this: a below average commodity (this will not meet expectations of a ROI-consider the built-in audience for this) and a poor work of art.

Clearly, Mr. Scott is fat and happy and I'm watching a genius destroy his legacy with this one. Alien is one of the best films ever made (to say nothing of the numerous other impressive works he's created). This is one of the worst. That may sound like hyperbole but in my subjective view, the shoe fits. It's right up there with ""Sleepaway Camp"" in its awfulness. How this came to pass is confounding. We *know* few directors can bring it visually like Mr. Scott but that's all this film is-a pretty shell. I beseech you sir: watch something done by Refn, who is a visual master that brings something more. Perhaps this will light a fire for you. Then again, you probably don't give a toot at this point.

The score was corny and overwrought. From the beginning when the horns blare at jolly intervals I'm thinking to myself ""What the bleep is going on here?"" I felt like I was watching a National Geographic show. None of it seemed to fit except for the rumbling, ominous, synthesizer patch. Hardly an accomplishment of compositional skill. However, I know this composer has done some quality work so I'll say no more about it. As an aside, if my memory serves me right didn't Scott p-off the venerable Jerry Goldsmith by *not* including something he had written for the opening score of Alien, having instead the insight (correctly) of using the unsettling near-silence as the title appeared across the screen? I digress. That would be on the director.

I saved the worst for last. This *story* is nothing but a cobbled pastiche of plagiarism. The writer doesn't have the good sense to steal anything worth stealing. (It was like 1 part ""Mission to Mars"" combined with 1 part ""Friday the 13th-part...whatever"" with a helpful dose of pop blandness i.e. TV) No need for a point by point cover of all the ludicrous premises (they are all virtually the same in their inanity) that abound in this film, for that has been done in other reviews. (""Come here baby, oh you're beautiful!"" What?!? At this point I was looking for something to shove through *my* hand much like the Rutger Hauer's character in ""Blade Runner""). The whole thing is rife with stupidity and events which offer no explanation. Why? It's simple really: that would require an imagination, something the screenwriter clearly lacks. The characters act and speak like perfect idiots. This is amateur hour at it's finest. A F*N FLUTE?!? Good God man! The attempt to interject-via faith- philosophical overtones is worthy of a Jr. high student. Try reading a bit more. It will help. Perhaps he is a good writer. I haven't seen any evidence of it in his work.

I can't comment on the acting given what these poor souls had to work with.

I'm going to don my nerd hat and say; is it too much to ask that science-fiction have a bit of-I don't know-science to it? There's a promo-clip I have seen of Weyland doing a TED talk. Has the writer ever watched one? In less than a hundred years, technology will have solved the problem of traveling millions of miles in space while in a state of suspended animation. We will have created artificial gravity and near-to-human, synthetic, androids (btw, what's the symbolism behind having the androids getting their heads torn off in these films?). Extending life expectancy? Not so much. Maybe another 50 years of decrepit aging. And of course we will have originated from homogenized angry, giant, shiny-white-mute-brutes who play flutes to initiate command of their vehicles. I guess they can't whistle. Also, there's such a lack of visual *grit* in sci-fi films nowadays that made the older ones much more believable from an immersion standpoint. It's the analogue vibe that's getting lost. Things are just too shiny, too unreal, too digital. Methinks at the end of the rainbow we won't find the giant men. We'll find a box with a CPU.

I feel a bit of shame in doing this---joining the atomized masses (to steal a phrase) with my scathing critique but I needed the catharsis.

To sum it up I'll borrow a phrase from a Scott film I actually liked (which Rupert Murdoch called a bomb-which makes me like it even more):

"lisa-629","What a sh!t show","9 June 2012","This was awful. Awful on a level I didn't truly think was possible, considering all the advertising and marketing that has been involved with this film. First of all, the only reason I gave it two stars was Michael Fassbender, he's unbelievable in anything he does, and was the only positive thing about this film. The main characters were all so randomly thrown in here, I never felt they played a major role. Charlize Theron is usually fabulous, but was just morose in this film, she never once smiled, and her character really was meaningless. The plot centered around the search for these specific aliens that were apparently the creators of man. With this story line, so much could've been accomplished, but the support roles fell terrible short, and many of the characters motivations were never revealed, so it left you feeling confused and flustered. There were a few scenes that made me jump, but overall, this is not a horror film, barely even action/adventure. This is a Sci-fi channel reject, and I'd be surprised if anyone walks out of this film feeling like anything they just saw made one ounce of sense. Terrible Terrible Terrible.","2"

The real question is how did this train wreck happen? Maybe RS functions best as a director only. Maybe he needs the perspective of a Producer. Maybe he works best with some higher level guidance. Who knows?

It saddens my heart to see such terrific technology wasted on a mediocre, at best, storyline. I would think that Ridley Scott would know better than to let a couple of Hollywood hack writers anywhere near one of his films. BladeRunner is my all time favorite science fiction film. Between Scott's direction and Harrison Ford's portrayal of Deckard, no truer depiction of a possible future has ever been done by anyone else; except, of course, in Avatar. This clunker, on the other hand, is a tribute to what can go wrong when a director's common sense falls prey to the easiest way to get it done. To me, this was just a 1950's bad ""B"" movie dressed up in modern techniques. Anyone who knows anything about SF knows that its true fans are completely unforgiving when it comes to short changing your story. It's the stories that make us love the genre.","4"
"celluloidjunky","The writers defended a very weak hand with convincing poker faces.","4 June 2012","Prometheus is a visual feast with ambitious ideas on an epic scale and should win awards for set design, visual effects and cinematography.  It's director, Ridley Scott, having given us defining moments in science fiction cinema, has rightly raised fans' expectations.

Unfortunately this Alien prequel is let down by its script. It's a cavalcade of unfinished ideas and rushed character development that falls short of its ambitions despite Scott wrapping everything up in a stylish veneer.  The two writers previously scribed the likes of The Darkest Hour and Lost, the latter of which never got to the point despite100-hours of trying.  In just two hours, with far bigger concepts, Prometheus never stood a chance.

The first act starts well but it's always easy to sell an idea initially.  The utilisation of the Alien Universe, Peter Weyland's quest for immortality, the very name of the starship Prometheus and the large themes of existentialism, creationism, destructionism and evolution make the story interesting.  This is explored on micro and macro scales, the micro being Elizabeth Shaw's (Noomi Rapace) inability to conceive a child and her father's death at the hand of the Ebola virus; destructionism at its finest.  The flip-side, the bigger-picture themes, explore the creation of life on Earth and its impending destruction at the hands of its creators.  Running parallel to this is the analogy between mankind, as the creators of the Android, David, and the alien creatures themselves, the creators of mankind.  The manner in which this is explored, complete with analogies between the robotically human Meredith Vickers (Charlize Theron) and the very-human robot, David (Michael Fassbender), breathe life into the story. Faith and religion are other major themes, albeit to a lesser extent.  In Prometheus, humans have met their makers, but the question being posed is:  what created them?

Prometheus struggles to assemble its parts into a satisfying story.  Only Michael Fassbender's android, David, interests, whilst Rapace and the rest of the cast are given little to work with.  Rapace's character never feels real, neither does her colleague, Charlie Holloway, (played by Logan Marshall-Green) whom, having just arrived at the planet he's dedicated his life to finding, inexplicably turns to alcoholism.  Surely the initial excitement would last longer than a few hours after touchdown?  The sinister motives surrounding the Android, David, are loosely explained by the introduction of Peter Weyland of the 'company' (Weyland-Yutani from the Aliens Universe), however I would question Weyland's motivation.  He is dying so his agenda should be different. The motivations behind the remaining characters are equally confusing.  Shaw, having seen her lover burnt alive, has to fight unsympathetic companions and conduct her own cesarean.  Moments later her stomach is stapled and she's charging all over the place, her motivation an enigma. It's also baffling why the Captain of the Prometheus would power his ship heroically into the alien vessel. Perhaps this is to explain more of Alien's back story, albeit a slightly misaligned one.  This isn't the same planet as LV- 426 (Acheron) and yet the action that gets played out mirrors what is eventually found there in Alien.  It is confusing.  I also took issue with the roles of Fifield and Millburn (Sean Harris and Rafe Spall) who spend their time bickering and constantly reacting in terror.  Their characters are inappropriate for a hand-picked team dedicated to the mission.  Why bring them?  Fifield wouldn't have passed a psychometric test for a construction job in the UK let alone be eligible for deep space exploration.

Prometheus at least attempts to explain the origins of Scott's Alien.  When our scientists arrive at new planet, they discover a 'head chamber' full of cylindrical, slime-oozing plinths; a seemingly less-evolved version of the egg chamber from Alien.  From these come snake-like creatures that could similarly be less-evolved face-huggers. This evolutionary thread is more evident during the final moments, when a squid-like 'chest burster' from these less-evolved face-huggers impregnates one of the 'alien creators.'  This gives rise to a familiar sight, the alien from Scott's 1979 film. Sadly this moment is swept up in CGI, belonging more to Alien3 than the original classic.

Creationism and evolution in Prometheus are not mutually exclusive.  This is demonstrated by the liquid used by the aliens to begin the process of life.  It's creationism that runs an evolutionary course, requiring life that has already evolved to make it work. It's a sequence illustrated in the opening stages, where an alien creature drinks black liquid and breaks down into the sum of its DNA.  This DNA evolves into all life on Earth, suggesting the God-like maker will go on to become everyone and everything.  Ergo God is everywhere. Conversely, when Holloway's character consumes a drop of the liquid, his body reacts differently. Why? This is not explored. Instead the writers' prefer to end that 'difficult' plot thread by having him killed.  Similarly they never explain why some of the aliens are resting in hyper sleep or the big question of why they create and destroy life. They prefer to hide behind the guise of mystery. This is never more evident than when one of the 'creator-aliens' has the opportunity to talk to its creations.  Instead of an interesting 'reveal' it simply embarks on a killing spree and is intent on destroying the Earth.  We don't know why, but after much screaming the film grinds to an anticlimactic finale with few answers.

Ultimately Prometheus is a vacuous experience.  Nothing more than well-directed nonsense with magnificent production values.  Plenty of it makes little sense and one can only hope that a Blu Ray 'Director's Cut' will prove more satisfying. Why did you create us?  Because we could.  Why do you believe?  Because I choose to.  These one-liners could be a metaphor for all of Prometheus' secrets.  Ultimately, like Lost before it, the writers defended a very weak hand with convincing poker faces.","7"
"digdog-785-717538","2300+ reviews late, here is mine","23 May 2016","i recently watched a video titled ""Prometheus Actually Explained (With Real Answers)"".

The video actually answers cleverly many questions that were buzzing around the internet when the film first came out, and which have helped generate the bad reputation of the film, in turn being the reason why i didn't watch the film myself. Honestly, i would have figured most out by myself because, you know, i'm not a retard, but there's still a few things in the film which are near unforgivable.

****massive spoilers from now on, for those who have not seen the film and also have no internet access.****

The plot of Prometheus is quite different from the one the trailer implies;

A scientific expedition is sabotaged by a meddling android under commands from the owner of the evilest corporation ever put on paper.

Visually, the film is glorious, although it almost understates the visuals - i respectfully believe that if they had made the visual aspect more of a centerpiece, the film would have had more success.

Some of the events in the script are really retarded; a control panel made of stone? A Xenobiologist hugging an obviously enraged animal?

Or, for example, the android David offering the poisoned drink to Holloway; although the scene is plausibly believable from the character's point of view, it's also completely obvious to the spectators. Did the great Ridley Scott actually forget how to shoot a film?

Charlize Theron's character is stupid beyond belief. Who thought that ""woman who stands still a lot"" was going to be interesting deserves to lose their job. Weyland's ""uncanny"" makeup is a weird choice, i don't know what they were shooting for but i really did not enjoy seeing a blatantly young person poorly disguised as an old man, with tons of closeups to make the effect even less believable.

The film is also quite slow .. rather than ""poorly paced"", i would say it's the opposite, too evenly paced, without any moments of particular excitement or action, as opposed to, say, the android-going-berserk scene in Alien.

About 3/4 through it finally picks up the pace, when the Weyland-led remains of the crew head in to meet the last Engineer. At this point, they have found out the entirety of the plot, what the goo is, their creation, the demise of the engineers, and Weyland's reason for setting up the expedition in the first place. The ending is rather simple and the entire plot might be too simplistic for the audience to feel satisfied.

In the end, you have to share the same mentality of the last few survivors to enjoy this film; that going forward to simply meet your creators is more important that what common sense tells you... expecting, perhaps, to find God.

If, on the other hand you share the opinion of Dr Holloway (Logan Marshall-Green) that creating life isn't such a shocking revelation, then you'll find the entire film rather insipid - it is, after all, a creation myth film.

Scott clearly states his religious inspiration for the film, if not directly *in* the film, and, exactly like religion, it's a load of bullshit.

Alien, for example, relied on a simpler emotion - fear. Prometheus attempts to rely on the emotion of revelation, but for many this will be more mundane than divine.

Having watched the film on a small screen, i missed out on much of the audio-visual aspect, but maybe this allowed me to focus more on the story itself. I didn't find this film too horrible, if anything i would say, it has many good things about it, but it lacks punch, something that generates really strong emotions; it's an effortless journey, but the destination isn't particularly great.

As for the film's terrible reputation, i would say it more due to it being judged on the success of other films, rather than on its own strengths and weaknesses, otherwise it could easily be on par with films like Moon, if not better. Sadly, it did the same for me, as watching it i could not help thinking how much better the characters in Alien were, and how much better they were used.

It's an OK film; kinda bland. i'm gonna have to say...

"marketsharetax","Nonsense","5 December 2012","Please be warned that this movie completely lacks the screenplay. It is inconsistent, illogical, unreasonable. The acting is not bad at all, the underlying ideas are not bad at all, the graphics is not bad at all, but the dialogs and actions are just plain inconsistent like a heap of garbage.

If you study how it is possible to have such a bad screenplay you will know that first story was written by Jon Spaihts, who also wrote the movie the Darkest Hour which is not as bad as Promethius but it is also done very poorly. In addition, Damon Lindelof was the screen writer who rewrote the story. He is known for his absolutely absurd soap opera ""Lost"". The question remains though: why spend so much money on actors, on graphics, and save money on a screenwriter??? Why James Cameron is not a screen writer of this movie?","1"
"BlackTaterTotallyBlue","Alien prequel is The Phantom Metheus","30 May 2012","OK, that's perhaps a little unfair. But relatively accurate when you compare Scott's original hard nosed masterpiece to this Saturday afternoon pseudo intellectual space bonanza. It talks about man's origins and the afterlife but only manages to give us bad tempered marble men and scary squids.

Fassbender's solitary scenes at the beginning are by far the film's best as his android character tends to the upkeep of the ship while the rest of the crew are in cryogenic suspension. He watches films and bleaches his hair. He perfects cycling while playing basketball and reads the dreams of his crew members. His performance (more than the writing of him) is the single redeeming element of an otherwise mediocre production.

The rest of the cast are given little to do with Theron, Katie Dickie et al woefully underused. Swedish born Rapace (original Dragon Tattoo trilogy) proves once again she's got the goods but her on-screen love interest, the blandly handsome Logan Marshall Green, is totally outclassed by her and they have zero chemistry.

It has some moments of decent tension and gross out horror, but where these things in the original Alien were tempered by silence and sparse naturalistic dialogue. Here the dialogue is occasionally daft, often used to smooth over poor plotting and pacing is not nearly so well judged. The result is a film that neither fully convinces as horror nor fulfills it's promise as a return to 'proper' sci-fi. For all the fanfare about this being Scott's return to the genre this more carries the signature of those who made the recent Star Trek movie and the series Lost. While no meagre qualifications, they seem odd choices for an Alien prequel and the film only confirms it.

For all the visual bells and whistles, Sir Ridley has taken his own cinematic gold and sadly spun straw. Unlike Lucas, he can be forgiven for this middling attempt at a prequel but if this is a sign of things to come he'd do well to leave Blade Runner sequel-less.","5"

If any people ask to me to recommend a very well made sci-fi movie i surely recommend this one, and i really hope that could exist a sequel, i would love it.

And if you tell me, yeah we are a lot of people who doesn't like this movie, that probes this is bad, ill tell you that good taste is not a democracy.

Thanks for this movie guys.","10"
"denis888","Muddled And Very Incosistent","25 April 2014","Ridley Scott is a hugely talented filmmaker. Yes, he is. Charlize Theron, Noomi Rapace, Mike Fassbender are all good actors. Yes, they are. 3D effects and awesome, and all the creatures are extremely realistic. True. Now, there is such a thing as a plot hole. Here, many plot holes. Very many plot holes. I watched this muddled 2-hour bog of pseudo-sci-fi, quasi-religion, as-if-moral film and could not but ask many questions/ Why? Why was that liquid drunken at the very beginning? Who are those white tentacles? Why killing all the humans? Who is that big white Space Jockey and why does he behave he does? Why was that planet abandoned? Why those containers? Many questions and all are unanswered. Sadly, but so. I simply watched just to see the end, which was very confusing and rushed-up. And the sequel? No, thank you, ma'am. That will be truly flabbergasting, to say the least. Noomi is OK, but still she is just a second rank actress, and while she was OK in that Swedish trilogy, here she seems to be a bit clumsy and sluggish. Charlize? Cool, too cool. Cold, I say.

"elliottburrows","If ever there was a film where the trailer was better than the feature...","2 June 2012","This was it. Gutted to be frank...

***Potential Spoilers***

My expectation based on the original films & the trailer : Brooding, sweeping landscapes, moody, grimy but strong characters, shades of 'less is more', tension building & building to an epic crescendo & superb action/effects.

How much of that did I get? Not much is the honest answer.

Setting & landscapes - Superb, but little use was made of them as the majority of the film is set underground in two areas. I really expected the light moving to dark to be gradual and help build the mood of the film. That just didn't happen.

Characters - woeful. Truly Woeful. 90% of the characters are miss-cast. Noomi Rapaces is frankly dreadful miscasting & delivers a poor performance as a wishy washy scientist imo, Therone is a waste of time & effort. Pearce as an elderly wheelchair bound man? Farce, complete farce. Fassbender is very good - not as great as some have suggested, but does enough to come out of it well. The rest? waste of time,effort & fee. The main cast could & should have been 6 strong and spent more time developing those characters. Huge own goal and completely detracts from the film.

'Less is more' - This is what I loved about the original Alien movie, and has worked so well in many of my fave sci fi movies in recent years (i.e Moon) & of all time (2001). When will movie makers realise that people have brains and are able to grasp plots beyond the bleeding obvious? This movie was just in your face, throw everything at the audience, without being refined in the slightest. One minute we're looking at 35000 yr old cave paintings in Scotland, 5 mins later were 4 years in the future and half way around the galaxy. Why was no more time paid to this period of discovery, the most interesting element of the whole movie for me? Unfortunately as soon as David (Fassbender) reawakens the rest of the deadbeat cast from their space travel lumber, the whole movie goes downhill.

Tension - What tension? There is not an ounce of it in the entire film. I've witness more tension as a toddlers tea party. The film plot just bundles along in a mess with half hearted 'who are we, where did we come from's through to characters who act like complete idiots at every turn. Think slasher horror 'Scream' type characters set on another planet.

Action/Effects - the redeeming element of the film. Some superb action sections, and as expected the effects were first class. Such a shame they were wasted on weak screenplay and a paper thin plot

Overall general disappointment that leaves me feeling 'what if'. Not a complete turkey, but not a galaxy away from it.","5"
"AndrewJgregor","Movie is named Prometheus Because it feels like your chained to a rock and your liver is being eaten by birds.","9 June 2012","Prometheus was terrible. I want the 2 hours of my life back. I dragged my girlfriend to it and now I'm pretty sure I have to go to see 3 chick flicks just be able to pick a movie again. I was on a role to, took her to Immortals she loved it, Avengers she also loved it. Third time Prometheus. Oops..If you take someone to Prometheus on a first date you will not be getting any sex, you will not even get a second date. This movie is so bad it made me Sign up for IMDb account just to give it a poor review. They should have just made it a separate movie but they added the last scene in so it could get the entire buzz about being a prequel and thus gain viewers like me who loved the ""Aliens 1 and 2"" growing up.

Let's start with Aliens. A great movie. I wrote a paper in ""Women in Film"" class comparing Ripley to Jesus and how Ridley Scott is a genius. I've seen every alien movie over 10 times each. The first one is amazing the second one is also amazing the third is great and the four is good. So I understand Ridley Scott is running out of ideas and it is hard to write four extra movies from 1. So I assumed this would be like a crappy alien 5. Was I let down. It was awful. I agree with everyone on that its visually stunning. So it taking drugs and watching glow sticks but its Not really what makes a movie. PLOT makes a movie. When you want to create suspense you first build the characters then have terrible things happen to them. With Sci Fi you can do things that are unbelievable, but the way the characters act still needs to be real. I had no attachment to anyone on the ship. They all could die I wouldn't of cared. I feel like Ridley Scott is like a rock star of directors, but even rock stars make shitty Christmas albums. He's old and out of touch with what movie need. They could have gotten rid of all the special effects and told a better story I would have been happy. I feel like no matter what this movie was going to make him money so he didn't care. I bet it's that asshole from lost a show I never watched and am glad. He shouldn't have surrounded himself with such poor writers he was doomed from the start.

Ahh WTF So you are telling me Aliens were created by a robot who poisons a man who has sex with a infantile woman who then gets an alien aborted squid removed from her abdomen which grows into a larger face sucker which deep throats a humanoid alien and poof the first alien is born? ah!!

Everyone knows you start humanoid alien spaceships with a flute solo?? The only thing they did right was the marketing, I REALLY wanted to see it, AND I see about 4 movies a year. One more thing was right the name Prometheus stole fire; this took the fire from Ridley's Career. IT also was just like the myth of Prometheus because watching this movie felt like being chained to a rock and having a bird eat your liver for eternity.","1"
"ToeCutterZero","A gorgeous, yet deeply flawed and confusing film","27 April 2022","This isn't your parent's ""Alien"", nor apparently is it Ridley Scott's Alien.

Prometheus represents the most blatant example of ""film making by committee"" that we've ever seen from a 20th Century Fox production. The film seems incredibly confusing? We see incredible science and technology in Prometheus, but humans haven't apparently kept up? Despite all the aforementioned incredible science and technology, the characters in the film make reprehensibly BAD decisions that simply don't reflect the 'science' part of ""Science Fiction"".

This is because the film was reworked several times and according to executive producer Damon Lindelof , ""Mistakes were made."" Among the most egregious is cutting a bunch of dialog, which was important to understanding the convoluted plot, and then forgetting to repair the narrative broken by the cuts. That approach probably works fine for TV movies with simple, inconsequential plots, but not so much for the prequel to perhaps one of the greatest science fiction films ever made, by the very same director?!

It's been 10 years since the release of Prometheus and we're still no closer to learning how the xenomorph ended up on LV 426, where the crew of the Nostromo encountered it in Alien. This, despite the release of a second prequel, Alien: Covenant in 2017?!

It's unclear when Scott lost his mojo, but it's GONE. Damon Lindelof, who shares writing credits, is no Dan O'Bannon. Lindelof prescribes to JJ Abrams' 'mystery box' approach to story telling. This involves adding gratuitous details to a story, only to abandon them w/o resolution. All those gratuitous 'mysteries' aren't mysteries, they're just 'writing flourishes' that were never intended to be resolved by the writer. Despite promising to finish the story of Alien with prequels, it appears that Disney, who purchased 20th Century Fox in 2020 has no further plans for the Alien franchise.

To summarize, it's unlikely that Prometheus will entertain even the hungriest fans of Alien. It's far more likely viewers will end up questioning.","4"
"gbh1","The 3rd best Alien movie, and 1st best Prometheus movie","8 June 2012","Firstly, don't go into Prometheus like I did expecting a game-changing modern equivalent to the original Alien. Alien still gives me the creeps and jumps today despite me having seen it dozens of times. Prometheus, although very grim, unfortunately doesn't quite reach those heights of terror. Maybe it's too polished, maybe the soundtrack is too heavy-handed, maybe the script was a bit limp in places and the story was too convoluted. For better or worse, Ridley Scott isn't the same director he was in the late 70s. Alien almost seems like a dogme movie in comparison to this film However, Prometheus is still a solid modern sci-fi horror with some great concepts and some nasty sequences which are more than reminiscent of the first two films, albeit very different.

What I found most interesting about this film is the way that, without undermining anything, Scott & co have re-established the world of Alien through to Alien Resurrection as a mere branch off of a very nasty, nightmarish tree. As a teenager I used to draw my own 'Alien' comics and obsess over the Queen > Egg > Face-Hugger > Chest-Burster chain of events *MILD SPOILERS* But Prometheus depicts the mysterious Space Jockeys as 'engineers' of what could be described as weaponised DNA which infects/corrupts anything it comes into contact with. Suddenly everything from the human/egg making scene from Alien: The Directors Cut, to the weird Ripley/Baby monster from Resurrection make a lot more sense. In fact I was very surprised by just how much this film compliments the original and all of it's sequels, even the horrendous AVP instalments.

Don't expect any 'xenomorphs', and yes, this is not the same planet or alien ship seen in the first two films, so therefore anything goes. And yes, the crew of Prometheus have access to much more advanced/sleeker technology as it's Weyland directly funding the mission with, I quote, trillions of dollars. Other tools they use are evidently not so advanced, so yes, a space-born oil refinery filled with grey computers and red buttons could still very much exist in this world, even decades later.

The bottom line is, If you have any interest in these movies, Prometheus is definitely worth your time and money. It might not be as terrifying as Alien or action-packed as Aliens, but it is still much better than anything we've seen from this franchise in 20 years, and more importantly, the scope has now been widened to such a great extent that I hope we see a lot more from it in the years to come.","8"
"sinatrakennedy","Perfection from a Master Film Maker","8 June 2012","Im amazed on a regular basis by how vocal the ""Haters"" are these days. Life's rejects have found a voice in computers and the Internet. Thus, they feel powerful when they get to rip apart movies such as PROMETHEUS. Despite the poor reception many of the tiny voices are offering here, I wish to stand on a mountain top to proclaim my absolute LOVE for this film. I expected everything and walked away with so much more. I was just a boy when the first Alien came out, yet I remember it like it was yesterday. I received the large Alien toy for Christmas. It's been a long time... And well worth the wait. Prometheus is the thinking mans/woman's science fiction film. With each door that closes, 3 new ones open up. I was in awe of the majestic beauty of this film. The utter awesomeness that unfolds. I was transported to another universe and the worst part of all of it is that it eventually ends. It's magic the way it's plot opens like the blooming of a flower, or the unfolding of the flaps on an alien egg. Does it satisfy? Does it answer all our questions? Do we see aliens? Does it do the series justice? I think so... But that's for you to decide. You can either have a small voice and complain and be bitter or you can sit back and enjoy the art and majesty that is PROMETHEUS.","9"

Visually it's very impressive but the story is lame, characters are completely ridiculous and stereotyped. These are not really killers for an Alien movie since the monsters are why most everyone is there...but even they are not very impressive this time.

"slimecity-38663","Promising, oh so promising","28 June 2020","The effects are great - crystal clear. The planetary setting is bleak and stark and rendered so beautifully.

But the acting is the letdown here folks, and the reason why, is the stodgy, terrible, lazy writing. Coming from someone who once took great pains to ensure that his characters motivations and tensions were real (ie: in Alien, not telling the actors when the alien birth would occur, and setting up real-life tension between the actors which would translate to real tension in the film - to this.

Terrible lines at inappropriate times, and turning Noomi Rapace into a bit of a screaming whinger doesnt work well. Neither does having great leads like Charlize and Idris do hammy one-liners (ad severely under-utlising their talent) is at times, painful to watch. The only shining star in this was (as is often the case) Fassbender. The scene of the crazed, disfigured monster-thing storming the ship was just laughable.

Its such a great premise and one that takes philosophies of our possible human origins to great places. But its such a shame thats its let down by lazy writing.

"randall_fire","An awful prequel that fans of the Alien universe shouldn't even consider to watch.","11 June 2012","You know, I'm easily entertained. I want you to know this before reading on.

Please, people, do yourselves an enormous favour: do NOT go and see this piece of crap. The acting is sub-par (with, as usual, a horribly overacting Guy Pearce taking first place in this department) and the characters are not only two- dimensional, but also so damn annoying caricatures you don't care who dies, or when. Which, by the way, is exactly what the other characters do! They don't seem to care about shipmates dying horribly. In fact, it's not mentioned at all 2 minutes later.

The story make NO sense whatsoever, and the different scenes don't even seem to take previous scenes into account! You think you'll find out how ""Alien"" started? Let me tell you: not only will you NOT know, I can guarantee that, with every scene, you'll just go ""but that doesn't even make sense!!!"" and claw your eyes out.

I could list all the incredible non- sensical faults and plot holes here, but that would take a small- sized book. This is probably the worst film I've seen in many years... If you're a fan of Alien: please take my advice: don't go and see it, don't rent it, heaven forbid you buying the DVD, and if it's ever on TV: throw your set out the window, wait two hours and then buy another TV (and window).

At least if it was called ""The Movie That Has NOTHING To Do With the Alien Universe Whatsoever, Nothing At All!"" I would find one thing that was not wrong with it. For shame, Ridley Scott. For shame...","1"
"nesfilmreviews","A fun watch with too much going on.","28 February 2013","A well made sci-fi movie--Ridley Scott's ""Prometheus"" is an entertaining science- fiction film, all the more intriguing because it raises questions about the origin of human life--and doesn't have the answers. Viewers should understand what they're getting; it has less to do with action, than with an exploration of space as a means of learning about what it means to be human.

The majority of the movie takes place during the final weeks of the year 2093. The 17-man crew of the science vessel Prometheus is awakened from hypersleep when the ship approaches their destination - a desolate planet orbiting a distant sun-like star that may be the home of space visitors who intervened in early human history. The creations have come in search of their gods to ask one of the most basic questions of existence: Why? Although this is the stated goal of the mission, several individuals have their own agendas.

The lead scientists are Elizabeth Shaw (Noomi Rapace) and Charlie Holloway (Logan Marshall-Green). Meredith Vickers (Charlize Theron) is in charge--and she makes it clear that if aliens are found, contact is not to be initiated. Prometheus' captain, Janek (Idris Elba), is content to remain on the bridge of his ship and watch on monitors as the expedition departs. There is also an android on board (a precursor to Alien's Ash and Aliens' Bishop): David (Michael Fassbender). The initial expedition discovers a series of massive underground caverns and chambers, as well as the corpse of one giant humanoid, but nothing is alive. That quickly changes, however, and the life forms that come into being are not friendly. The most spellbinding scenes involve the crew members exploring the passages and caverns inside the pyramid, obviously unvisited in aeons, and their experiences with some of the hibernating alien beings.

Noomi Rapace holds her own as the lead of the film, playing a bit of a precursor to Ellen Ripley. Her character is tough--adorable and complex--and she can be both the victim and the hero. The star that outshines Rapace in this film is Michael Fassbender as David, they synthetic human keeping control of the ship. Fassbender has been impressive in both indie and mainstream films lately. It's an understated role, but like any great character, there's as much in what he doesn't say and do as is in what he does.

If there's an obvious element missing from ""Prometheus"", it's a strong identification with the humans, who are underdeveloped and underwritten. Most of what's interesting about the story has little to do with the protagonists.

""Prometheus"" is not without problems but, for the most part, they are problems that result from overreaching rather than playing it safe. ""Prometheus"" has a little too much going on. It's a story of big ideas and, as is often the case with movies designed to be about something--the human characters get marginalized.","7"

Just a little heads up to anyone out there who still hasn't seen Prometheus and was hoping it would be a good prequel to Aliens, please -- be happy with what you have, and forget about this modern 'wannabe'.

*SPOILERS*

Honestly, if I could erase the hours I spent on watching this film, I would. It is an utter piece of garbage, and completely unworthy of the ""Alien"" title disregarding being a standalone movie. The only good thing about this film was the first few minutes, and after that -- trust me, you would want to kill yourself.

First off, this whole ""Prometheus"" project was supposedly a billion dollar science expedition. Now, if they have had good proof about life on other planets, fine by me. By good proof, I meant something better than a few cave paintings (when it is known that religion ruled the world for a long period of time - who knows if these aren't just paintings of what is perceived to be 'God'?) and a nut case scientists who tells you ""It's because I choose to believe in it"".

A nut case scientist who you'd instantly want dead after her first stunt of lugging some decapitated head into the mother ship with no caution what-so-ever; before whining about how we can't bring infected people back into where we live, and then hating the hell out of the offspring of said infected individual. She was practically begging with ridiculous reason that we can still cure said individual ten minutes ago. Now she couldn't wait to kill whatever was inside her immediately because it was obviously a monster. Oh and did we mention she was supposed to be a sterile woman?

All the characters were not true characters with no relatable emotions. None of them made any sense in the decision they make - a biologist who walks away from a dead alien corpse? A geologists who'd rather go back in the ship instead of studying rocks on an alien planet? Said two 'scientists' who freaked out about a dead body but decided to play cool when they encountered a life, worm-like creature? The muddled science was already too much -- care to screw up human emotions too?

This rant and the list of errors could go on forever. (EG what's with the typical, over-used family plot and the old powerful figure behind it all?)

1 star for Fassbender's performance, and quite frankly, that was it. Count CGI in on it as well if you wanted to, but the story just killed it as soon as they wrote it.","1"

They didn't stick one scientist in the bunch , they took stupid risks a real scientist would never dream of , more that that anyone with common sense would'nt consider.

"cgoddard25","Needed to be an hour longer","4 June 2012","I watched Prometheus last night with my girlfriend and a few of her friends. I thought it was completely awesome but unfortunately the rest of my group did not share my enthusiasm. I am an avid Alien fan and love anything to do with that so perhaps this is a little biased. I thought the concept of this alien genetics lab gone wrong was brilliant. How could you not love such an intriguing mystery, which leads me to my main point; I love how little is explained in this film. It leaves so much to the imagination and I also think that Scott expects a certain level of intelligence from his viewers. The same level I would say he expected from all those who loved Alien. I think that both Prometheus and Alien hold a sort of subtlety which expects you to already have a pretty good grasp of humans and what drives us. That being said the rest of my group did not understand anything about the movie, like ""why that android was being so sneaky"" and so on. I cant wait for the next 2 movies and how they will slowly explain all the incredible mysteries of the series to us! That is why I gave this review a 10 mark. Not because I believe it to be a 10 movie (in reality I would give it an 8) but because I simply must see the next 2! And if the haters keep knocking it, none of the mysterious questions that have them so bitter will ever be answered..

Enough with the positives; the real negative of this movie is the lack of character development. You really had no idea why characters behaved in the way they did. The worst part for me was when the crew of the ship just decided to give up their lives so easily and happily like it was going to be fun or something (they should have fled the ship with Charlese Theron and perhaps died from shrapnel outside whilst their captain took one for the team). An extra hour for character development would have been awesome! But other than that a fantastic movie for all those who like to ponder about the mysteries of life, alien life, creation and science!","10"
"areatw","Beyond the visuals, there's nothing","14 September 2017","I had a good idea of what to expect from 'Prometheus' and, for the most part, I was right. I knew it would be visually brilliant, with great attention to detail, realistic looking special effects and top-notch production. I also knew that it would be heavily flawed and would have plot-holes and unanswered questions galore, though it did surprise me just how much of 'Prometheus' made little to no sense.

Much of the film defies logic and there is no explanation provided for many of the key plot developments. The whole film is built on the presumption that the audience will just be taken in by the visual spectacle on-screen without wanting to dig beyond the surface. For many people that may be the case, but I prefer films that have a coherent and logical plot behind them. Unfortunately, 'Prometheus' offers nothing beyond the impressive visuals.","4"

"g61268-1","Too dumb.","9 June 2022","Briefly: The special effects are great, the acting is perfectly fine, but the writing is . . poop! Prometheus is yet another American big budget film/tv series that calls itself ""science fiction"" but which contains no appreciation of actual science. Even the premise - that humans were created by a species living on another planet, while all other life on Earth evolved separately - makes no sense from the perspective of biological evolution. And why would Shaw and Holloway interpret the pictures in the caves as invitations (from the creators of humanity, no less) instead of the obvious: An astronomical event occurred that was visible in different parts of the world? And how would they know exactly where to travel based on a picture of six stars when our galaxy contains about 400 billion? And why would the DNA of the discovered ""engineer"" match that of a human when judging by their appearance they're obviously a different species? And so on. And as others have pointed out, the characters - supposedly brilliant scientists - act like idiots. The deaths of Millburn and Fifield, for instance.. Even children would have been more cautious.

And there's just too much more wrong to take the trouble to mention. If you like expensive special effects and have no knowledge of science, logic or common sense, you might love this movie. Otherwise, spare yourself.","2"
"jmk112233","An unmitigated success","7 August 2014","What can one say for an absolute joke like this? I could throw a ping pong ball to a local playground and hit a 5 year old who knew more about not just science, but humans, how they talk, think and interact.

The only acceptable excuse for utterly irrational, random behaviour of useless, clichéd, undeveloped characters in the movie would be that the writers of this colossal mess have never met a human being before, let alone talked to one.

I would feel dirty to even attempt to go into the details. This is the movie equivalent of ""it's not even wrong"", so there is no place to anchor a critique; it's just one continuum of implausibility, and I am not even talking about aliens or monsters. I am willing to buy even the most outlandish, irrational behaviour from aliens so long as humans in a movie behave and talk somewhat like real humans.

Why 10 stars then? Because it accomplishes it goal. We, as the audience, don't care about characters, plausibility, rationality, storyline, science, motives, consistency, coherency, reality, intellect or dialogue. And we are given exactly what we want and deserve. Kudos for a job well done.","10"

I want to know more about the background of the 'Creators' and their technologies, and what is the connection with Alien. (the open ending). Also what is the connection with the Predator.

I also see there is Prometheus 2 announced for 2014-5, and I beg the director not to mimic or borrows ideas from other movies. It would be best not only for the fans,but for history of film-making and of course for all of the mankind as future explorers of our galaxy(and more) to see UNIQUE,BRAINSTORMING and PURE stories.

It was a breathtaking experience for me watching the humans going on remote moon and exploring.What about a planet next time?! :) This is getting long.... I'm stopping NOW :)","10"
"eatalotofpeople","Left to ponder?","7 June 2012","Anticlimactic, overcomplicated, unoriginal and downright silly. A wasted opportunity. This film started off well, but by mid way through you get a sense that it has lost its way. By the end you get that unnerving feeling that it has sold you short. A Much wasted opportunity. No real scares with no cares. Really can't understand how they screwed this up. And before I get a retort, I will say that I am familiar with the Alien films, but did not watch this film for that reason. I viewed this film because I was hoping that this would place the franchise back on the right track, if not, new direction. Unfortunately the new direction is bastardised, meaning, it stank of re-writes and production interference. You could go as far to say that this film has no lead character, no solid story, bad pacing and it feels like its missing the third act. Its one of those cases were, if the film ran for another 5 minutes towards the end with some sense of urgency, it could have really saved the whole package. Unfortunately the film just fizzles out at the end and your left to ponder why you feel a little stupid.","6"
"freemantle_uk","Ridley Scott does 2001: A Space Odyssey","7 June 2012","Prometheus is the return of Ridley Scott to the sci-fi genre and the Alien Series and hype has been building for months. But a backlash has already has formed and people have stated there negative feelings against it. Is it the cast of the hype being too much or hater just wanting to hate? Elizabeth Shaw (Noomi Rapace) and Charlie Holloway (Logan Marshall-Green) are two scientists who discover a star map in the ruins of civilisations that had no way of contacting each other. With the support of Peter Weyland (Guy Pearce), the CEO of the Weyland Corp. they are funded to go on a scientific exploration to the moon LV-223 to find what Shaw and Holloway call the ""Engineers"". On the voyage are the company representative Meredith Vickers (Charlize Theron), pilot Janek (Idris Elba), biologist Milburn (Rafe Spall), geologist Fifield (Sean Harris) and most importantly the android David (Michael Fassbender). But it turns out there is danger involving the discovery of this life form and of course to anyone who knows the Alien series anything to do with the Weyland Corp. can not be trusted.

There is no denying that Prometheus is a very ambitious sci-fi film, focusing on story and ideas not just action, horror and set-pieces. The theme of corporate manipulation continues as the Weyland Corp use people to achieve their own ends, but there is something even bigger themes as it seems that Scott was trying to make a 2001: A Space Odyssey style epic as humanity tries to find its makers. It even starts like 2001: A Space Odyssey, started in Earth's past to some creature starts life on Earth and a mission find the source of message into outer space. But the take in Prometheus is much darker then it was in 2001: A Space Odyssey which was a much more hopeful film. There are themes of science being crossed with faith and theology, what would happen if humans did meet our makers and what would happen if are what we find is not what we want.

Scott knows how to make worlds, whether it is a historical or sci-fi: that is why Blade Runner and Alien are still so revered. He continues with the tradition of the Alien series of the action set in one location, this time a strange shine, but also expands on the universe of Alien, making it even gritty world as we see a group of people explore the very edge of what we know. There are great set designs and vehicles and Scott uses physical effects and CGI to great effect and helps you get soaked into this grim environment. It is a great looking film, with strong action and a whine inducing scene in the middle.

The cast is great, the roles are filled with great actors, from Fassbender and Rapace to even the likes of Kate Dickie from Red Road in a small role. Fassbender was the big highlight as the cold, emotionless android as he has an agenda. He starts off like Sam Bell from Moon, a character who is alone and has to keep himself busy, researching languages and whilst acting as the caretaker. And I wonder if there is an injoke calling him David as a reference to A.I. Artificial Intelligence. Rapace is a strong lead as woman of science and faith, a strong female character in what is a trait of Scott films and Alien films. She grows a character. Even thought Elba had a small role he was also a really strong member of the cast as the pilot, with plenty of characters and traits to enjoy. It is great he is getting a lot work. Marshall-Green has not been in many films he to was a good lead and worked well with Rapace. Theron too had a badass moment early on as she does push up when she awakes from cryogenic status and is a very professional and cool character. She is much more substance then she was in Snow White and the Huntsman.

The big problem with Prometheus is the written. Damon Lindelof of Lost re-wrote the film and the film has a more episodic style as each twist and event happen and more and more questions are raised. There are questions left unanswered, like David doing some actions and how he would know if something would do a certain action. There are some holes like a biologist wants to run away from an alien rather then examine it: it would be a biologist's dream, the discovery of a life time. There is also obvious sequel baiting but considering the money the film has made the sequel will happen. The final problem is the casting of Guy Pearce, playing a old, dying man and I don't see why an older actor was not cast.

Prometheus is a very interesting and compelling film, which has a lot of ideas. It is attempting to be a smart, more dramatic piece of work and not just a action or horror piece.

On a final note, except for a few moments, the 3D is not essential to the film.","8"
"criscal","Cinematography great, actors fine, story lacks","3 June 2012","As the title of my review summarizes, I liked the cinematography of the movie really well. The actors were doing a good job, with Michael Fassbender as the android David standing out. Charlize Theron as enigmatic director was OK too. The rest of the cast was very well replaceable, especially due to lack of screen-time. Having seen the Alien movies, it is not very original what happens in the movie - just slight ""gene shifts"" of the story spiced up with some hints of a creator/creation story. I must say that the ""leaked"" story-book that was reported about a year earlier sounded much more interesting than the final result. Overall a bit disappointing - I'm not sure that I would see any sequel that this movie heavily hints at.","6"
"faisal_khatib","But with zero expectations, stunning visuals and a brilliant leading pair; I put this film right among the better ones I've seen this year.","11 June 2012","I arrived at the theatre clueless about what Prometheus was all about (apart from it being a sci-fi flick), having not partaken in the hype surrounding the film. Therefore, the lack of any preconceived notion allowed me to enjoy the film more than I expected.

Prometheus as I later found out is the brain child of Director Ridley Scott who was also behind the original film, 'Alien'. The film is supposed to be a prequel to the 1979 hit, which makes sense of the nostalgic feel that was evident throughout the film. Hence comparison between the two is made making you realize Prometheus's problem clearly lies in the several plot holes and a comparatively lackluster supporting cast.

Two archaeologists, Elizabeth Shaw (Noomi Rapace) and her boyfriend Charlie Holloway (Logan Marshall-Green) discover a star map in several different ancient earth civilizations that they believe is an invitation from humanity's creators. It's the year 2093 i.e. four years later that they find themselves at a moon several light years away from earth in a star ship called Prometheus. On discovering several alien structures, they land nearby to explore it further, triggering a series of events leading to what could be humanity's destruction back on earth.

Spectacular visuals introduce you to the film taking complete advantage of those 3D glasses. These visuals stay with you throughout the film and to an extent, are one of its main highlights. CGI creations from action scenes to sweeping landscape shots are amazingly detailed. The cinematography (Dariusz Wolski) is flawless giving the visuals the required space to shine. Ultimately the world created by Scott is impeccable. Unfortunately the same can't be said about the background score (Marc Streitenfeld) that not only didn't fit the film's nature, but didn't even manage to leave a lasting effect.

Several times during the film it made one wonder why something was happening when logically the opposite should be happening. The lack of caution, fear, or clear direction on part of the characters at several occasions was perplexing. There were several 'Captain Obvious' moments too that were quite comical, while there were instances of leaving several loose ends unsolved. Shoddy efforts to cover up the plot holes I believe, which fell flat thanks to complete ignorance towards any kind of character development and clear lack of common sense.

Noomi Rapace as the film's protagonist is convincing with every turn in her character. As the only character with any real development, Noomi punches a pack with a brilliant performance especially when things get desperate. Michael Fassbender (Android called David) in a restrained act comes as a surprise from such a powerful actor. The constant look of curiosity on his face was reminiscence of Commander Data from Star Trek. The character mostly seemed random with no reasoning or motivation stated for his actions adding to the whole loose ends quota. If it wasn't for Michael's brilliant portrayal, the confusion created would have sunk the film.

Charlize Theron (Meredith Vickers) didn't have much to do apart from standing around pretending to be indifferent and cold. Idris Elba (Janek) as the ""can't fly worth a damn"" pilot was cliché riddled and so was his co-pilots Emun Elliott (Chance) and Benedict Wong (Ravel). Sean Harris (Fifield), Kate Dickie (Ford) and Rafe Spall (Millburn) seem like space-fillers. And I have no clue why Guy Pearce played the old man Peter Weyland.

When I reread what I've written above, this film does come across as a half-cooked effort at rebooting a franchise. But with zero expectations, stunning visuals and a brilliant leading pair; I put this film right among the better ones I've seen this year. I really did enjoy it quite a bit which is a surprise, because I'm pretty critical if I must say so myself. So if you're into sci-fi films, this is surely a must-watch.","8"
"kevin-caprani","oh RIdley WHAT WAS THAT?","5 June 2012","I am a great admirer of Ridley Scots films ,few directors have started more impressively, his first three films in particular are quite brilliant, The Duelists,Alien,and Blade Runner are all masterpieces of storytelling and visual realisation, sadly Promethius fails dismally with the story and while the visual imagery is superb it is not enough to save the movie. The first half of the film is excellent and succeeds both visually and intellectually, however after a scene where a 3d holographic image of the universe is displayed the film descends into the sort of cheap shock horror imagery one might expect to find in say a rubber octopus movie,it lacks intelligence and coherence, there are massive plot holes if this is supposed to follow onto the original Alien film,the actions of what is supposed to be a superior alien race are simply non sensical, it totally lacks suspense as a narrative some blood and gore frights but thats about it,really a below par film from Ridley.","3"
"tome_s77","Sure, it's not Alien but what heck is this?","14 June 2012","To start with, this movie isn't all that bad. The graphics are exceptional, the movie starts in an interesting way, Michael Fassbender is really good as David and so on.

The movie itself leaves you with more questions than answers, there are a couple of interesting twists and turns but the movie doesn't elaborate any of them. Instead there are lots of dead ends which leaves you wondering what could have happened. I asked myself lots of times ""why did he/she do this and that?"" or ""why did this happen?"". Noomi Rapace looks like Ellen Ripley but is far from the same quality actor that Sigourney Weaver was in the Alien movies. She is NOT believable as Elizabeth Shaw.

This movie makes me really sad because I had high expectations and was expecting a movie that would blow me away but instead I saw this mediocre ""horror"" movie. Where is the horror in this movie? I was looking for the horror but couldn't find it. Sure, there are some scenes that children shouldn't see but other than that, horror movie? Right...

This movie doesn't deserve 7,7 rating, it's more a 6.0 movie at most. Someone said in a review that this movie gets better the second time. Come on! Am I supposed to see this movie twice to like. I don't think so! If you have to see a movie twice in order to like it then something is really wrong.

If you are expecting to see a movie that you will remember long after then go and see some other movie. This movie WON'T end up in my movie collection. That's for sure!

I'm going to rate it 1 out of 10 because 7,7 is FAR to high for this movie.","10"
"frictionangel","Oh god! Who created this? They should have let the story evolve...","13 June 2012","The ratings for this movie are very misleading and since all the reviews that really talk about what it's like have spoilers in them (which meant I didn't read them before I went and saw the film) I am going to try writing one with enough warnings in it but without spoilers (even if I am banished forever from IMDb in the attempt!). To start with, if you are planning to watch this movie, DON'T! Or go ahead if you are the sort of person who can completely blank out all logic while watching a movie and concentrate on the packaging cos not only is there no story, there is also no dialog (expect stuff in the ""see Scott run, see Scott's dog, see Scott's dog run, run dog run"" class)and the writers apparently don't speak much English (they use words that don't mean anything in the context and it is like listening to someone read a translation from an online-translator). The initial visuals are lovely, then a green chap appears (who is still very lovely) and then it all goes downhill from there! It's really completely downhill for the rest of the movie! They've taken a bunch of nice actors and arranged the storyboard so cunningly that you start disliking the entire lot (for the sheer unbelievable stupidity of the characters) within the first five minutes of their appearing on screen. One actually wants them to die and as quickly as possible. Waiting for bad things to happen to them is the only suspense in this film and it fails at even doing that well. The main horror is the screenplay and the main thrills it offers is when one hopes one will have one character less to listen to! Oh and there is absolutely no science in this fiction. Not even some common sense! Easily the worst film of the year!","1"
"HelenMary","Even 3D, IMAX and Charlize's catsuit can't make it more than a ""meh""","4 June 2012","I was never a fan of the Alien series, but saw them; Aliens (the funny one) the best. This was my first IMAX experience and I wasn't overly impressed, and it was 3D which didn't add much. I gave it 6/10 and those points are mainly awarded to Charlize's catsuit. Sorry, also Logan's gaminess, Fassbender and Rapace's acting and the SFX (almost the entire film was CGI). The plot was silly IMHO and the only sensible character was Elba who was constantly saying ""lets get out of here!"" I can't review really without giving spoilers but I can say the film left me feeling sort of empty (in part due to the unprecedented event of me not finishing my popcorn coz it was horrible) and underwhelmed. Because of the schlok-horror it needed comedy, and there wasn't much. Elba's ""love the one you're with"" and asking Theron whether she wants to get laid was the comedy high point. Rapace was the phenomenal dogged female and carried the film's action and all the ""twists"" I saw coming a mile away. Too many questions at the end. Overall, ""meh!""","5"
"mike_hartwell","Awful science fiction ignores basic science, professionalism, and suspense","5 November 2012","Prometheus 2012 a freaking Ridley Scott direction and it is the worst POS Science Fiction. How a movie with a half a billion dollar budget could ignore basic science, basic professionalism, and even basic horror clichés is beyond me. Ex: The crew finds a construction (alien sentience) the size of Cleveland. Loses two engineers (that just had to touch the cute alien). Ignores basic safety protocol and has to keep searching while the monsters off them one by one. Basic horror cliché: They split up and travel down different dark passages.

Insane robots (the 3 laws have been in existence close to 60 years)

Supposed scientists ignoring basic protocol, Crew members abandoning posts to get laid. An hour after a self inflicted c-section the scientist is walking down the dark passage.

"almafuerte-1","5/5 and 0/5. Total score: 5/10.","9 September 2012","Considering this is supposed to be a sci-fi/action film, I'll analyze those two parts separately.

Regarding Action: The movie is awesome. It does the job, and it does it well. It freaking delivers. Not the best I've seen, but freaking good.

Regarding Science Fiction: There's neither. It doesn't have any science at all, and the scarce science it has, is just so wrong it's not even funny. It doesn't have fiction either. Fiction implies there is a story. There is none. I can't consciously categorize this as science fiction. I think the right definition is more like religious delirium.

The whole movie doesn't make sense. It's Alien all over again, but without the incredible atmosphere of the Alien franchise, and with a fake, inconsistent xenomporph. And for some reason the entire crew of the prometheus, including the scientists, are the most mentally unstable people you will ever meet. I think they only recruited scientologists.

When I say there's no story, I mean it. The characters nor their actions make any kind of sens.

And when I say the science is wrong, I'm talking about instantaneous out-of-the-box carbon-dating an unknown life-form in an unknown environment in an unknown natural satellite that happens to have an atmosphere very rich in C02, messing up speeds and distances, incredibly advanced automated medical procedures that close wounds with metallic staples, androids with no apparent power source (as its body and head continue to work independently after being separated), animals that grow 50 times their size literally creating matter out of thin air, etc.

The movie is enjoyable, to a point, but if you are a science fiction fan, it'll drive you crazy.

And the religious overtones will drive you mad.",NA
"albertalienx","The answer to the question...","18 August 2012","Sometimes, more than the answer to the question, it is more relevant to analyze the nature of the question itself, and that is what this film is all about.

""Where do we came from?"", ""Why they made us?"" ask the mains characters of this film, and the answer may lie between the powerful imaginary of the film and the horror that the characters have to go through.

If you have followed Mr. Ridly Scott filmography, chances are you are gonna pretty much love this film. Beautiful landscape, strong characters (funny thing, the robot is the most interesting character of all), strong visuals, what else can you ask for?

"chimpanzee_boyuk","Flawed, but spellbinding","31 May 2012","I was fortunate enough to grab seats to see Prometheus in IMAX 3D at the Metrocentre in Gateshead for the opening midnight screening last night.This is the first feature film I have seen in IMAX 3D, and I should start by saying that the 3D was actually a lot less obtrusive than in other recent releases films. It may not have added much to the experience, it didn't bother me either. From a technical aspect this is one of the best Sci-Fi films I have seen in a long time, with stunning visuals many of which were shot in stark, earthly landscapes such as Iceland and the Isle of Skye, but which both Ridley Scott and cinematographer Dariusz Wolski manage to make seem brilliantly ethereal and extraterrestrial. All other technical aspects of the film are wonderful.

As far as the story, script and acting goes, most initial reviews that I have read seem incredibly divided, but I was largely impressed. I think Rapace and Fassbender were both highly commendable in their respective roles as the curious, eager scientist with a strong survival instinct and the mild-mannered, mysterious and yet unpredictable and slightly sinister android. Theron and Elba are satisfying in their roles as the icy corporate overseer and droll ship's captain, but the rest of the cast were largely forgettable as cannon fodder. While it certainly lacks the characterisation and naturalistic feel which Alien had, I believe the two films set out to achieve very different things and do them very well; Alien was a much more low-key, personal thriller which focused on character development to create tension, whereas Prometheus focuses on grandeur and spectacle to create awe and adventure. From a story point of view, there are a couple of moments which retrospectively don't make sense, but I found most of these easy to overlook at the time and they really don't bother me too much.

I would also go so far as to say that Prometheus works better as a horror film than Alien did; Alien never repulsed me especially as I knew what was coming due to heavy exposure, but the horror in Prometheus, while strongly reminiscent of the subliminal themes of sex, fear of pregnancy and rape which were strongly implied in Alien (albeit shown in a more overt way in this film), was done in a fresh and surprisingly disturbing way which did repulse me, and I don't say that very often about horror films. I feel that the horror in Alien, while iconic, is not nearly as agonising as it is in Prometheus, as the characters suffer for a short period of time in Alien.

Finally from a philosophical point of view, many have complained that Prometheus raises more questions than it does answer them. I think it, along with a little prior knowledge of the Alien franchise and what Scott originally intended it to be, allows the viewer to construct their own thoughts and conclusions whilst leaving a little open for debate and contemplation should another film be created. For instance, the question which keeps coming up is ""why?"". Well I have my own answers which I was able to make based on what I saw and what I already knew had been speculated about the origins of the Space Jokeys and the mythology of the Alien franchise in general. Furthermore, as a fan of the original Alien, I felt extremely satisfied by how they tied in a lot of the elements to the original film, and am willing to see how Scott chooses to expand on this story, as there are lot of ways it can be done.

On the whole, not a film for everyone, and it will divide opinions, but I really liked it. Is it as groundbreaking as Bladerunner or Alien or any of the classic Sci-Fi epics? No, but I do think that it will be remembered as one of the best Sci-Fi films of its time, and easily as Scott's best film since Gladiator. I gave it 9/10 initially due to the sheer enormity and breathtaking beauty of the world which Scott created. Having had time to ponder some of the flaws, which are evident but did not bother me as much as in other films, I will give it 8/10 (maybe 8.5 if I'm feeling generous), but I would still highly recommend it and put it in the list of best films of 2012 (so far).","7"

"thethinman777","A mess and a half.","7 June 2012","Let's forget for a moment that this film came with all the baggage of being an Alien prequel of sorts, along with the knowledge that it isn't really one either but a standalone attempt at something original. Forget for just a moment that this was directed by Ridley Scott. After watching Prometheus I had no choice but to forget these things because I had to judge it for what it was it really was; a remake of Mission To Mars.......and that film sucked. I was gob-smacked when I realised, halfway through this mess, that its strongest influence was that torturous celluloid skid-mark. It even has a horribly misjudged score.

The positives: The visuals are, for the most part, great. Good job by anyone in that department. Ummm......err.....nope, that's it.

The negatives: It's not entertaining, a major crime for a film to commit. The script is absolutely awful and can be held responsible for nearly all of this films shortcomings. Decent pacing almost entirely absent, inept, cliché-ridden (and awesomely stupid) dialogue that makes you cringe......it's just bad. Editing is all over the place, which is either a reflection of the script or just bad editing, I may never know for sure. Want to care about characters? Tough luck. Empathy has to be earned. The really good films do this in a variety of ways but this isn't one of those films. Like to be frustrated? Good, you're in for a treat (the editing will be your best friend). Anger may well follow so take some precautions. Big ideas? Oh please, it's just the same old, tired questions that have been around for ever: Why are we here? Where do we come from? Who made us? Is there a God? Blah, blah, blah. I find it more interesting that we don't know the answers to those questions anyway but Prometheus asks them......and then forgets that it did and vanishes up it's crack into the void (where it finds kinship with The Fountain and they live happily ever after). After watching Reason and her close friend Logic being raped for two hours the ending broke my heart and all I could see was Tim Robbins floating in space with a frozen head.

I love Alien 3. The majority doesn't but, with the longer cut available, I think that David Fincher crafted a unique, memorable and stylish space-horror out of a complete mess and horrible working conditions. That takes considerable talent. Ridley Scott and company had time, space, freedom and access to all the latest toys.....and we get this.

It's a crime. Someone needs to go to jail (at the very least for those horribly misleading trailers).

Wait a minute! It's me isn't it *facepalm*. I'm just unable to appreciate what I saw.....too stupid I guess. I mean, it's not like the trailers were desperate or anything so it's my fault for having any kind of expectation at all. Boy, do I feel stupid. I must not have an open mind, that's it. My mistake.","3"
"synevy","Just Let Go","15 August 2012","There are a few things i've learned from all the ""games"" around this movie. Michael Fassbender has made the film Gods furious (don't ask me why), Ridley Scott is also trying stuff, and viral videos or many extended trailers are bad for your mental health and judgment. So, blow away the fog of prejudice that's fallen over Hollywood, pay attention to the film and find out whether you like it or not, whether it's related to Alien or NOT.

One of the first few premier screenings of Prometheus was in 3D. Still, i don't think that any other film can be as great in 3D as Avatar. Most of the times, during watching, i was taking off the glasses to rest my eyes. It was like watching a 2D movie with an unnecessary filter. My expectations were high, due to the visual effects that were introduced in the trailers, but it appeared that one can pleasantly watch it in 2D (so keep that money for an extra cup of your favorite beverage).

The story is simple. A team of scientist funded by a big technological corporation (Weyland Industries) are setting a course to a distant planet in search of the origins of mankind, based on the ""writings"" of a cave wall and considering it as a message from the creators of humanity.

The ""actual"" cast is rather limited. Michael Fassbender performs very accurate as the android who escorts the team to -originaly- help the scientists and plays an important role through-out the film. The other important character is Noomi Rapace's Elizabeth Shaw. I think the film makers wanted a new version of Sigourney Weaver's Ellen Ripley, but no! The rest of the cast is mostly supportive, like Charlize Theron, Logan Marshall-Green and Idris Elba. They're all very good actors but this movie didn't seem like a chance for them to rise up a bit more. Everyone else seemed dispensable and their actions predictable enough to figure out for yourself on ""who stays till the end"".

The visual effects are quite rewarding with some really great photography and a few of Ridley Scott's cinematic tricks and camera takes. There are some flaws, if you watch carefully. I see it as a game like Spot The Differences or What's Wrong With This Picture! That's interesting.

Truth is, i was never interested in the Alien movies (even though i'm a huge sci-fi fan). I know their story but none of it got me to follow religiously and blindly Ridley Scott's work -there are other films for that-. Here's the good news: You don't have to have seen Alien to watch Prometheus. If you've ever heard of it, that's good but not essential.

Overall, it's a great sci-fi film, worth watching, makes the difference between all those remakes and comic book based films that are laying around lately. Could be called original (could be) and definitely needs (will be) a sequel.","8"
"caseymoviemania","Casey's Movie Mania: PROMETHEUS (2012) review","10 June 2012","How often you get to watch a blockbuster movie where it mesmerizes you at the opening minute, before gradually grabs you by the throat and never let go until the very end? The answer is none others than PROMETHEUS, Ridley Scott's long-awaited comeback to sci-fi genre since BLADE RUNNER (1982). It is certainly well worth the wait especially since PROMETHEUS is a prequel to his own timeless classic, ALIEN (1979). Well, actually it is more of an indirect prequel (you just have to see it for yourself). But one thing for sure, prequel or not, PROMETHEUS is a rare breed -- a thought-provoking, yet frightening science-fiction epic that isn't afraid to ask difficult questions related to our very own existence....

"lbrownfi92","More than Meets the Eye","15 July 2023","Prometheus is certainly more than meets the eye.

I was pleasantly surprised by the film in numerous ways. The visuals are impressive, from the landscapes to the design of the ships. The cast was excellent; exceptionally noteworthy was Michael Fassbender, but all of them were cast perfectly for their roles. The story is interesting and compelling and the action is consistently intense and riveting.

It poses larger questions, too, and grapples with themes such as creation versus destruction, and selfishness versus sacrifice. In questioning why the Engineers chose to create then destroy, one has to ask themselves why us humans do the same thing.

So many movies of this same type suffer from bad visuals, a bad cast, or bad writing. But I'm happy that this film avoided those pitfalls, because it was genuinely enjoyable to watch.","7"
"lars41","A huge disappointment.","20 November 2012","I remember many years ago leaving the cinema after watching Alien: The eight passenger. I was sixteen years old, and shaken to the core. When a police car passed with blue lights flashing, but no sirens, I jumped two feet into the air from sheer shock.

Later I watched James Cameron's Aliens and while I wasn't blown away the same way, the aggressive, gung ho style of the movie made for a very entertaining romp.

Since then the Aliens franchise has been a downhill slope, and I'd all but given up on it. So when the word spread that Ridley Scott was returning to where he came from, I was. to say the least, excited.

I was, however, very disappointed with the result.

It simply, in spite of being an impressive visual spectacle, never caught my attention. The plot was messy and clunky, where silly things would happen simply in order to have things move on, and half the characters that was present might as well not have been for all that they mattered.

In the end there was more questions raised than answers given, and the obvious To Be Continued ending didn't do anything to improve it.

The worst part was the flat, unengaging two-dimensional characters. I didn't care about their fate, because I had no idea who they were and where they came from. The comparisons between Sigourney Weaver and Noomi Rapace are ludicrous. Where Weaver came across as tough and resourceful even when terribly scared and running for her life, Rapace is going through the motions without ever convincing me, not aided by one of the most silly scenes in the history of cinema.

The exceptions was Michael Fassbender and Charlize Theron, who were both giving solid performances, but, alas, to no avail. There's were the only characters I was interested in, but again, unfortunately, very few answers were given and utterly pointless events defined their respective conclusions.

The presence of Guy Pearce in this movie remains to me the biggest question. Why, why, why? Utterly and completely miscast for this part, his character is such a stereotype that it becomes laughable.

After Ridley Scott's recent work, Body of Lies and Robin Hood I had serious doubts whether he still had the ability to create the sweeping, epic dramas he once were so good at. This movie nailed that doubt to the board.

"SdwOne","An ambitious effort that didn't quite work in places...","7 June 2012","OK So yeah, this was a film that I must admit; I've been literally dying to see ever since I heard the name ""Prometheus"" being whispered around in quiet corners of the movie world. Ridley Scott is a director in the heavy weight division and his films have stood the test of time And of course, Alien and Aliens (the others are not even worth mentioning!) have attained legendary status among most sci-fi fans so, it was with great anticipation when I finally got to see this film

OK The Good As is the case these days with modern films chock full with special effects, the CGI, visuals and camera shots were all very impressive. It is quite simply, a visual treat and, some of the more gory bits may leave some of you with a weak disposition to watch those scenes firmly behind your trembling hands!

The tension was simply no where near as intense as Alien or Aliens. Sure, there was some tension but, given the 15 age rating you could sense that they had to play some of that down.

The acting? Well Nothing special. This was a bit of a shame! Apart from a good performance from Noomi Rapace, that was it really! A few good wise cracks from some of the supporting cast but, nothing notable comes to mind considering I just watched the film just over an hour ago. In short, the dialogue, acting, wise cracks etc was simply no where near that found in Aliens.

The story? Well now, this is when things got messy Without giving anything away just be prepared to get very confused in places! You will go away from this film with a LOT of unanswered questions. Perhaps too many. But then, Ridley is obviously trying to whet our appetites for more upcoming films and boy, he's left a crap load of loose ends to tie up! So, take this point as you will Is leaving the movie theatre with more questions than answers a good thing? Then you're in for a treat. Otherwise you will get frustrated period or get frustrated waiting for the next instalment(s).

There were a couple of very weak twists in the story which the astute amongst you will quickly work out in no time. So, apart from the premise of this film with regards to the Big Question, it's totally non-taxing on the brain Well It IS the 21st century after all!

Personally, it would have been nice to have gotten some concrete answers but I guess Ridley hasn't quite finished with us yet!

The action? Not much. And what was there was a bit silly in certain places. You want action? Stick with Aliens!

OK So in a nutshell, no this film is NOT Alien or Aliens. In some ways it's not even close. Not necessarily a bad thing but then one has to ask, is it a good film on its own merits? Well here it's a very mixed bag. Some things simply just didn't work, unless Ridley intends to resolve such matters in later films. So perhaps some patience is required. Some will undoubtedly pour scorn on this and some will be eager for more films I think this is pretty much where the battle lines for fans and trolls of this movie alike will be drawn over the next few months. However, overall, not a bad film but it's not great either Assuming that Ridley gets his wish to make more films, I guess we will all have to simply wait and see how this new take on the Alien franchise will play out.

But it has to be said I for one am intrigued!","7"
"jwpotjepoeper","Nothing happens in this movie, really nothing!","26 December 2012","This was the most boring movie I watched in a long time. Ik really liked the first 2 Alien films, the third Alien movie was OK and the fourth sucked big time, also the 2 AVP movies were very poor. But this is even worse then all of those previous mentioned movies. Nothing ever really happens. And the things that do happen are unexplainable or totally useless. Why was the old Weyland there? What purpose has the tentacle alien baby? Why does nobody ever really panic? What was the real purpose of going to this planet? Why did the alien that they wake kill everybody? Those are just a few questions that have no answers. The movie has good CGI I'll give it that, but that really the only thing its got. No suspense, no real gore, no real scary moments, no good action. This is something that the previous Alien movies did have. I really would like to know what Ridley Scott was thinking when he made this movie, I do know that he wasn't thinking clear. To conclude, a very poor en boring movie! Don't waste 2 hours of your life on it!","1"
"AlonsoMoseleyFBI","Dumbed down scifi","26 March 2022","Won't rehash what so. Many others have said. But this is currently at 7/10? A sad indictment, really.

Things went pear-shaped at alien 3, mainly because Fincher was not left alone, and all subsequent releases were a steaming pile of poo.

This, and Aliwn Covenant have no excuse whatsoever. All those years to come up with this nonsense? Wow.","1"
"fifer71","Read the books for a believable story","20 June 2012","What has happened to this film it could have been great but it turned into a reasonably looking, poorly acted, terrible written with direction that gave it all the energy of a damp squib.

In Alien there is a cargo ship that intercepts an ALIEN!!! beacon and is sent to discover what it comes from. The ship is buffeted and battered and makes a rough landing. The crew leave the Nostromo and find a crashed ship

filled with eggs in some sort of smoke filled trough and an alien pilot which has had something burst from it's chest.

In Prometheus two scientists with a mad cap theory based on some unconnected drawings of a roughly similar group of stars convince a industrialist to spend trillions of dollars to go off on a wild goose chase into deep space. This flight can't be registered in any way as it is not mentioned in any of the later films. In fact it is openly denied that the corporation has no knowledge of the planet. This mission glides to a smooth landing on the planet in a ship far more high tech than the ship used in the later Alien film and still more high tech than the 50 year later film Aliens. They find a huge alien complex with multiple ships non of which is found in either Alien or later in Aliens when the planet is being terraformed.

The story then unfolds with scientist taking no real safety measures even after crew become infected discover many strange types of goo and creatures and even an alien. This humanoid alien tries to destroy mankind (it is never explained how they discovered his plans) so the humans (who we have no interest in crash their ship into the alien ship preventing take off.

The Alien then leaves the ship and attacks the last human but is thwarted by a huge face hugger that has grown after being sterilised and having no food becomes bigger than the alien that is twice as large as a human. This face hugger plants an embryo similar to the one in Alien that then bursts from the alien beings chest and look vaguely like the xenomorph from the other films.The film then ends with no real explanation of how the alien that the xenomorph burst out of moves from one ship to another after dying or why a creature that has come from goo to become the xenomorph would now go back to the alien ship and lay eggs.

There are books by Steve Perry that explain everything that went on in the first films better than Ridley Scott has in this terrible film. I get the feeling He wanted to make a film about the origins of mankind but nobody was interested so he through in some strange Alien prequel idea into the mix just to get money from the studios.

If you love the Alien film even if you could stretch your imagination to accept AVP don't watch this film the plot has more perforations than a tea bag, the acting is sterile leaving you not caring about the characters. It does have good visuals but in the movies as in computer games good graphics doesn't make a good game.

This film is simply the worst big budget film I have seen and that includes The Phantom Menace. In Prometheus Jarjar Binks would have been a great character compared to the rest of the cast.","1"
"azanti0029","Commendable failure, but still a failure.","4 November 2012","Regarding this film, I was a huge fan of the first two Alien movies, and a big fan of Scott in general, met him and he was a very nice man. So it was with great excitement that I got to take my fiancée to see this in the opening week at the Imax. Despite all the debates about the film, all that matters is what I see on the screen the first time I go, and then the only thing that really matters is 'Is it any good...?' My answer isn't a simple yes and no unfortunately. Its certainly would be silly to dismiss it as crap, but I can't chant its praises either, even though I really want to, and as I said before I met Ridley and he was a very nice man and I am a big fan. IT IS A FILM YOU SHOULD SEE ON A BIG SCREEN, THE BIGGER THE BETTER, of that, there is no doubt.

I need to prefix my comments here with the following - Ultimately, I don't care if its part prequel, all prequel or isn't a prequel and someone is pretending that its not a prequel all I care about is 'DOES IT MAKE A GOOD FILM IN ITS OWN RIGHT' ??? Does it work on its own? Because it certainly should. It has a great premises, a good cast, and it looks lovely, so why doesn't it work? Now when I first left the screen I was in a good mood, but part of me felt really empty, then as time went past I realised more and more of the film didn't make sense, contradicted the boundaries of the films own reality (Don't you hate it when they do that? See the last Brosnan Bond for an explanation) and there seemed to be huge chunks missing. Okay, great there might be a directors cut to come, awesome, look forward to that. But that should add depth to whats already there, not compensate for holes that already exist, and this film had holes a plenty.

The good points were as always Scotts use of the Camera, the shots, the visuals, effects, casting, (Some of the acting) but the bad were plenty too.

The script has some dire, truly dire, lines. Characters that are established as scared when there is nothing to be scared of act completely unafraid when an obviously snake like monster is about to eat them. The Captain of the ship seems either woefully underwritten or under developed. Idris, I love you normally, but what was going on here? We establish a Captain who does seem to care about and have a loyal crew, then a serious incident occurs which kills at least 5 of them, which passes without so much as a comment or emotional reaction (Cut, perhaps? shoot the editor then) making the rest of his performance therefore totally unbelievable. Naomi Repace is good enough but again her character is so one dimensional, the scene where she removes the foetus, while shocking is made totally laughable by the scenes that immediately follow it, I know this is Science Fiction, but come on, you might as well have an Alien put on a Hawaiian hat then and dance with the android. Repace seemed to be trying an American accent in some scenes and totally repressing her own, then in other scenes, there was her Scandanavian in every word.

The opening 15 minutes gave me loads of confidence that this was really going to be something but it was ruined by a number of convoluted subplots involving Waylan and his dream of an ever lasting life, which though perhaps realistic within the setting is an overused idea that has been seen so many times before - why not focus purely on the dilemmas of the crew of the ship, there were 17 of them after all, many of whom were reduced to no name roles in the credit list (Ship Techician 1 and so on) I can actually remember the names of every single marine in Aliens, even the ones who did not speak, such was the power of the picture, and that was after a single viewing. (Names like Spunkmeyer do tend to stick in the head, but I digress) Other really iffy moments are when two crew are reporting in that they have found Alien life (You know, a fairly big deal!) at this moment the Captain is elsewhere, then when he comes back on the bridge later, he says nothing of the report the men mentioned, trust me, this isn't a plot thing. Everyone can see the crews camera footage, its already been established earlier, so why isn't this mentioned by anyone? Did they forget to hit rewind or something? Characters do really really stupid things, sure like real life, but this is a movie, and it has to work in context presented, and a lot of it didn't. Fassbender was the best thing in the film, but his limitations as an Android seemed to be contradictory at best and by the end really confusing. He laughs at his own jokes, yet is apparently devoid of real feelings. Okay maybe he is trying to learn, like Data from Star Trek or something, who knows because it wasn't explored. I think Fassbender is actually the best British male actor around today and he was brilliant but could not alone save the movie.

Don't get me wrong, I didn't hate or even dislike this movie, but I find it a little mystifying that someone of the calibre of Scott should make such glaring errors in his film. I am seriously hoping that an extended cut will at least rectify some of the glaring character defects that we seemed to endlessly witness but feel doubtful that it can turn what is a very commendable but ultimately flawed film, into a great one.","3"
"charles-arthur-400-459316","Nails scraping down the blackboard of your brain. Unbelievable characters; sloppy plotting; lousy pacing","20 June 2012","A film needs only do a few things: have characters who you can believe in (that is, the human ones behave like humans would); have a plot which makes sense as it unfolds (even if you have to experience it backwards, or in layers - think of two famous Christopher Nolan films); have pacing which makes it enjoyable to experience.

Prometheus does none of these. The humans, when they face a crisis or something unknown, don't behave as you'd expect people to do - warily and with some sense of self-preservation. They're either ridiculously trusting, or they just plow in without reflection - has none of them ever seen a horror movie, even in this far-off future? They make John Hurt's character in the original Alien look like a model of rectitude and careful scientific approach.

The characters are poorly developed: there are too many, and you don't get an idea of who they are, what they want or what their motivations are. Again, contrast with the original Alien, where the (small) crew all have clearly identified personalities, aims, wants, interactions, etc.

The plot is insensible; literally it numbs you. Not every point needs make sense as you watch, but you shouldn't be saying ""wait, what? That makes no sense"" five minutes after any key scene.

The science is total rubbish. If you've any knowledge of biology or evolution, you won't enjoy this; scene after scene will be like nails scraping down the blackboard of your brain.

And finally, the pacing is lousy. There's no point where you feel that the characters are trying to pool their knowledge, or that they're trying to get control of what's happening. Instead, it tries to throw things at you all over the place in order to shock. (Again, compare to the original Alien, where the characters continually get together to try to figure out what to do next as each plan falls apart.) When things happen relentlessly but you don't understand why, you're just left bemused.

Compare the pacing and plot in Ridley Scott's Gladiator (where you have fights, and then the pauses in between during which the plot develops, and which explain the importance of each coming fight) and you realise what it looks like when done well.

This film has pulled in megabucks, partly through a marketing splurge which drew lots of people in - I know it did me (I watched it in 3D Imax).

However, within about half an hour I was ready to walk out; I only stayed because I nursed some faint belief that it would get better, or redeem itself. It didn't. Save yourself. Rent Alien.","1"
"3xHCCH","A Very Unscientific Science-Fiction Movie","7 June 2012","In the year 2089, a couple of archaeologists(?) Holloway (Logan Marshall Green) and Shaw (Noomi Rapace) find pictograms in various caves and ancient temples that suggested alien origins of human life in a faraway star system. They earn the sponsorship of old trillionaire Peter Weyland (Guy Pearce in atrocious old-age make-up) to launch a 2-year expedition with more scientists to travel to that planet in a vessel called ""Prometheus"" to study it and search for these ""engineers"" of the human race. They get more than what they bargained for as the crew members, as well as the very existence of Earth itself, were threatened by the aliens they encounter there. Can the crew of the Prometheus escape this alien threat that they have unleashed upon themselves?

The set decoration, cinematography, editing, sound and visual effects are by all means top-notch under the direction of veteran Ridley Scott. This is certainly a beautiful film to watch. However, the utter disregard for any scientific principles of research investigation and medicine is really very distracting. These scientists in this crew do not follow very basic scientific procedures. Would you really remove your helmet in an unknown atmosphere just because your equipment says it is safe? Would you do an autopsy of an alien head with your face mask hanging around your neck? Could you get up and run right after a bloody do-it-yourself Caesarean operation? Would the DNA of the ancient ""engineers"" still EXACTLY MATCH with human DNA after all these years without any mutation?

There simply too many mind-boggling questions. Was that breath-taking opening shot of a volcanic lake supposed to be Earth? When that white alien drank the black stuff, his DNA was seen mutating in the water, what then? Could an android (Michael Fassbender) really be deceitful, and why would he be? What is the point of Charlize Theron's icy character Vickers? Even the epilogue puzzles with even more questions. The way that last alien looked with the big horn on its head felt totally forced, and obviously shoehorned to coincide with the original ""Alien"" movie, also created and directed by Ridley Scott.

So overall, this movie is just OK. It is indeed a visual spectacle, but the story development leaves so much to be desired. Some movies you could enter and leave your brain checked at the door, but not this one. In this type of movie, you will expect some scientific credibility in order for it to work. Unfortunately, ""Prometheus"" fails in that regard.","6"
"cultfilmfan","Prometheus","11 June 2012","Prometheus is a prequel to the 1979 film Alien also directed by Prometheus director Ridley Scott, and according to Scott, both films take place and are set in the same universe. The 1979 film Alien, has always been one of my favorites. It works as both a great science fiction film as well as a horror film as well. When it came out in 1979, Alien was nominated for two Academy Awards, and won one for Best Visual Effects. The film was well received by critics and audiences and proved to be also a major hit at the box office. It has also been credited as being one of the scariest films ever made. What worked so well for the original Alien, was it was a great looking film with it's sets and production design and keeping special effects very minimal, which could have also been because of the time it was made, but how they managed to pull it off was brilliant. The film was very affective at both keeping your interest as well as putting you in a feeling of dread and terror. Everything about the film worked and was successful at being a class act horror film. The music, the claustrophobic feeling you get from watching it and of course, not knowing what exactly is going to happen, or if it will, or when. The film launched the career of actress Sigourney Weaver, and showed that a woman could be a leading heroine and also be extremely tough, yet vulnerable and carry a movie all on her own, without needing the likes of Stallone, or Arnie to help her. The film looked great, had a great atmosphere and feel to it and plus it really was effective at creeping you out and keeping you entertained as well. The film because of it's success was followed by numerous sequels, some being quite good and others not. Now we come to Prometheus, done by original Alien director, Ridley Scott and also giving us a somewhat new story, but trying to make it connect somehow to events that we would later see in Alien, and the above mentioned sequels. When, I first saw the theatrical trailer for Prometheus, I thought that it would either turn out to be a great film, or a huge flop. It had the potential to be both. Luckily, I gave it a chance and went to see it and it is certainly no flop. With, Prometheus, Scott is again able to capture the style, mood and atmosphere of the original Alien. It's a fantastic looking film with it's sets and production design giving it a very futuristic yet believable and fascinating look to it. Much to my delight the special effects were kept at a minimum and what we got instead was top notch makeup and costume design people as well as some of the best technical artists in the business making everything look and feel great and it's affect is quite impressive. I did not see the 3D version of the film, but there is so much still that you can take in and take away from the 2D version of the film. The new worlds and places these characters take you to are so breathtakingly beautiful, yet haunting and mysterious at the same time that it almost has an overwhelming affect on you while watching it. The film's cinematography also made everything looked great and heavily contributed to this feeling. The story for the film did borrow some elements from the original Alien film, that I think a lot of fans of the series will also quickly pick up on, but there is also a lot of new stuff to absorb and take it as well as enjoy as well. The film's script is actually quite philosophical and intelligent and to say I totally understood everything with just one viewing, I would be lying. This is a film that requires you to pay attention and just devote your mind and your senses to the film for it's two hour running time and just let yourself go with it. I think on repeat viewings the film would still hold up terrifically well and I think it is one of those films that you will understand more as well as also appreciate more on a repeat, or several repeated viewings. The feeling of dread and terror is also in this film. I don't think it's affect was quite the same as the original Alien, but nevertheless still quite affective and using major skills and talent in delivering the scares including great music, timing, atmosphere and just building up the tension and surprises while keeping the gore at a minimum and not going overboard with fake looking gore, or special effects. The performances from Noomi Rapace as well as Michael Fassbender are terrific here and they really carry the film along with it's good supporting cast and it's very talented crew behind the camera. Really for me there was nothing not to like about this film. The advertising and marketing of the film was done in a great way to not give anything away, but to make us want to see it anyway. The film is epic and grand in the scale of 2001: A Space Odyssey, or even last year's Tree of Life. It is extremely affective and is certainly a thinking person's science fiction film, but also for the horror film fan as well. This is certainly a worthy prequel to the original Alien, and one day I think it will be held in the same regard and grow with it's stature and reputation over time. One of 2012's best films.","10"
"mantass132","Worst Sci-fi movie I've ever seen","28 June 2012","I went to this movie with high expectations, hoping for something astonishing. But the movie was rather disappointing and pitiful. I was just hoping it would end sooner, and thought I wasted 2 hours and some money for this movie. The beginning was promising, so I hoped it would eventually get better, but it didn't. Too many holes in the plot, terrible overall acting, and too many goofs. It seemed to me that the producers wasted more money on the effects (which weren't that good though), than on the plot. I just couldn't stand the plot holes. I would suggest not wasting your money, and waiting for a DVD.

"duckforceone-5-626305","Explains the Alien storyline - Movie mostly for aliens and sci-fi fans.","30 May 2012","Well I was just in the theater and watched Prometheus.

As an avid Aliens fan, I know all the movies, and have read most of the books out there. But I also read the interview with Ridley Scott, saying that this was not an Alien movie. So I went in, not expecting any aliens, but a good story.

And the story was good. It explained a lot of the story before the alien movie, and answered a lot of my questions.

I don't know if Ridley Scott have read a lot of the aliens novels out there, but it seemed he had the same ideas as to what has been written about the ""Space jockeys"". I really liked that, intentional or not.

Most of the characters, were unfortunately very shallow, lacking depth. Too many introduced, and no real focus on them. Pure stereo types of some sort.

Fassbender did really well though as David, the android.

The visuals were amazing, nice and crisp. Good looking and well worth watching in the theater. The 3D part though, while great looking, was too few and far between to be really necessary to watch in 3D.

Again, as an avid Aliens fan, I will only rate this a solid 7. Where the original Alien is a 9 and Aliens is 10 in pure awesomeness.

But unless you are an alien or sci-fi fan, i would not recommend it for ordinary watching. It will leave you with too many questions, and too many things not understood.

Especially as some of the characters, are seen in more detail on the internet commercials and TED talks. If you haven't watched them, you will not get their points and meaning.","7"
"danieltay47","Not as good as it seems","29 June 2012","This show have it's good point, but mostly, it's all bad. The starting of the show seems rather alright as it was flowing rather smoothly. However, already at the beginning of the show, it was extremely boring. I find myself nearly dozing off at the front part of the show as all that talking without the suspense which it was suppose to have just makes it dreadful to watch. At least at the later part of the show begins to get more interesting and the suspense was starting to build up. But the ironic thing is that the story wasn't flowing properly as it progresses deeper. In fact, the plot seems to be mixing up at the last few part and it felt more like the director was vomiting out whatever he could to end the show, something to me which makes it extremely horrible. But the only plus side to the story is that it is not predictable as I thought it would. To conclude, it's not really worth the time to watch or let alone buy the DVD. If you are really interested to watch the movie, I recommend you wait for HBO or FOXMovies Premium to play it on TV.","4"
"jsjeffjeff","How about science fiction","24 June 2012","These thoughts are for people who have already seen Prometheus:

Prometheus one third spectacular production, one third science fiction and, unfortunately one third cheap horror film. It starts with the question of finding our makers. Seems like a meaty enough subject. But sure enough, we're immediately taken into a dark, wet underground with relics, snakes, goo, cannisters and undead spacemen. From that point on its all Indiana Jones and no science fiction. In Prometheus, Guy Pearce spent a trillion dollars on this project to answer our fundamental question. But he apparently didn't have enough money to select a crew of competent people, opting instead to keep the missions purpose a secret and staff up with half wits that freak out when they learn what the missions about. No matter, the dying billionaire fakes his own death and hides out on his own spaceship. Why hideout? Who knows. Dave the robot seems to know too much about the aliens, then poisons one of the scientist while arranging for him to impregnate another scientist with an octopus like creature. Why impregnate her? I'd hate to think its just so she can give herself an abortion on screen. Why poison the scientist? Who knows, not me. The highly advanced spaceman wakes up and forsakes all his intellect and development to engage in a type of barroom brawl massacring humans. Why? W.K.N.M. The octopus and the awakened spaceman have a terrible fight. Why? W.K.N.M. Here's my idea for the sequel: lets wake up Issac Assimov and have him write a true science fiction script, no caves, no octopus. Just a solid exploration of a journey to meet our pro creators. Then lets lock Ridley Scott in a prop room and limit him to photography and special effects.","3"
"findingdevotion","Good CGI can't detract from awful story","18 September 2012","The main reason I'm giving a 1 instead of a 6 it's because I have much higher expectations from a flick that tries to bind together a famous series and has the name Ridley Scott connected to it.

The movie has a lot going for it. Michael Fassbender has style and talent and doesn't waiver that here. Noomi Rapace is awesome and Logan Marshall-Greene has a distinct cool about him. I love Charlize Theron and I am sorry she wasn't better used here (same like Fassbender).

Also, the CGI is simply amazing I can't wait for a Blu-Ray HD version.

But, alas, there are a few major letdowns as well.

First, it's the story itself. Somehow the writers couldn't get a grip on connecting it to the Aliens universe in a manageable way and chose to go with cheap mythology.

The android (a must have for an ""Alien"" movie) just doesn't feel like an android. Androids in ""Alien"" were always evil-tinted, but also smart, logical, strong and useful in key points in the plot. Fassbender's character is less than useless, his key-characteristic being an obvious jealousy of humanity (after all, Galloway the scientist, managed to find the origin of life and was able to set humanity on a collision course with the fate of the mythological Prometheus without the endless information storage abilities of an android).

The lesson in the story is also cheap: you need faith in addition to knowledge to make it. This feels ironic since the only two characters who truly have a purpose (Idris Elba who sacrifices himself to protect Earth and Green who sacrifices himself to protect the crew) were clearly polarized: Elba had faith and Green had knowledge.

Charlize Theron dies the silliest death I've seen in a blockbuster, senseless and lacking any merit whatsoever: crushed by a falling ship. Seriously??

"Geeky Randy","Geeky Randy's summary","4 July 2012","Scott directs this implicit prequel to his terrifying 1979 sci-fi noir classic ALIEN about a crew's exploration on a distant planet that might have the answers to the origin of mankind and the meaning of life. Great subtle nods to the other films in the franchise, especially ALIEN; however, the touches of horror turn into sci-fi/action nonsense by film's end, with very little (if any) neo-noir elements that made ALIEN such a fantastic film. Admirable that CGI was used as little as possible outside of establishing-shots and Streitenfeld's score is one of the best that the industry has offered in the last few years. PROMETHEUS is nicely packed with ambiguity and symbolism to keep itself fresh even after multiple viewings; however, when a film has this incredibly graceful method of storytelling, why make the protagonist someone seeking answers instead of asking questions? It's a contradiction of how the audience is intended to feel and therefore distances us from our main character. Star Rapace looks weak and plays the main character equally timid to her physical appearance, with no emotional strength whatsoever; and Marshall-Green's casting as her partner and love-interest is so mismatched and unnecessary. Did they really need 45-year-old Pearce to play a 103-year-old man? UGH! There are plenty of talented elderly actors who could have handled this simple role. At least Elba, Fassbender and Theron are pleasant and portray interesting characters to make up for the terrible casting of Marshall-Green, Pearce and Rapace. Lots of pros, but lots of cons—a decent film should at least have a couple more pros than it does cons, but PROMETHEUS' pros and cons are pretty equal.

"subhajit555","For Si- Fi Fans.","5 June 2012","For people who loves Si-Fi Movies- ""Please don't waste your money on this movie"".

I am not a movie guy so will be able to give you all the technical details of movie making but I'll give you some insight based on simple common sense.

1. Its not the era of ""Aliens""(Movie), people are filled with information about space exploration from Nat Geo and Discovery Channel.

2. Aliens are not stupid. As per my belief, their actions can be unexplainable or explainable but not stupid.

I will get down with some good facts about the movie now.

1. Hyper intelligent humanoid monster alien comes out of his crashed mother ship to kill a little human woman out of rage, then gets eaten by a squid, the squid apparently is a half human child. Totally Si-Fi.

2. You go in the vicinity of some unknown planet, you orbit around it, do some scanning stuff to get to know about the topography, you don't simply land somewhere pointed out by an idiot.

3. The crew members looked liked some hybrid cast from ""lord of the rings"" mixed with ""conair"". You don't do a multi-billion dollar space exploration program with people from all ethnic background pretending to be astronauts, seemed to me some jail break guys. The cast totally makes no sense. The script is good for some Si-Fi grade B movie.

4. You don't go to an unknown structure and open up your head gear simply because you can breath and scans shows every thing is normal. Is there no protocol. What about unknown pathogens and particles not in the scanner's database. When you are making a Si-Fi movie, Please try to justify at least some part of it.

5. What about quarantine ? Aren't you suppose to quarantine personnel after coming from some test site or something ?

6. Human body won't change even at 2089 or even later. You can't remove something from the uterus of a woman and staple it. There are layers in the uterus, muscle layer,adipose tissue layer and skin layer, you just can't pull out something and staple it like that, you will die of internal bleeding. I am not watching ""Crank""(Which promises to be non si-fi movie) am I ? I am watching a Si-fi Movie, then she again goes to fight, wow... Riply NXG(Ripley next generation).

7. Doesn't the inter-galaxy(or universe) navigating ship have a defense mechanism to check for impacts, come on the ship can defy gravity, it can at least avoid a collision. It is very bold to crash into an alien gravity defying ship but it is not a Si-Fi movie.

There are tons to write about how pathetic the movie is but I hope I've proved my point.","1"
"toqtaqiya2","Though somewhat of a disappointment Prometheus is still grand and ambitious science-fiction.","24 September 2012","Prometheus is something to behold. It's an ambitious science-fiction film. It's been a long time since we've seen a good Alien film. What Prometheus does, however, is something different since it's a sort of prequel to Alien (1979). One may not even call it a prequel because it's barely related to the other films in the franchise. Ridley Scott (the old Englishman who gave us classics like Blade Runner and Thelma & Louise) returned to direct and it's obvious that he made an effort. The special effects look fantastic. The cinematography by Dariusz Wolski is beautiful. Even the actors do a good job, Noomi Rapace and Michael Fassbender being the standouts. The action scenes, when they are there, are exciting. But, it's just too bad that the script by Jon Spaihts and Damon Lindelof is so poor. It's filled with unimaginative dialogue, and it raises questions to which it gives no answers. In addition, the characters aren't well developed. So, there is very little substance for an ambitious premise. Still, Scott delivers some of his best work in years. There are few things here on the level of his old films but some scenes are genuinely breathtaking. Considering this it really hurts that the script is poor because just about everything else about Prometheus is good. If the script was good as well we may have had a good, if not great, science-fiction epic. As it is Prometheus is somewhat of a disappointment. It's structured a lot like the previous Alien films though it doesn't improve on them. Another thing worth mentioning is that the designs, of the aliens and the technology, are very impressive. I should mention that for me it became obvious that the script is poor when Shaw and Holloway were talking about ancient civilizations. Clearly the screenwriters don't know about Carroll Quigley's theory of civilizations, the best work on the subject out there. Despite this, Prometheus is definitely a film worth seeing. I doubt that it will scare you but it will certainly amaze you.","6"
"Smells_Like_Cheese","Sick Curiosity","1 July 2012","Alien is one of the classic horror sci-fi films of all time. Giving so many different themes and conversations to talk about: betrayal, isolation, darkness and claustrophobia. The film was so popular that it spawned 3 sequels and a whole truck load of spoofs and tributes. But the question on everyone's mind is: Where did the alien come from? Also if the alien is like us since in the last sequel we find out that Riley's DNA is mixed with the alien's. So director Ridley Scott comes back to answer those questions with Prometheus, a prequel that was supposed to answer these questions. With some excellent visual effects and a great story, this is bring sci-fi back to a whole new level.

In 2089, archaeologist couple Elizabeth Shaw and Charlie Holloway discover a star map among several unconnected ancient cultures. They interpret this as an invitation from humanity's forerunners, the ""Engineers"". Peter Weyland, the elderly CEO of Weyland Corporation, funds the creation of the scientific vessel Prometheus to follow the map to the distant moon. The ship's crew travels while the android David monitors their voyage. Arriving in 2093, they are informed of their mission to find the Engineers. The Prometheus lands near a large artificial structure, which a team explores. Inside they find numerous stone cylinders, a monolithic statue of a humanoid head, and the corpse of a large alien, thought to be an Engineer. But what they find later on may lead to more questions that they may not want the answers too. After all, curiosity did kill the cat.

Over all, I think that Prometheus was a great film with very promising story lines. But I was disappointed that in some way were are left with more questions than answers. I wasn't so sure about the main character, Shaw(I'm assuming you've seen the movie since I do warn about spoilers in the beginning of my comment), they say that she can't get pregnant. She has sex with her boyfriend the night before, they go to the sight where these alien creatures attack them and she's pregnant. They say however that she's 3 months along and my curiosity is that since her boyfriend was infected, was it the boyfriend who impregnated her or was the attack? Feel free to send me a message if you have a better answer, please. Also I do wish some of the characters had better development like Charlize Theron's Meredith Vickers and the two men who are first attacked were just like bait to get the movie going and it was somewhat insulting as this is a more intelligent thriller.

However what stands out in this film other than the effects was Michael Fassbender as David, the android. He does a phenomenal job as the android who is not only just there to do his job, but almost curious upon why the humans act a certain way. Why are humans so curious? It's a good look on society where some answers are just not good enough. Shaw finds the oldest drawings known to man, but wants to know more. She finds a ship where we may have found the answer to how we were created. But who created our creator? It keeps going deeper and deeper and ends up really destroying the mission. Our curiosity as humans is what can really kill us. Prometheus has it's flaws, but without a doubt is one of the best movies of the year. I'm curious to see if they will continue the story as we are left with some questions still on where these aliens came from and how they survived and would breed. But I highly recommend the movie for sure and it's good to see Scott back with creating a great picture.

"davidwright2673","Cynical!","13 June 2012","When the news of an Alien prequel to be directed by Ridley Scott was announced, the cinema going public, and in particular those with a penchant for sci-fi, began anticipating the long, thought to be improbable, return to form of the franchise and the exorcism of the ever diminishing returns since Aliens over 25 years ago!

Initial reports, though sketchy, seemed hopeful until that was a Mr Lindeloff became involved. Nobody in the cinema industry is more qualified at dragging out an interesting premise than one of the writers that somehow managed to make the story of stranded plane crash survivors last for over 5 years! That is what has happened here though, reading a recent interview with him he states the original script was very prevalent with Alien references, eggs, face huggers, et al but why cut to the chase in one movie when you can cynically drag it out for 3 with hack writing, poor characterisation & schizophrenic behaviour from what should surely by the cream of the scientific community on such an important mission!

It looks beautiful & Fassbender is great so there's your 2 stars!

I'm all for thought provoking movies that credit their audience with having intelligence, and the idea of expanding the Alien universe is a good one but Prometheus fails at both. We already know the corporation is manipulative and out for it's own interests, or is that 20th Century Fox? I'm confused.......

I think I'll skip part 2 (if I gets made which I doubt) and wait for part 3 and the Alien prequel.

Oh and one final point, it appears by 2093 women have abandoned such passé items as bras and pants in favour of wrapping bandages over their breasts and genitals, I bet you didn't see that one coming ladies!","2"
"craig-hopton","Enjoyable viewing","3 August 2014","A perfectly good SciFi horror. Not to the same spine-tingling standards or as gritty as the original Alien movie, but certainly in the same vein.

The movie follows the tired SciFi cliché of a spaceship full of clashing egos, but I wasn't complaining - it's a format that is proved to work. Sadly, the large cast does mean that there's too little time given to character development but again that's only to be expected.

The heroine Elizabeth Shaw, played by Noomi Rapace, is a fairly strong character but not to Sigourney Weaver standards. She is overshadowed by Michael Fassbender as the quixotic android who rather steals the show. Charlize Theron plays a vile company rep but oddly fails to feature as much as you'd expect (I suspect this is a deliberate red herring to make you think she might end up being the sole survivor rather than Rapace). All in all, it's an interesting cast if short of any truly exceptional performances.

Initially I was disappointed that the Alien creatures didn't feature more but actually that doesn't prove to be a problem. There are various references to them that build up the franchise's mythology in a clever way, from the eggs and nesting sites to a foetus that gets implanted in Shaw's womb (probably the finest scene in the movie).

The pace throughout is good and the destructive finale is a nice echo of the original Alien, with Shaw's survivor instinct on impressive display. A good night's viewing.","7"
"Horror-yo","Strong initiation to a potentially GREAT trilogy","9 June 2012","First of all, this isn't nearly as bad as they make it in reviews. We should take a film for what it is and judge it accordingly. So forget the pompous critiques.

As a philosophy enthusiast, knowing Ridley Scott would team up with Lindelof (co-writer for Lost) along with great actors like Fassbender, Pierce and co...; that this would be a sci-fi take on existentialism through the great Alien franchise: I'd have expected a lot more dialog, interesting axioms about life, and long, profound tirades on the human condition. To address that: this is a very good event-based action movie, with underlying, hidden symbolism in stead. The soundtrack, though being a composer, I can't even recall. Typical Hollywood dramatic stuff. The actors, though the level overall is fine, again follow the typical huge production formulas. Sometimes over-the-top and unnecessary, but really just generic mostly. The exception: Fassbender is fantastic, as usual, as the cold android.

Now, about the event-based aspect of this thriller, on one hand it's very beneficial for the film. As opposed to ""Inception"" for e.g., where all the concepts are explained as if it were a DVD extra about the film; here the action takes place in a solidly crafted, and flawless quite honestly (despite the 2hrs, never gratuitous or wasteful) frame; and then it's up to us to pick up on the implied/concealed symbolism and meanings. On the other hand, with a title like ""Prometheus"" (awakening epic echoes of Greek mythology), we may all have been waiting for more literature, but we'll learn to accept this in time when the answers come in the sequels and we have more hindsight for this one.

The atmosphere: quite generic, yet fitting. They really didn't go for anything too art-oriented, even though the more conceptual side of the film (the xenomorphic features on the walls and ceiling; the virtual touchscreen when Fassbender examines the room; the goo-oozing poles) does give it a big plus. But while everybody emphasizes that it's all visual-based, it really is rather FANTASTIC CGI and the 3D glasses that do the trick as opposed to something like Avatar or such aesthetic-laden pieces. And furthermore, this film does a really good job at making the viewer feel like it's all real. There's nothing too theatrical or play-like, it's sci-fi and means to be realistic. For eg. the focal male character (the boyfriend) dies off really fast in the development of the story. We follow the main chick throughout her adventure and suffering, and nothing made her invincible during that span; she was just courageous enough to make it out alive. Even the space jockeys/engineers act very real-life like (we would imagine).

All in all, this film is a very promising start to what we hope will be one of the greatest ever sci-fi trilogies made; it raises questions about mankind as it is, through a very originally constructed host of science fiction and tale-telling. On its own, as if isolated from any following sequel, this film is great at being profoundly mysterious and asks one specific question that is possibly the most thought-provoking in all that sci-fi and philosophy can blend to produce: why do our own creators want us...dead ? Despite the genius of our species, and the value of life for such conscious, intelligent, loving beings: why are we obsolete or perhaps threatening to our own engineers ? And, of course: who is Prometheus, and how will the writers integrate that concept intelligently enough into the legendary Alien franchise ?","8"
"jeremysaxton","It takes talent to create a film this bad","9 June 2012","I'm being completely serious. My friends and I spent a half hour after the film going over everything wrong with it. And like Phantom Menace, there's a lot.

This review contains SPOILERS. The plot is about a team of scientists and others who travel to a far off planet after finding hints in ancient cultures about aliens who may come from there. And therefore, who might know the origins of human life. Yes, it is sort of a precursor to the Alien movie franchise. It's a promising idea with plenty of philosophical and sci-fi subjects to address. But I just want to talk about where it went wrong and warn you. I am giving spoilers, not about how the plot goes, just revealing things that don't make any sense.

First of all, two young good looking phD characters are the scientists. They don't act academic in any way, they don't act educated or that they have any interest in science. They look and act like young actors. There's a humanoid robot who acts evil, but it is never explained why he's being evil. There is a supposed geologist who freaks out for seemingly no reason, acts really scared of everything for no reason, but then later on meets an alien and gets really close and thinks it's really cute. Charlize Theron's character is harsh to everyone, but her character really has no role in doing anything. She's supposed to hint at a secret evil agenda of the corporation that funded the mission, but that agenda doesn't exist. Early on, it's revealed she has an area of the ship that has its own life support and escape system. Gee, I wonder when that will come in useful. She also has a machine that's supposed to be super high tech but looks like one of those little machines that grabs toys in a fairground. There's more.

The scientists find something interesting on the alien planet, like a wall of writing, and then they move right past it without questioning it or thinking about it. The aliens that are revealed don't resemble one another. Why? One guy who's killed comes back with super powers like the ability to climb walls and not get destroyed. Huh? There's more but I just can't list it all in this space.

Oh, and guess what, the special effects aren't as great as the trailer makes them seem. There don't seem to be any 3D scenes after the first few scenes. None at all. The technology really doesn't look any better than Alien, a movie made decades ago.

I had a great time laughing with my friends about all these things that don't make any sense. If you want to see a good sci fi movie, don't see this one. If you want to support good sci fi film makers and not support awful ones, then do NOT see this one. If you're seeing it for free and want a good laugh, like most people in my theater were doing during the film, then see this one.","1"
"krajo","Below average movie","9 June 2012","I'm always looking for movies that create their own world, their own mood. I had high hopes for this film to do just that. It even started out good, with epic scenes, cryptic messages. However it was all downhill from there. I'll try to write without revealing anything, maybe it will make the movie less boring for some.

About the plot: simply put, nothing made sense. Not even the major plot points. There was so much random stuff thrown in, I wonder if they realized that the main thread wasn't enough for a two hour long movie ? Maybe if they stuck to making a philosophical picture about our origins, or just went the other way and made an action movie. But no, it tried to be everything at once. Also, since there was no time to develop the characters, their actions seemed random.

Acting: decent enough, given how bad the screenplay and dialogues were. Noomi Rapace delivered the only scene that evoked some kind of emotion, namely absolute terror.

CGI: top notch, too bad the rushed scenes didn't let you enjoy it.

Music: not worth mentioning.

Overall: for me there were two good scenes, the rest was average to bad, sometimes embarrassing even for a B movie. I don't get it, with the amount of money, A list actors, it could have been a very good, epic movie. What the hell were they thinking when they wrote the screenplay? Was it actually screenwriters, or just a bunch of teenagers ? I'll give it a 3, for the visuals and the actors trying, plus Charlize Theron was in a tight spacesuit :)

bye, krajo

ps: oh, and in the last scene, where they wanted to tie into the Alien movies, and where you'd think there's no way anyone can f**k this up, I mean you just have to get the big dead alien guy in the chair, how hard that can be? Guess what, they screw it up, unbelievable.","3"
"rich7354","Did not know it was Alien prequel","19 October 2021","Going in, I did not know this was an Alien prequel. As such, I was hooked from the very beginning and I was captivated by the ""search for our creators"" theme. I was enjoying the movie quite a bit until I saw it start to turn into another Alien movie. From there, things just went down hill and ended in a quagmire of dead bodies, dead aliens, and dead script.

Giving it a 5 for the first half of the film.","5"
"rcolgan","""Sometimes to create, one must first destroy.""","16 July 2014","Why are we here? What put us here? How far will we be willing to go to find these answers? These are some of the questions that Prometheus raises. Whilst it may not always give us the answers to these questions, the journey to find them is exciting and visually stunning, blending these elements with a thrilling story.

Just like Alien before it, this film sees a crew of a spaceship discovering far off alien life. The key difference being they set out to discover it to find their creators. It is because of this goal that each of their personalities begin to play a significant role. Raspace's character is religious, hoping to find her creator to answer her questions on life. Fassenbender's android who appears to desire the knowledge of what it means to be human. Then there's Theron whose motivations remain an enigma throughout the film, but works towards the gain of a corporation. This range of personalities allows the films themes to be explored more in depth with the conflicting views giving more perspectives on the issue.

But whilst these perspectives help to raise more questions in the birth of life, at the same time offers very few answers. Much of the film is left either ambiguous or with little to no explanation. But I think I prefer it without the answers. It leaves more to the viewer to consider these meanings rather than spoon feeding the audience its own. Since there is a sequel planned, maybe some of these questions might be answered. But as a stand alone film, it's still an interesting theme detailing mankind's fascination with the journey to find the meaning of life rather than answering the question.

Saying this there are areas of the story that do let the film down. For example Fassenbenders character is probably one of the films most interesting, but we don't receive enough information about his side of the story making his arc feel more incomplete. Also juggling so many different characters makes the whole narrative feel like a mess at points. So many plot lines are dropped such as a relationship between Idris and Theron that doesn't seem to have any reason for a presence in the film. But luckily the films stronger plot lines based around themes make up for it.

The biggest selling point of this film was that it was Ridley Scott back in Sci Fi. And once again Scott shows us why he is one of the masters of the genre. He creates futuristic worlds like no other, stretching from vast landscapes of other worlds to the detailed insides of a spaceships that create a detailed image of a future lifestyle. Unlike most modern directors who use VFX too much, Scott doesn't let them take over the film. Whilst they are used we still get a lot of decent practical effects with both blending together to create both beautiful and original designs. Both the aliens and the landscape blend realistically together to create some incredible imagery that explores the films theme of life and the development of technology.

On top of the interesting themes, Prometheus constantly remains exciting through many intense scenes taking place in a range of landscapes. There are some brilliant moments of both horror and action in a mixture of environments. Some in the futuristic environments of the space ships. Others in the dark caves that they are searching in. There are even a few moments in the more open and barren landscapes between the two locations. It's this range of locations that keeps these scenes interesting by keeping the action varied ranging from the dark, claustrophobic caves where anything can be hiding in the dark to the landscapes where you can't hide and may only run.

Whilst it's not his greatest contribution to Sci Fi and has a few flaws with its narrative, Scott shows that he's still got the skill to create one of the most realistic portraits of the future put to film. He realistically simulates every detail of future life on the spaceship from methods of surgery to the androids. Prometheus is a flare of originality in a genre that has become stale and repetitive that will hopefully get a sequel some time soon.","8"
"maveric1974","Profound! Intelligent! Thought-provoking! Thank you Sir Ridley!","6 June 2012","Having only just seen this at IMAX Melbourne in 3D, my head is spinning! In a very good way :-) I wanted to put my thoughts down ASAP and I am happy to report (to a true cinephile), Prometheus doesn't disappoint. It delivers in spades and much more, BUT only if you walk in with a open mind, not expecting Alien, Aliens or a hybrid of both. Why would Sir Ridley try and do that when he made what is probably the best sci-fi/horror film of all time way back in 1979? No..it had to be this way. More profound and intelligent and forcing us to really closely follow the action on screen. The visuals are just ""died and gone to LV-223"" pretty! The scale of the scenes and the landscape is something only Sir Ridley would attempt and be able to pull of (without the CGI and aiding the storyline and action rather than taking over it). Sure there are some issues regarding character development, but I was willing to forgive, given we will never have another Ripleyesque type character.

Mark my words. This is hands down the most intelligent sci-fi film in a long, long time and after the foul taste of Aliens3 (had the right mix, just didn't cook properly) and Alien: Resurrection (DOA), this glorious spectacle, in 3D nonetheless, is a fitting and proper tie-up of all the questions you ever had from the first Alien. Prometheus won't be liked by all, it won't achieve the fame of Alien/Aliens (not straight away anyway), but over time, as you ponder it's existence, watch it a few times and realize what it set out to achieve (and indeed, achieved), you will thank Sir Ridley like I did tonight.

That their dialogue would be so juvenile. That their personalities could be so mediocre and unimpressive. But then...there was that scene in the medi-pod. And Shaw running around afterwards w/ NARY A WORD TO ANYONE ABOUT IT. /facepalm. I can only guess none of the scriptwriters were women. This incredibly expensive film was ruined by some basic plot failures and I lost my ability to follow the characters with any sense of belief. This was a trip down absurdity lane and quickly devolved into something the makers of Beavis and Butthead could've made more profound and entertaining. I was so disappointed after the trailer build-ups for this movie. This should've been a great movie, and it just goes to show millions of dollars can't fix it when the script or editing or direction is bad.","2"
"lezboyd","Amazing prequel that stays true to the mythology and still goes in its unique direction.","10 October 2012","This is a great movie that serves as the perfect prequel to the Alien series of movies. What stands out about this one is that it goes beyond just the mythology surrounding Alien and the xenomorphs, beyond just the CG effects, the jump-shots and action pieces, and asks some real interesting questions. It is rare that you see a movie that has enough references to its predecessors while still managing to be a unique story in itself.

Great work by the director, Ridley Scott, as well as the actors involved, especially Noomi Rapace. Can't wait for the sequel! P.S.: Given that the story mostly revolves around Christian theories concerning creation, as well as the fact that it takes its own direction independent of the preceding movies, I don't find it surprising that it has invoked a ""Love it or Hate it"" reaction in most people.","6"

*** mild spoilers ahead *** duck and cover not necessary ***

George Lucas showed clear without ambiguity his non-talent as a director and scriptwriter. He definitely has a sense of putting all together especially listen to the right people with the right bit of quality work: Irvin Kershner, Leigh Brackett and of course Lawrence Kasdan.

And so did Ridley Scott.

Nowadays, just a few director-films exists anymore. Mostly we call them Blockbusters in respect of one-person decision-making: Scott, Lucas, Cameron, Bay (..) have freedom of doing. And doing so, one can lose himself in arrogant narcissism, forgetting the roots of previous achieved works.

And so did Ridley Scott.

One can blame the awful, non-narrative script, but experience this magnitude of omni-nonsense; it's not possible not to point at Ridley.

There is no sense of reality nowhere, not in the acting, not in the characterization, not in the figures behavior, not in the slightest situation, not behind any stone of the rocky landscape. Speaking about ""sense of reality"": It has nothing to do with the genre. Fiction doesn't mean to have no rules.

In contrary! It's all about the rules! New worlds, new situations, new possibilities, and the viewer in the middle of the action asking himself highly interested what he would do instead of the main characters. This is so essential, that plot holes aka inconsistent storytelling will wash you out of your imagination as fast as your interest is sinking.

How to connect to the character if stupidity is the answer to incoherent logic? Lacking any vehicle transporting yourself into the imaginary world, how to connect to the plot? To the story? To your lost 15 bucks? How to explain it to your girlfriend? ""But the visuals were great, let's go to the backseats"" .. i don't think so.

You can have cool characters, you can have zeitgeist-dialogs, but you must understand ambivalence. And you must do that carefully, so everybody swallows that. Richard Dreyfuss in Jaws made a wonderful job: A cynical scientist, bullish, precocious, but also polite, social intelligent. I bought that.

I don't buy PhD's with a total mindset of a soccer player. No offense against soccer here...

I don't buy PhD's which motivation is to believe in non-confirmable stuff. Well, none of my colleges do and they do a lot nonsense. But I guess petting an alien snake on first contact would take no part in their adventures.

Especially I don't buy 3 pilots on a suicide-run emotionless and obviously lobotomized.

And no, Ridley, not only me, nobody, not even Road Runner himself would run strait forward from a gigantic donut when there is plenty of space on both sides.

I really thought we were beyond this in 2012. Well, every flick has its ""nooooo"" moment

The biggest mistake is the genre: Prometheus happens to be neither science nor fiction. It became splatter-horror. Alien & Aliens sets up a couple of questions: How to analyze and survive something completely out of this world in terms of thinking and interacting not related to anything we are used to understand. The superb visuals (H.R. Giger) transported us there. And here comes the important part: These questions were very related to everything happened in the plot and so we were told answers piece by piece, carefully forced to adapt our imagination to the current situation.

THATS the definition of enjoying fiction.

Prometheus asked where we came from and why our creators want to destroy us. The whole plot is not related to these never answered questions. Its purpose is only to show us one action scene after another without ever having a climax.

All that artists like Giger and previous story-writer did to build a world with extraterrestrial aliens who actually give us a sense of highly engrossed and unpredictable beings is wasted. It's all human. It was no accident, that Giger melted the space-jockey with his pilot chair: Our perspective of reality should be challenged: He installed a definite ""another"". Ridley obviously doesn't understand.

Now we know, our ancestors are just surrealists.

If you, dear reader, are so eager to see that movie, never forget: you subsidize future projects of that kind.","1"

"nrabond007","Franchise Resurrected","10 June 2012","In a world of poorly done prequels that miss the boat completely, ""Prometheus"" has created a different kind of prequel that delves deeper into side stories than that of the main plot of ""Alien,"" as everyone expected. Ridley Scott gladly reserves his directing helm and shows his true prowess as a master of sci-fi horror, giving us wide open vistas and worlds, while at the same time, creating a sense of shock, horror, intensity, and claustrophobia. We are introduced to Dr. Shaw, played by Noomee Rapace in the first scene of a film as she completes her discovery of a series of like symbols throughout the world in a small cave. The symbols represent a star cluster light years outside of Earth and before we know it we are whisked away to the helm of the ship ""Prometheus"" as it approaches planet LV-223, commanded and inhabited by David, played by multi-talented Michael Fassbender, fresh off his convincing role of Magneto in ""X-Men: First Class."" The David character is presented to us as sensitive and smart, picking up on every possible piece of human information he can gather, and using his android tendencies to examine the dreams of the frozen crew and gain a tactical advantage, becoming more friendly by studying and mimicking the human moves of Peter O'Toole in ""Lawrence of Arabia."" David and Dr. Shaw are the two most compelling characters in the screenplay and that is why they are described in detail. Efforts are somewhat but not completely wasted on the talents of Charlize Theron, Idris Elba, and Guy Pearce, all of which should have played more integral roles as they were absolutely riveting with the screen time they were given. ""Prometheus"" should have been titled ""Space Jockeys"" as that is what the film focused on, while giving us a slight teaser of the ""Alien"" franchise yet to come at the end of the film, introducing us to possibly the first face-hugger in existence. As a reviewer I am not here to answer questions, which I have done so already, but to alleviate any feelings of disappointment that some may have. The previews leading up to the films release really do a great job of expressing the need to know. If you are expecting the world of chest-busters, face-huggers, and acidic blood, you have come to the wrong movie, but if you have come to study more about the origins of secret races only glazed over in Ridley Scott's 1979 scream-fest you are in for pure elation. As a hardened ""Alien"" fan-boy, minus the last two entries in the series and the abomination that was the ""Alien vs. Predator"" series I left the film not the least bit disappointed in the film that was presented. Instead of answers you will get questions, and these questions will be answered in the sequels that stem from the masterpiece that is ""Prometheus."" Watch, enjoy, and question!!!","9"
"DHWaldron","Philosophical and Unique","12 August 2017","Despite angered viewers and reviewers, ""Prometheus"" is unique to the ""Alien"" franchise, being the first movie to not actually show a Xenomorph until the final moments. Despite all of the negative feedback the film has received, it is easily one of the top movies of the franchise. ""Prometheus"", unlike the other films, is not about the survival against the alien, but about survival against age and time, as a weary old man withers, and searches for the creation of humans to plead with them to extend his life, or better still, gift him immortality.

The prequel to ""Alien"" is filled with nods which will excite fans, but still seem relevant to the new viewer. The acting is good, but, as usual, the visual effects and make-up overshadow them all, with particularly exceptional make-up for ""The Engineer"" (a late antagonist), contrasted with a detailed set. The only issue with the film were some continuity errors (which may possibly be explained in later sequels). Unfortunately though, the dissatisfied fans and lack of horror elements means that this film won't be remembered for its underlying intricate philosophical teachings and story line.",NA
"benxrichardson","A beautifully executed film","7 February 2022","Prometheus has a stunning visual design which was a pleasure to watch. The problem was the plot. It was generic and nothing particularly special happened.

"roland-hesz","Quite disappointing","5 December 2012","It starts off nicely with a promise of a good film, then it falls flat. Inconsistent, unbelievable, and generally disappointing.

Good material, awful execution - the actors were not bad, Fassbender was really good, but the characters were completely illogical at times, some actions clearly contradicting the whole character, done only to further the plot.

An experienced and ready to die captain leaving his post to shag a blond, while two of his crew is stuck in an unknown structure?

"superh13","Sci-Fi?","13 August 2012","Where's the Science in this ""Science Fiction""? Prometheus is one of the worst sci-fi flicks ever, if not THE worst ever. Even top notch CGI, though impressive, can't save this ""Olympus Mons"" of plot holes, bad dialog and inconsistent plus unnecessary characters.

I won't get into all of the plot holes, it has been pointed out in various comments already.

This whole creationism crap, creating live on earth et AL. Please keep in mind that live on earth formed in the Archaeozoic, long before there was breathable air, continents and waterfalls, on which one of the aliens destroys(!!!) his DNA....OMG. You could hold against that, that he only creates human live, but then again, where's Aquaman? ;)

At a certain point, namely right after they entered the alien complex, it became just vicarious embarrassment: Seriously, who takes a geologist on a mission to an alien planet who turns nuts on the first sign of (dead!!) alien lifeforms? And the biologist, who seems to feel the same way, but is delighted by the discovery of a large penis-shaped alien snake and wants to hug it! Yes, seriously, it's a penis shaped alien, and he wants to cuddle with it, I've seen it in 3D!

I wonder how this disaster could have happened? Is it dementia on Ridley Scotts side, or was he just forced by studio executives to let Lindeloff ruin the script?

Unless there will be a refund policy at the box office for shitty story lines in the future, you won't see a dime out of my pocket any more, Hollywood. Ah well...at least Charlize got some good plastic surgery buck out of it to keep her fresh for the next 10 years.","1"
"jayzdude","Can't believe I shelled out $9 for this...","18 June 2012","I definitively do not recommend paying full theater price for this movie because it is awful especially for a scifi film. All it is, is crappy special effects for a summer film as are most films during summer... There are a bunch of plot holes, the characters are soooooo stupid, the technology is unrealistic in some situations and too modern in others. There is no real story and most of the actions performed by the characters makes no sense. The film is a waste of 2 hrs of ones life spend the money and time on something better. I went to watch it because the previews made it seem like a new scifi epic film but sadly it is not, just another shitty summer blockbuster with some Alien stuff in it (the series).","1"
"cesar-onlinebiz","I wish I could give this more stars","26 September 2013","It is a beautiful movie with epic images. The first few minutes is a great visual fest with an event that makes you feel the movie will be great.

Then the movie doesn't pay off. A largely unlikeable cast of characters is assembled and as soon as they arrive at their destination they start acting like complete idiots. The audience can see the only (possible) plot twist half an hour before it happens.

The David robot is the only interesting character, Idris Elba and Charlize Theron's talent is largely wasted here with the exception of a few moments where they shine.

It seems Ridley Scot became a shadow of its former self. I guess this movie is worth watching if you like Science Fiction and the Alien series but don't expect much from it.","4"
"cowboykalira","Needlessly complicated mess","15 June 2012","I went to see Prometheus today, although even before I saw it, I knew this film was going to disappoint me.

In that respect, I guess I should only blame myself for the loss of two hours in which I could have had more fun, for less money.

Where to start? Well let's start with the original Alien. That movie has made a big impression on almost any Sci-Fi fan I know, and I have been wondering a lot why that is. Watching Prometheus today has answered that question conclusively.

Alien was great because it wasn't complicated. It had a small crew on a spaceship, fighting an alien. One by one the members of the crew get killed, and in the end kick-ass Ripley manages to kill the alien. Simple, self-contained, and claustrophobic. Add to that great acting performances by a cast made up of brilliant actors, and you have the perfect classic.

Now we come to Prometheus. For some reason they decided to take the alien story, and try to turn it into the answer to life, the universe, and everything. Since we already know that that answer is 42, the exercise seems pointless, but okay, I'll try to be nice.

The thing is though, instead of answering any questions scientifically, we get this vague cross-over between Erich von Däniken's paleo-SETI theory and questions about God as our creator. I'm pretty sure the whole Von Däniken thing has been done, and I'm even more sure that a lot of Sci-Fi fans are not exactly into creationism. So why these two premisses are thrown into this movie is beyond me. As the reviews on this site show, if anything, those ideas offended a lot of the audience this type of movie is aimed at. To add insult to injury, the story leaves a lot of the questions it hints at completely unanswered, leaving viewers who do get into the human origin story frustrated.

Moving on, the acting is a mixed bag. Fassbender is great as the android, and Rapace and Theron are quite good as well. Given a better script they could have made this movie great. Unfortunately they're not given a lot to work with in terms of believable dialogue. The rest of the cast play as if they're extras in an episode of Torchwood, and ruin a lot of the scenes they're in. The performance of Logan Marshall-Green was absolutely terrible as Rapaces boyfriend. They're supposed to be scientists. He acts the part as if he is a male underwear model.

The effects are of course top-notch, and the 3d isn't as annoying as it could have been. The styling is esthetically pleasing, and reminiscent enough of the old Alien movie to convince me that in that department, a lot of people cared for the superior original. Why the script writers, and Ridley Scott himself didn't show the same integrity to the original masterpiece is a mystery, they could have made a movie with a lot of suspense and tension. But, as so many remakes, sequels, and prequels do, they went for the false premiss that if bigger is better, much bigger is much better.

I didn't expect a movie as good as Alien, or Aliens. But Prometheus, for all the pompous posturing it does, is nothing but an empty shell, devoid of any lasting impact.","4"
"pij_ruleroftheworld","Oh dear, oh dear","15 June 2012","*WARNING, MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS* What a disappointment. Like many people, I didn't go to the cinema expecting anything nearly as good as Alien and after watching the film, it was a good job I didn't as it meant I wasn't as let down as I could have been.

The plot is weak and gives us many questions which we don't get the answers to. I just couldn't buy into what was going on because it was all to muddled. This film is far too indulgent for my liking, focusing more on the effects than the script. Ridley Scott has used this as a vehicle for showcasing what he can do with a computer and thus has made the film a shambles.

The acting isn't great but they have been let down by a poor script and bad casting. Why is Swedish actress Noomi Rapace playing an English scientist when there are countless talented English actresses out there who could have done a better job at playing the part and also can actually speak with an English accent? I like Rapace as an actress but she has been seriously let down in this film. Similarly, why is the brilliant Rafe Spall playing an American? There were characters who were British so why not give him one of those parts and give Spall's role to an American actor? It's all very makeshift.

I feel like I should go on but I have been rendered speechless by the atrocity that Scott has produced. I have only given two stars because Michael Fassbender's performance is magnificent and I like Rafe Spall.","2"
"arto-alamaunu","Boring","22 March 2013","I remember Ridley Scott directing some great sci-fi movies in the past. Well... this starts as a decent sci-fi, but as soon they land to the planet it turns to a some family drama and pointless walking in the dark. Nothing really happens, just horrified shouts, all the action is boring. So predictable twists on the plot that made me yawn, when I was supposed to be excited and terrified... I think Ridley Scott should retire from sci-fi and make some good old time movies with a good story. This movie is just waste of money and time. I'd rather see Stalker and 2001-A Space Odyssey once again... This is like a James Bond movie going bad; You only watch it once.","1"
"shebacat","lots of special effects, very boring story","10 June 2012","If you are looking for a movie with lots of great scenery and lots of special effects then this might be the movie for you. It was beautifully set and the special effects were great.

But... if you are looking for a good story that actually makes any sense whatsoever, this is NOT the movie for you. The story is dull, the characters are lifeless, it didn't make any sense - it was very confusing and the ending is hopeless.

It may be a movie better left to the $1 theater where at least you can see the special effects, but you won't be wasting your money. Better yet, just see a better movie.","2"
"conductivephantom","Would make any Xenomorph proud","9 June 2012","Before I get into the review itself, let me just say this is probably one of the most brilliant movies I have ever seen. Not only did all of the trailers and advertisements make the movie look good, the movie itself exceeded beyond them. I have read tons of reviews that people have been writing for this movie, and to just sum up my opinion of all of them, I will say just give it up, its Science Fiction. Ridley Scott created a movie that matches the unique and stunning style of his original Alien movie, while not relying on that to make a new movie which is set in the same universe, but is great on its own without needing to much connection to Alien. All lot of the complaints people have had over this movie don't actually have any ground to stand on. Its almost like most of them did not even really watch the movie. One of the complaints I have read was that the characters are very stupid. Yeah, right. Other than a few who were MEANT to be dumb, I don't see how anyone could honestly be called stupid. I don't think having the quick thinking of finding a way to preform your own operation in minutes is something that I call dumb. I have also seen complaints about this movie being to much in Scotts point of view. Well yeah, of course it is, what did you except him to do, considering this is his movie, and he has said he has tried to support the fans needs as much as possible. Was there any complaints about the original Alien movie being in his vision? Probably not, but with people expecting something similar to that, they will surely get disappointed for as much as this movie relates to Alien, it is a movie of its own. People have also been complaining about the crew as being bad scientists. Well, what do you expect, there only human. People get careless, make mistakes, and if anything this bring the characters to life and shows what kind of people they really are. The whole reason the team was sent to this planet was to find life and hopefully their creators. People have complained that just some random billionaire decided to go and look for this planet, and with that, good for him. People now a days disappoint me, because does not the idea of exploring the Universe itself make the journey worth it, let alone looking for an alien race. If I have a trillion dollars I too would fund for space exploration, just for the sake of exploring and adventure. People also have stated that finding the ancient temple itself seemed unbelievably lucky. Well then so be it. There's always a small chance that such things can happen, and what would a sci fi movie be without such extreme circumstances. Basically, most of the movie actually works well as long as instead of finding ways it doesn't work, you think of it as an actual sci fi movie and find reasons why it could. The effects in this movie were amazing. Some have said that the aliens look like plastic, well just go watch Avatar, there you can find plastic looking Aliens, but here, while yes they were slimy, they were brilliant. The soundtrack is also brilliant and puts this movie into a unique place of its own. The actors were all well picked and did a wonderful job, and I especially appreciate that none of them seemed too recognizable as characters from other movies. All in all, this will be up there in my top movies ever, and I greatly appreciate Scotts efforts in trying to bring back the Alien universe and create a whole new story without ruining and focusing on the original Alien one.

( BTW, people have also stated that the movie looks dark because of its dark setting plus wearing the 3D glasses, well the brightness is actually correct, because Scott purposely brightened the movie for the 3D version to match that of the 2D one, so if you are complaining about the 3D version being dark, you'll have it no better in the 2D version[ not that I found the brightness at all bad])","10"
"ballistic-eva01","Doesn't worth seeing it in the cinema","3 July 2012","Why didn't i listen to the reviews of some users here??

I deeply regret going to the theater to watch this... this... thing!

3D's and photography are amazing. The rest... utter useless nonsense! The argument and plot doesn't live up to Ridley Scott's name, one of the reasons why i was stubborn to go see it.

The first half of the movie is boring, and what Alien and Aliens were tremendous (psicological terror), this ""Prometheus"" crap doesn't come even close! Even the characters lack personality.

A lot of things are very badly made up. The stupid thing of a lot of ancient cultures having paintings in walls and whatever of signals from outer space in their cultures is such a cliché! Just like Alien vs Predator! It doesn't sell as an movie argument anymore! ""Look, all this signals are GOD from outer space! Oh my, lets go to LVwhatever, in some stupid place in space to explain our existence! We were made by aliens!"". That's just stupid! Looks like ""Mission to Mars"" of 2000. Other thing that just doesn't make sense: In the Aliens movie, the Alien ship in LVwhatever had a alien pilot dead with its chest blown up. By the way this ""prometheus"" crap ends, it doesn't make any sense. Re-inventing plots is just cheap and lacks creativity.

This movie is a good pop-corn movie to see it at home out of curiosity, but NOT to spend money and see it at the cinema. That's my advice.

"drizzetd","Just another summer movie","17 June 2012","I just saw this movie yesterday after great anticipation from all the trailers i saw, i even saw the first movie again because it was the best in the series (maybe 4 was to haven't decided yet). First i must say that if you go, go to the 3D it's a must, the effect's are brilliant (and i haven't said it in a long time about a 3D movie although the AVENGERS came close). you can see the ashes fly in your face when they first land, and everything just engulfs you when you get into the movie, the sound is amazing all around just amazing effects. Having said that, The real problem begins with the plot, if i hadn't known the film is directly connected to to the alien series i wouldn't have been so disappointed, but Ridley Scott really disappoints in a big way. seeing the movie i felt like this was the ""Clash of the Titans"" version of the Alien saga, just bad all around. The connection to the saga is well pointed out but the plot is a joke there is a mini plot intertwined that is even worse,i fail to even see the connection of the origin of humanity here, and so those scoot fail to show it.if the point of the movie was that there is no point to everything, so really whats the point to go see this movie at all. The cast includes: Charlize Theron (oh mama), Michael Fassbender & Guy Pearce all great actors and all just waisting away in this movie. Noomi Rapace plays here character really well and that really adds to the dark atmosphere and the conflicts between the characters, but there was no real need for so many frames of her tummy, she looks very ripped, but come on. In conclusion without the amazing 3D and effects there is no real reason to see the movie at all, i am very disappointed with the great Ridley Scott who brought us: Gladiator, Thelma & Louise, Blade Runner and of course Alien.","6"
"mfnmbvp","'Prometheus' (2012)","14 September 2012","I will stand behind Ridley Scott's 'Prometheus' regardless of whether the film contains ""flaws"" or not. Most of the negative comments being generated are basically about the same exact things and are basically just overly harsh criticisms. Sure, why would Logan Marshall-Green's character decide to remove his helmet in an alien atmosphere? I don't know, why do people decide to drive cars when they're drunk? Why do people yell at computers? All good questions. I'm not ever going to be overly harsh against a film unless it truly deserves it, 'Prometheus' however is grand, well-done filmmaking of the highest order. The effects are brilliant, but what is truly remarkable are the philosophical questions the film raises...and then fails to be able to provide an answer. Why would it? It's all hypothetical in the first place.

Noomi Rapace and Michael Fassbender are impressive to say the least, but I think everyone is more or less well-suited for their roles. I must say that I was disappointed that Guy Pearce didn't have a bigger and better part to play, but I'm not going to cry and b**ch about it. What I think I loved about 'Prometheus' was the adventure and the mystery, which is really all that we should be caring about when we go to the movies in the first place. Expertly crafted horror sequences, with a very nice pace to the film the entire time. Sure, the ending might have disappointed many, but I thought it fit well with the rest of the film. Either way, to me, 'Prometheus' is a thoroughly well-made feature that demands multiple viewings. Thumbs down to all you haters. =P

"brian-rothstein","Somebody needs to send out a warning beacon for this movie","10 June 2012","I loved the first Alien movie so when I saw that Ridley Scott was doing another one, possibly a prequel, I patiently waited for it to come out while trying as hard as I could to avoid any reviews, previews, or spoilers. I just assumed the movie, while probably not being as good as Alien, would still be something definitely worth watching. Why else would Ridley Scott bother to return to the franchise?

I'll start out with the good parts. The visuals are nice. I also enjoyed Michael Fassbender's, Noomi Rapace's, and Idris Elba's performances.

Now for the bad. The movie basically doesn't make any sense. It's hard to understand a lot of the characters' actions. The science seems fishy. The ending doesn't clarify much. I wish I had noticed that Damon Lindelof had a writing credit on the movie before I went, because he pulled this same type of thing on Lost. It's easy to write mysteries. The challenge is writing solutions to those mysteries.

I wanted very much to like this movie - so much so, that even though I had my doubts as I was watching it, I still thought it was not too bad right after it ended. It was only after thinking about the movie for the next day or so that I realized how many plot holes it had. The more I thought about it, the angrier I got. I was angry at the lost potential and angry at myself for letting my guard down and blindly trusting that a modern Hollywood blockbuster could live up to the past.

Anyway, if you're reading this, please know that this is a warning beacon that I'm trying to leave you. Under no circumstances should you watch Prometheus with any sort of high expectations. If you must watch it, then try to watch it without thinking too much. And try to forget about it as soon as the credits role.","2"

A group of drunk college students would have more chance to succeed in this mission than the crew of the Prometheus. This is why the movie script feels so fake to me. I just couldn't empathize with any of the characters. They all seem oddly familiar with the technology of their suits, the ship, the communication devices, everything; as if they have been using it all for a lifetime but then again they are screwing things up all the time. Isn't people supposed to go trough a grueling training before being sent on a potential suicide mission? And how do they end up in that mission anyway? When they are receiving the mission briefing nobody knows why are they there except for the couple of anthropologists or whatever they are. Did their employers just told them: ""hey, here's a bunch of money, just get on that ship, sleep for 2 years and once you arrive to that alien planet we don't know sh*t about, you'll receive more instructions"". And then they proceed to land and take advantage of every opportunity they can get their hands on to die a screaming, painfully and horrible death. The whole script/ movie seems built around the showing off of the visual elements, which are stunning by the way, but fall short of making this movie enjoyable.

Why tell an origin story if you are going to make it line up only on certain points but not all? The Alien from the original film holds no bearing whatsoever on the plot and its' execution. So why include it???? Money? I can't think of any other reason. Back to the top. The casting is awful. Rapace, while looking strangely similar to Sigourney, has nothing to work with I'll admit (horrible script), but she didn't help by turning in a very average performance. I didn't care about her character at all. The script is rife with clichés and where is the hard science??? Nothing brought up in the 1st half of the film is resolved by the end either. What we get is a muddled mess of a film that has no real substance. I laughed when I saw the worst film mistake of all time repeated again and again by hundreds of film-makers-you know, where some giant thing is falling on the actors and all they have to do is run right or left to avoid death but they keep running straight along the objects' path? Grrrrrrrr...this is elementary stuff. Horrible film mistake #2-Characters committing suicide without a thought and with a smile on their face. I just don't get this movie cliché'. (See Michelle Rodriguez' death in Avatar). Despite mind-blowing set pieces and an epic turn by Fassbender, this film disappoints beyond belief. I couldn't care less if they made a sequel. Oh yes, and there is zero character development. Rapace is the only one who gets 5 minutes of a past to add weight to her character. And look, I don't want to hear that ""an artist doesn't have to spoon-feed the audience"" crap. You can only get away with that type of story telling if the characters have meat. I say again where is the hard science??? You want to claim you made a sophisticated film but you keep it dumbed down??? I'm so confused. And don't you dare compare this to Blade Runner. The characters in that film are fully developed, and there is a clear direction to the plot. Not so here. Epic, epic fail.","5"
"Meven_Stoffat","Alien prequel, you don't say?","10 June 2012","Wow, it's like it's 1999 again and I'm back at the cinema, watching The Phantom Menace, hating it when I should be loving it... After all I do love the subject material.

Yet I couldn't love it. No matter how much I loved Alien it just downright sucked! I'll admit the first 10 minutes were good but then it solely went downhill. Fassbender was so bloody fantastic, even creepy as David. Oh and it looked pretty too. It was shot on the RED EPIC and the special effects are pretty looking. But the script is so full of holes that would put a block of Swiss cheese to shame. Including, but not limited to:

-So they find a painting in the Scottish mountains that tells of a planet that may have held humanity's beginnings... But how did the cave dwellers know of the planet had they not evolved in that time?

-How Were they able to breathe inside cave without their helmets?

-On that note why was the planet so earth like, with breathable air and earth like terrain?

it's never fully explained what the alien species of white, gay looking Palpatines on the planet are. I get that there will be a sequel but lazy world-building.


-Speaking if which, the idea of humans evolving from an alien species was a cool idea but never explored further.

-How did they land 1) so closely to the temple and 2) so smoothly to the planet?

-the black goo- it seemed to do so many things; from contaminating one guy with viruses, to create wormy aliens, etc. What did it really do? Pick a story and stick to it.

-If they knew that reviving the head could be dangerous why did they do it in the first place? And why did it explode?

-How does Shaw walk after the surgery? If the abdominal muscle is cut you can't walk. It has to be sewn together and let to cure, but no, a few staples and she's fine.

-If Weyland was that old don't you think Hypersleep would have killed him?

-So Shaw had the baby and suddenly forgets it?

-how did everyone know that Holloway would become an alien-zombie thing?

-Why did the scientist try to touch the cobra alien THREE TIMES?!

-If David is an android why did he infect Holloway's drink to get to Shaw?!

-How could David feel love?!

-If the boss was paid for the expedition, why did he fake his death and hide on the ship?!

-The obligatory ""Empire Strikes Back"" moment with the ""father"" line. People actually LAUGHED OUT LOUD at that scene.

And of course, they had to include the obligatory religious subplot, who created us, etc.

"pkeim","Woah....","17 June 2012","SPOIELERS. REALLY. I MEAN IT!

First off this is my first review ever. About anything.

Most things got stated previously but some details I wanted to add my personal thoughts about.

This movie is NOT ""hard"" Sci-Fi, hard Sci-Fi meaning intelligent well researched, believable and with our today understanding of the universe thinkable/possible technology/events/etc.

I'll have to add that I didn't even know that ""Prometheus"" plays even in same universe as ""Alien"", however I quickly recognised the architecture of the human spaceship. But just for the record I didn't got into the movie thinking about ""Prometheus"" as some sort of prequel to ""Alien"".

The beginning was good, at first I thought he was poisoned, I saw it that he brought live to earth.

Later on they talked how totally independent cultures created the same motive... the listing of these cultures got me to raise an eyebrow though, cause the Mesopotamian and Sumerian were essentially the same and not so far away from the Egyptian.

But....well... it is only a movie.

Many stated about how they could depict the same motive and that the engineers must have visited earth more often. However I think that it is an epi-genetic remnant of him (the engineer from the beginning), i.e. an memory inherited through the genetic code, a mechanism known today.

This also could explain why they ""invited"" us to an ""bio/nanotech weapons lab"" either he somehow consciously wrote it into his code or it got there by accident.

What I found really odd is that the whole team meets on destination for the first time.... the most important and expensive exploration mission and they didn't even train for it? At least an multi-trillion ear would train them for some 0815 planetary exploration...

Also ""But it is what I choose to believe"" The first time I laughed, then I cried... I mean come on. If I would go to anyone to get funding for some high-risk extreme-cost mission and the only ""fact"" I could come up with is ""But...but but that is what I choose to believe"" I could have tears in my eyes to fill oceans with but nobody would give me a funding.... not even the pope or Scientology.

Disregards of safety/protocols etc. etc. They just rush down, say ""We've to hurry we only got some hours of daylight left"" I don't know what the rotation period of that planet is, but let's assume that it has normally more time till dusk. Either the night is very long or they could wait and prepare for the mission. Some wrote that privately organised explorations have lesser regulations, but 1. This is an high risk and 2. Extreme cost operation... something you don't want to screw up, especially if the boss is hiding in the cargo hold.... for whatever reason.

One scientist then screws around why another one would want to bring a weapon for the exploration of an alien planet ""WTF"" and he just goes ""Okay.... well... then I'll leave it here"".

They just get their helmets off cause ""We've got oxygen"" yeah okay and all the other nasty stuff that could swirl around there? Scanners can only detect what is known to them, what they got programmed to detect.

Literally thousands of other more or less little things that nearly got my eyebrows to fly away...

The black goo: I still think that it is some sort of nanotechnology evolution accelerator, in regard that it did something different to the engineer in the beginning: It could get programmed to do vastly different stuff, from forming everything into pottery to create ""better"" lifeforms.

The characters are plainly stupid. They behave like chipmunks on an acid trip with too much amphetamine in their food. More often than not completely random stupid stuff, which even contradicts their profession. Normally an biologist going out to explore another planet would get an cardiac arrest from finding an alien (even an dead one) and not run off screaming in panic. Same goes for the geologist. Why did they even sign up to go to another planet if they don't to be there??

The android, which got played really good, just runs around knowing exactly what buttons to push, which he does frequently and nobody cares about ... just remarking sometimes ""Whatcha doing David?"" ""Pushing buttons"".

CARBONDATING AN ALIEN on an alien planet dammit. I nearly puked all over my seat from that. I REALLY had to constrain myself not to scream out how stupid that is...

They got an exact match of our genome and theirs... yet we developed on this planet which should have changed our genetic makeup, engineered or not. Plus they look different then us and have green blood (head explosion scene).

And the list goes on and on and on over the next ~ hour.

I seriously can't understand people giving this more than maybe five points. Yes some say that this movie is just too deep for many to understand but I doubt that these people understand how stupid and shallow this movie is.",NA
"WildBullWriter","Terribly disappointing","11 October 2012","How does this movie fail? Let me count the ways.

But I lose count.

But let me focus on the biggest problem of all: the story makes no sense. I suppose many people walk out of the movie assuming it was so profound that they simply lacked the intelligence to understand the story or its presumed profundity. They are wrong. It is not a profound movie, and the story itself is a mish-mash that defies description.

Check it out on DVD if you must see it because, after all, what's his name directed it. And now that I think about it, just how did a director who could make ""Bladerunner"" make a movie as bad as this one? Has he simply lost it? Maybe.","3"
"karry_gardner","Very Poor Effort","15 May 2013","Expected a lot better from such a renowned director and following all the hype about the movie. I am very pleased I did not waste money going to the cinema . The plot was poor and predictable, the acting very wooden and some of the scenes involving a young woman leaping around having just undergone abdominal surgery, downright silly and humanly impossible. I did expect something a lot better than this. I have struggled with the 10 lines of things to say about this and also because the system did not want me to submit anything profane or spiteful - not being spiteful but this was slow and unwatchable in parts and I found myself contemplating the pile of ironing in the kitchen that needs doing . it was boring. Cannot imagine why this was Oscar nominated - can understand why it didn't get any awards . I would not recommend .","1"
"Fierze","A polished turd","3 December 2013","My opinions on Prometheus have surely been expressed a hundred times before in these reviews, but the movie is so frustrating that I too have to voice my disappointment in order to move on.

Like many others I loved the idea of original Alien director Ridley Scott returning to the franchise to make a prequel, and it could have been awesome in many ways! Unfortunately, while the first 30 minutes of the movie are pretty decent and epic, the storyline begins to fall apart after that and it continues to deteriorate at an accelerating pace throughout the rest of the movie.

We are exposed to a storyline containing so many flaws, unexplained actions, irrational character behavior and leaps of logic that it looks more like an early draft than a finished product. I am not going to mention every bad detail here because others have already done it. Let's just conclude that Prometheus is an incoherent mess of plot holes, illogical twists and seemingly random ideas aimlessly thrown into the movie.

It looks to me like the cast try their best given the substandard script, and that the writers seem to be the ones to blame. What were they thinking? Are they 12 years old? Were they high? They should have cut out half of the ideas they threw into the mix and instead put their focus on making the story coherent and believable! Hell, all they had to do was to look at EITHER of the first two Alien-movies (1979 and 1986) to see brilliant examples of believable and exciting sci-fi story lines.

I guess director Ridley Scott should also be ashamed for not recognizing that the script/plot was not nearly finished at the time of shooting the film. According to rumors, Scott also decided to scrap a few scenes that were pretty vital to the story, probably making the movie even less coherent and even more frustrating to watch.

The reason for giving Prometheus as much as 3/10 is the beautiful cinematography, scenery and CGI. The movie looks good! Too bad that looks alone can not save this film - You can try to polish a turd all you want, but a glossy surface can't hide its shitty content.","3"
"Likes_Ninjas90","It is a product of our times and not in a complimentary way","3 June 2012","Prometheus is a prequel to Ridley Scott's Alien (1979), opening with a creature disintegrating itself into the Earth. Forwarding to the year 2089 and archaeologists Elizabeth Shaw (Noomi Rapace) and Charlie (Logan Marshall-Green) discover that a map has been left by the alien as a signal to another planet. A few years later and both archaeologists are onboard the spaceship Prometheus. The ship is sponsored by the rarely seen Weyland (Guy Pearce) but is captained by Janek (Idris Elba) and manned by the tough talking Meredith (Charlize Theron). There is also an android on the ship named David (Michael Fassbender), who is occasionally taunted for not being human. Interest arises when the group lands on a moon and discovers that there is a direct correlation between human and alien DNA. Problematically however, some of the crew become separated from Shaw and the rest of the group, forcing the others to retreat from the safety of the ship to find them.

Prometheus is bigger, louder and flashier than Alien ever was, but not as effective. Where director Ridley Scott once relied on pure minimalism, including the use of silence, deep shadows and selective glimpses of the alien creatures, he deters instantly from the 'less is more' approach from the very opening of this disappointing prequel. The immediate vision of an alien badly in need of a suntan, with a UFO hovering above him, is the result of the impatience of both contemporary films and modern audiences. After all, Prometheus was delayed to make way for the likes of Alien vs. Predator (2004). Interestingly, that Razzie Award-nominated feature became the highest grossing film between both franchises worldwide. What has followed is a lack of restraint in Scott's film, particularly in the visual design, which compromises his unique stylistic imprint. The clear, white, sterile tones of the ship's interiors, along with the tight fitting grey uniform of Meredith, hint at a fascist regime. But the emphasis on digital technology upsets the mood and the isolation. The ship is comprised of see-through computer screens and sophisticated touchpads, while in the caves the crew can use flashing red scanners to search through darkened areas. If this is a prequel to the retro, low-tech Alien, how is it that they have access to such advanced gadgetry? The illogical choices in design also flow through to the narrative, which is unresolved and emotionally hollow. Potentially fascinating ideas surrounding destruction as a form of creation and facing our creators are squandered by deliberate obtuseness. Rather cynically, the film's main questions, specifically the relationship between humans and aliens, seem purposely unanswered if only so audiences will have to tune in for the next episode.

Furthermore, the characters in this film are noisier and more talkative than in Alien but still have little to say. The film is painfully short on characterisation and the cast is underused. Rapace is perhaps the strongest because she's intense and visceral but she is not much of a conversationalist. Idris Elba, Guy Pearce and a barely seen Patrick Wilson, are all fine actors but they aren't well served by the script because they're largely excluded from the action and substantial details about their characters are scarce. The plot struggles around the midpoint because the motives and the goals of many of these characters feel sketchy. Similarly, there are few actresses better at playing ice-cold than Charlize Theron but she's unusually heavy-handed and the part feels underwritten because it limits her range of emotions. The most elusive member is Fassbender's David, who seems to recognise when he is being taunted, which adds some much-needed tension, but his bizarre actions make it difficult to tell whose side he is on. These characters are also drawn into dumb plot points, courtesy of even dumber actions by the expendable side characters. There are moments where you'd like to scream 'don't split up' and 'don't touch that alien' but these events unfold with predictable outcomes, thanks to an intrusive music score that cues us in on when to be frightened. The thrills are meant to be amplified but everything is performed with little self-awareness for the genre. There's a laughable scene where a character undergoes the world's fastest caesarean and after the alien came out all I wanted to hear was Agent K say: ""It's a...squid."" The aliens, including but not limited to an enormous tentacle beast, might be more visible and more violent but that doesn't mean the film is more exciting or enjoyable because of it. After the screening, I wondered why Scott had taken so long to make the film. On top of a proposed Monopoly movie, based on the board game, and the recently announced sequel to Blade Runner (1982), I questioned whether Scott was officially short on new ideas. Watching Prometheus, that answer seems simple. In terms of design and direction, it is a product of our times and not in a complimentary way.

NOTE: I watched the film in 3D but aside from Hugo (2011) I am now convinced that there are few films being released that can justify the additional costs, including this one. If you must see it, watch it in 2D. Or better still, rent Alien again.","5"

"Junreviews","A sloppy Sci-Fi movie with stunning visual effects","28 December 2012","Who is truly responsible for human life on earth? Did our ancestors leave hidden messages that last over millennium for us somewhere in the universe? Prometheus, directed by Ridley Scott who is famous for ""Alien"", one of the most successful Sci-Fi movies that make him who he is now is a type of movie that has great potential to solve all those prolonged and mysterious questions we have been asking ourselves. However, as many of you already know this movie fails logically by ignoring basic science while there are some people who actually enjoy this movie regardless of a number of flaws. I am really surprised to see the gross of this movie compared to a lot of negative reviews. Like every other movie, the score does not matter but your eyes. Depends on how you view the movie, it can be good or bad. Anyway, I write down my thoughts that include biased opinions. Here are things that rarely make sense or should be revised more thoroughly.

*Mass spoilers*

1. The archaeological evidences such as murals found in a deep cave on Earth become vaguely irrelevant to their purpose of space travel. In a word, they are nothing but fillers to make the movie look like Sci- Fi as they don't try to adopt any of them during their investigation.

2. The part where they say human being was created by engineers who live in the remote areas of the universe without mentioning any detailed proofs or religions perplexed me. I know it can be controversial if preaching gets involved, but I think it is way better than having them say ""That is what We are going to find out.""

3. One of the main characters, David who gets introduced as a soulless robot with high IQ reveals sympathy and secret affection to a female protagonist, Elizabeth who loses her partner, Peter because of David's envy. Do they know what ""Soulless"" means? I don't think so.

4. Two geologists, Fifield and Millburn get lost despite having the most advanced tracking device that detects by bleeping and flashing in a wide range area from the entrance to the exit with the support of crews monitoring them in the vessel. They could have thought of the other way of getting lost like having their tracking device turned off by some unknown external interference.

5. When Elizabeth tries to return to the vessel with a mysterious head carrying in the regular zipper bag and mighty storm almost blew her away out of the sight part was one of the most shady scenes. I mean it takes place in 2094..could they have come up with more advanced way to keep such a precious thing? Like quickly sending it to the vessel through an electronic transferring system without having to actually carrying it with you like we do nowadays? Or at least she could have hooked the bag to her belt or something. Is it impossible to do that while being able to build the imposing spaceship equipped with highly advanced technology systems?

6. The fact that trillion-dollar project paid by government in search of the origin of human life consists of the most well-built spaceship on Earth that carries less than hundred crews and a very few infantries..actually zero infantry with no powerful robots or machines except flame and razor guns exploring the place where no human have been looked so sloppy and unprepared. Again, it is 2094 for heave sake and all they brought in the spaceship that is big enough to overshadow a village were fancy Cafeteria, gyms, surgical and navigation room? And as there were hardly any battle scenes, I think putting some fighting scenes that involve robots confronting 7-foot-tall aliens would have at least left us some strong impressions. The entire sequence was just one-sided to overpowered Aliens.

7. Last but not least, Elizabeth being gestating by her infected partner, Peter which leads to giving a birth of baby Alien was quite clueless thing to solve. Because Peter becomes extremely pale and cruel-looking while getting his eye color changed into red, and somehow ends up generating a totally different-looking and long-headed creature that looks almost identical to the one that we are familiar with. What is the true relationship between them? Left us puzzled.

Aside from all the aforementioned negative elements , my 3-stars comes from some pros of the movie. First, the realistic cyborg performance by Michael Fassbender who shows fantastic robotic expressions that nobody can imitate along with the mechanical movements. He is a robot in the movie after all.

Second of all, visual effects is beyond the standard quality in terms of creatures and environments. By watching this movie, I can vividly and easily imagine what the future spaceships would really look like and how leather chairs and wooden desks are going be replaced by the glowing aluminum furniture. They sure know how to depict the futuristic design.

Lastly, the ending. Overall, I am a bit disappointed in character development and the plot, but a distant whisper from Ridley Scott whirs through my ears and tells us that ""Prometheus 2"" which recently got announced will come back in a much better shape in order to make it up for true Sci-Fi movie fans and the rest who are left with an ambiguous mystery.","3"
"kevin-greer42-392-673858","You should know better...","10 June 2012","In common with many people, I was really looking forward to seeing Prometheus. The movie has been heavily promoted as a prequel to the unsurpassed ""Alien"" and is directed by Ridley Scott himself. But shortly before I saw the film for myself I noticed a description on IMDb that filled me with foreboding: ""Writer - Damon Lindelof"". If you don't already know, you need to know that Damon Lindelof was one of the main writers of ""Lost"".

With that in mind, if you were one of the many who watched Lost through thick and thin, I reckon I can predict your response to Prometheus based on your response to the ending of Lost. If you felt the ending of Lost was good and you bought into the idea that the whole story arc was about character development and their ""journey"" to self-awareness, then you will probably think Prometheus is pretty good: deep questions (where do we come from), conflicted characters (searching for meaning) and mythology come to life (cave paintings and ancient languages). If, on the other hand, the ending of Lost left you feeling like you'd been mind-raped by a socially dysfunctional uber-geek with a Wikipedia cut-and-paste approach to story writing and a lazy contempt for the audience, then you'll absolutely HATE Prometheus.

I fall into the latter category. I very nearly walked out of this film half way through. I felt my intelligence was being insulted in almost every scene. All the other negative reviews here on IMDb are correct. I won't duplicate here the points that others have made but in summary: the plot is nonsensical; the crew don't behave in a believable manner; there are gaping holes in the underlying story; and, true to Lindelof style, meaningful questions merely serve as an excuse to ask more questions (""OK, now we know who made us, but who made them?"") or serve up meaningless pseudo-philosophy (""It's what I choose to believe""). Even the unexplained ""black goo"" is a pathetic, transparent rip-off of the X- Files.

But you know what? If you go into this movie knowing it was written by Lindelof but expecting it to be good, you really should know better. I'll give you 2 facts about Lindelof that should tell you why: (1) on his IMDb profile page it says this about him: ""He is the writer of the 2006 comic book miniseries ""Ultimate Wolverine vs. Hulk"". Although in a previous 2004-2005 miniseries ""The Ultimates,"" the Hulk had been said to have killed 800 people while on a rampage in New York, Lindelof gave the more exact figure in ""Ultimate Wolverine vs. Hulk"" #2 (April 2006) as 815. 815 is the flight number of the doomed Oceanic flight from which the castaways were stranded on ""Lost"", and constitutes three of the cursed ""numbers"" used as a recurring plot point on that show."" (2) He has been quoted as saying ""The jumping off point for Prometheus for me is this: If somebody believed in God and you presented scientific evidence that directly contradicted that belief, what would he do? I find that question tremendously compelling.""

The first quote, despite being geekery of mind-fracturing proportions, nonetheless demonstrates that Lindelof possesses a tiny little mind with as much imagination as a toenail (ooh! It's not 800, it's 815 because, you know, that's ""meaningful"" – in a comic). The second quote indicates that despite his tiny little mind, Lindelof apparently has a need and believes he has the ability to join some very serious company and address profound philosophical questions. He's wrong and someone needs to tell him. Perhaps we can strap him a rocket and fire him into space so we don't have to hear his idiotic screeching.

This film is a huge disappointment and I place the blame firmly with Lindelof. Scott managed to make the film look gorgeous but it's built on Lindelof sand. How Scott allowed himself to be taken in by Lindelof's dire story writing is inexplicable.","1"
"Soyoenrc","Waste","1 June 2012","It, was, a, waste.

It had the biggest plot holes I've ever seen in a movie. When watching the movie you could predict about 95 percentage of what was going to happen.

I actually started laughing at the main character when she started crying because she was alone, it was just so... Pathetic. I don't know what happened in the middle of the movie but seriously?

Alien I loving robot, again? Plus I sure do love a zombie movie... If I want to see nice terrains for 5 minutes I could just as well go hiking. The scariest part during the movie was when my girlfriend got spooked by the surgery performed.

If it hadn't been for the animations and the details I would've thought this was a b-film produced in India, only thing missing was some citizen starting to dance with the snakes, which actually partly happened - he just wasn't from India.

Anyhow, it's alright to watch as you'll be busy watching how beautiful the landscape and animations are whilst the blonde gets a ship in her head, fair play.","4"
"claudiohfg","Waste of time and money","15 June 2012","I'm so mad that I wasted my time watching this movie that I just had to at least warn somebody about it. My review contain some spoilers so be warned twice.

The characters are shallow and inconsistent. I didn't care if they would die or not. Better when they did.

They're scientists but don't know anything about security or protective gear.

They fear dead inanimate bodies, but are cool with living alien snakes.

The air being breathable does not mean it is without viruses and other deadly creatures.

Two guys leave early to go back to the ship, but miraculously they are left behind just to die senseless deaths. BTW, there are a lot of senseless deaths in this moving picture... thing... stuff.

Why all leaving being that are not us are trying to kill us? Even extremely advance ones?

"scotch7","3 Big Goofs","14 June 2012","Give this one 4 of 10 stars for the very truly beautiful visuals, including opening sequences and imaginings of the interiors... stuff you all saw in the trailers. Plus one more star for casting of female leads.

Big Goof 1:

Dr Elizabeth Shaw (Noomi Rapace) wakes up from a deep-space sleep wearing two ace-bandages functioning as a bikini (covering the usual bits). The Ace bandages are fastened by metal-and-plastic clips that are somewhat more fancy that what we use today, but still the same function and clearly part metal.

We soon see her wearing a button-up night-shirt as she prepares to have sex with her partner. It's significant in that she has had a change of clothes since waking up from deep sleep. Probably a shower too.

Later entering a medical scanner, she's wearing an identical ace-bandage bikini again. No explanation on why this is the right thing to wear instead of say a t-shirt or hospital gown or scrubs. She is asked to remove a metal crucifix, but not the metal clips holding her ace-bandage ""bikini"" together.

The ace-bandage bikini is a very important outfit to the movie. Rapace/Shaw is still wearing it in a reprise of Sigorney Weaver's panic-in-just-a-thin-t-shirt moment. This outfit make no sense in terms of fashion or function or thrill or continuity. Hetro guys (including me) would prefer a t-shirt or something even more revealing. Rapace has shown us her considerable charms (Girl with a Dragon Tattoo) so why not at least a sweaty t-shirt?

Big Goof 2:

The ""big-bad-nasty"" wants to plant her embryo in you, so baby can eat you from the inside, till ready to hatch. Your next role is ""walking eggshell,"" a task you do not survive. VERY Scary, especially as filmed in Alien.

The big-bad-nasty will also eat you at the cellular level, then use the bowl of mush you quickly become to quickly build copies of itself. This could have been VERY frightening, if the cinematography showed the process correctly. Such attacks at the cellular level are common in our world. It's what happens with Ebola, HIV and Herpes: Virii invade your cells where they insert some ""malicious"" code into your regular DNA. Your cells then stop working to keep you happy and start working for the virus. Mostly this is very much against your best interests. Copies of the virus are made till the cell walls explode, releasing copies of the virus into the host (you) where they infect more of your cells. Lather, Rinse Repeat.

Prometheus could have presented a CGI of this process which would stand alone, educating and enlightening along with frightening all at the same time. Instead the CGI shows a victim's DNA being dissolved, then random atoms are re-assembled into a new string with a nasty new mission. As shown, this would require something more powerful than the strong nuclear force or the weak nuclear force; so suspension of disbelief is halted for a lot of us.

This is doubly sad, because the idea of latent malicious code in your ""junk"" DNA waiting to do something nasty when triggered is a very interesting idea. It's been developed in books (The Deus Machine) and is worthy of movie development. Imagine throwing just one ACTG ""switch"" that exists in every cell in every body which then launches a malicious program that causes normal DNA to ""go postal."" Sigh.

Big Goof 3:

Alien spacecraft - at least 100 meters across in the shape of a big ""C"" fails to complete launch and after colliding with another spacecraft crashes from at least 5,000 meters onto the surface of the 1-G alien planet. It flies flat like a Frisbee, but lands on it's thin side, 90-degrees from flight attitude. Rather than break into millions of pieces (or even two); it holds shape and further survives falling flat onto the tarmac.

Nothing on the periodic table of elements is that strong at that scale.

There's more, but time to stop. It would be so wonderful if just one person on a blockbuster movie's production team was actually capable of reading SciAm or ANY technical publication.","5"
"trajan96","How to butcher a brilliant franchise","22 April 2023","One of the more egregious screw the pooch exercises in movie history. A legendary franchise, a stellar cast, an Oscar winning director whose original ALIEN is still one of greatest Sci fi films ever, and they came up with this incomprehensible mess. The biggest problem was a laughably awful script. Characters supposedly great scientists behaving like juvenile idiots repeatedly. No safety protocols whatsoever on an alien planet with unknown life forms crawling around everywhere? Characters with apparently conflicting agendas that were never clarified. Characters behaving like shrieking idiots. Weak shots, poor pacing, painful dialog. Here and there some beautiful cinematography and visuals but not nearly enough to rescue the overall. Watching Alien then Prometheus back to back, one would never guess the same direction helmed both. Was he drunk? Relationship troubles?","4"
"BRYN-26","Another Alien movie that shouldn't have been made.","15 June 2012","The more I contemplate Prometheus the worse it seems! While certain elements of it were brilliant & very entertaining it was effectively just another Alien movie that shouldn't have been made.

Highlights: the space scenes in 3D, the spaceship interior (opulent in Culture-esque way).

Here are a couple of flaws (among very many): 1. on the Isle of Skye, upon discovering the drawings the archaeologist runs out of the cave calling ""Dr Holloway, Dr Holloway, come quickly.."", this was doubly annoying, firstly no Brit calls another PhD ""Dr"" (only in America), secondly, it was so clichéd, it was like watching Stargate (which I hate).

2. I thought the crew of the Prometheus was terribly cast, so stereotyped, only Theron was well cast, but her character fell apart half way through. Other characters: ""Let's have a black captain!"", but where was his cigar? ""let's have an oriental navigator"", Mr Sulu anyone... I could go on!! My rating: 5/10.","1"
"MovieAddict2016","Put aside your expectations that it will be an ""Alien"" film.","4 October 2012","I've had a tumultuous ride with ""Prometheus."" When it was initially announced, as Alien 5, with Tony Scott's son-in-law directing (he's now making a Samurai movie with Keanu Reeves and been kicked out of the editing room by the studio because it's gone far over-budget, btw), I was cautiously optimistic. When Ridley took it over, and it was re-announced as a prequel, I was more optimistic.

When they began to basically hint that they were retroactively altering the 'Space Jockey' creatures from Alien, I grew a bit worried. One of my biggest delights with Alien, as a child, was the weird Space Jockey creature they stumble across, and you can just tell from the way it was filmed that it was meant to be another alien species that was killed off by the titular alien species.

What Ridley Scott decided to do, however, was (and I don't think this is even a spoiler, by this point, but stop reading now if you want to know nothing about Prometheus) retroactively claim that the Space Jockey wasn't actually just an alien but, rather, an exoskeleton suit of sorts, a kind of bio-mechanical grafted suit, and that the alien inside the suit is actually...the ancestors of humankind.

So immediately you get the idea that Ridley isn't just making an Alien prequel. This is a movie with bigger themes and ideas and it only truly connects to Alien in a few ways, and minor ones at that.

I think, after seeing the film and realizing how little it connects to Alien, the retroactive altering of the Space Jockey didn't bother me as much as I expected it to. Will I re-watch Alien from now on and be convinced that the thing in the chair is a human engineer who looks like us? Nah. But within its own universe, Prometheus works well, and the story it has to tell is engaging.

This may not be what most people expected, but if you can meet the film on its own terms, it's quite a ride. And while the characters do indeed act quite stupidly at times, Michael Fassbender is amazing as David. He deserves an Oscar nomination.","8"
"ignacio-mig14","The Horror! The perfect irony.","1 October 2012","Before turning it off, the last scene of this movie I've seen was a head exploding. What a perfect metaphor for the horrid decadence of the action film genre. As a viewer, it could be my head exploding after me blowing my brains out, and as a filmmaker, their heads after squeezing'em so hard trying to copy James Cameron, and Spielberg, and mostly Scott himself, and the garbage that comes out of that dead brain is called ""Prometheus"". Like I've said, I didn't see the whole movie (thank God), but I don't know why I got this strange feeling I've seen it 200 times before. More than 30 years old is the masterpiece ""Alien"", but it seems like Scott pretends to laugh in my face with this cheap remake, orientated to earn some more money from the people that's too young to have watched the original. The use of terms such as ""prequel"" and ""connections"", in order to cheat the audience and come out with both bigger ego and bank account, is worthy of admiration. Bravo, Ridley! I'm nobody, but I'm glad I didn't pay a red cent to watch 45 minutes of your pretentious, huge and impressive lot of nothing. Do you want to know where we come from? Why are we here? We come from our mother's uterus, and we're here to make a living without fooling other people in the process, that's all I care about. Oh, right, the storm effects, the aliens, the exploding heads, the holograms, the old cultures, the alien scientist, the crazy scientist, the do-able science woman, her boyfriend... say hi to them from me. So long and farewell.","1"
"your_friendly_reviewer","Alien: Prometheus","4 April 2020","As with all Alien movies it's full of gore and dark atmosphere so if that's your flavour then have at it. It's not a bad movie but would suggest waiting to watch until the prequels have caught up to 1979's Alien, also directed by Ridley Scott. If you haven't seen any of the Alien films then start with the one just mentioned. Outstanding visual effects.

I would watch this again if it's already playing in the background.","7"
"jakslev","Promising Prometheus","18 June 2012","I went to watch Prometheus without knowing that it was meant to be a sort of prequel to the Alien movies. Considering how these movies spun off to be utter crap; that knowledge might have made me watch this movie with lower expectations.

As a nerd, I like the whole dualistic sci-fi environment that Ridley Scott, and others, have created. The mix between clean white and sterile safe areas countered with dark, almost medieval (and definitely gooey) areas where evil resides, is very good and resonates well with most nerds like me. The opening scene of the movie was epic with a beautiful view and a simple short story line that (to the initiated) explained the origin of man. I almost dropped my pop corns there!

Unfortunately the movie doesn't continue in this epic intelligent manner. It leans heavily on the Raelian and the Intelligent by design theories but quickly turns into a new Alien movie for a new generation.

There are many open questions in this movie and things that are utterly silly.

1) Why did our creators decide to delete us? And why did they suddenly decide not to?

2) Why did they choose to kill us using a scary monster that they can't even handle themselves? Surely a nuke or just going down and banging our heads in would have been smarter?

3) Why do they leave a star-map on earth that leads – not to their home planet – but to one of their military facilities?

4) Why didn't other creators return to the military facility on the planet to sort the alien-monster issue?

5) Why are they themselves so immensely aggressive and uninterested in interacting with us?

6) Why haven't they evolved during the x-thousands years where we have developed intergalactic flight?

7) Why is the super-advanced medic-station ""calibrated for men"", when it's owned by the female boss/owner of the whole operation?

8) How realistic is it that anyone would be able to run around after having had a moving foreign object the size of a baby cut out of her belly? And clamped together with some metal clamps???

9) Why would the captain be smoking cigars and act like he was from 30 years ago? A bit of an anachronism?

10) Why would anyone choose such stupid scientists and such silly weapons?

Well – I can't be bothered to write any more about the movie. It was bad – not as bad as Knights, but still pretty bad.","3"
"asselineric","Big disappointment","23 June 2012","Please note that I'm a big fan of the first Alien movie. The other movies were superfluous to me.

Prometheus does not have an interesting storyline. It's a reenactment of the first Alien.

The picture is beautiful, but the ambiance ordinary. I was expecting to be scared, but I was not at all. The first Alien's feeling of claustrophobia, which I think made the movie so great, was absent.

The alien creatures in this movie were in plain sight all the time. That made them not scary. The design of the creature (squid + tall guy) were not weird as the original alien, making them ineffective. Also, for a race of advanced engineers, they seem to have the IQ of cavemen: all infected humans and engineers are just regular ghouls of classic horror movies (except that they don't go for your brain, they just wan't to kill compulsive manner). The life cycle of the creatures made no sense to me at all.

The greatest strenght of the original movie was the realism of the characters played as blue collar workers. Their reactions were all plausible. On the contrary, Prometheus characters are the usual gross Hollywood caricatures. They do not act as a realist team of scientific explorers. Here are a few examples: how could an isolated team of two scientists be left in an alien spaceship without constant monitoring? How come such a group of scientists be so unprepared as a team for such an important mission (with so many incompetent members)? Why are there no biological contamination precaution taken by the biology scientist? How come 3 members of the crew suddenly and without hesitation decide to go kamikaze? The whole movie follows roughly the pattern of the original Alien, so there are no surprise. In a sense, it's a weak remake of the original.

Ridley Scott had poor writers. Too bad because some of the actors there were of quality. But what can you do without a decent script? If you're a die hard fan of the Alien franchise, see this one at the theatre. If not, wait for the DVD.","3"
"Marc_Action","Alien I","20 October 2012","The premise of the film is great. In the distant future a space crew is sent on a journey to possibly find the origin (or creators) of mankind. They use a star map discovered in a cave in Scotland by archaeologists. The team finally arrives at their destination four years later; a distant moon called LV233, only to learn that most of the aliens (which they dub as the ""Engineers"") have long vacated the world or died out, and that something went terribly wrong some time ago. Before they can figure out just what that is that went wrong, things start going bad for the crew as well. This is all great stuff, and watching the storyline unfold is a thrill.

Where Prometheus falls short is it tries to be the prequel to the cult hit film Alien from 1979 but doesn't quite mix with the chemistry of the original or the franchise that it kicked off. What's worst is Prometheus lifts elements directly from the franchise without bothering to change anything. For example, I get that including a mysterious android in the film ties it in with the franchise, but we already seen an android decapitated and impaled in Alien and Aliens, respectively. So doing it again here doesn't add any shock value for the audience. We've seen it before, try something new. Or how about the alien pregnancy, with the baby bursting from the abdomen? Yup, that was done already in Alien and Aliens 3. Well, actually there is a really cool surgical procedure in this film done to remove an alien baby from the main character's abdomen before it can hatch, so I guess they did change it up a little bit, but it's not enough to make anyone who's seen the Alien films care. Also while the premise is great, Ridley Scott's execution of the film is not. There is just too many implausible things going on in this film.

A big issue is the opening scene. It is never really explained further in the film, and therefore, seems meaningless. The ending is also problematic. How can the lone survivor run off in an alien spaceship that she does not know how to operate in search of the ""Engineers"" home planet without any food? Exactly how far does this character expect to get? It just doesn't make sense. There are a lot of moments like this in this film.","3"
"Gabrienb","Very disappointing.","11 June 2012","I am a big fan of the original Alien, but came to this film with no expectations except one: I fully expected it to be good. Not great. Good. Heck, I would have settled for decent.

Thing that gets me is, they had me for the first hour and a half. I liked that it was meandering and slow. It reminded me of the original. If only it was going somewhere...

Unfortunately, they begin with Alien and end with Armageddon. Worse though, because Armageddon I could safely turn off after 20 minutes.

Over two hours, with no action to suck up the time mind you, and they still couldn't come up with a remotely original or interesting plot? Couldn't develop a single character beyond a cardboard cutout? Not a single one! All those great actors wasted. And then the ending ticks every cliché in the book down to projecting a sequel. No thanks Mr. Scott.","1"

The writers spent so much of their time trying to be deep or philosophical that they forgot to fill in plot holes. I do applaud the filmmakers for choosing practical effects over CGI when possible, though, which helps create a sense of horrifying realism. However, when you start to really think about the story, the loose ends start to show and this movie falls apart.","5"
"Rautus","Prometheus - Flawed but Enjoyable","3 June 2012","Prometheus (2012)

Directed by: Ridley Scott

Screenplay by: Jon Spaihts and Damon Lindelof

Prologue:

Prometheus, the long awaited instalment in the Alien Saga is finally here, and like everyone, I was excited to go see it

After all, this was a new Alien movie that was being directed by Ridley Scott, the visionary genius behind the 1979 classic that started it all, not only that but it was to be a Prequel that expands the Alien Universe and sheds light on the long, mysterious Mythology behind the Space Jockies

and Prometheus would also return the series to its roots with the dark, Gothic H.R. Giger style surroundings

I couldn't wait.

Plot:

In the year 2089, an archaeologist couple Elizabeth Shaw and Charlie Holloway discover a star map hidden among the remnants of other unconnected ancient cultures. Believing all this to be connected to the human race's creators. Peter Weyland, the founder of the powerful Weyland Corporation, funds the creation of the scientific vessel named after the Greek Titan Prometheus to follow the star map to the moon LV-223 to find mankind's makers, dubbed ""Engineers"" by Shaw.

In the year 2093, the ship arrives and lands near an alien structure. A team including Shaw, Holloway, and David explores the structure, while Vickers and Captain Janek monitor their progress on-board the ship.

What was meant to be the scientific discovery of a lifetime, soon becomes a nightmare of complete terror as the intentions of the structure and of the Gods who made us becomes clear.

Review:

Prometheus is interesting movie with great ideas that is executed both good and flawed at the same time The visuals are stunning and impressive, you can definitely see the Budget was well spent for the CGI.

The sets of the Prometheus ship and the Space Jockey ruins are beautiful and reminiscent to ""Alien"" The effects for the Space Jockies and the Alien Bio-weapons were decent The acting is good, especially from Michael Fassbender as David, there is a fascinating mixture of childish innocence, profound wit and a dark sinister core.

Charlize Theron is exceptional as the forceful, commanding and ruthless Vickers

Noomi Rapace was good as Shaw, it was interesting to see that the main heroin was not just another Ripley clone, as seen in both AVP and AVP-R

She was frail, but also had a deep inner strength within.

I liked Idris Elba as the Captain of the Prometheus, it was a shame they didn't give him more screen time and give the viewer the same feeling they had for Dallas in Alien.

Guy Pearce as Peter Weyland was alright, but distracting, like most movies where a young actor or actress is put in old age make-up and has to pretend to be old. Highlander II: The Quickening with Christopher Lambert as old MacLeod is a prime example. It's a really hard thing to pull off, but props to Guy Pearce for trying his best.

The rest of the cast was okay, but needed more time to develop all of them, and because of this, most of them end up being like the characters from AVP, you don't really know much about their personality to care what happens to them.

Another problem Prometheus has is the script which has a fair share of plot holes It also doesn't know whether it wants to be a body shock horror, an infected colleague gone mad kind of horror, an atmospheric horror or sci-fi adventure. But for some reason, the bonkers style changes makes the film entertaining It's like a bizarre, wild ride, where you don't know what you're in for next.

One flaw that this movie has is that at times, it feels that there is something missing, it feels like there should be scenes in the film to explore more of the story and the characters

Hopefully there will be a Director's Cut for the DVD & Blu-Ray Release that fills the movie completely.

Another flaw some people have is the pacing, while it may be slow to begin with, I believe it was intentional for creative reasons. The movie was building up atmosphere and tension in the same style as Alien. The slow pacing with the first half wasn't a problem for me.

Overview:

Prometheus is a flawed movie but also enjoyable if you can look past the plot holes and the flaws.

I definitely recommend checking Prometheus out with an open mind

Enjoy the movie for what it is, a beautifully shot, crazy styled expansion of the Alien Universe.","8"
"OlieRendch","Not a Prequel!","20 October 2012","This is a pure spin-off. Anyway, Prometheus. Hmmm, what can I say about this film. Well, it was very interesting. It wasn't as scary as I would've thought but more philosophical. The plot was defiantly interesting and there was a twist or two. I liked the CGI, that was fantastic and the creatures great and had some awesome scenes but then I can see where people get a little confused. This film gives out a lot of questions all the way through but then it only answers, like, 2 or 3. You literally have no idea why most of the events are happening. Its a fun movie to watch if you like sci-fi, aliens and thriller-like concepts but for the people who think about the story arc and look into it, you mostly base your views on theories. The end was one of the best parts and it defiantly sets up a sequel. So, I don't quite know who I'd recommend it too; sci-fi fans defiantly, an people who don't care about the story lines, but also people who do because you want to know which makes you keep watching and yearn for a sequel.",NA

Okay, I saw 7.8 star on IMD and decided to watch it in a theater. Totally horrible and felt as if I wasted 15.50 bucks. An alien drinks something and dies. A group of people get on board on prometheus in search of the creator of humans- aliens. The aliens happen to die the moment the humans arrive. Furthermore, there are a bunch of vessels full of black gooey stuff that happens to melt down when the humans arrive. It creates a snake-like creature inside the black liquid and attacks people. First, I don't know why the men touched the disgusting creature on extra-terrestrial land to begin with. The snake like monster breaks his arm and when cut off by another person, it exudes acid and kills the other person. The snake is reborn where it is cut goes inside the initial person's body and kills it.

They also see a trace of what happened in the past and what the human-like aliens did inside the pyramid. It shows like a green electro sort of image.

There is no form of village or any living creature besides the dead giants in some uniform and that monster from the hundreds of vessels. The alien pyramid turns out to be a spaceship and holds thousands of vessels that keeps the black material. At the same time, scientists on board find out that the dna of human and that of the aliens match.

David, an A.I puts a droplet of the black material into one guy's drink. He becomes a monster and gets killed. He has sex with his girlfriend, and she gets pregnant with a monster in 10 hours. David does NOT do a procedure on her. David is like an asshole... he also tells her later that doesn't anyone want their parents dead. I don't know if he means to kill off all human race. The woman goes inside a machine that does auto-surgery and removes the alien inside her.

Turns out that an old man who developed prometheus is on board. David finds one alien alive in a tube just like people in the movie Matrix. The alien-much larger than humans, tears David the A.I's head off and kills everyone else. David sees that the alien gets on a machine and sees the alien trying to fly to earth. David, a smart a.i, can speak with the alien, and also by the aggression of the alien, David knows that the alien is heading off to earth to destroy human beings with the black, monster making, gooey material. The same stuff that killed all the aliens.

Really don't understand where that black thing comes from. Also, these super smart, human creating aliens can't have died of monsters. They should be able to find a way to kill them off! IT doesn't explain why the alien wants humans dead either.

Anyway, the woman once pregnant with the alien notifies the people on the ship. They somehow believe her, and three drivers(of the ship) all agrees to die by exploding the alien spaceship with theirs!!!!

Charleze theron escapes but dies anyways by being crushed in the broken spaceship. The once pregnant woman finds a part of the ship to get more oxygen. Finds out that the alien fetus she had grew into some sort of kraken, like the one in pirates of the Caribbean. The last alien comes to kill her but gets killed by the kraken.

David, his head chopped off, can still communicate with the woman. He tells her to save him and he will be able to drive one of the other alien space ship. Really doesn't make any sense since David is the one who tried to contaminate humans and also kill her with alien fetus. Woman says she wants to go to a place where these aliens were created and want to ask them why they decided to destroy humans. That's the end. Really shocked... how the hell does she know if there is alien creator? There wasn't even any notification that they were 100% sure the aliens created humans. It was just a hypothesis. Anyways, she is off to some other place in space, not sure what she will eat on her way, and a weird alien comes out of the dead alien. I don't know if it was already a part of the alien or if it is part of the Kraken","1"
"DarkTheater","Pretty, but meh.","27 October 2012","Prometheus is a Playboy model. Beautiful to look at, with nary a scar or blemish anywhere, but completely inarticulate. This had the potential to be a blockbuster, and a definitive science fiction film, but Ridley Scott and the writers chose to dumb it down for the lowest common denominator (which, apparently, was the writers themselves.) You have a crew that should be the cream of the crop for a trillion dollar mission, but who all prove to be completely incompetent, acting in direct contradiction to what their specialty is supposed to be. They also have no grasp of common sense. (you NEVER take your helmet off on an alien world). You have engineers who create man, then revisit us several times to give them a map to their boi-weapons facility. Huh? Then for no reason they decided to come wipe us out 2000 years ago, but didn't make it. You have an android supposedly committed to saving his master violate every contagion protocol and infecting a crew member with no idea what will happen to him, and a dozen other examples of quarantine violations. (A dude whose partner was infested with an alien snake shows up outside, so they not only open the door, but walk right up to him, then turn their backs on him so he can attack. Ugh) Pretty, but not a keeper.","6"
"RoyBatty88","A movie that'll receive mixed reactions, a movie that you'll love or hate. I loved it.4.5/5","8 June 2012","You will either love or hate this movie. There is no in between with it, it's goes way deep and leave a lot of ambiguity that are near impossible to answer. I think that was where I have a love/hate relationship with it, I love that it doesn't spoon feed it's audience everything but at the same time it leave questions that drive one nuts. Now there are 3 scenes that I can't give away that should of been cut out because to me they felt a tad out of place. Why am I giving it 4.5/5 after pointing out all it's flaws? Here is the simple reason why, for one, It's Ridley Scott, bias number 1. Bias number 2, the first half of the movie is literally the best science fiction I seen in a long time 3.) It's beautifully directed and loaded with great performances. and 5.) It was rather suspenseful.

This being said i loved it, I think it's the next Blade Runner that movie was ambiguous as hell, it was not well received at all when it first came out, and guess what, it's considered a classic. I think Prometheus will be that movie. It's a glorious movie in it's own right. Sure I can understand why people will not like it, I definitely get it. It is not a perfect movies and needs a lot of improvement. I will confess there is a lot of scenes that seem to tie in with Alien and they really should not of done that. First off I thought it was going to take place in the same universe as Alien but not be a direct prequel. It contradicts itself in a lot of ways, I had to let the creatures in the movie grow on me.

Well now I warned about the cons in it, let me point out the pros. First off, the acting from Noomi Rapace was amazing she shined in every way. She played probably my favorite Heroin in a movie. She is on my top 5 now, my top 5 being, Ellen Ripley (of course), Trinity, Princess Leia, Lispeth Salander (Both Swedish and American movie), and finally Elizabeth Shaw played by Noomi. Then there was Michael Fassbender. Of course the man can do no wrong he's golden in everything that he's in. Literally. He plays a complex character, David, who you can't really predict his next move. Even after the film I can't figure out his true motive. Now here are other pros, visually it's gorgeous, it's a feast for the eyes the whole damn thing. The whole movie was well put together, although, they needed to tone down the plot holes. Again, there are scenes i would have cut out of the movie. But all in all, I loved it, I love Ridley Scott doesn't spoon feed his audience.

Overall, I loved it, but I don't recommend it to everyone. I honestly think it should be fixed in many ways it's not a perfect movie. I am going to see it again because as I pointed out, it's raises lots of questions, there were parts I didn't get. However, I know it's entirely intentional. A lot of it has to do with the inevitable sequel that will be set to come out.",NA
"Supercargo","It's OK","9 July 2012","I went to see *Prometheus* yesterday evening. It was ... hmm ... 'OK' I suppose is the best I can do. There were definitely things to like about it. The acting was good. Especially from Noomi Rapace as Elizabeth Shaw the archaeologist and Michael Fassbender as David the Android, though I liked Charlize Theron's character too. But, but, but ...

I still don't think the much hyped '3D' imaging is very good. It does not seem three dimensional to me. More like several flat planes set one behind the other. There is an illusion of depth, but it works best in what I take to be computer animated landscapes where the camera can swoop and fly. In the live action scenes I found - at best - it added nothing to the experience of the film. At worst (but to be fair there were few 'worst' moments) it distracted from the drama.

Setting that aside, one other aspect of the FX really irritated me. Regardless of how good the technology is in some places, isn't it remarkable that Hollywood still can't create a convincingly OLD person? Poor Guy Pearce (Peter Weyland) who must have spent hours getting slathered in latex every day he was in front of the camera. To what purpose? He looked like a man slathered in latex. Why Ridley Scott could not have found an elderly actor to play the part I do not understand. I kept expecting a transformation scene, or a flashback, in which the latex would vanish and the point of using an actor in his forties would become clear. But no.

Generally I found the story disappointing. Thousands of years ago - at least 35 thousand years ago according to the film's opening live-action scenes - the human race was created by a race of giants. For sake of argument we'll call them Titans. Then for unknown reasons, the Titans took it into their heads to wipe us out again. They developed some sort of biological weapon, but lost control of it. This happened about two thousand years ago. (Am I alone in seeing some sort of connection with the founding of Christianity?) The Titans lost control of their weapon and it wiped them out but not before they had built a fleet of spaceships and loaded them with deadly canisters of bio-gunk. The bio-gunk is still alive and deadly, as the crew of the Prometheus then find out. When the gunk infects a person it seems to go through a series of metamorphoses before growing into the Alien we know and love.

Here's the question at the core of the film: if the Titan's made us in their image and are, so to speak, our creator-gods, then who created them? The puzzle is presented twice. First through Elizabeth Shaw's equivocating Christian faith. (Exactly why is she so attached to that cross she wears? Is it really only nostalgia for her missionary father?) The second time is by way of David the Android, who lives and watches over his own creator-gods.

Perhaps this is a philosophical question that it is worth devoting a whole film to, but let's not pretend it hasn't been done before. And if Ridley Scott does think this is a profound philosophical conundrum, why tackle it so superficially? Because the film IS superficial. It is very obvious that it is being made for crass commercial reasons. There are many nods in the direction of the original *Alien* films (to reel in the punters who liked them) and many loose threads and unanswered questions (to open up the options for sequels). But set the film next to Scott's original *Alien* and the sheer poverty of this new film is very apparent. Set it next to (for example) JJ Abram's re-envisioned *Star Trek* and the cack-handedness of *Prometheus* as a vehicle for kick-starting a failing franchise is also very obvious.

No. For me *Prometheus* just confirms that Scott is losing his touch.","6"
"mrshev","Nice visuals, bad everything else.","19 November 2012","I have a lot of time for Ridley Scott. He has made a long list of wonderful films. He has the skill to create movies that dazzle, frighten you and make you think.

Prometheus, though, is not one for the resumé.

It's a prequel of sorts - but this seems unclear when watching the film and I gained no further insight into the 'Alien' universe than I did without watching the film. There are a number of similarities to Alien but whereas the Alien crew were bored, travel hardened, cynical space truckers the crew of Prometheus...well, they are a strange mix of people. Certainly, I wouldn't have picked them as a crew to investigate something so unimaginably important.

This is one area that the film fails. The crew are a type of action piñata - merely there to be whacked and disposed of as the plot sees fit. It's as if no time went into their development as it was not deemed worth it, when they were needed as nothing other that set dressing. They also do not make meaningful sense as a crew on a research ship - people on research ships tend to be passionate, methodical and pragmatic. This crew have none of that.

The second area where the film fails is the plot. It is a veritable Swiss cheese of plot holes, cul-de-sacs and blind alleys. Not only do minor details fail to add up but the entire plot - the hook upon which this carcass is hung - is just a shambles. A kind of moronic, smörgåsbord of ideas that make no actual sense when you start thinking about it after you have left the cinema. I understand that one of the writers from Lost was involved - and that explains a lot.

The visuals, however, are fantastic. From the Prometheus itself to the gorgeous rolling alien landscapes - all of it is a feast for the eyes.

Finally, special mention needs to go to Noomi Rapace, Idris Elba and Michael Fassbender who almost single handedly keep the show on the road. Whilst the plot holes, miscasting and dubious scientific research turn this movie into a Carry On film they gamely lean on their significant acting ability and soldier on.

So, 5 out of 10 - why Scott didn't put this through a writers workshop is beyond me though!","3"
"peter-woodhart","disappointed","14 June 2012","I had very high hopes for Prometheus and I think Ridley Scott is one of the best directors ever, but, I saw the 3D version yesterday and I was very disappointed. On a positive note, the visual look of the film is fantastic and atmospheric. Unfortunately, the plot is very weak and insufficient work is done to develop the characters. I have a lot of questions:- 1. What was David's role/ motivation on the mission and why did he infect Charlie? 2. Why did the script writers use the name Weyland (again) - surely he was the rich guy in Alien vs Predator? 3. What happened to the atmosphere on the moon? In Promotheus, it was sunny sometimes (but not breathable). In alien it was extremely stormy and harsh all the time! 4. Why were there so many different alien life-forms? 5. What made the humanoid alien become so belligerent when they woke him? 6. Why did Vickers call Weyland 'father' when she had a different family name?

Finally, the ending appeared rushed as if either the film ran out of funding or the script writers couldn't think of anything

I have lots more questions but basically - what a shame! With a different script and the same approach to character development as in ALIENS - it could have been fantastic...........","3"
"nakano-385-773981","it grows on you","1 June 2012","After my first very negative review (I only gave one) and nearly one week after viewing the film I think I was wrong to be so negative. As I try to explain below.

I had an open mind before going to see this film, I did not expect or associate it with Alien. I looked at it purely on its own merits.

I realize now why my initial dislike of the film was based on its story. Anyone who has read Twelfth Planet (Earth Chronicles)by Zechar Sitchin would understand its not easy reading how we came about and how our creators view us. So I realize that for some people they may not like the film not because its a bad film but it does not fit comfortably with their hopes and beliefs. If this is deliberate by the script writer then it is far more clever and deeper than I realized.

However the script is the biggest let down. More holes to fill a black hole. If this film had a better script it probably would have been one of the best science fiction films of all time. There are two very particular holes that made me want to hate the film and believe I had wasted 2 hours of my life and nearly £10 ($15).

But the strange thing is apart from the script the film is haunting, it does create an alien world, it does create a believable Robot (Oscar worthy acting), it does create a spaceship landing on another planet, for the special effects, for the cinematography, for the Directing it is exceptional, beautiful and believable.

Edit: just bought the DVD and watched it again, its worth it just to watch Michael Fassbender as the Robot, I hope he gets a supporting actor nomination in the Oscars. He deserves to win it!","7"
"Jakealope","Very Big Letdown","20 November 2012","Okay, I expected more out of Ridley Scott and this latest installment of Aliens. So expectations lead to disappointments. If this was some low budget film by a second string director, I might have been slightly more charitable, but not much more. The movie could have been so much better with a better plot and characters.

For positives, it had great sets, visuals and location shots. They also had a pretty good set of actors. Michael Fassbender as David the Android was by far the best actor role set. It also had a decent but no original pansperia, life originating from another planet, plot element. It was certainly a far better film than the execrable ""Mission to Mars"" by the execrable Brian De Palma. It also floated out some intelligent ideas and concepts that weren't directly answered

But these are the parts that made the film bite. First two men get stranded in the dig when the rest of the crew had to high tail it back to the ship when a big storm blew in. These are supposed to be a couple of wimps who got scared when they found the dead aliens' bodies. So they end up taking refuge in the creepiest chamber they found, the temple room full of black goo and those creepy vases that are supposed to contain baby aliens. So one of them sees this ugly heinous looking creature swimming in the black goo on the floor. So they start cooing at it like it was a cute golden retriever puppy, trying to pet it. Even if looked like a cute puppy, any alien life form has to be treated with the utmost care and suspicion; if for nothing else contamination. Naturally bad things happen to them. It reminds me of a cheap horror movies where the next set of victims decide to take a stroll in some dark creepy place so the slasher or monster can have an easier time killing them off.

The worst part was when after David the android got one of the aliens implanted into our lead Scientist, Elizabeth Shaw. She gets away and gets in some auto surgery medical pod to get this terrible thing removed. So the machine gets it out of her. And she immediately gets dressed and goes to confront the mission leader, Meredith Vickers. She doesn't tell anyone about this horrible incident and horrible creature, which she left partially neutralized inside the medical pod. I mean after such a horrific event, if some one wasn't struck down by shock, they would at least tell some one, especially the mission leader and ship's captain. Okay, part of the plot was that the people involved were not unified and many had their own agenda. But Shaw was the de facto leader of the expedition. Later on, that monster, without eating anything, managed to grow in size about a 100 fold in less than a day.

I don't mind a movie recycling past elements, but from other movies, like the Fifield into the man-spider thing like from the Carpenter's ""The Thing"". There were just too many dumb characters, dumb moves, like trying to run from a ring shaped ship that is rolling on its side like a wheel by running down the track it is bound to roll on instead of cutting to one side or the other. We deserved better and Sir Scott let us down","4"
"lauluisa","The new cornerstone that takes down the house","19 September 2012","So we have some CGI. Once again. As incredible as it may seem, there were great movies before CGI. Stories told. I miss those stories. That acting. Eye-candy is a very poor substitute - like the substitute androids in ""Surrogates"". I think the Alien saga is an achievement. I have watched it over decades and have found nothing quite like it. The composition, the feeling, the details - it all comes together as a masterpiece. And now I'm faced with a supposed prologue of it all and I am crushed. The main theme - did somebody's 5 year old compose it? The DNA-donor at the beginning - his last gig was in Green Lantern, right? I will not even go into things like taking off helmets and not using gloves - those things have been covered here sufficiently. Somebody wrote in a review for the new Total Recall: this movie has no soul. I have to repeat that line here. There is nothing here. Yes, the CGI is good and I appreciate a nice view like the next Joe. But it does not substitute for the narrative. Yes, there's hints to the original (as there are in new TR), but that seems like offering me a pimped-up Ford Sierra as a Lamborghini, because it also has four wheels. And having Guy Pearce there - it reminds me of Lars von Trier' Melancholia: he casted John Hurt and he just sat there having like 2 lines. Why, oh, why? I am saddened. Truly.","2"
"bakoako-385-321249","My Friday evening nightmare (a short reflection)","9 June 2012","I had a dream last night, it was a about big strange nice-looking, water-loving man, and yeah, a robot was also included, but then again, I wasn't sure if it was really a robot, he talked about pain, and not to feel any, but maybe it was a world war dream, on second thought, he looked pretty like a Nazi soldier, and behaved similar. Then my dream twisted again, suddenly he was a deep loving human head, with strange filling. Oh, I remember now, there were others too, they explored a cave, and got f*cked by cobras (that was not very pleasant!), but they weren't really cobras. Anyhow, it was just dream. Than I was in a future hospital, and saw a woman performing an operation on herself! What an awful nightmare! But then again I was relaxed again, she could walk afterwards with no problem, and I knew, I was still dreaming. But I hoped it will end soon. So towards the end I was getting relaxed, but than some porn scene came up before my eyes with a big muscle-brain man get f*cked in the mouth from some very disgusting living flesh-something. OK, then I really wanted to wake up, and the Gods heard me, and woke me up. Just before that, I saw right before my eyes, that my nightmare was directed by Ridley Scott! So I was relaxed, when I woke, because I knew, it was really only a nightmare, all of this, 'cause in reality Ridley Scott directed Alien, Gladiator, Black Hawk Down, and so on. So I'm happy again.","1"
"victormonticelli","Underrated top-notch science fiction","17 September 2012","I think that the main reason that there is very few (or none) good sci-fi movies nowadays is because the audience today is, impressively and unfortunately, far more close-minded than a couple decades earlier. I am almost absolutely sure that Alien would not have such an impact if it was released today. Same with Blade Runner, or any other sci-fi classic.

It seems that today the audience have a hard time untying the bounds with the ""Status Quo"" or our reality as we experience, and if you don't let yourself go a little, a movie that has such strong concepts and a message underneath the surface such as ""Prometheus"" can disappoint because it has nothing to do with ""that's the way scientists react"" or ""a living form could not evolve so fast"". Ridley Scott tries (and, in my opinion, succeeds) on creating a whole new universe and mythology and for that, he hold no concern on a scientific approach of anything that legitimates a universe that is beyond our comprehension, and therefore he has no intent on explaining everything on screen.

One that could see beyond that ""barrier of the far-fetched realism"" can enjoy a masterpiece of the science fiction, a movie very rich in subtle meanings and concepts, an approach on origins of man that is rarely original. Ridley Scott is one of the very few directors that still have courage to make a movie that is full of layers, not intended to only make profit or please the audience, but to make you think. If you watch Prometheus more than once, you can experience a whole different movie over and over again.

It is not a perfect movie, though, and it's certainly not Ridley's best, but it is, 30 years later, the universe of Alien revisited, you can feel the atmosphere, you can celebrate that feeling once again, and you can see the the master of science fiction on the screen, which is such a relief, comparing to what the genre has providing us recently.","8"
"srdikano","Dumb AF","8 September 2020","Prometheus has an incredible premise, a potentially compelling story and a top notch Hollywood sci-fi budget. Yet... it's the dumbest script in modern film making.

Absolutely nothing makes sense: the characters are absurd, unrelatable, their behavior is consistently asinine and there are plot holes everywhere. I swear that I'm not being hyperbolic when I say that Prometheus is quite possibly the stupidest film (that wasn't supposed to be) that I've ever watched.","3"
"seanhmoss6","Ridley Scott makes Alien... again?","1 October 2022","I've already seen this movie...back in 1979. Then, I saw most of it again in 1986. Granted, this time around the visuals are superior to the first two times, but the story is the same. There are a couple of minor changes that are so predictable and uninspired that you hardly even notice. At one point half way through, I actually felt like I was the bored director because I already knew what was going to happen next. So much so that I didn't ask for or choose different takes to prevent cardboard performances from a talented cast to make the final cut of the film.

I suppose I hoped that because the movie was shot in 3D, no one would notice I just put a shiny coat of paint on a 1979 Cadillac.","5"
"allan_mckie","Worst movie in at least 5 years","21 October 2012","This movie has had a huge marketing campaign, and took in reasonable money. However, as I sat on the sofa (I rented the DVD) after it was finished, I turned to my girlfriend at the same time she turned to me and we both started ragging on the movie. It wasn't that it was one of these arty ""oh, it doesn't make sense because it was over my head"" type of things. It just didn't make sense. The implausibility of so much of the movie was astounding, as follows:

Weyland spent a trillion dollars on this ship to go some huge distance across the galaxy in search of some fountain of youth, but crews the ship with what amounts to amateur morons horrifically badly prepared for anything and everything.


the lead female character (whose name escapes me - the characters made that little an impact) gave herself major abdominal surgery, with no general anesthetic (granted, some future injection may have reduced the pain felt), and is therefore able to survive the squid that was growing inside her. OK, fine. She then essentially forgets the surgery and does all the usual running, jumping, fighting etc that you see in an action/sci-fi movie. This is literally within hours of the surgery.


the aliens were not consistent with what we know from the first movies. The infection went as follows - a drop of black goo is ingested by a crewman (name unknown - refer to earlier character anonymity) who then has relations with the female lead. She then starts growing a squid which she surgically removes. Squid comes out the size of a soccer ball, but somehow magically grows to the size of a cow (with enormous tentacles) to then act as some kind of demented, overgrown face hugger to the Engineer. The Engineer then has some sort of different Alien burst out of his chest. This is NOT even vaguely similar to the first movies.


2 years of space travel, even at relativistic speed (it appears that there is no FTL capability in the Alien universe), is not far in terms of distance in space. 2 light years is essentially down the road in terms of space. However, given other aspects of the film (such as the planet being some sort of outpost) then this probably isn't terribly relevant


the amount of unnecessary junk on the human spaceship was astounding. They had all sorts of creature comforts and empty space. Fine, they had the ability to control gravity, but they mentioned the trillion dollars that was spent on the mission - wouldn't it have made sense to make the ship smaller and cheaper by leaving all that stuff out, especially as the crew spent most of their time in cryo-sleep?


the human crew are essentially children. They appear to have no training of any kind, no discipline and no clues about what they are doing. Granted, Weyland didn't tell them much, but surely Weyland would have recruited the best people available considering he was spending a trillion dollars. Belief was beggared yet again.


Michael Fasbender's character (I only know who he is cos I liked him in Inglorious Basterds) was so annoying that he ruined an already bad movie. Why would an android worry about his hair?


what was the motivation of the Engineers? They went to the effort of making life on earth, but then decided to unleash the unstoppable biological weapon (imagine if there were 200 million Aliens loose on Earth) on us, rendering the Earth hostile to all life. The Engineers appeared to be as susceptible to the Alien as humans were in the previous movies. The Engineers essentially came across as children breaking a toy that they no longer wanted to play with. Interstellar travel, control of DNA, spawning life across the galaxy, but with the maturity of a 4 year old? Incredulity is everywhere.


The lead female character survives numerous attempts on her life, both by various characters, organisms, the environment etc, and then decides to go ask some of the people who have been trying to kill her why they were trying to kill her, all the while trusting an android who spent a good chunk of the movie trying to kill her. Incredulity is well shattered and lying in bits all over the floor.


In summary - APPALLING movie. Plot stinks. Acting stinks. Effects annoying. Logic ignored. Horrible experience (and not in a good way). I gave it 1 star because the rating system does not allow negative stars.","1"
"m_gh_gh","stupid scientists?","21 September 2012","The film in general doesn't make that much sense, though it's breath taking in some parts. The characters are supposed to be well knowledgeable people who made it all the way into that ship. not to mention the money in stack for sending such hightech manmade spaceship to a planet on hand of those folks. but their childish behavior, lack of discipline and acting on their own decisions does not go well with the theme. I mean come on, you don't give that ship to such people who behave less responsible than second grade students. I rather don't go to the details of having that kind of a behavior, shall a person end up at best to a job as a postman or a bar-keeper. but most possibly not a scientist and definitely not to another planet.

I totally understand that the director needs some mistakes from the crew in order to produce something that thrills the audience. but sorrily the viewers level of intellect is assumed as tiny as a mouse in this movie. This was sad as I was most of the time irritated by characters actions and was not really able to find a reasonable answer for my whys and hows raised through the movie.

"hoytyhoyty","This film only serves one purpose:","19 September 2014","It's kicked Alien3, 4 and the AvP's out of canon, permanently.

* There only ever was one Queen, somehow she made her way in one of the alien ships (lets pretend the Engineers never existed, because they sucked quite badly) to LV-426 - that's the AvP's gone, and Alien3 on the ropes...

* A human torso is far, far too small to gestate a Queen - that's Alien3 a'gone-gone... and with it Alien4

* The alien drones and Queen did not exist until into the far future - that's the AvP's wiped off the board, and of course good riddance

Why should we take this utter piece of crap as canon, over anything else that got made?

For one simple reason:

Everything after Aliens sucked in extreme measure, including Prometheus, but Prometheus is by the original director.

So it's a case of 'we may as well take any help we can get'.

Alien was such a piece of archetypal scripture, that it wasn't ever really possible to make a sequel, let alone sequels, of it. But then James Cameron came along and simply pluralised everything... and it just happened to work! Beautifully!

We went from Art movie to Action movie, and even though the endings were completely identical we didn't care. Something we never thought possible had happened - go James!

Then Alien3 came out and that was the end of that...

One day there might be a good Alien film again, but it's kinda getting a bit late.

Ridley inspired a whole heap of new-gen SF-action film making - as did George Lucas, as did Stanley Kubrick - nowadays I think we are just looking for the next evolutionary step.","1"
"ChrisChadwick","A Very Good Film. Imaginative. A Few Minor, Niggling Flaws.","7 June 2012","After reading a few reviews, it seems I have seen a few things in this film, others haven't. Maybe i'm giving it credit where none is due.

The four things which gave me reason for annoyance are: 1 - Why did the two women at the end run away from the rolling alien spaceship? Why didn't they just run to the side? Job done. Simple. 2 - If you are going to pay a lot of money for a good actor, don't give her a crap death. Charlize Theron: squished. Rubbish. 3 - Give your film a proper ending, if only for the poor audience. Flying off into space looking for answers is not an ending; it's an ellipsis... 4 - Weapons of Mass Destruction? All you do by mentioning the dreaded W.M.D. is make the audience think of Team America: World Police and Hans 'Bricks'. This is why Green Zone didn't work as a movie. Yes, the aliens W.M.D.s in this film, but why not refer to them as biological warfare or genetically constructed or genetically modified weapons? ""Hey, Hans Bricks- you're bustin' my balls, guy.""

The only bad performance was the grumpy Sean Harris's character. Maybe this is the fault of bad direction or bad acting. I don't know.

Michael Fassbender was faultless. Brilliant. You never knew at any point what his motivations were or who his allegiances were with... if any.

I loved the 'Space Jockey' aliens right from the very start of the film. They were intimidating and much more powerful than the humans. A nemesis is only worthy if it is far more powerful than the protagonists. Big tick! And I'm happy we didn't get to know why they did what they did. There is always room for enigma in these films. No need to answer all questions. Give us something to think about.

The alien at the very end, I am guessing, is not a progenitor of the Xenomorphs as we saw in the 'Alien' films, but a different form of genetic/biological weapon as created by the Space Jockeys.

I thought the technology was very believable and at times so creative, it left me smiling at what i was watching.

Maybe they could have used an old actor instead of Guy Pearce, as the only time we saw him young, was in promotion videos for the film. Maybe he will come back in the next films? Maybe as Weyland Progeny, or maybe as a robot?

I love that the Alien universe is being explored in this imaginative and different way. I look forward to any further episodes. I just wish they had come along before Aliens vs Predator: Requiem gave a kidney punch to the whole operation. Totally inconsistent - acid for blood only when it suited the film-maker and so on...

Go watch and enjoy!","8"
"karianne-myrdal","Disappointing","24 June 2012","Let me start by saying that this is not a bad movie. The production value is good, and visually it's completely stunning. The problem is the story. First, it can be very difficult to understand for people who are not familiar with the Alien-franchise. It contains a lot of scenes and references that won't make sense if you haven't seen the previous films. Seeing as this is supposed to be a prequel to a movie made in 1979 (and frankly, you have to be a genuine fan of Alien to know this), they really should keep in mind that the movie would attract a new audience.

Second, Promotheus contains a lot of scenes i find kinda unmotivated. Like the opening scene, where one of the ""engineers"" drink their own poison. The scene was great and all, but WHY? And the zombie-thing? I mean, wtf was that all about? Once again, I feel like a lot of scenes were added just to satisfy the Alien-fans. Ridley Scott didn't HAVE to knock up Noomi Rapace with a giant facehugger.

Thirdly, the plot crashed a little with the feeling of the film. I think that if they first went for the whole Alien-thing they should also have kept the feeling. One of my favorite things from Alien is the quiet scenes and slow cutting between the scenes. This is a thing that really enhances the loneliness and helplessness in the film. Sadly, it seems that Scott has decided to go completely for what the mainstream audience wants, and decided to make movie filled with action and explosions.

To finish off, I want to say that I do not think this is a shitty movie. I don't think I wasted any time or money watching this and, as a big fan of both Ridley Scott and Alien, I quite enjoyed all the references. But overall, it was a little disappointing.","5"
"notoriousgrk","Very good trailer! I would like to have my $20 back now Mr Ridley","15 June 2013","Set in a futuristic setting scientists take up what they call an invitation found in a cave drawing which appears to be of the stone age type. Just before this aliens landed on Earth and some kind of ritual takes place were the alien disintegrates and supposedly becomes the progenitor of humanity. After arriving on LV 223 an atmospheric moon orbiting a Saturn like planet, the film apparently focuses on a black goo, the aliens who look like the one at the start and what the compound they explored, which contained the goo and the aliens, might be.

The way the film unfolded like a half-decent horror film and it showed that it depended on those horror like moments to get the audience to feel a jolt or two. Another aspect that this film relied on to make something out of it was the CGI. Other than that it was quite disengaging and while watching it in the cinema I was more focused on whether I'm sitting well enough in my seat so at least if I daydream or sleep I can do so with ease.

The dialogue in this film was quite ordinary and bland, the main character (the woman scientist)was more impassioned and made the film more watchable and that maybe it could get much better, it did not. It was that way for mostly most of the film.

This movie was presented as one of those movies were we are to make the meaning out of it and that those unintelligible and unimportant moments in the film were made for that. This message was particularly pushed by the news and TV movie reviewers as a great film and that Ridley has done it again. And that controversy is the key to a great movie. Well, people who watched it know its a big lie, at best its a deliberate misconception.

The fanboy-ism of this film was the most unattractive and distasteful of 2012 for movies. Essentially the fanboys made up the meaning from that excuse of a movie in such a way that they made a great deal out of something negligible. In other words they made their own movie in their mind and just because it was their own then others must accept that its a great movie. Other fanboys tried using this film as measure of their own 'better intelligence' since they like it while others do not.

This film is not a film, it is a 124 minute brand. A brand deals with perceiving, imaging and consuming. Prometheus was made with inadequate decency and relied on horror film clichés and high tech graphics to get people to buy tickets and later on DVDs with director's cut . It presents form over substance to appeal to brand conscious consumers, were the makers put in minimal effort and expect the others make the rest of the film for them in their minds, for a price! This tends to happen with some clothing brands for instance were a cotton shirt is significantly overpriced because it has a brand symbol. And for certain consumers this is good enough and its of high quality due to the price they have to pay. Its funny since those types of shirts are maybe just 30%-40% better than a more reasonably priced shirt and maybe =>150% the price.

As mentioned before this is Prometheus. This, in my opinion, is not a movie that can be appreciated as it is. If people like a deeper plot, Anime is by far the better alternative to Prometheus. Anime like Neon Genesis Evangelion and Ghost in the Shell, for starters, can be appreciated as they are and with a deeper plot to make meaning out of it if one chooses to do so.","1"
"deastman_uk","The roof is on fire","7 June 2012","It is the nature of a small independent film that there will be occasional problems with lighting, sound quality, continuity and sometimes editing. If the film is strong, small issues will not derail it.

But this much anticipated film with a high budget is wholly upended by a poor script, odd plotting and some desperate clichés. What I don't understand with a film of this magnitude and inheritance is how so many basics go awry.

There is a basic feeling of chaos, as if Mike Leigh has refused to tell the characters what their motivations are. There is some unsettled acting, but the root cause is the script. The screenplay often looks like a bad school performance. Crew on a trillion dollar mission just mill about. The aliens would embarrass Men in Black.

The bits of plot nonsense are inescapable and kill the film a a spectacle:

A geologist, who has provided mapping tools gets lost in a one level cave. - Two characters run away from a massive rolling wheel in the same line that it is rolling - The ships captain, suddenly ignores protocol and open the door to a zombie. - Seconds after major abdominal surgery, our hero runs about like a spring lamb.

"Thomas-Giffin","A great film!","11 June 2012","I'd been looking forward to Prometheus for as long as I'd been hearing news about Ridley Scott's return to science fiction films and any film set in the Alien universe is a celestial chorus to my ears. The marketing campaign was very well constructed and layered and apart from the one trailer where you thought you were sold the whole story, very solid.

Then the film was released, some said it was great science fiction, beautifully designed and directed, others said it was confusing, needlessly pompous and slow.

I finally got around to watching the film and I was utterly entertained.

I have to admit first that the film is no where near as scary as Alien, nor as intense and action filled as Aliens. However, that being said, I found it a gripping, intelligent and epic science fiction film that benefited hugely from Ridley Scott's calculated direction and a well picked cast that really do work well. Noomi Rapace is oddly un-Ripley-like (now a word) until the last act starts to play out, she's much more warm and inviting as a character. A frankly gender warped twist on the classic chestburster scene and she begins to become a fighter. The other cast, Idris Elba, Charlize Theron, Benedict Wong and Logan Marshall-Green all are a lot deeper than initially are characterised early on. However, it is left to my man-crush Michael Fassbender to show the world what a good actor is, his android David is a tour de force of physical performance and understated creepiness, not enough to be menacing or evil but he freaked me out in several spaces.

The plot is epic stuff but it does require a level of concentration and imagination to fill in the unanswered questions in the vein of many great science fiction films. It's not as clever a plot as you may have heard but you develop your own theories and ideas (or latch onto ones that fit better than your own) about what goes on. The only disappointment with the plot was really that it doesn't end as far towards the start of Alien as I was expecting, certainly the bit image from Alien I was hoping the film would replicate remained not shown.

Certainly the film looks great, the sets, CGI and technology all look great have this retro- fitted vibe from the Alien series where it looks usable and durable but not pretty or stylish for its own sake. There is more than enough gruesome bits too, not too often but when they do happen, you're aware of them. Again, there is no sheer outright terror like there is in Alien (Dallas in the ducts anyone?) but it had me at the edge of my seat several times.

However, the thrill of watching Naomi Race, Charlize Theron, Michael Fassbender, and Idris Elba outweigh the risks.

There is no doubt that the visuals in this film are amazing. It is a beautiful film and a real pleasure to watch. Of course, that is an easy statement to make as the visuals did receive an Oscar nomination. I thought the soundtrack was also very good.

Michael Fassbender, who played David was amazing, and probably deserved greater recognition for his performance. It's the best I have seen him since he played Bobby Sands in Hunger.

Naomi Rapace was also very good. I am slightly prejudices as I have seen her several times in the Millennium trilogy. I never tire of that movie - the whole thing at once. The ""operation"" was stunning.

Where is this going to go? Is there a sequel? It screams for one, but I am satisfied with the film as it was.","7"
"jtindahouse","An enjoyable experience","8 March 2017","I'm not the biggest sci-fi fan, but with 'Alien: Covenant' not far away I thought I better take the time to check out 'Prometheus' and familiarise myself with the prequel series. I wasn't quite sure what to expect going in. I knew there was a lot of controversy, debate and divided opinions surrounding it. I had heard it described as both confusing and ambiguous. I happen to like confusing and ambiguous films because they leave a lot of fun to be had after the movie discovering people's theories and opinions.

The product I discovered however wasn't really either of those things - at least not to me. I followed the story pretty easily and the things that were left up in the air really didn't bother me. I was happy to wait and see whether they were covered in either of the two planned sequels. I did quite enjoy the film though I have to say. Firstly, the characters were all terrific. There was tremendous diversity in the cast and every character worked and played off each other perfectly. Secondly, I found the story and the action scenes really interesting. I believed in the characters motives and that drove the plot ideally.

I generally think that if I can enjoy a sci-fi film, then it must be good, because there are very few out there that I do like. 'Prometheus' was one of them. In fact it has me quite excited for the next two editions in the planned trilogy. I just hope there isn't a 5 year wait between the second and third ones too.","7"
"kytetiger","Thanks Mr Scott","31 May 2012","What can I add to all the other reviews here next to mine?

I'll just sum the goods and bads:

+Good use of the 3D, where the holograms and dust float in front and behind characters, coupled with a solid and beautiful design. the camera is steady, with a clean picture. +Outstanding performance from Fassbender who steals the movie. He got the little changing expressions that makes you believe. Theron and Rapace are interesting in their roles and sometime give good plays. +Sound and music transports you. +new approach for explaining the Alien and the origins (see below) +Ridley just re-appropriating his own product and

-just transcend all the alien franchise's mythology by taking a new kind of opposite angle -A lot of characters lack depth. - I still question some of the Hollywood necessary influence in some part of practicality in some places (the volume inside the ship, uses of light inside the helmet, some texts, ideas) -a certain turning plot that is questionable and just lack the appropriate response. -Science level equals a 12 year old kid's knowledge.

This is my explanation for the evolution of the Alien:

The black liquid is a weapon of mass destruction that destroys a subject (black marks, cells explodes) but can recreate afterward a new species depending on the host. This means that the Alien we are used to know (2 arms, 2 legs, etc)exists only because the black liquid has infected a Human DNA. If the black liquid infects a worm, the ""alien"" would be some kind of worm. If it infects some furry ball animal, the ""alien"" would be some hairy furry alien...?! ***End of Spoiler***","7"

"intern-88","Prometheus: in space, old habits die hard","20 June 2012","It's no great insight to say that Hollywood seems to have run out of new ideas, but recently this has become embarrassingly evident.

The past few years have seen a relentless succession of high-profile remakes and sequels. In a changing marketplace, in which big media companies continually refuse to adapt, film studios seem to have become increasingly reliant on the Sure Thing. The trouble is that as much as we may despise such shameless regurgitations, they tend to make an awful amount of money. The 2010 remake of Desmond Davis' 1981 fantasy classic, Clash of the Titans, was critically panned but made almost $500million at the box office; Men In Black 3 may have you craving to have your memory wiped by a secret agent, but has already brought in a cool $300million in its first few weeks.

However, while this increasingly unimaginative atmosphere has produced a fair amount of tripe, certain genres seem to be able to provide the potential for quality as well as commercial viability. Alongside the irrepressible comic-book adaptations, science fiction has once again thrived with such prequels as JJ Abrams' Star Trek and Rupert Wyatt's Rise of the Planet of the Apes being greeted with critical acclaim as well as financial success.

So it seems that a well-conceived science-fiction universe can provide ample fodder for worthwhile blockbusters. However, given the Alien franchise's steady decline over the past few years, Prometheus seemed to have its work cut out for it.

Directed by blockbuster powerhouse Ridley Scott, Alien (1979) was a masterstroke of conceptual simplicity and stylish execution. The crew of a cargo ship unwittingly bring a beastly, man-eating alien on board and it picks them off, one by one, in a claustrophobic and spine-tingling couple of hours that quickly cemented itself in the Hollywood pantheon. Unfortunately, its brilliant simplicity also made it readily replicable. Aside from James Cameron's decent 1986 follow-up, Aliens, the same blueprint was marched out for a further two abysmal sequels. The 2000s saw the eponymous creature rear its ugly head twice more in the crossover catastrophes that were Alien vs. Predator and Alien vs. Predator: Requiem, which turned in a considerable profit margin despite being excruciatingly naff.

It is with a certain trepidation that Scott has returned to the fold to direct this latest outing. Eager to distance himself from the franchise's formulaic trappings, and in lieu of making a direct prequel, Scott instead decides to focus on one unexplained aspect from Alien and expand it into a very different kind of story. In the 1979 original, the malevolent creature is brought on board the cargo ship, Nostromo, when the crew discover alien eggs in a crashed spaceship. As they explore the wreck, they also find the remains of a giant, fossilised creature, which sits in the ship's cockpit. Scott has said that the enigmatic 'space jockey', as it became known, has always bugged him, and this film sets out to explore its origin, setting a new group of characters on a distinctly more philosophical journey, which may hold the key to the meaning of human existence.

The year is 2089 and archaeologists Elizabeth Shaw (Noomi Rapace) and Charlie Holloway (Logan Marshall-Green) discover a celestial map left by humanity's alien forbears in the ancient cave paintings of Earth. They are commissioned to lead a scientific expedition to follow the path the paintings lay out, taking them to a remote and desolate moon where they find the ruins of an ancient civilisation. Initially, Prometheus feels encouragingly different from the rest of the series. The journey the ship Prometheus takes is set up as a voyage of discovery rather than a voyage of the damned and, with stunning visual effects, Scott begins to craft a tantalising new world in the distant reaches of the Alien universe.

Unfortunately, it isn't long before Scott begins falling into old habits. As they explore the ruins, the crew find more than they bargained for and unleash the wrath of the race they hoped would enlighten them. Thus, the film realigns itself with the very moulds it set out to break and Rapace, taking her lead from Sigourney Weaver's Ripley in the original series, is left to run around in blood-stained overalls, narrowly escaping the fate of her shipmates, who are all killed off in a range of rather unpleasant ways.

The script then descends into a series of clanging nods to the original, with several scenes almost completely mirroring the most iconic moments of Alien. As it reaches its end, the film hastily returns to the philosophical questions it first posed, yet with so much time taken up in reliving former glories, this only serves to underline how quickly the film drifted away from what was supposed to set it apart.

Recognising that a direct prequel would only lead him into all-too- familiar territory, Scott sidelines the iconic extra-terrestrial in order to tell a more human and complex story. Yet, in its almost compulsive backsliding into the Alien formula, Prometheus is little more than a tame rehash, whose only merit will be making an obscene amount of money.","6"

In fact no it was one of the worst experiences of my life. i would rather spend nine pounds on a knife to stab myself with then watch that film again.

"houghtonetet","A magnificent mess","9 June 2012","Ridley Scott's sci-fi CV is up with the best of them so I had high hopes for this prequel to the Alien franchise, (of which his film is by far and away the best). Oh dear, what a disappointment - a series of astonishing and fabulous special effects masterpieces were offset by an incoherent plot, weak acting and more plot holes than a Swiss cheese.

On the negative side: I suppose it would appear picky to take the film apart too much and dive too deeply into the detail, it is only fiction after all and everyone watching it is supposed to be enjoying themselves! But I did find some things stretching credulity...a mission briefing given on arrival rather than on embarkation...no trained security taken on an expedition costing a trillion dollars intending to encounter aliens of unknown military potential...DIY abdominal surgery held together with paperclips and with the patient running full tilt within minutes...a race of super-intelligent creatures whose first reaction to a polite question is to pull the questioner's head off (perhaps it might have been an idea to subtitle David's question so we knew what he said?)...quarantine regulations enforced by open doors and flamethrowers...

The list goes on.

The plot offered no explanation (that I could see) as to why the Engineers wanted us dead, or why they brought life to the dead Earth in the first place. Where did the Captain get his reasoning from that LV223 was a military installation? What was the purpose of the giant head and the green stone? Why was no one left on the bridge to watch over Milburn and Fifield when they were lost within the dome structure? I don't know.

On the positive side: It would be fair to say that the SFX were jaw-dropping. I thought the opening shots of the primeval Earth and of Prometheus's arrival at LV223 were breathtaking. I liked Fifield's map-making droids and the Galactic Map in the centre of the alien ship. The various grisly creatures featured were very well-conceived and the Engineers themselves were impressive.

A pity that the best acting came from someone playing a synthetic human. Such a shame that the film left more questions than when it started, although at least we now know that the aliens of the franchise are biological weapons. I hope Dr Shaw's further adventures are more coherent.

My son and I saw Dark Star on DVD the previous night. Frankly, we enjoyed that more.

"DanLives1980","Ignore the haters! New age in sci-fi horror, same old atmospheric terror!","15 March 2013","First and foremost, when you intend to see Prometheus, what do you expect? This is a prequel to the greatest science fiction horror franchise of all time; picked up by its original writers, producers and director and given a new spin to include the new generations. And if something is going to be continued/rebooted then why not at the hands of the people that gave it you to begin with? Prometheus is an origin tale that deals with the discovery of the alien Engineers that created the Xenomorph (the creatures of the Aliens movies) and the horror that naturally ensues. Simple? No, it is much more than that. In true Ridley Scott fashion, everything is richly multi-layered, the film has an intelligent culture all of its own, it has a broad multi-narrative provided by a vast array of characters and despite the fact that the prequel is now way more advanced than the sequel in terms of technology inside and outside of this fictional universe, it has the exact same atmosphere I remember feeling while watching Alien as a kid.

Prometheus cleverly puts the more famous character actors in the background and gives prime time to the lesser familiar faces (Noomi Rapace and Logan Marshall-Green) in order to establish the story and then the brutal and sometimes gutwrenching horror.

But what it also does most cleverly is take its sweet ol' time getting to the meat beneath the surface. The story telling is fantastic, the setting is dark and heavy despite there being a lot of daylight and the horror delivers a whole lot more than I expected. But you need to know that, as Ridley Scott is a master of suspense, this means that the stuff you want to see this film for does not come full on, yet escalates just slowly enough at times to make your skin crawl.

By the end of Prometheus, if you are not satisfied that you have just seen a true first class sci-fi horror worthy of the original, you've just joined the growing legions of the 'nothing-is-ever-good-enough-for-me' undead! Sci-fi, horror, huge story, subtexts, sub-plots and huge lashings of originality; what's not to like?","10"
"Loguey","If you like a plot holed piece of disappointing nonsense, then this is the film for you...","19 June 2012","So, the long awaited Prometheus has finally hit the big screens for all those Alien and Scott fans. I myself could not wait to see this, here it is, I'm excited, and ready to see what Ridley has to deliver.

Well, it certainly did not deliver. As an Alien fan myself, I went into the cinema with a clear head and talked myself out of thinking about the first two films. Never have I been more disappointed. I don't quite know what Mr Scott was up to whilst writing this piece of nonsense but he certainly wasn't thinking about the casting of characters, the music, the story or the dialogue.

The opening of the film was a little confusing but hey, that's what happens in films, you start off not really knowing what is going on but it's okay, because this usually becomes explained throughout the film, doesn't it? apparently not. Prometheus is not intelligent, it's fast paced, and the characters are so unbelievably stupid you've got to wonder why they were chosen to go on this trillion dollar mission to a planet that may or may not have life form and that may or may not have created us humans.

It's utterly ridiculous in many ways. You know when you were a kid and it's a Sunday night and you've just remembered that you have some homework that needs to be given in first thing Monday morning? You rush, writing and writing, not even thinking about what you are putting down on that paper, you finish, don't read it, say 'that'll do' and hand it in. Well Scott is that kid and I am the teacher marking his piece of paper with a big, disappointing F.

Just to warn you, there will be a sequel to the prequel. Hang your camera up Ridley, you'll be doing everyone a favour.","1"
"TheFilmGuy1","A Great Sci-fi World That Builds Up A Universe","5 January 2015","As somebody who has seen Alien and Aliens, and liked them but wasn't crazy about them, I can say that I actually think Prometheus was pretty good. It got a lot of hate from Alien series fans, but I don't see why. Is it because it's only loosely related to the franchise? Who knows. All I can say is that it's a good sci-fi film.

In theory, it's kind of the same story we have seen in not only other sci-fi films, but the other Alien films. That being said, the way it's executed in Prometheus works. It adds it's own flair to already existing ideas in the sci-fi genre. I also found the plot and it's themes to be quite clear, where as I have heard a lot of people complain that it makes no sense. I really don't understand that complaint. Yeah, not EVERYTHING is explained, but it doesn't need to be. The main ideas were explained, and that's whats important. It's also heavy on themes of faith and creation, and I liked the way it explored these themes. I also must say I really loved the very last scene that connects it to Alien. I won't spoil it, but it's really awesome to see.

I do hope there is some kind of sequel or continuation. It builds on the world of the Alien franchise, and I find it fascinating. I personally can sometimes find the lore of a sci-fi film or series to be too much, but I really like what they were going for here, and want to see more.","8"
"jkbonner1","Great Expectations","5 October 2012","Three stars out of ten

I read a review of this movie in a national mag I subscribe to and the mag gave it a good review (three stars out of four). I was looking forward to it since I like sci-fi movies and haven't seen a good one in a long time. Good point: Nice special effects which looked convincing. Met my expectations.

Problems with the movie: 1) Granted it's sci-fi, still the movie implies, in direct contradiction to modern biology, that human beings, aka Homo sapiens, had a special extraterrestrial origin. Even a biologist in the movie scoffs at this idea, but he's finished off early in the movie along with an anti-social geologist. I didn't see the need to take this position except to appeal to religious types who do believe this (hey, they think Earth was created about 6,000 years ago too).

2) Then there's the thinly veiled philosophical issue: Where did we (aka H. sapiens) really come from if we somehow sprang up from somewhere else? At the movie's beginning two archaeologists (Rapace and Logan Marshall-Green) discover remarkable cave paintings, carvings on steles, etc. from many ancient civilizations pointing to a particular constellation. The two archaeologists conclude the planet where we, the human race, supposedly originated is to be found in this constellation. After this they're on a quest to discover our origins.

Financed by a private corporation (Theron plays the CEO's daughter) a team of scientists, including the two archaeologists, go off to this mysterious planet. Does the team learn where we really come from? Nope. They find evidence that an earlier group of ""men"" reached the planet about 2,000 years before. Except for one ""man"", the entire crew of these predecessors were all killed off in some mysterious way. A sample of the one of the dead ""men's"" DNA is taken by the team, and an exact match is found of their DNA to our own. Conclusion: these guys were our forebears.

But these guys were arming a spacecraft with WMDs and ready to fly off to Earth to destroy humanity (their descendants). Why? That becomes the BIG question, presumably to be resolved in a sequel. This one guy left who wasn't killed off 2,000 years ago goes berserk and kills a whole bunch of the team, including ripping David's (Michael Fassbender) head off. This doesn't kill David although it's a real inconvenience to be left with only a head but no body. But he's an android after all―think of the android in Alien.

Apparently the guy, our forebear, didn't think highly of what humanity has turned into. Given how buff and tall he was, maybe he thought we'd all turned into a bunch of weak wimps that deserved death. The forebear-guy dies by being crushed by a creature resembling a giant squid (wasn't clear to me where it came from), but not before being implanted with an egg by this creature. However, the offspring that comes ripping out of his body looks like ... again, think of Alien.

Hence no way to ask the forebear-guy: Where the heck did you come from? since he's dead. Taking that all the way back, one could presumably trace our lineage back to ""the big guy in the sky"", or anywhere else you'd like it to be. The movie ends with one of the archaeologists (Rapace, the Marshall-Green character dies from a mysterious disease) setting to depart on a journey to discover where we ultimately come from. The answer presumably to be resolved in a sequel.

3) Okay so the director was Ridley Scott who created Alien. And this movie was intended to be a prequel. So what? Still the Alien thing was way overdone. Too many people also. Who were they? The crew in Alien was a much more compact number. This movie could have been more outstanding since it did have an auspicious beginning. It desperately cried out for a better script and better character development. It also needed more emphasis on science and a lot less on religion. Science itself is awe-inspiring enough. At least for those who know what it's really all about.

4) Finally the acting. The term ""wooden"" comes to mind. This is most probably due to the overcooked and vapid script. Someone reviewing this movie said he just couldn't get into the characters. Ditto for me. The only one who did a halfway decent job was Fassbender, but he had more to do in the movie than most of the others. Charlize Theron, whom I normally like, came across as a bloodless robot. Maybe she was the robot and Fassbender wasn't. Whatever. This movie seriously needed a Ripley and Noomi Rapace wasn't the gal.

End result: Big disappointment. To paraphrase Groucho Marx: I've seen good sci-fi, but this wasn't it.","3"
"Snabeldyhr","Not as good as I hoped for, but not as bad as I feared.","1 June 2012","Just came back from watching it a little while ago.

Could it live up to what we hoped for? No Was it as good as we could hope for/expected of it? Yeah, think so. So, no, it's not perfect, but I kinda liked it anyway.

The story? - clearly a lot of thought has gone into making it and it does make sense...mostly. Unfortunately is has the same thing that most horror movies also do - people doing something VERY stupid ...that doesn't make ANY sense - other than advance the plot and f00king things up even more for the characters ...and doesn't even bother to TRY to explain WHY. Unfortunatey it can't rise above that very basic stupidity and that's too bad. I'd hoped for more.

But a lot of things works really well too. Despite a few scenes that really rubbed me the wrong way for being a little too familiar compared to scenes from earlier installments - I like how it meshes really well with the already established universe. Mythology established in Alien 3 are here, and built upon, while setting up its own stuff...and even something that establishes something major from Aliens are set up here as well.

...and leaving it wide open for a sequel, naturally...which I hope we get. :-)

However, overall it suffers from being almost too slick. Like too many other ""big movies"" it has, what I call, a ""hyper-optimised"" script. It's predictable, unrelenting in its forward storytelling momentum, and nothing is there by chance - everything matters and the time of red herrings and ""fun little things"" are a thing of the past. We don't get ""small insignificant things"" anymore - only big plot holes that are unexplained and too big to ignore.

Visually it's stunning though. Nothing effects-wise to complain about.

Some negative stuff there, but how could I not mention it. But I loved it and I'm looking forward to seeing it again (and again). I won't splash out extra on 3D the next time, though. The 3D, while good, is in no way needed for anything and although it may add depth to the world, you won't lose anything by only watching it in 2D.","7"
"SoutheastUK","What were they thinking?!","1 November 2012","Initially dreading ""Yet another Aliens movie"", I watched it anyway and was nicely surprised at the idea of humans travelling through space to meet their gods....and then I realised that what I was watching was actually quite dreadful.

I can honestly say that apart from one short visual sequence involving one of the ""gods"", the rest of the movie left me cold. I was under the - obviously - mistaken impression that Hollywood had learnt that effects - however well done - simply cannot make up for a lacklustre storyline.

As a standalone story, the ""humans flying through space to meet their gods"" would have worked. The absolutely clumsy way in which they merge the aliens angle actually made me cringe and my respect for Ridley Scott has definitely taken a tumble as a result.

I have not been this disappointed and shocked since I started posting on whylostsucks.com a few years back. Picking out the holes and laughing at the poor writing in that farce of a show. Questions, questions - no answers. All types of things happening, all unrelated to the story, stupid ending... All the same crap I had to put up with watching LOST, only to see what is was all about in the end - nothing.

I saw the original Alien in a theater back in the day, and I like it now as much as I did then. Amazingly realistic characters, setting, pacing, everything. Brilliant to this day.

Where was Ridley Scott in this silly escapade? Did he go senile?

This POS is positively ridiculous, for example:

The scientists do not act or look like scientists. They did not know each other or know why they were on a Trillion dollar mission until they arrived on a strange planet? They all show absolutely no training for a space mission. The ship's Captain was more like a hip recording studio type of guy. Cartoons have better characters.


Part of the crew was like Star Trek where you just see them walking around until they die.


They approach a new, uncharted planet and fly right to the landing strip.


And then the helmet thing... Anyone see the ending of ""Mission to Mars""? SAME SCENE! ""There is air in here, I'm going to take my helmet off - No don't!"" Oh jeez...


The big head, hieroglyphs - what does it all mean? More questions... Doesn't matter (Lost type stuff) as the story is unintelligible and Lindellof doesn't answer questions anyway. He just spikes the scenes with a lot of irrelevant clues to drive people crazy trying to figure it all out, but there will be no answers in the end - just more questions.


I knew almost the entire movie from the trailers anyway. The beginning, middle and end. Just some details of little importance were missing. Low-class marketing.

"jaypesci","Genuinely cr*p. Burn every copy.","6 July 2012","WARNING - CONTAINS SPOILERS (NOT THAT YOU CAN SPOIL THIS MOVIE MUCH MORE THAN RIDLEY ALREADY HAS)

I've just finished watching Prometheus, and I'm struggling to find the words that would adequately describe this utter train wreck of a movie. To be totally frank, I refuse to believe that this is a Ridley Scott movie. I genuinely suspect that Fox is lying to us.

The script appears to have been written on the back of a matchbox by someone with the mentality of a nine-year-old. I'm 35 years old, and I was a child myself the last time a movie insulted my intelligence as much as this one did. If this movie was canned meat, I wouldn't feed it to my dog.

For the love of God, Do NOT let this awful, awful mistake of a movie burn itself into your neural pathways, as this would be a form of brain damage that could never be undone. It's like finding out your wife is cheating on you, or that you are the offspring of a mongol. Some things you just don't ever want to know.

The movie opens with the premise that ancient cave paintings depict a star system that is claimed by the movie's main character to be home to the creators of the human race. How this is deduced from caveman scrawlings is never explained, except for the main character saying that she chooses to believe it, which is, let's face it, just plain retarded.

Based on this flawed premise, the Weyland corporation decides to spend a trillion dollars funding a mission to find this alleged star system after taking this theory at face value without question.

So, the corporation hand-picks the most unprofessional professionals they can find for the mission, and put them all into hypersleep without introducing them to each other so that they wake up 2 years later orbiting a distant planet surrounded by people they've never met, and within a few hours of waking up, they descend to the planet's surface to explore a ""pyramid"" that looks nothing like a pyramid, which they just happened to find within moments of entering the planet's atmosphere.

As luck would have it, the main character was indeed correct in her assumption that this far-off world is inhabited by intelligent creatures that are indeed the creators of the human race. This is apparently proved by examining the DNA of a severed alien head, which, when compared to human DNA, proves to be identical (the aliens come back to life and explode shortly after when they are electrocuted, by the way).

Once inside the ""pyramid"", everyone takes off their spacesuit helmets, potentially contaminating themselves and their environment before returning to their ship. The captain allows them on board without question, and no decontamination procedures whatsoever are followed, and nobody complains about this.

Apparently, the act of entering the pyramid seems to have set off some kind of response mechanism that makes the cylindrical pedestals inside ooze some kind of black liquid. For no apparent reason, the synthetic human that accompanies our retarded explorers decides to secretly take a sample of this stuff back to the ship and spike one of the crew members drinks with it. Later on, the crew member has sex with the main character, and 10 hours later she is 3 months pregnant, even though she claimed earlier in the movie that she can't get pregnant.

The guy she has sex with, after leaving the ship and falling ill from swallowing the black ooze, comes back to the ship and is refused on board, due to the fear of contamination, despite the fact that the whole crew has already been exposed to the alien atmosphere and has been coming and going from the ship at will.

The main character ends up in the medical bay, where the synthetic human tells her that her foetus is a strange alien squid, and tries to convince her that she should be put into hypersleep for the return trip to Earth. Naturally, she disagrees, and attempts an abortion by using a medical machine that is tailored for males only.

As luck would have it, the operation performed by this machine is a resounding success.

Do you really think that we will be wearing skinny jeans and platform clogs in 2094 when we are zooming through space and visiting unknown planets? There were some scenes that were supposed to be intensely serious and I burst out laughing at their absurdity. I kept waiting for the phallus-like creatures to start tap dancing on the table, or the last living engineer to say ""Rosebud.""

There were only 2 redeeming parts of this movie: The opening scenes were like watching an IMax opening, and the acting of Michael Fassbender was superb. I give him 10 stars. I want my money and two hours of my life back!","1"
"kinwingwu","an exploration into nothing new or original and Lacks the Documentary style of Alien","19 June 2012","Ridley had no where to go after pioneering two of the most original science fiction masterpieces in modern cinema.... The claustrophobia gritty 'Alien' and retro film noir 'BladeRunner'!

Influenced into SciFi genre after watching George Lucas's 1977 Star Wars which brought back the lost cinema art of special effects.

So Prometheous is nothing new and feels just like L. Ron Hubbard's 'Battlefield Earth' Scientology inventor that believes Humans are spawned from Extraterrestrial life

Ridley Scott is just stagnant on delivering anything new on the SciFi Genre and projected onto the cinema screen nothing but short of mundane science fiction which teaches bad, inaccurate Science about space travel and human biology.","5"
"randomemail-483-536372","Ridley has lost the plot... seems that literally!","22 September 2012","Prometheus having a score of 7.4 (at the time of writing) is nothing short of amazing. All these comments how this is the ""masterpiece"" or ""best movie ever made"" could only be written by PR people on the studio paycheck because you have to be really retarded to find this movie anywhere near good.

This movie sucked big time. After 1 minute into the movie I already had a feeling that this is not going to be good. After 10 minutes it was obvious. And after 20 minutes I was dying of boredom and wanted to scream please turn this off and let's go home.

The writing and acting quality is reminiscent of the obscure c-category movies of the 60's and 70's. None of the story makes any sense. It just jumps from one random scene to another without leading to anywhere. The acting is hilariously substandard. Even the Fassbinder, who is a handsome guy otherwise, is very bland and uninspiring.

The story is just plain stupid and full of mistakes. A lot has been pointed out here by others already, but some examples. None of the ""science"" part resembles in any way any science. Even random people would have a more believable approach to scientific procedures than scientist in this film. Most of the actions of characters seem to have no motive or logic at all, and everybody behaves completely unbelievably. For example, the angry geologist just starts screaming at the heroine just completely randomly, then wonders away with another guy to get lost in a straight tunnel. Then they freak out because someone else might be there to be petting a hideous looking alien snake at the next scene. Most of the events and actions in this movie happen just completely randomly and without having any point in the big picture. The side story lines lead nowhere and add nothing to the characters or story. The story is full of plot holes, inconsistencies, stupidity, etc.

The dialog is exceptionally dumb. There are cases where writer has tried to be philosophical about the problems of religion and science, but everything is reduced to stupid one-liners. It is totally annoying and embarrassing. At some points the movie turns into blatant creationist propaganda.

At no point in the movie is there any suspense, tension or excitement. All scenes that are supposed to induce any of that do not work. Some of them are rehearsal from original Alien but only in a farcical manner. Others are ruined by completely because you just can't believe that anyone would do anything so dumb. Others just do not make any sense at all and just seem to be thrown in as an afterthought.

Prometheus is a very big disappointment. Its writing is just very very bad, as is all the acting in it. Even the imagery is pretty average Hollywood stuff and lacks any originality.

Obviously most of the budget was spent on pre-release marketing and there were no money left for hiring a able screenwriter or decent actors. A primary school child would have done a better job for tenner.","1"
"richard-2227","Terrific!","6 June 2012","I don't know why everyone hates this movie!

I had the same response to this as Avatar: that some gifted artists had worked incredibly hard on a terrific piece of storytelling. It's big, utterly consuming, terrifying, well cast and fun at times. It uses modern cues to create a spellbinding vision--there is certainly beauty amongst the mayhem.

The movie got derailed somewhat in that they set out to find the gods and end up fighting for their lives. When they finally meet their maker, he displays no interest in them--which was a let down.

The intent is recovered at the end as they disappear in search of more adventure. But the heroine confuses ""God"" with ""alien races"". And that hints at more carnage to come if they make a sequel.

P.S. Fassbender is a freak and I look forward to more of his work!","10"
"magnus-norden","Incredibly bad movie","4 July 2012","I really looked forward to seeing this one, not least since I love Alien and Bladerunner. But where Alien is a great suspense movie, that doesn't get bogged down in irrelevant cosmology, Prometheus relishes in trivial ideas and is not the least bit exciting.

And where Bladerunner excelled in interesting twists, the narrative of Prometheus is so poor that almost nothing in the movie is believable, let alone thought provoking. Bladerunner was based on a Philip K. Dick novel, and that can only be a good thing. Whatever the script for Prometheus was based on, it certainly wasn't good.

And where both Alien and Bladerunner are driven by superlative acting, the acting in Prometheus is, well - I don't know how to put this, but I really can't remember when I last saw a movie so completely devoid of plausible - or even remotely fascinating - characters as Prometheus.

But if you like surprises, go see it. I was extremely surprised to find out that Ridley Scott could actually make a movie this bad.","3"
"flyboy852","Beautiful imagery, but that's about it","6 June 2012","I have to give this movie a very low score because it was just bland. I also agree with stevelovell, the characters were flawed and really given very little room for development.

There were a lot of moments when I went WTF? Really? Where are we going with this? For instance, the character Meredith can be ignored. She didn't really serve any real purpose in the plot at all.

Don't take me wrong, the movie was still enjoyable. But I definitely would enjoy it more if it wasn't given all the attention and all the hype. It simply is a movie that doesn't deliver.

Overall, it's just not an exciting movie.","4"
"jimiuk","Average-to-poor","31 May 2012","This film was one of my two must-see films this year, along with The Dark Knight Rises. But having just seen Prometheus I feel I should deploy an emergency beacon to warn other humanoids about this very average film.

I have a lot of problems with this film, so I'll go through the negatives in a series of bullet points.

Negatives: -The story-line didn't know where the hell it was going AT ALL. This was the gravest sin of all in the film. Within 5 minutes of leaving the screening I came up with a number of scenes and set-pieces that had NO PURPOSE in pushing along the plot. Such as Guy Pearce reawakening and death, the male Doctor 'virus' and burning. The ending with the humanoid alien was pretty annoying too. When you watch a film you want to at least feel like you've got a grasp of the issues. You don't want some alien to just randomly awake and start tearing off heads.

-Character development and acting I didn't feel were that great either. Wassbender I liked (if a tad random), and Raspace but everyone else was pretty uninspired I'd say. Some of the decisions they made too didn't feel legitimate. They'd make leaps all over the place, 'What? Alien tears head off your buddies? They must obviously be going to wipe out mankind (and android said a riddle about this too). Let's go back and ram the ship into the alien ship.

-Ending and conclusion were awful. Guy Pearce gets awoken to get killed. Why is he in it at all then? Head ripping was all very, very random. The 'fly to the aliens home planet' ending was terrible too.

Positives -It did look nice.

I am disappointed by it but it still deserves a watch.","3"
"JoeB131","The Curse of Prequels","24 June 2012","is that knowing how we got to the point where we came in is never as interesting as we thought it would be.

Darth Vader and Hannibal Lector were made less interesting by their back stories, not more.

So we have these archaeologists who convince the Evil Company to fund their Trillion Dollar expedition to find this planet where the ""engineers"" lived. The Engineers are 9-foot tall humanoid giants who created mankind, apparently. But it wasn't their homeworld, it was just their bio-testing lab, and the Engineers decided humanity was some kind of mistake that they needed to eradicate. Since this happened 2000 years ago, it was not because they had seen an episode of ""Keeping up with the Kardashians."" So what you have here is an Alien Movie without the aliens. Not to mention a bunch of characters who do things that make not a lick of sense just to keep the action scenes going. (The Red Letter Media guys cover most of these pretty well.) Visually, it's a treat. Plot terms, it just takes the logical flaws from the Alien Movies and compounds them. (Seriously, you think at some point, Weyland-Yutani would lose their shirts...) The only nice thing is that it eliminates the Alien v. Predator movies from Canon, so there's that.","6"
"sammytinatree","Tonally all over the place","4 September 2021","This is absolutely not Ridley's best work; second time watching it after an unfavourable first viewing years ago, and my first impression is still holding true.

The film has no idea if it wants to be a sci-fi horror or a majestic film of discovery, and the tone lurches radically from scene to scene because of it. Throw in characters who are utterly inconsistent with their motives and make bewildering choices, and you've got a film that can absolutely be skipped.","3"
"randelcole-1","not worth your time or money","6 July 2012","With a fancy title and the noble intent to explore how life on earth was created, I was hoping for an intelligent summer movie. Unfortunately, this film is filled with plot and story holes, uninteresting wooden characters, average special effects and a story that has the simplicity worthy of only about ten minutes of screen time.

It is a shame that Hollywood continues to insult the intelligence of its audience. It reminds me of American car companies and how they thought that their cars would continue to sell even though Detroit quality fell behind the rest of the world.

While the filmmakers are laughing their way to the bank, they should be ashamed to have spent so much money on a film that is an embarrassment to their reputation. I want my time and money back.","1"
"jessecampfens","Go see this movie and make up your OWN mind.","8 June 2012","In an attempt to balance all the negative reviews, I decided to write my own review. This review has some very minor SPOILERS but I wrote it to convince you to go and see this movie.

I have no idea what's wrong with the people who call the movie and the plot stupid or simple. By reading the negative reviews you would almost presume the story is as brain dead as Battle: Los Angeles or something bad like that.

Let me start with saying that I enjoyed every minute of Prometheus and that the IMAX 3D quality was the best I've seen since Avatar, and I've seen (too) many 3D movies in between. I also had no problem with the acting whatsoever, it was all top notch if you ask me, Noomi Rapace was pretty good and Michael Fassbender should be nominated for an Oscar.

Yes, there are some questions left open at the end of the movie, but is that bad? Instead of cheap entertainment this movie actually raises some important questions and challenges YOU to think about it. Maybe the reason of the bad reviews is that people don't know how to think for themselves anymore, If someone asks them a question they Google the answer instead of thinking about it themselves. Now that's a troubling trend! With some intelligence its easy to notice all the layers and subtleties Prometheus has to offer under the surface. This movie is by no means shallow, it has deep questions to ponder.

Another reason of the bad reviews could be a psychological one, the movie revolves around a very disturbing but not impossible notion, namely the thesis that human life is engineered by extraterrestrials. This is a very confronting idea, that is beautifully mirrored in a conversation between David and Charlie at the pool table. Without being aware of it, some reviewers could be tormented by some deep religious roots (in a way we all have inherited some of those believes) The ideas in this movie could shake the very foundations of their believe system, which is sometimes causing an aggressively reaction when they are trying to keep those systems in place. Never forget that if the church had its way the earth would still be flat...

Believe me, there is far more ancient evidence for this than you'd possible believe. This idea doesn't come from a stupid ""Alien vs Predator"" movie, no you should delve into the works of Zecharia Sitchin who has dedicated 30 years of his life in a deep and thorough research of ancient clay tablets and artifacts describing and depicting these stories. And yes it very unsettling to throw 300 years (the movie plays almost a hundred years in the future) of Darwinism in to the garbage can as the biologist points out in the beginning of the movie. For me there couldn't be enough movies to address this question about our REAL history. It's sad that there is not more talk online about that very thesis, because that's what's this movie is all about!

I will go to see this beautiful movie again, for I know there are many interesting things to discover all along. The dialogue has many answers if you listen carefully, and if you're able to connect the dots, there are far less plot holes than everybody here tries to make you believe. Pay attention to David, for he says many revealing things about everything.

Enjoy!","9"
"tybar","Yup, it sucked!","17 September 2013","I'm not a scientist. However, based on the movie Prometheus I'm smarter than a scientist; at least the scientists that are portrayed in this movie. The mission to planet LV blah blah blah seemed like it was staffed by a bunch of drunk college students during spring break (Dude! I'm taking my helmet off! No way! Do it! Do it! YEAH!).

Not only did they not exercise any scientific protocols they basically blew common sense out of the air lock. This movie could not have been dumber if Scooby Doo, Shaggy and the rest of the mystery gang were on board. At least they would have had the common sense to run away from the MONSTER in the BLACK GOO!

And why was the alien dude so mad that he had to rip the android's head off? Couldn't he just like say ""Hi"" or ""Wow! Humans. OK. You're here and you're so grown up"". I guess I'd be p'd too if I were woken up by a bunch of idiots running around like high school flunkies pushing buttons and turning things on and screaming.

Another thing, I wish the Alien franchise would stop trying to re-invent Ripley. It seems that every Alien movie has to end with the heroine being the sole survivor of the party, running for her life and outwitting the maniacal killer alien only to kill it with a push of a button (See Alien, Aliens, this movie etc...).

Finally, Elizabeth hops aboard one of the alien ships and is going where? To their planet? What happens when she gets there? ""Hi everyone. I'm from planet Earth which is right over there in this star cluster. Yup, there's billions of us and now we have the technology to roam all over the galaxy. Yuk, yuk, yuk.""

"juraj-dorko","Lindelof was allowed to make another horrible mess","10 August 2012","Think about a porn movie. Do you enjoy it for its visual appearance? Hell, yes, absolutely. Is the plot well thought-through and coherent? No, doesn't have to be. The movie isn't made for hard-thinking audience. Do the characters behave like they would in real life? The farther from it, the better!!! Do they do stupid and nonsensical things? Well, since the story doesn't matter anyway, why shouldn't they. Do you feel connected with the characters? No need to. Do things happen for a reason? Well, if the reason is to visually please the eye of the audience and to move to another scene, then yes. Otherwise, no, not really. Are the jokes really funny? Oh come on, aren't we a little too demanding?

Prometheus is like a porn movie, except there's no porn in it. But when you watch a porn flick, you really don't expect much from it, like you do in the case of Prometheus. To ruin the legacy of the original Alien movie in such an atrocious way should be a mortal sin. This movie is exactly the shameful scam Lost turned out to be. David Lindelof should be hiding in sewage, forever feeling ashamed of what he did with Lost, not given chances to write scripts to eagerly-awaited films. Someone wrote in their review that they hoped David Lindelof's name would become toxic, and that they're looking forward to that day. I couldn't agree more.","1"
"aharmas","Dpn't Miss The Point. Look at the whole picture.","8 June 2012","Scott continues to make quality films and defy a direct association with a particular genre. He has tackled just about everything and proved himself one of the best film directors of this and the previous century. This film will be another of the jewels in his crown, a film that will most likely earn its share of detractors because they, either don't agree with the questions it raises or with the fact that it does require a bit of thinking. To be fair, it would be impossible to explore the theme subject matter in two or three hours. Most importantly, this is not just a science fiction/fantasy film. It, like most important science fiction landmarks, looks ahead and introduces ideas that will most likely be the genesis of important ideas and/or exposure to many to new concepts.

Before going on, it bothers me to see how people jump to embrace films that give us a ""concept"" and is never fleshed out, or a preposterous idea of something that is downright ludicrous but that is hidden behind excellent production values; yet it is clear that there no ""soul"" or real substance underneath. ""Prometheus"", on the other hand dares to pose the big question about our origins. It is not an original idea, but the screenwriters and Scott have revisited something that sits in the hearts of scientists and theologians who want to know the ""truth"".

In the film, the prologue can baffle a few people in the audience. Who is the ""humanoid"" and what happened to him and after his disappearance? Later on, as the crew finds its way into the other planet system, we are teased by the hieroglyphics which resemble writing we have seen before. Furthermore, the supposed DNA connection will rattle a few cages. This is fascinating material, and it looks like fiction now, but as science evolves and continues to explore the wonders in Nature, we must realize that the ideas are not so far-fetched. Still, the film is not a dissertation, but an entertaining exploration of themes that have been introduced before. At least, we are not dealing with a puzzling and frustrating monolith, a drug-induced trip into existential connections between the past and the present, or a trip into the dreams of a dreamer...

What we have is a tragedy of sorts, which originates from humans and androids interacting with a universe that is too dangerous and complex to understand. There is the spirit of rebellion against injustice, very well developed and played by Fasbender's David. We add our spirituality and its undeniable link to science, and as if this is not enough, the realization that to humans, just about anything else outside our bodies, is really ""alien"", and our bodies' immediate reaction involves prompt defense. It either vanquishes the invader and ensures our survival, or as the film depicts, it leads to our doom.

""Alien"" had the ultimate predator, an organism that needed a place to incubate its young ones. There were times when it resembled an insect in the early films portrayal of its society. Eventually, we began to realize that it was effectively ensuring its survival by mutating into something that resembled its host, as it shows in ""Alien 3"". This film might clear some of those early appearances, or it could confuse you even more, but the final scenes' revelation if you are paying attention will make perfect sense, considering our own history.

I really liked the way Scott connected the first Alien's images with what he gives us in the final third of the movie. Now we see what the destroyed spaceship means, how we might never be able to conquer such creature, and most importantly, and this is a personal wish, we get to explore, investigate, and find out what these artists are saving for a more extended explanation of who the ""engineers"" are, and what is the origin of their present attitude toward humanity.

The film is exciting, gripping, and very entertaining, giving us a great blend of the best cinema can offer you in ways of production values, acting, and some thoughtful screen writing. It also benefits from a director who can make you feel the darkness inside our fears, our souls and wrap it all up in a repelling but beautiful package. Giger lives on, as we get to see, and I wonder more sets, either inspired or designed by him. There are a few surprises, a whole new number of set pieces that will be remembered as classic cinema, and even better, an important film that is not afraid to ask questions and challenges us to be a more reactive audience. We had enough of empty style, here we are like David in the film, witnessing a document that might awaken that ""fire"", that ""soul"" that is in us, but we have chosen to ignore as we sit placidly, encouraging more empty, beautiful, huge, silly productions. This is a beautiful film, a nice compliment to a universe that is not as impossible as we thought before.

An instant classic.","10"
"Rabh17","Impressive visuals-- damning plot holes","10 June 2012","I liked the visuals. Wide, epic, cinematic, atmospheric. The imagined technology was beautifully executed.

The problem that I see will be with the Sci-Fi crowd that actually CARES about the details of the Alien Universe. The people who keep track of the story timeline (as in what year was Nostromo's discovery of the the alien? and how does it line up with Prometheus?) And for this same audience, this movie is less a action/horror movie and more of the Thinking Sci-Fi Horror movie. That means the details MUST MAKE SENSE. That means Plot Cohesion ACTUALLY Matters.

Like-- You find a place where there is a pile of alien bodies that doesn't look like they all laid down and expired peacefully...yet you take your HELMET OFF? Like-- The Captain of the ship SEES these piles of dead aliens-- and HE LETS YOU BACK ON-BOARD? Remember that the FIRST 'Alien' had Ripley locking the contaminated crewmembers OUT of the Nostromo as part of Biological Contamination Protocol-- and they WERE NOT Scientists!! Like-- The Engineers had been around for MILLIONS of YEARS, had Started Life on Earth-- and left cryptic messages to 'Come Back to these Stars where we maintain a Mass Death Weapons Facility so we can Kill all of you anyways? And Many Many other questions for things that make NO PLOT SENSE, but were perfectly reasonable for a plot put together by a Hollywood-Blockbuster-Committee instead of truly competent writers.

That said-- the average Movie-goer just going for a thrill ride will get it. In Prometheus' Case, I can happily say that the slew of Previews will not spoil the movie for you. If you Saw the Previews-- you did NOT see the movie.

And yes, some of the scenes are. . .hard to stomache. In my theatre, quite a few of the GUYZ had their hands in front of their eyes, catching wincing glimpses between fingers. Yeah-- That Bad.

"dilan_abey","Prometheus is the most unambitious ambitious film ever made","27 June 2012","Prometheus is the most unambitious ambitious film ever made. It seeks to ask the biggest questions of all, but in the most facile and sophomoric way possible. It is visually stunning, but intellectually prosaic, original and derivative. Yet, up to the final act, it creates and maintains a level of wonder that only the best sci-fi can. Ultimately, however, it wastes it with what has to be one of the most disappointing final acts of all time. It is lack of focus that lies at the heart of the failure of the film. It tries to combine the intellectual and philosophical inquisitiveness of 2001, with the horror and thrills of Alien. Unfortunately, the inherent tension that exists between these two completely contrasting styles of film renders Prometheus impotent. Scott fails to realize that in order for Kubrick to develop his concept as powerfully as he did, he needed to forgo traditional notions of structure or characterisation, which is at complete odds with what made Alien so successful. In that film, Scott chose to pare back the concepts in the film completely, instead focusing on characterisation, pacing and a watertight structure. By trying to combine elements of both, Prometheus fails to match either. The most successful elements of the film occur at the beginning, when we are presented with ideas rather than having them explained to us. The opening scenes, featuring amazingly eerie shots of natural occurrences coupled with an equally strange figure, establish a great tone for the film. The introduction of the idea that aliens designed us is handled well, if rapidly, and our first glimpses of the planet are very effective, as is the structure they visit. As with the opening shots, the best parts of the opening two acts occur when the characters say nothing, that is, when the set design and special effects are holding out attention. Scott is nothing if not a visual director and this is no exception. Like 2001, we are presented with stunning images in these first two acts, whether that be of the planet itself, or the giant metal face at the alter. However, while Kubrick was content with letting the visuals reveal the concept, Scott tries to develop characters who can articulate his, which is where the first the real problems begin. While all the characters are clichéd and direct from the playbook of interstellar voyage films, this could be excused if their roles were limited. Unfortunately, Scott attempts to give them dimensions, though as with the tension mentioned earlier, he never allows enough time for them to actually develop. So, the beginnings of a history between Shaw and her father is alluded to; the two pilots are given a repartee related to a bet; and the classic 'odd couple' trope is partially established between the geologist and biologist. While these aborted attempts at characterisation are not unforgivable, they do distract from what is actually interesting about the film – the meanderingly enticing pace that allows us to become enveloped in the world created. However, from the third act the wheels completely fall off the film, and quickly. Consider the difference in the pacing in this third act. At first, Scott allows us to explore the structure along with the crew – we find out information as they do, and given time to contemplate how this may relate to the questions we are asked about the origins of life. However, the film suddenly launches into overdrive, with plot developments and technically impressive, yet emotionally pointless, action scenes are thrown at us. This rapid and unaccountable change in pace only works to separate the audience from the film; while in Alien we are slowly brought to the crescendo, here we are forced into it. This causes bizarre inconsistencies such as the almost comical way Shaw interacts with the captain after her operation: she does not feel it worthy to mention that she just aborted an alien hybrid, and he does not find it interesting enough to mention the five dead crew who were just attacked by the reanimated body of another member of their party. Multiple plot holes are also created here, the most glaring of which being Shaw's assertion that the engineers had 'spared' earth, despite 15 minutes earlier saying they were 'delivering death' there. While these problems are unfortunate, the real disappointment lies in the treatment of the original concept that propels the film. While questions about the origins of life can be interesting (though they are all pretty much answered), and the concept of an original cause is tantalising, Prometheus is content to deal with both in the most uninspired of ways. Instead of trying to engage with how this changes our conception of our place in the universe, the prospect of other life, or discovering the mechanics of how we came to be, given the engineer's bath-bomb like help (did we still evolve through the mechanisms we thought or did they guide us? If so, how did they do it?), the film chooses to focus on the most uninteresting of adjuncts: religion. Evidently, Scott and his writers thought that making Shaw religious immediately gave the concept depth - that simply making these references to Christianity meant they were being profound. Inevitably for such a boring inquiry, their examination only gets as far as the stuporous 'I choose to believe', this despite that fact that, if her own thesis is correct, Shaw's Christianity cannot possibly be. Similarly, the teleology is compared to our relationship with robots, and again this is only developed to the extent of David being told he doesn't have a soul and can't understand concepts because he is not human. The actual difference between us, given that we were 'designed' by mortals, and him is never actually considered beyond this most basic of ideas (to see a much more interesting consideration of this idea, look to Scott's Blade Runner). Ultimately then, Prometheus is a technically impressive film that lacks the very soul it wishes to examine.","4"
"seashelly94","Never have I seen such a horrible movie","6 July 2012","There are spoilers in this review, but don't you worry. This movie isn't worth spoiling. It isn't as though telling you the plot with ruin anything. In fact, it might spare you the torture of sitting through this debacle of a cinematic experience.

I did not want to see this movie simply because I knew that it was supposed to be a prequel to Alien and Aliens. I am a huge Alien and Aliens fan, and I even enjoyed Alien VS Predator - the first one. I was convinced that Prometheus would fail to live up to the incredible story, suspense, effects, and acting of its predecessors. And, I was absolutely right. The bottom line was that I was out of power in one hundred degree heat and an air-conditioned theater with Prometheus had to be better than dying a slow, painful death in my sauna of a home. No, I think I would have taken the sauna and heat stroke.

Where do I begin? Ah yes, the story. The script was confused, dull, anti-climatic, and struggled to find a link to Alien. I could have written numerous unrelated words on a large dart board, throw darts at these words, put them together on paper, and it would have been a more interesting, concise, and clear script. To begin, the opening scene of this movie is one of these big, white, muscled Martians on some planet. He drinks these black dots on purpose, yielding complete disintegration of his body. This has nothing to do with later things, and it makes no sense in connection to the movie. As we discover, the black goop is somehow the start of the aliens we know from the movie alien. When someone comes in contact with it, they're infected and turn into some weird infected guy. Somehow, if someone infected has sex, the woman gets impregnated with some huge alien embryo thing and it grows into a big other thing that looks nothing like anything - maybe a giant squid spider - and it infects yet another human and a whole alien (finally looking like the aliens we know and love) bursts out of the human body. Mind you, it takes the whole movie to explain this process and it isn't even until the end that the alien arrives. This life cycle is confusing and nowhere near as sensible as the one in Alien or Aliens. There, the queen lays eggs, the eggs birth the spider things that implant the baby alien in a human, the human host gives birth to a baby alien, and the baby alien grows to a big badass.

Not only is the life cycle off, but the story lacked interesting characters and real drive. The whole reason they went to this planet is so some old man could talk to these human alien people in an effort to save his life. This old guy's robot son has infected the human crew and worked against them the entire movie, just to find a live human alien for his old guy ""dad"" to talk to. Kind of kills the suspense. Everyone basically dies, except the main woman whose acting is as horrible as the writing for her character. I didn't care about anyone and hoped everyone would die. It was disappointing to see that she, oh and the robot, did survive. Most of the movie was spent exploring or on the ship talking about research and ""Why are we here? Who made us? What is the reason for life?"" It was more of a religious/spiritual/philosophical snore-fest than the action/suspense promised by a movie in the Alien franchise.

The acting? Horrible. Coming from someone who has worked professionally as an actor and majored in theatre in college, you can trust me when I say that it was terrible. No emotion. No intent. It was a bunch of random people no one has heard of spouting their lines like those parrots you pass in toy stores. You know, you say something and they repeat it in a mechanical and single toned manner. The characters had no layers. They were similar to the stock characters found in commedia dell'arte of Italy or noh/kabuki theatre of Japan. In these forms, a character is one note and represents a single thing. A villain is a villain, a lover is a lover, a hero a hero, etc. That was this movie. The blonde? The bitch. The main chick? A true believer. Etc etc etc. I would expect such singular acting from an old comedy, but I expect something more engaging for the silver screen.

The only good thing about this movie was the opening credits. It was beautifully done, albeit out of place. The other good thing about the movie? The ending credits. I left faster than if the place were on fire. If you want to see an interesting movie that connects to Alien or Aliens, don't hold your breath. Bring a pillow and a blanket. Take a nap. You won't miss anything.","1"
"parnygards","It could have been great...","5 June 2012","SPOILER WARNING:

Doing a prequel to an extremely successful and beloved movie commands a careful approach and a sense of respect for the original artistic expression. Especially when executed by the same director.

I can respect the need of getting return on investments made, and live with some trade-offs when it comes to widening the target group. Such as adding some crowd pleasing scenes or characters.

That said, there really are no excuses for the, IMHO, lack of character development, bizarre and irrational acting by some characters, displaced comical remarks (such as when three characters are about to meet certain death) and worst, the numerous logical dead ends.

Unfortunately, at least the theatrical edit I saw, delivered sub par in about every department except art direction and costume. Which to be fair was great.

Major flaws: - lack of inherent logic, there were so many scenes that simply didn't add up - overly complex (and illogical) script - shallow (and illogically acting) characters, lack of character development - lack of suspense, crucial for a movie of this kind

In failing to respect the original movie as well as not at all matching the expectations created by the excellent campaign material and trailers, the fall becomes that much taller. Sadly, Prometheus deserves a very low score. It promised a lot, but didn't deliver. Hence the 1/10.","1"
"colonalbotworth4","Prometheus: Three Strikes.. You're out.","15 June 2012","I went to see this movie after seeing the trailers.. you know, the fast-paced trailers that make the movie look like an edge-of-your-seat sci-fi horror movie, filled with pulse-pounding scenes of anxious anticipation for what horrors will unravel next. Unfortunately, the trailers were much more exciting than the actual film itself. The film was more of a concept that seemed good, but must have been developed and adapted into a script while really, really high.

Strike 1:

The dialog was cheesy and underdeveloped. The characters were mostly one-dimensional (the tough OCD captain, the angry ""just here to get paid"" mercenary, the strong-minded black pilot, etc). The two main scientists, who were the cause for this exploratory expedition, were the only ones that the writers seemed to actually even TRY to give any depth to, although sadly even that fell short. They were portrayed as the blind idealist (""Charlie"" Logan Marshall-Green) and the reluctant hero (""Eli"" Noomi Rapace), archetypes you can find in any children's action cartoon or typical Japanese anime.

The blind idealist will do anything to find what he's looking for. He enjoys long walks down dark wet corridors, removing his helmet in an alien environment to breath in potentially dangerous toxins or poisons, and being set on fire to sacrifice himself to save and ""wake up"" the reluctant hero. The reluctant hero doesn't want to let go of her father, doesn't want to let go of her boyfriend, and doesn't want to admit that things are not as they seem until it's too late.. but in her defense, no one does.

One of the things I usually like about sci-fi horror is it tends to be more intelligent than traditional horror. They usually break the conventions of ""don't go in there.. why would you go in there?!"" type situations. But not Prometheus. For instance, ""hey these two guys were stuck in the ruins all night, we lost their audio and video feeds during the night. Let's go in and look for them.."" Wouldn't you perhaps have recorded those feeds? I'd assume on a corporate-sponsored mission, all transmissions would be recorded.. so maybe play back the tape? If they had, they would have seen the little snake fight and acid bath that went on only a few hours ago in the room they were about to just stroll back into.. but nope, instead they stroll back in and this whole movie gets a little more entertaining and a lot more absurd.

Strike 2:

This is a small one, but significant: the year of the mission is around 2093 and the strong-minded black pilot is trying to bang the tough OCD captain. Upon hearing she wants to see him in her room, he sings ""if you can't be, with the one you love.. love the one you're with."" Oh how cute and f**king clever. I bet that's JUST what a strong-minded black pilot would say. This captain sure must love the classics because at the time of the mission that song is 123 years old. ""Love the one you're with"" is a song from 1970.. 1-9-7-0.

The movie was filled with stupid little quips like this. When it wasn't poorly written meaningless dialog, it was poorly written attempts to be ""deep"" or have some meaning, but that came out almost worse. It's like two people talking about ""life"" without either of them having any real deep opinions on the subject, like two teenagers on really weak ecstasy trying to be weekend philosophers. No references to real philosophy, no real emphasis on the AMAZING discoveries they did make, no celebrations, no reflections on the real meaning of life or the implications this discovery had on them.. none of that. Just some silly conversations with the android (the best part of the movie I might add) about what it means to be ""alive"". Seen it a million times before, blah blah blah.

Strike 3:

""'Let's sedate her and put her back in this pod till we leave.. oh no, the reluctant hero is unwilling to be sedated.."" So the reluctant hero attacks two people, storms into the captain's area (no one stopping her), goes over to the captain's expensive and very rare surgery pod (which she was earlier reprimanded for even touching) and uses it to rip the alien out of her stomach in a scene that was neither scary, nor horrifically graphic.. mostly just annoying and awkward. Then the machine STAPLES HER UP and sends her on her way. Moments later, she suits up and leaves out on a mission. Are you f**king kidding me. And the old man.. 100+ year old Mr. Weyland, played by the 45-year-old actor Guy Pearce, again.. are you f**king kidding me?

Honestly there is so much wrong with this movie. A movie with a good concept, starring good actors and actresses, with amazing sets and settings, amazing visuals, and a budget that would make even Steven Spielberg blush.. all of these things would lead you to believe this movie would be good, and all of those things are true, but somehow, this movie still falls way short.. way, way short. Perhaps it's just another casualty of the Hollywood machine. Creating a movie not to be a work of art, something that can stand on its own.. but rather to revitalize a franchise, to be marketed and mass-marketed, to be a vehicle for sequels, to be a mere stepping stone on the path. The trailer builds you up for a gigantic roller coaster ride.. but instead the movie is more like spinning around on the tea cups at Disney World. And at the end, there are no loop-ty loops, no mind-bending twists or gut-wrenching drops.. just the dizzying upset you get when you realize you paid money to see a movie with very little to say and less moments of horror than Thanksgiving dinner with your family.","5"

Apart from the space ship (looks good) and the captain of the ship (at least some kind of a character) I found nothing good in this movie. And I never ever heard so many strange concepts about life.

"Pingo-2","Doesn't live up to the hype.","1 June 2012","I expected more. ALIEN + the trailer tells the whole story. There's just nothing more in this. And sadly, there's no characters and no antagonist either.

That said - this is a very well made movie with tons of great effects and nice settings. Beautiful at places and down right nasty at others. Really cool.

But you know - if you stretch out a film over 120 minutes, you should really have material for it. Sadly, PROMETHEUS does not have that.

Sure - Scott wants to save something for the sequel to this, but we who pay to watch the film actually wants to see THIS film. Hence, this film has to stand alone - and it doesn't.

Without the next installment, and ALIEN, this movie would make no sense at all - and scriptwise, it would go directly to an extensive re-write.

Most significant of script errors is the lack of an antagonist. There's just no suspense in the first part of the film. The second part kicks off good - and is really watchable - but only because of cheap thrills and tricks.

It's still a far better film than much else being made today, but for $120M dollars you'd expect them to hire writers that can really really write. We've actually seen much of this in tons of other films, and it's just not fun anymore. Give us something new! If it was a $1M movie, then I wouldn't complain. For that budget, this would be super.

But when you play around with $120M and you still make old-make-up that looks like in the BACK TO THE FUTURE-films - then you know that someone needs to get a reality check.","6"
"grnbrndd12","The Dangers of High Expectations","2 June 2012","I must admit, ever since buzz about an ""Alien prequel"" started floating around the internet about two years ago, I've been in a state of intense anticipation. When I discovered that the project had moved in another direction and became Prometheus, I, like many other fans, began following the near endless stream of trailers, images, and viral videos that have been churned out for the film the last few months, all the while eagerly latching onto each new show of the ""space jockey"" or allusion to Alien.

Then I saw the film. I must admit that my disappointment was partially my own fault for letting myself get carried away by the hype, but the studio ought to have some regret for stoking such anticipation for what they must have known is film that is little more than average. Or perhaps that's why they did it. Either way, the film gets off to a rather nice start, and the first hour is, particularly for Alien fans, quite enjoyable. Seeing the crew explore a derelict ship like the one in Alien, finding its crew of ""space jockeys"" and the persistent about-to- become-an-Alien-movie allusion to the original film are enough to have me, and most of the audience, on the edge of their seats. Then the film reaches the hour mark, and it's all down hill from there. The script runs out of steam, resorting to twists such as Guy Pearce's appearance on the ship and the yawn-inducing ""twist"" that Charlize Theron's character is his daughter. Characters such as David, that had been set up in the first half as scheming and multi-faceted, suddenly become flat, and characters seem to forget what had happened earlier in the film (where's the tension between Noomi Rapace and Theron after she kills Holloway? What about David's role in infecting him with the virus? IT'S ALL FORGOTTEN). Worse still, the trailers had literally spoiled all of the scenes we get with the various alien creatures, from the hammerpede to the tentacle monster. What we saw in the trailers is all there is, and much of the ending, with the space jockey ship being hit by the Prometheus, is also ruined in the ads. The ending, while interesting, is shameless for the extent to which is drops any attempt to answer the questions posed in the film, instead setting up for the inevitable Prometheus 2. The last shot, while interesting, is also an entirely predictable shout out to Alien fans that I, and judging from their reaction the whole audience, thought was poorly done. The movie also consistently breaks its own logic, and the constant to-and-fro from the Prometheus to the derelict feels both unnecessary and pointlessly frenetic. While the set designs and the planet Scott creates are impressive, I never felt very drawn into the film's atmosphere after the story leaves the derelict for the first time. The music is entirely bland, and I frequently didn't even notice that it was there.

As for the characters, I was shocked by how one dimensional and static they were, especially given the all-star cast. While Fassbender is predictably good as David, the character itself is hindered by a script that forgets halfway through what makes the character interesting. While Rapace does a decent job as Shaw, some of her dialog delivery was so poor I actually cringed. Would it have killed them to do a second take on some of these scenes? The rest of the cast is entirely unmemorable, save for Idris Elba-who is himself underutilized-, particularly Logan Marshal-Green, who is killed off so early and in such an uninspiring fashion that I found myself wondering why they even bothered having the character in the first place.

Overall, setting aside my own self-inflicted hype disappointment, Prometheus is an undeniably mediocre film that will tickle the fancy of Alien fans in some respects, but will satisfy no one's expectations. Still, I recommend the film to Alien fans for the hint of magic that the film has. I just wish they had aspired to more than the middle ground of unoffensive mediocrity.

EDIT: After seeing the film a second time, and abandoning my fan hopes for it to be a traditional Alien movie, I can say that as its own film Prometheus is good. 8/10 recommended.","8"
"josh_youngbwfc","Does Prometheus Deserve the Hype?","15 June 2012","""Prometheus, are you seeing this?"" asks Noomi Rapace's character scientist Elizabeth Shaw and yes I saw it, but there is a huge difference between seeing something and enjoying it.

Prometheus is an indirect prequel to the Alien series. This film focuses on a team of explorers who discover a clue to the origins of mankind on Earth that leads them on a journey to the darkest corners of the universe. There, they must fight a terrifying battle to save the future of the human race. Sounds interesting.

As mentioned, Noomi Rapace leads this cast that really manages to pack in the noticeable names: Michael Fassbender, Charlize Theron, Idris Elba, Guy Pearce, Rafe Spall and even a small part for Patrick Wilson. With so many experienced cast members being directed by the hugely acclaimed (although in my opinion drastically over rated) director Ridley Scott big things were expected from everyone, especially taking into consideration the success of the Alien film directed by Scott himself.

The film opens with a series of long, wide and very scenic landscape shots and this is a theme that the film will follow throughout and every time we see a large shot of the planet that our heroes find themselves on it looks fantastic; the directing and camera-work means that Prometheus is incredibly pleasing on the eye with some of the best environmental shots I've ever seen. The special effects follow suit and are so real that it doesn't matter how far in the future the crew of Prometheus (the ship which the film is named after) are, it feels and looks as though it could happen today, the effects are believable.

Unfortunately Prometheus has one huge flaw and one that I can not look past: every single one of those characters lacked any kind of personal motivation; their actions seemed uninspired. Noomi Rapace's character, the main character, spends the first half of the film doing not a lot at all and then spends the second half running away from things and holding her stomach all the time. And this is who you are supposed to empathise with and support, not really your traditional hero. I couldn't have cared less about her partner, whoever he was and Charlize Theron's character was ridiculously under used to the point where it seemed like if you took her out of the film no difference would have been made.

In fact, the only character that I felt was worth watching, partly because of the portrayal of the actor, was David, the non human member of the crew portrayed eerily well by Michael Fassbender. Another good performer among the cast was Idris Elba, relatively new to big budget films after carving his career out on television but deserves all the success that comes his way, although killing off his character just seemed like something to do rather than having any impetus behind it.

A stand out scene is when Shaw gives birth to an alien life form and while the rest of the film around that moment seems rather boring this scene is anything but! She doesn't have a lot to do everywhere else but here Noomi Rapace earns her salary hands down; the trauma and pain her character is going through comes across excellently on screen. Sometimes, poor films or films you don't enjoy have one glimpse of brilliance and this is Prometheus'. I would go so far as to say this is one of the best scenes I have ever seen in the cinema.

Does Prometheus live up to expectations? Not really.

Is Prometheus an enjoyable sci-fi film? Ish.

"n-rieck","Most movie critics know nothing.","9 June 2012","Don't believe anything you hear from know-nothing critics because this movie is better than most ""Alien"" movies including ""Alien vs. Predator"" which I happened to love.

Okay so I am a huge sci-fi fan who has been waiting two years for this film (it is part one of two, BTW) and would have seen it last night except I have been out of town on business. What is really sad is that every review I have read has been mediocre to bad with one review (Toronto Globe & Mail) actually containing some spoilers. So, my wife and I decided to see it today (IMAX 3D version) and can tell you all that this movie is great. It is better than ""Alien vs. Predator"" which I loved, and at least as good as the original ""Alien"" or any of of the Alien sequels (number 3 was a real stinker). Now the person who wrote the review in the Toronto Globe & Mail must have seen a different movie than us because all the spoilers he described were different than what we watched. But I have seen this before with sci-fi movies; Many patrons and critics hated ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" (some walked out; some demanded refunds; prompting Kubrick to cut scenes ""in the theatre"") and it was never fully accepted by the public until about a year later (many complained that it had a weak plot which may be true; thank deity I had read the book before watching it). Even still, many people today consider 2001 the best sci-fi movie ever. But not me, for my money it has always been ""Blade Runner"" which was also not liked by the public for quite some time. Let's face it. Only sci-fi people can fully appreciate this stuff.

"joben-525-633946","Interesting in parts but feels like a money making scheme.","21 December 2012","Ridley Scott's 'Prometheus' is an improvement on the one-dimensional 'Alien vs Predator' movies but like its flawed counterparts, ultimately feels like a desperate push at making more capital at the box office.

'The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo' star Noomi Rapace and Logan Marshall- Green lead a group of explorers into a distant planet in a bid to discover the truth about human existence. However, following some discoveries about the planet they are on, and some discoveries about what lies there, they begin to fear for their safety,

'Prometheus' is supposedly the origin story behind Scott's earlier 'Alien' franchise though it often feels pointless and unstructured as it plods through an interesting if confusing narrative. It is rather complex and expects the audience to absorb it all in without much guidance and without disrespecting the average citizen - it isn't a stroll in the park. Generally, I love my intellect being tested however with no apparent conclusion, it appears as though Scott will complete his vision in a follow-up film.

Noomi Rapace was outstanding in Steig Larsson's 'Millennium Trilogy' adaption's and is once again impressive as the explorer and the damsel in distress. She is supported well with Logan Marshall-Green as her on screen lover and the mysterious performance from Guy Pearce as the assisting android.

The movie's main upsides are the CGI and cinematography which is consistently superb and incredibly realistic; one scene in-particular when a storm arises shows the beneficial side of an estimated $130 million budget.

Overall, 'Prometheus' is a decent film. The only qualms are it doesn't live up to the enormous hype proceeding it, nor does it answer many questions about the evolution of the Xenomorphs - it just raises others.","5"
"bloodweiser1","You've Received an Invitation","2 June 2012","On release, Prometheus seems to create mixed emotions. My belief is that if you go expecting to see an all-out Alien movie, there's a chance that you'll leave disappointed. But if you look a little deeper, there's a masterpiece here. A very, very clever movie. What we have is a movie that may baffle in the present (and make no mistake, it's always going to leave unanswered questions) but given time, it's going to become much more accessible and open up to a fuller audience. But first, it needs to be slowly digested and understood.

For comparison, I'm drawn to The Matrix. Long, before it's reputation was destroyed by the sequels (and please Ridley, don't do that to Prometheus), the Matrix was just a great sci-fi movie. Within weeks though, people started to discover that it was much more - the Wachowskis had placed a message in there. It held something deeper. Now, that movie is a legend: discussed extensively on philosophy forums, dissected by students and in no small part, because of that philosophy, we see it as a classic. I see Prometheus in the same vein. Look past the Alien franchise and you'll see something much, much deeper. Not necessarily more satisfying but definitely something to chew over. And definitely something that makes it a great.

In my quick review, I don't want to concentrate too much on the sci-fi story, the acting or the cinematography. What I want to concentrate on is what I would call the ""soul"" of the movie. In my opinion, it's raison d'etre. What we have is a message concerning the very depths of each individual's existence. You can't be given that message directly - only pointed towards it. You have to grab it for yourself.

Yes, after the general sci-fi story we've got the layer of the Prometheus myth. But below that is the true essence of the movie - Gnosticism. Each character plays a part in that Gnostic structuring. Their actions and characters are based on it. We've got disciples seeking gnosis, demi-gods, atheists, popes, dogmatic followers and even the Church pops up in the guise of the Company. Scott was very smart. The legend of Prometheus was used by Gnostic religions in early Christian history, so it fits nicely with what he's presented. It's layered beautifully. True, sometimes layering the simple with the complex results in what looks like a plot hole and on it's release there are many complaining that those holes are there, but look properly and you'll see that the vast majority of those holes aren't there - if it doesn't make sense on the superficial level, it's probably explained at the next. Confusing? Only if you don't look properly and that's not a fault that can be laid at the door of the movie but rather a viewer who needs to open his eyes and study a bit harder.

If you only see ""Alien"" you haven't even scratched the surface. If you see the Prometheus legend, you've gone a bit deeper but you aren't there yet. The real depth of the movie is that Prometheus is presenting you with the opportunity to study Gnosticism. The study of yourself. Some will say that Prometheus is too conceited, that it's messy or that by hiding that message, it's become bloated. They're missing the whole point.

Prometheus is much more than a movie. It's a message. In one of the main character's words ""It's an invitation"". It's totally up to you if you want to receive that message, let alone act on it and accept the invitation.","9"

The opening scene was excellent, smart and visually stunning. Could see a slight homage to 2001 A Space Odyssey's time-warp ending with the panning of early earth landscapes and mountains. The scene of an alien seeding the earth set the scene. However, my heart dropped with the meeting of the crew of the spacecraft that had just reached the remote planet. They were a bunch of the most unlikeable characters you could imagine. It didn't make sense to me that a journey that would last for years would be made up of people who had never met, were unprofessional and with motivations that are totally incongruent with space travel. These are supposed to be astronauts exploring new territories but they acted more like tour guides and disgruntled employees just doing their regular day job. The rest of the film was a remake of Alien with the brown haired female character taking on the Sigourney Weaver warrior role.

In any reasonable future, none of those characters would have ever been chosen for such a space mission. The only character that had any depth was the robot.

Me being more of a hard sci-fi fan might make me a bit overzealous but this is how I got it: maybe the most important and expensive expedition ever is led by a blonde PMS-ing 24/7, with a crew of jerk ""scientists"" that have a behavior that's borderline idiotic. Nobody seems to care what's going on, nobody seems to do any research; instead they try to play with seemingly innocent aliens, they get drunk while studying an alien or they mate and they get lost in some circular hallways and freak out at every noise while they have the technology to cross the universe. That's why they traveled for four years. And I'm sure many other plot holes have been voiced by other reviewers. If you're willing to get over these shortcomings, you might then be frustrated by the ending that leaves some questions unanswered.

As usual, some physics facts are overlooked for the sake of being cool like noise in space, but I generally liked the special effects.

"king-growler","Shockingly bad, inane plot; fun visuals","25 June 2012","I was really excited to see this movie, and was utterly disappointed. I am shocked at how bad the screen play was, and how many ridiculous, pointless plot-holes there were. The screen writer should be ashamed of himself. I'm embarrassed for him, it's really that bad. It was impossible for me to just ""let go"" and suspend my disbelief so I could enjoy this movie... because literally 3-4 minutes could not go by without some character doing something completely stupid, or without something totally nonsensical happening. The plot was an embarrassing, shambling mess of all (and I do mean ALL) the SF tropes you discover as a young teen. Honestly, this might be the worst of the Alien sequels, and that's saying something. I could go on for pages and pages why this screen play was inane, but others here have covered many of the same points.

The visuals were pretty, and largely effective -- though why in 2012 aliens and spaceships can look totally real, but ""old person makeup"" still looks like it was created in 1972 is a mystery. The music was okay -- except for when it was totally inappropriate. It seemed like R. Scott paid for half a movie score, and kept using the same plaintive french-horn bit over and over... even in scenes that were supposed to be suspenseful or creepy.

I would honestly give this movie 1 star, but will bump it up to a 2 simply for nostalgic fondness for the very first Alien movie. There is no way in hell I would see a sequel to this, nor Lindelof's upcoming disasters: World War Z, and the new Star Trek sequel. When I told me wife that he is writing World War Z, she was crushed -- she loved that book, but hated this movie even more than I did (if possible).

"seaj11","over-complicated, uneven horrific reboot","9 June 2012","It is with great sadness that I say this...Prometheus is one of the worst, most pointless films I have ever seen. Despite an excellent leading cast, terrific source material, and amazing design and effects, the story is so saturated in its violence and shock value that it fails to rise to the heights its premise could go.

From a gorgeous and disturbing beginning that adopts the panspermia theory of life's beginnings on Earth, comes a quickly drafted get-them- to-the-planet plot that immediately spirals into bad-things mode. The leading characters are drawn well, but eventually are converted into plot devices and horror props, including a man who decays from the inside, a woman who bears his alien child, the company representative who seems to have ulterior motives but really does nothing more than make idle threats, and the android who somehow misinterprets his inventor's instructions to bring him alien contact to mean, ""Unleash the alien biological weapons on the crew.""

Sound bad? It's worse. You have random terrifying moments that completely ignore the lessons of the original ""Alien"" as well as all classic horror films, that less is more, and our eyes are overburdened with gore and destruction worthy of a video game movie. All the pseudo- philosophical musing and mythological tie-ins the script includes casually, washes in comparison to the utter insanity of the various parasites, guts, ripped and charred flesh, and eventual creatures. The screenwriters also forget that you save the worst for the last part of the moment...and if they had, the film might have actually been compelling and satisfying.

By introducing an elemental parasite, eliminating several artifacts that are never relevant to the plot, having the parasite begin evolving with its creations (rather than having it appear disjointedly at random moments), and saving the lead character's horrific birth scene for the last act, we would have increasing levels of psychological terror, motivations for certain character's sacrifices and murders, and then an enemy capable of dispelling the mysterious ""engineer,"" whose motivations should be explained first, in the chair wherein he is found in ""Alien.""

All in all, this was a good premise with an excellent heritage that got drowned in the lure of torture porn, awesome CGI, and twisty scripts common of today's sci-fi horror flicks. The ending is so vague and unmotivated, it seems a setup for a sequel...typical studio move. Studios, spare us another attempt unless you're willing to dial it way back and deliver a chilling, simple, thoughtful film that follows David's advice in ""Prometheus"": ""Big things have small beginnings.""","4"

********************************************************************* First of all, I rank the original Alien as one of the 10 best movies ever made. Needless to say, my expectations were sky-high. Especially considering the fact that Ridley Scott was behind the wheel.

So what on earth happened here? The script is utterly awful. The dialog is laughable (at best!) and the character build-up nonexistent. The characters behave like total dimwits throughout the movie, sparking responses from the movie-going audience that I do not think the director intended. The snake-xeno scene has been dissected before by reviewers here but let me pose the question again: should a biologist really attempt to cuddle with a rather malicious looking new life form not once, not twice but three times?!! This is only one of many,many,many frustrating behaviors from the cast. ""I got two crew members lost in a cave during a rather bad storm. Should I monitor their well-being or go for a quicky? Nah, I opt for the latter!"". The realism from Alien is thrown out the window on behalf of irritating one-liners and totally unrealistic behavior from the cast. I feel cheated. And no, I did not expect Prometheus to be just another xenomporph-film. But I did expect a film that took its legacy seriously. This did not. What was the point of this film, really?","2"
"bbrunoliveira","Perspective from someone who didn't know what this was","15 February 2021","I won't be long. When I saw this movie, I didn't know about the hype surrounding it. I don't know how I missed it, but I didn't know it had anything to do with Alien, all I knew was that it was a Ridley Scott movie. I had seen one of the trailers and it looked interesting. After I watched the movie, I was amazed by a huge blockbuster tackling such universal questions. Even better, I was excited about the possibilities moving forward. It's unfortunate that whatever they had planned, never came to fruition. I even read somewhere they were thinking of making Jesus one of the creatures which is so incredible. It's an inspiring inspired movie!","8"
"vijcode","Prometheus, portentous more like it.","3 June 2012","Have to say ever since I seen the first trailer for this movie I thought this would be the top summer movie...Well what a disappointment. Like most I was expecting a Clever thought provoking sic fi epic. What we got was a mess. The movie pretended to be about the origins of our life and why we are here. Epic questions or what....But that's where the epicness ends. The plot if u can find one revolves around a set of foolish scientists doing everything possible to ensure mayhem and death follows them. The film played more like a horror movie than a sic fi. Unsettling stomach dissections, heads bursting &head ripping. I know suspense is important but if you're gonna set the premise up for such big questions the audience deserves some answers. There aren't any and what you get instead are excuses for nods to the old Alien movies. It seems like Ridley Scott felt left out at the blockbuster stakes and tried to come up with something. He has, a mess of a movie and a disappointing taste in the mouth. The film ended suggesting a sequel. I'd imagine it would be to explain the so many un answered questions of this movie. If that's what it set out to do then that's why this movie felt so pointless and unfulfilling.","3"
"jimmypetersen1984","Slightly more annoying that Alien4 . . .","11 June 2012","While watching Prometheus I was unable to suspend disbelief, due to the sheer number of terrible decisions, poor plotting/characters and an appalling script, which is very unusual for me.

I wanted to love it, but even scenes deliberately designed to conjure excitement by referencing other films, and Alien itself, were spoilt by the need to rush to get to the next plot point. It seemed every time they were starting to build to something interesting, they would show the reveal almost immediately. Less is more, and allowing breathing space would have heightened our anticipation in seeing inside the space jockeys room etc. Ironically, if they had cut out half the movie (rather than add more to the inevitable d.cut)and spent more time with the characters/environment it would have more satisfying. And there is no Ripley. Or indeed anyone worth caring about, which is a pretty big thing for a film so concerned with 'humanity'. And on the subject of less is more, just because you can now show everything from DNA to Spaceships to Aliens through the use of CG, doesn't mean you have to. Alien had none, and people will be talking about that film far long after Prometheus is forgotten.

Below is a shortened list of annoyances I personally came across whilst watching -

Why does Shaws hair blow in the wind inside her helmet??? - Why cast a young man as an old man? - Why does the goo do different things to different people? - How is Shaw running around after surgery? - Why were the three of them so happy to kill themselves at the end? - Why does everyone just go and have sex while there are two men left behind to die in the temple? Is there nothing better to do after you find life on another planet?? - Why travel all that way based on spurious assumptions? - Why do none of the crew seem to realise what mission they are on/appreciate its importance? - The plot is entirely based on conveniences - they land next to the only 'man made' structure on the planet? - Why do they suddenly go racing off as soon as they land? - The characters are the stupidest I've seen outside of a teen horror. - Why do the engineers want to wipe us out anyway? - If a giant spaceship is rolling towards you, roll sideways, not forwards. . .


Prometheus cannot decide whether is is Alien or Avatar, and ends up a dumb sci-fi cousin to Kingdom of the Crystal Skull.","1"
"deatman9","Visually stunning but lacking solid writing.","11 June 2012","I went to see this movie the other night in 3d of course and I was blown away. Everything you saw looked real enough to touch. As far as the writing goes though I was kind of disappointed. They do not explain much from alien it being a prequel and all and they leave a lot of questions unanswered as if to set up a sequel.

This movie is set many years before the first alien movie on a ship called the prometheus. They are on a way to a planent with what they think houses the being that created humans.

Overall this movie was really good and its worth a watch for sure. But like I said its lacking in the writing. The visual effects will keep you distracted though.

"helmich-551-613055","Disgustingly awful","10 December 2012","Let me also express my horror after watching this movie. It really makes you wonder what Ed Wood would have been able to do with 130M dollars at his hands...

We are supposed to believe that a trillion dollar mission designed to make first contact with an alien civilization is crewed by people who have never trained together. Who have never even met. When the resident biologist tries to strike off a conversation with the geologist he's met with ""I'm not here to be your FRIEND, I'm just here to MAKE MONEY"". Perhaps this was a smart reference to the rationale of the characters behind this movie?

If you're going to create characters that are at risk of meeting their maker in the course of your movie, at least make us care whether they live or die. None of the characters have any depth to speak of, they are incompetent, useless, obnoxious, moronic, outright hostile, or simply extras that serve absolutely no purpose. This stuff is basic. You spend a 130M dollars and there's no one in the creative process that says, OK, so let me get this straight...at all?

Some time into the expedition they find what they were looking for, a dead humanoid alien. The geologist is not impressed. He's off to look for rocks. Fsck the dead alien.

Really? You've just made the greatest discovery in the history of mankind and...you're bored?

The idiocy goes on and on and on after that. Apparently the discovery of an alien civilization has so disappointed Holloway that he decides to drink himself under the table. This provides the vehicle for David the android to infect Holloway with the organic black goo he's found. Why? Your guess is as good as mine.

What does the black goo do, exactly? Well, it can infect you with alien DNA that forms a worm that crawls out of your eye. It can also take the shape of an alien snake. A hissing cobra like thing that is so irresistibly cute the biologist just has to pet it. The black goo then goes on to orally penetrate the geologist and turn him into a zombie. And that's only the beginning.

There's a captain, who's only job is to fly the ship, but in order to crash the Prometheus into the alien ship he needs two sidekicks to commit suicide along with him, because he can't ""fly worth a damn"".

The whole thing comes to its merciful end when the alien ship crashes down, nearly hitting Ellie. Except the ""nearly hitting"" part is turned into a minute-long chase scene.

This abomination should never have been made. The execrable script should be turned into black goo and force-fed to its author. What a disgrace. This is George Lucas all over again.","1"
"mleenyc-1","A Sci-Fi Movie For Our Times","15 February 2013","Normally I do not comment on the overlap between science and what passes for sci-fi movies these days. But this is Prometheus, a movie that lovers love, haters love to hate and the norms can join in the fun, if they are of a mind.

The broader reflection that draws me is what the board reactions on display informs about the state of science (and math) learning in this country (US). When Alien came out in 1979, it reached the viewers of the original Star Trek TV series of the late 1960s and the Apollo 11 moon landing in 1969, a time when the younger generation harbored a veneration for science and what it could inspire and accomplish. Star Wars (1977) was more of a fantasy adventure set in the futuristic past, but it was mindless fun, because of the humorous characters portrayed in a film that poked fun at itself. It offered some inspiration, as well as values that a civil society could support.

Fast forward to the present and I see a younger generation not only NOT holding the sciences in esteem but actually mocking the sciences, and this lack of respect is evident in many of our misguided politicians as well (hell, we can't even call it global warming - it has to be climate change).

Prometheus becomes a cultural test in these times, with many younger people seemingly unable to appreciate the real need for science to play a more important role in our lives, our movies and our imaginations, if we are to compete with the rest of the world and play a major part in this world's technological and economic advances.

What separates Prometheus is the cynicism. Peter Weyland to me personifies the greed and vanity permeating our present culture, capable of murdering and destroying at will. Behind the Weyland character are the script-writers Spaihts and Lindelof (Cowboys & Aliens 2011 and Lost series). These writers, and indirectly Ridley Scott as well, apparently care not a whit about the science and, as Bill Harding (played by Bill Paxton) in Twister (1996) said, ""He's not in it for the science, he's in it for the money."" While you can get away with this brand of cynicism in a TV series like Dynasty (1981–1989) as entertainment, the singularity of sci-fi is the necessary grounding in scientific rules and an outright rejection of cynicism (although cynicism may be used as a critique but not as an end in itself).

The inept script-writers hold forth the incompetent, pseudo-archaeologist Elizabeth Shaw as their main lead, who wields a religious cross, no less, in what is supposed to be a science-based fictional movie. As stated before, the cynicism in this movie is rampant.

I hold Ridley Scott and others like him responsible for taking their parts in perpetuating the current disdain in American culture for science and learning. To the extreme extent, they are greed personified. Like Dr Jonas Miller in Twister, they are in it for the money.","1"
"rosslittle-278-657280","Shabby and forumlaic IQ lowering twaddle","10 September 2012","This movie is terrible. Ridley Scott has obviously looked to the other Alien films and made himself a little formula something like this: Balshy female protagonist + android + beheaded android + slime on walls + hidden agenda + stow away alien + pots of Alien goodness + suspense building pings + crew of misfits + exploring alien craft = blockbuster movie.

Unfortunately, no one part of this movie is satisfactory. Character development is so shallow that you find yourself not caring if the love interest turns into a massive wrinkly alien or not. The bog standard stereotypical characters have been lifted from the other Alien films, and you know what, it comes across as though Ridley Scott was actually bored of them.

For an alien film, the lack of actual alien on human action was a bit of a shock. Instead, masses of time is given to dreary dialogue to force facts at the audience. ""OH MY GOD it's a ZX Spectrum Surgery Pod thing""... that stood out like a massive sore thumb along with a whole host of other pieces of info that those lacking a brain would need to string the series of images on the screen before them into a story. For the rest of us, it was just tedious and boring.

Holes in the plot... My colander has less holes. It really was utterly formulaic but with very little in the way of story to provide the scaffolding to hang the bits of the formula from.

And really, the sets. I mean, the alien ship was spotless! How many thousand years had it lain there? What's more the air was absolutely crystal clear. On the crew's own ship, again, everything was spotless. For a working vessel there appeared to be no wear or tear. No dirty windows, nothing that might suggest it was actually anything other than a set.

It's this lack of attention to detail that makes me think the movie is nothing more than a 'made-for-tv' type affair.

Thoroughly disappointing - if you have paint, watch it dry instead.","2"
"rjennica","contains spoilers and not so kind words","24 November 2012","Yikes! I bought the 3D Bluray for beautiful Charlize Theron, having enjoyed her in ""Aeonflux"". But this story was nothing but another version of the ""Alien"" and ""Species"" trilogies. The script was simply horrendous and disjointed! There was no need for language, especially amongst the 'professionals' and crew members. It just made everyone look and sound like a bunch of misfits. Especially with untoward panic and temper tantrums. ""I'm just making this movie because this economy sucks and I need to pay some bills."" So, if you can't act, you're hired! When Ridley Scott makes a bad movie, you KNOW this economy is affecting ALL alien formseven the illegal ones! ""Hey meester, you want my seester? Everything said in other reviews thus far, mirrors my sentiments. So I'll just be redundant and say, this movie is STUPID, STUPID, STUPID! I want a refund!","1"
"warrenf_peace","I loved it and saw it 3 times in 2 days and I want to see it AGAIN!","9 June 2012","The critics have a point, as every film (critic) has issues. As Ridley says, ""this film lives in its own universe,"" so of course the differences between Prometheus and Alien are correct - The continuity gaps that the reviewers pull at - (the infamous Giger 'Space Jockey') - will increasingly spotlight their own lack of imagination. I found the film spectacular Sci-fi, and saw it 3 times (once in 3D) over 2 days. For me (*SPOILER ALERT*):

The violently sexual attacks by the aliens in this film suggest Ripley's British buggery beyond the bravura thespian ism by Noomi & Fassbendy; The tech is spec-tech-ular , for a future in our universe; The more philosophical themes were indeed a bit 'flan', but whether to accommodate the general public's lack of facility in this era, or to leave open the doors to a quintillogy (or ""infinitillogy!"" - Scott is no one's fool, as the back-end participation would be obscene - much like the excess American profiteering being flaunted by current corporate elites - in this aspect, Scott's prescience is spot on with Theron's character)

So in the final analysis, Prometheus will delight visually; the underscore has a main theme that may haunt you; the questions left unanswered may hopefully inspire some of our race (unfortunately, not enough to actually get there). Scott's biggest flaw is in the economics of this journey. His 'luxury yacht'/research starship will not be available at the end of the 21st century for $1 trillion dollars. But oh, ""Make It So, Number One""! (Oops! Wrong Universe )

I believe in God, but I define it much like those who see Phi Tori at the heart of it all. Scott does the impossible task of proposing a definition of our God (who may be simply more scientifically adroit 'bio-engineers'), and only fails to answer that impossible question to Justin at Variety. What did you expect? ∞=42? I could go on (and hopefully, I will go on - through eternity..) Unfortunately, Peter Weyland won't. And Justin wants to know Why not? (I figured that part out for myself.)

Weyland wasn't a Believer.

I hope Riddles has started working on a sequel, as I'd like to get as much of Ridley Scott's thinking on film as possible, before he, too, meets his maker (rather, 'Our' maker). And I'm enthralled that he pulled off this inspirationally epic sci-fi masterpiece. Like 'Blade Runner' was in its day, 'Prometheus' should become a similar landmark for this artist, indicating his evolution of style, mastery in his medium, a unique voice and groundbreaking ideas. The man deserves an Academy Award with this one.

Now we wait to see what James Cameron delivers with Avatars 2 & 3 (good luck with those. Anyone can relate to the troubles of a purple eleven-foot-tall, native American-like-with-a-tail), whilst I try to find time to propose some ideas at taking Elizabeth and David through the heavens. While the perverse greed exploited through consumer capitalism ravages our resources, and petty materialists govern, our planet is being pillaged, and our future is being stolen. There will be no Research Expeditionary Vessels darting through the universe at warp speed in this century, (or the next), except, perhaps in our imaginations. And I envy (not worship) the species that achieves this great conquest of physics and engineering. Are they truly Gods? Demigods? Angels (or Demons)? Or are they just great engineers? Will they, too, be forced to follow the law of the jungle, so that only the strongest survive? God, I hope not! For that vision, go see 'Prometheus'! Then go see it in 3D. (and get off yer arse, and do something good for the planet, so that we'll be around long enough to become that which we seek - The Answer! (And no, sorry Douglas, it isn't 42.

Seriously, what was this movie all about? There was no plot, no characters, or even decent idea. It seamed like movie makers created CGI and tried to make a movie of them.

CGI dude: Mr. Scott, we created here an explosion scene. Where would you like to put it?

Ridley Scott: I don't know. Put there ever you like. I am too busy today. Need to get my hair done.

Most of the film has no meaning at all. It applies to dialogs, and actions of characters. How that octopus alien thing could grow so fast so big without any nutrition? Would anyone try to touch some strange creature with teeth in foreign planet? How stupid should you be to do that? How stupid should you be to run in front of rolling spaceship instead of running to the side? How could they find the planet according the stars in the paintings? Stars moves. Always. The different civilizations couldn't draw them exactly the same, the future humans could not find that stars too. The stupid plot holes is everywhere. There is no need to look for them. They simply stands out in front of you and you can't ignore them.

"Acello","What ???","17 September 2012","... This was the most frequent question that popped in my head while watching this... thing. It was meant as a horror movie, and succeeded : I was horrified.

Now rating this a 1 might be a little harsh ; like most other reviewers, I agree that, to its credit, the movie has awesome visuals. However ! not only do they not save this awful nonsense, you could also say that they are NOT adequate for an ""Alien"" movie. Super-wide vistas ??? What happened to the constant claustrophobia in the other Alien movies, even the terrible ""Resurrection"" ? And everything is so CLEAN...

So, if like me you aren't in love with the visuals, what's left ? Well, nothing at all. It's all an awful mess. It's not ""New-Starwars-bad"", not by a long shot (I would rate the so-called ""SW 1-2-3"" below a zero out of ten), but it's still awful.

I have to rant. I'll just do it. Here are my favorite reasons (although if you've read other ""Hate-it"" reviews, there probably won't be anything new here. Pass if you have.)

1. The crew is a bunch of schoolchildren. They have no sense of danger, of self-preservation, of discipline, of any vital priorities whatsoever. The only authority figure, Vickers, serves no purpose as everyone disregards her orders constantly, even to her face. Captain's orders are also ignored. It's not even chaos, because that would mean you can't expect how the characters will react : no, in this movie, you're certain that whatever shouldn't be done WILL BE. And this team is supposed to be made of pros ?

2. Contrary to other reviewers, I don't believe that the ship ""finds immediately the straight lines"". There's no clear sense of time during the entry scenes into the atmosphere. For all we know, they could have been searching for hours. But it's still unbelievable enough. That moon has the same gravity as Earth (exactly the same !!) so it's probably extremely big, even if it has a denser core. Yet they find the ""facility"" by chance. Would it have hurt to include some signal, like in ""Alien"", to explain how they find it so fast ?

3. The crew, as I said, is a bunch of morons. But worse : it's a bunch of morons who apparently haven't had a chance to get to know each other. What ??? A trillion dollar expedition without any preparation ?

4. The ship HAD to land FAR from the facility it had detected. It could have parked right outside, but that would have made impossible one or two scenes. For similar scenes, see ""Pitch Black"". But in PB, landing far from the base was unintentional. The ""hurry back on your quads before the sh** hits the fan"" was credible. Not so here.

5. Then we get to the REALLY good stuff. Upon finding an ""Engineer"" 2000-year-old dead body, two cretins freak out and leave. There was, at that point, no reason to get ANGRY (that was really my first big ""WHAT ?????"" in the movie) and leave the group ; that was contrived, that was LAME. Little did I know what I was about to see next.

6. So the two idiots obviously get lost. You can expect that in an unknown subterranean maze. BUT one of them is an expert at mapping corridors with his ""pups"" and still he has no feedback from them ? Worse : they have a working radio contact with the ship (where the captain has a great 3D map provided by the ""pups"") and STILL they don't ask for directions ???

7. And then, you all know this part : the captain leaves the two stranded morons (lost but still not asking for directions) on that note : ""Oh, there appears to be something alive not too far from you"" and then abandons his post at once for a sh*g with the creepy Vickers. So he doesn't get to know what happens next. Too bad, he really missed something epic.

8. The two idiots (well, one in particular) decide it's fun to try to pet an unknown alien species of snake which is clearly very pis*ed off and gives them every chance to back off. A dead Engineer's body : not fun ; a living, angry alien cobra : fun. Go figure. Anyway, carnage ensues. They deserved it. Were this movie a documentary on real events, those two imbeciles would make the top of the Darwin Awards of 2093. Numero Uno.

9. Then...

Ah, it's too hard. It's too long. I'm getting tired of this, and I've only covered half the movie.

I'll have to pass on some other great moments of sheer stupidity, like the ultra-high-tech med-pod that treats only males -- in what is a woman's lifeboat (????!!!), and the terrible, terrible scene where a spaceship rolls on the ground like a wheel (and everyone runs in the same direction instead of running left or right). The suicidal collision in the end is also stupid enough to be mentioned ; yes, okay, one pilot could sacrifice himself, but the REASON why the two others stay with him instead of going for the escape pods is the final nail in the coffin of a movie made for 6 year-olds.

All in all, there's, incredibly, no end to the list of absurdities in this movie. If you thought that looking endlessly for the cat in ""Alien"" was cretinous enough, know that you haven't seen cretinous if you haven't seen ""Prometheus"". It really, really challenges your idea of ""nonsense"". You'll never be the same after that. You'll reclassify ""Alien Vs Predator"" as ""artsy"". You probably already have, if you've seen ""Prometheus"".

Ridley, please leave ""Blade Runner"" alone. It needed you at the time, but not anymore. The ""Alien"" franchise didn't either, but that ship has unfortunately sailed.","1"

"jeev7882","The most amazing sci-fi film in a very long time","10 June 2012","Prometheus is a brilliant visual sci-fi marvel. Ridley Scott has given us an epic film that survives independent of the Alien movies even if it is somewhat of a prequel to the series. The look of the film is arresting from the onset. The opening sequence, presumably on Earth, sweeps through a massive lake and waterfall, up the cliff face and to a single living being. The being is human-like, but not quite human. He drinks something that causes him to decompose rapidly. Eventually, his DNA ends up in the water where it seems to recombine and, again, presumably, become human DNA.

"donaldmcfarlane99","An apocalyptic Sci-Fi catastrophe.","5 June 2012","As a big fan of the Alien series, and of Science Fiction in general, I went into this film slightly concerned that Ridley Scott would, after all these years, botch the job. And he did. This film was horrible. There were gaping plot holes, the behaviour of the characters in the film completely illogical at times, and an overall weak story that is never fully explained. Yes, the film is very pretty, and stunning to look at. Yes, some of the acting is quite good. But as far as story and plot goes, this film is a disaster. An apocalyptic Sci-Fi catastrophe. Any Sci-Fi fan of Blade Runner, 2001, BSG, the original Star Wars, Alien, Aliens, will be let down on all fronts. In regards to Alien, this film isn't as scary. In regards to Aliens, this film isn't as fun. Very disappointing. I had high hopes, and they were dashed.","4"
"darren-153-890810","Was expecting more - Terrible 3d","6 June 2012","I confess, I wasn't a huge Alien fan but the trailer for this looked epic so I thought I'd give it a go. I also thought it had massive potential to rival Avatar in the 3d steaks. Sadly, it didn't. The 3d was totally pointless, which is a shame as there are some beautiful scenes containing holograms of the universe. It would have been amazing if the planets would have zoomed out of the screen for us to almost touch and hold them.

It's totally watchable with some decent performances, but some bad ones too. Some of the dialogue is very sub standard.

I know Ridley Scott likes his powerful female leads but it's totally unbelievable what the main goes through and survives. But hey, this is Hollywood after all.

It could and should have been much darker with more suspense.

"po331","Don't listen to the overwhelming negative (1-2 star) reviews.","9 June 2012","Just because a movie doesn't meet your every expectation or your ""high-standards"" doesn't make it a bad film. The fault lies with the self entitled fanboys who before watching the movie, decided to think of a storyline they wanted to see. It's sad to think that we live in a time where stories are told to appease the viewer instead of taking them on a journey. I walked into a theater with an open mind and I was happy with what I saw. I see a lot of reviews misinterpret key plot points and perhaps that explains their frustration.

Prometheus is well casted with stunning visuals and room for a trilogy if successful.

The story starts off a little slow at first but necessary for character development. I think there is an amazing plot to be discovered if given the chance and opportunity through a sequel.

Are you left with questions at the end? Yes, it wouldn't be a Scott film if there weren't any unanswered questions. Is it flawless? No, there will be some surprises that you'll figure out before they're revealed.

Is this truly a prequel to the movie ""Alien""? Not really. So don't expect dark corridors or ""they mostly come out at night, mostly.""

Watch Prometheus and let the Ridley Scott tells his story instead of holding him up at gun point demanding to tell him yours.","8"
"sfokt","Ridley Scott, you used to make good movies... :/","5 June 2012","This movie is made of painfully cliché lines and plot devices, flat characters, ridiculous plot, lots of 'oh I can't have babies' 'emotional'rubbish and tons and tons of pseudo-scientific crap. From the start the plot doesn't make sense - how did the 'scientists' get from the fact that some cave paintings contain a representation of a certain configuration of celestial bodies to the idea that something came from this area of space, let alone that this something wants us to come and visit, let alone that this something engineered humans? Completely unjustified reasoning. While on the mission, the characters make every possible mistake they can, from 'oh yea, there's oxygen here, let's take our masks off before checking if there are any pathogenic microorganisms in the air', to 'ooooh, look at that horrible black ooze coming out of those vessels we don't know anything about - can I lick it please please please?'. The whole 'mission' is just really weird - you would expect people who go on a mission together to actually work together, or at least have a stable chain of command - but no, they bitch at each other all the time. The rest of the movie is basically a set of pseudo-scientific curiosa (let's put some electricity through this 2000 years old severed head, it will come back to life!), pseudo-emotional bullshitting that is meant to give characters some depth but only makes them look stupid and unbelievable, tons of belief-based unjustified inferences unworthy of anyone who took a year of any undergraduate science course, and cliché lines of the 'we have to do it or there will be no Earth' kind. Not only this, but the entire movie promotes the common 'belief over science' attitude which I find quite appalling. The fact that it's the so-called 'scientists' in the movie who are the most naive and thoughtless people, is simply disgraceful. Don't watch it, it's a waste of time, and definitely don't pay for it.","1"
"TheUnknown837-1","I do have a desire to see the movie again and pay closer attention to the little details.","10 January 2013","I've put off writing about ""Prometheus"" for a while, because I wanted to be absolutely certain on where I stood in regard to the much-deliberated question of whether or not it works. And, if it does work, on what level? And in what way? This Ridley Scott production, a prequel to his 1979 horror masterpiece ""Alien,"" has caused a bigger intellectual, fan-based firestorm of opinion than any other movie released in 2012. So I decided to first let the flames, if you will, simmer down and approach the movie, having heard both sides of the argument, with an open mind. Ironically enough, and perhaps to nobody's surprise, I wound up smack-dab in the middle in terms of my reaction.

The best way to approach ""Prometheus"" is as its own stand-alone premise. I have the feeling that's what Ridley Scott wanted to do: he probably only tied it to the ""Alien"" franchise for better box office assurance; hey, the guy's got to make money to make more movies, after all. He might have also felt the way I did when I first heard about this project: was a prequel even needed? Did we really care who dispatched that signal that drew the inter-stellar space crew of the first ""Alien"" movie to that dark, wind-lashed planet? Did we care what the fossilized extra-terrestrial seated behind the chair in that big spaceship look like before his insides exploded? And first and foremost, did we really care just where those slimy, bug-like monsters that terrorized Sigourney Weaver in four different movies originate? Me personally, not at all. I was much happier letting my imagination fill the blanks.

But that's okay, as far as ""Prometheus"" is concerned, for it only provides a handful of those answers. In fact, in regards to that fossilized alien's origins, it only teases us with an answer; it never actually provides one. Just when we think we've figured it out, we realize we've got wait for ""Prometheus Part II."" What this film would really like to do is be a sort of modern-day ""2001: A Space Odyssey."" It's more concerned about philosophy, about religion and anti-religion, and the never-ending debate on man and his relationship to the universe. And on that level—the raising of philosophical questions—""Prometheus"" is a success. It also has a very strong sense of majesty and wonder about what lies beyond the atmosphere of planet earth. Whereas the only mindset of Alien was downbeat terror and discomfort, ""Prometheus"" persists in throwing big streams of splendor and astonishment. When the characters of the movie, a team of scientists and military protectors along with an android, start venturing into that big cavern on some remote, uninhabited planet and start awing at the cave drawings, the skeletons, and the architecture, I was hanging my jaw along with them.

In fact, I enjoyed the sense of science-fiction wonder—the scientists believe they are visiting the homes of an alien race that genetically manufactured mankind—that I wish the movie had not gone the way it did in the second half. I did not want violence, I did not want encounters with alien life forms. It was all fine—and one sequence involving a self-ordered dissection to remove an alien parasite was genuinely scary—but I was happier when Mr. Scott was simply probing questions. Again, it really does feel he wanted to make this picture with no franchise-strings attached.

Maybe that is also the reason why the characters of ""Prometheus"" do not stand out as individuals, as people I could get involved with. They were merely stick-figures: the scientist who places knowledge before safety, the stern military professionals, the foul-mouthed mechanics, the emotionless robot devoted only to his programmed mission, the cocky pilot and his crew. They also seem to come from all corners of the earth; every other crew member is a minority. To make one more seemingly irrelevant comparison to ""Alien,"" the cast of that movie were also, fundamentally, stick figures. But they were stick figures breathed full of life by sharp writing and strong performances. Each person had a personality that was distinctly their own. But there are no fleshed-out people in ""Prometheus."" Late in the third act, the ship's captain is told by his Asian helmsman not to take the controls, and they laugh over the remark that he cannot fly to save his life. Just a hint for a dynamic that is never explored or dealt with on any level before. There is also a third-act twist regarding another endless question (what if a man could live forever) that pushes itself into the movie too quickly and ends itself much too soon to leave any sense of resolution or, in this case, futility.

But this is the ultimate strength of ""Prometheus"": as long as you don't demand answer-after-answer, it is a movie you will want to see again. This review, after just one viewing, might be too little and too soon. I do have a desire to see the film again and to pay more attention to the little details, the small jabs of dialogue that probably contain more potency and irony than I gave credit for at first, and how moments connect to one another. And it is also worth admiring for Ridley Scott's flair: his ability to convey a sense of scale and epic proportion so sadly rare in movies today.","7"
"CookezofDoom","Beautiful nonsense.","5 January 2013","This movie looked gorgeous and I enjoyed the acting of both Fassbender and Theron but this story was awful. It was so bad I have to say that I consider it one of the worst movies I've ever seen. I'm not a harsh critic, I love most movies I see or usually, feel at worst, neutral. I can think of so many questions, it is easier just to list them.

Why did the scientists decide to take their helmets off on a whim? Aren't scientists aware of contamination? Why did the biologist run from a harmless alien corpse? Wouldn't he be jumping for joy at such a find? How did the mapping geologist get lost? Why then did the biologist later approach a live alien with excitement throwing caution to the wind? Why was the alien head being electrocuted without any purpose or caution? Scientists normally try to make as little invasion as possible, especially with a rare alien that might be the most important discovery in human history. Why did the android poison a harmless scientist who was never mean to him without considering the consequence it might have on the whole crew, including himself and his dying boss? Why did the dying/mutating scientist want to be killed so badly by Vickers while he was mutating? What was with a flamethrower rather than a much more effective gun? Why was Shaw over her lovers death so quickly? Why was the android trying to put Shaw in stasis with a rapidly growing alien inside of her that was going to almost certainly kill her and why were the other scientists helping him do this without questioning where it came from or why they were doing this? Why does Vickers own a personal surgery machine made for a male only? How is a cesarean completed without any uterine stitching? It only stitched her skin on the outside. How does Shaw run around after major surgery without dying? Why is no one concerned when she walks in half naked covered in blood with huge stitches? Seriously? No one asks what that is about? Why is Shaw not mad at David for trying to sedate her or Vickers for killing her boyfriend? Why was the head of Weyland corporation secretly asleep on board? It was his ship and his money. His motive did not need to be a secret. Why did the Alien start punching everyone in the face without seeming confused by their presence? He didn't at least think ""what are these humans doing here?"" It seemed silly. Why were the pilots so willing to kill themselves? They seemed way too happy about it. Why do Shaw and Vickers run the length of a massive falling ship? Why run toward the shadow? Why does Shaw want to go visit a the aliens who were trying to kill humans? She just saw the Jockey smash some humans without listening to any kind of reasoning but thinks they'll listen to her questions?

For the most part, motives and actions are unexplained. Characters have no depth and what happened to them concerned me very little and the scientists just did not act like scientists. I was personally annoyed that the last surviving alien simply massacred everyone without telling the audience anything about what happened. Perhaps they left it open for a sequel? I seriously hope not.","1"
"Hypergarage","Promethues is insane and abysmal. ULTRA SPOILER","7 June 2012","Right so here's how aliens happen according to Prometheus -

In the Beginning the space jockey's came to earth.

The Space jockey's were humanoid things that like to wear cool helmets. (shame, I always thought they were an alien race akin to the elephant man, but cooler, and I thought predator had one of their skulls in his collection in predator 2 - but no! Helmets)

And so they wanted to create. And thus one of them drank some black goo and disintegrated. And then this crazy alien went, half disintegrated down a waterfall. His molecular structure did things in the water. And Thus the seed of life was planted on earth.

Then ages later the space jockeys came back to earth and helped early- man draw a diagram of some far away stars. Why did they do this you ask , well ....

The space jockeys now wanted to kill man (I don't know why) so they hatched a clever plan. They took some massive spaceships to a planet called LV-223 and there they created a new black goo which does horrible random things.

And there they would wait, wait until mankind became clever enough to decipher the diagrams of far away stars and come .

Even if it took 70 million years they would wait, and one day man would come and would die by black goo!! That was the plan.

Unfortunately the space jockeys on LV-223 were terrible at handling the black goo and ended up spilling it or something. They did after all, keep the containers of goo on the floor. It was a disaster, some ran down corridors and fell over and their heads fell off, all but one space jockey died. The elaborate goo plan had failed - or had it -

Humans did eventually show up. All was not lost, thought the goo. One human got goo inside him and horrible random things happened.He promptly had sex with the main character. Another guy became a zombie, The women gave birth to a slimy thing and the captain played the concertina.

Meanwhile the last space jockey (remember him) got woken up by humans and a robot. And boy was he angry-

Unfortunately for him he ended up the victim of the slimy thing (which is now a giant facehugger).

Later- you'll never guess what bursts of out the poor old space jockey. An alien from Alien !! (more or less). Perhaps the space jockeys should have just blown earth up to kill their creations the humans instead of the goo plan. Being a super race and everything.

Thus ends the events of LV-223 So that's how aliens happen according to Prometheus. Leading perfectly into the 1979 film Alien - where they land on LV 426 .

Understand? No me Neither.

Ridley Scott's latest film is utter nonsense just like the above. Personally, I discount it from the Alien canon (just like Resurrection and Alien vs predator ). I do however count batman/aliens by DC/Dark horse comics 1997.

One star for the visuals (you don't really get enough sequences of Prometheus itself doing stuff) And one star for Michael Fassbender (whose character motives are as crazy as the space jockeys .","2"
"cultfilmfreaksdotcom","Promalien","8 June 2012","For years it was rumored Ridley Scott was directing a prequel to ALIEN. Turned out to be a remake. A bulky spaceship full of scientists mixed with a working class crew; a crafty humanoid robot with a trick up his sleeve; an alien popping out of someone's belly; a tomboy heroine – ring a bell or two?

Actually the story's set in the ALIEN universe and the spaceship, rather than heading home, is destined for a planet with possible lifeforms. Two research scientists, including Dr. Shaw played by Noomi Repace, have discovered cave paintings with a similar theme – and a dying millionaire has backed their mission. The ship is called PROMETHEUS and the important crewmembers include Michael Fassbender as David, a robot who models himself after Lawrence of Arabia, and Charlize Theron's Vickers is the tough corporate head.

Although Repace's Shaw fills the Sigourney Weaver role, in one scene Vickers refuses a contaminated crewmember back aboard the ship. The planet consists of a or what seems like a ""giant cave"" wherein illuminated wraiths roam while hidden slimy creatures provide the necessary body count slaughters. There are a few action scenes and the special effects, particularly in 3D, look fantastic. But the problem are the characters, none standing out or likable enough for the audience to really care about their frantic survival which, after the searching has run its course, PROMETHEUS is all about.

In the acting department, Fassbender has a nifty look but lacks the sinister charm of Ian Holm; Repace only shines when she's fighting to live; Theron is more robotic than Fassbender; and the scruffy crew provide filler roles. Ultimately there are fewer answers than questions in a canvas stretched beyond its paint, which in a script co-written by LOST's Damon Lindelof isn't surprising.

And though it would be a sin to give anything really important away, the big finale twist isn't so much connected to the story itself, but the film's... promotion. We'll stop there.

"leon_normand","A lot like Gladiator, except....","25 April 2013","...Gladiator was good.

I gave it a 4 for the pretty sets & vistas.

Example of character decision-making: If a big, donut-shaped OBJECT is rolling at you edge-on, would you A: run straight away from it, making it inevitable that you'll be crushed B: turn right and quickly avoid the object C: turn left and quickly avoid the object

50% of the movie's characters in this situation failed this test...

And that was NOT EVEN the most stupid decision made by a character in the movie, which featured the most undisciplined, careless explorers available on the Earth, apparently.

Horror works when the characters behave logically, even bravely - and they still get slashed, eaten, squashed or whatever. It DOESN'T work with idiots (""Look! A dead crewman is suddenly at the door! Let's open it!!"")

BTW, Mr. Scott apparently still has a REAL HA*DON for human-looking devices (Alien, Blade Runner). He doesn't trust 'em...","4"
"delnegro-IMDb","The only good thing about Prometheus is how forgettable it is","17 April 2015","The science and protocol are nonsensical, the characters one-dimensional, the directing seems to lack any sense of direction, and the only surprising thing about the plot is how it manages to get cheesier and more predictable with each new development.

Given the quality of the script and direction, it's hard to blame the actors for their haphazard performances, but the only one displaying believable emotions is Michael Fassbender, and he plays a robot. Idris Elba is competent as usual, but his character is such a cliché (token black captain gett'n too old fo' dis sheet) that I was half expecting him to pull off his face at some point to reveal Kirk Lazarus.

Even the over-hyped visual effects look like something from the previous decade, too sharp, lacking fluidity and subtlety, and with an overall attitude of ""look at me, I'm an expensive CG shot, I took ages to render"" (which is fine in a film like Pacific Rim, but not when you're trying to create a believable environment in which to tell a story) or ""look at me, I'm clearly a practical effect because I'm covered in goo and all I can do is wiggle back and forth"".

And one has to wonder if it was really so hard to find an 80 or 90 year old actor, instead of giving the role of Peter Weyland to a 44 year old with his face covered in so much rubber that it comes across as a misguided homage to Yogurt from Spaceballs.

Ridley Scott's attempt at emulating George Lucas and performing a ""murder by prequel"" on his own brainchild is just as successful (and seems born of the same roots - too much money, too few restrictions, too thick a bubble of sycophancy), but never manages to reach the same spectacular levels of fail. While Lucas' prequels (and ""remasterings"") are so bad they're almost funny, Scott's prequel is just flat and forgettable. Without the connection to Alien or the $125 million budget, it would be just a bad movie.

Blade Runner beware.","2"

I hope to convince them to turn the lens on Scott and get him to take a good hard look into himself. After ten minutes, no I'm being generous it wasn't that long, I knew that this film would be awful. When the crew of the good 'ship'(2093 space explorer)awake from their induced hibernation, immediately one of the drowsy travellers in the style of a gnarled gold panner with an 'overnight shadow' that the others have managed to avoid, launches into a stereotypical tirade reminiscent of class wars which surely should have been eradicated a long time before launch. Even more sure however is that such disparate characters would never have been selected to embark together. OK the special effects are good but when you have 130 million to play with why not but I reckon you could give 130 quid to a local am-dram troupe and get much better value for many.","2"

The gaping holes in the plot cannot be filled by even the best Blarney you may hear from the likes of Lindenhof. Fassbender, an actor who I have a tremendous amount of respect for and is probably the best actor of his generation, did a lot of Scott arse kissing in the marketing lead up to this movie... well, it is was all for naught, his head ends up in a bag in a scene reminiscent of a really bad school play.

"betahangya","One of the worst","3 July 2012","Because it is money and energy waste on a huge scale, it is endlessly stupid, beyond imagination, and, most of all, it makes absolutely every promise and keeps absolutely nothing. If you like when you are taken for a dumb in a company of dumbs, or have simply a masochistic nature you may find joy in this. Of course you can find (""imagine"" would be a better choice of word) always an _explanation_ for everything, but you don't need a movie for that. The only thing that makes you ""think"" here is: why this movie could happen. It is really as bad as any other freely chosen ""B"" ""sci-fi"" movie. Except for that a ""B"" movie is really more intelligent. Simply because it doesn't take itself seriously, it knows it can't. So it has space for fun and for play. This ""Prometheus"" isn't fun or play or anything. There is only one scene in the movie that was fun and satisfying, where the corporate no-brain life-paranoid ultra-bitch is killed by a gigantic alien spaceship as it beautifully slowly rolls (!) over her. Haha, I laughed, that was seriously funny, I loved that! That was the climax. Says everything about this endless non-sense called movie. The recipe is, as in any other TV commercial: make huge promises (as here in the first 3 minutes), but don't satisfy the audience, not even by accident! (This seemed very important in this concept! Maybe there was an extra team for the task to purge potentially good scenes, or make them, at least, as bad as possible.) This moving picture is a bruised, bad-looking whore.

It's been over thirty years in the making, but Scott has finally got to further his story in the Alien galaxy. It's not a direct prequel to the original movie, it just happens to be in the same stratosphere.

And the film is almost flawless. Like Bladerunnr, Scott has given us a film that will cause many a discussion in years to come. I have my opinions on the structure and narrative of the film, some may agree, most will not.

This film is about the meaning of life, and I truly believe that Scott has put almost as much of Bladerunner into this film as he has with Alien.

The majority of the people on the ship know that these engineers designed us, they want to know how humans came about getting 'emotion' as David (and maybe Vickers) do not have that gift.

The film questions religion and faith, and the holy grail of the franchise, the birth of the xenomorph.

Visually the film is perfect, Scott is all about landscape, and the use of 3D is done very well in this.

Fassbender is the main draw here, ironically giving the film it's heart and soul. Theron too, is very good, and I am still convinced that she is a replicant n this (she refers to Weyland as father (maker) and she references a pleasure model in one scene). I may be shooting of target, but this is my humble opinion.

The film isn't scary, so don't go expecting horror.

But expect something that is truly intelligent and will have your attention for the duration.

"mrpatras","El sueño de la razón produce monstruos - Goya","25 October 2012","I don't know where to start. I saw it on the plane trying to kill 9 hours of flight. I watched it and could not make any sense of it. I got hold of a BluRay two weeks later, and the perception was unchanged. I cannot divulge the plot as I believe that there is no plot. A kind of a (pre)Alien thing adding a lot of CG, keeping some names in the line of action such as Weyland. The first Alien was great. I loved it from the beginning. I liked the following three as well. At the same time with the first Alien I saw Predator I (Arnold), second one – I cannot remember it well. It came along Alien VS Predators (acceptable), then another Alien VS Predators that I also cannot remember and further Predators. I feel like counting hundreds and still counting. Mr. Scott's latest puzzles me. A talented director that seems to have ran out of imagination and perhaps because of the fear of taking up gardening as a new hobby starts milking a quarter of a century old cow. With the current computer capabilities people can do ANYTHING. Why not take up on Clarke, Asimov, Klein, or any of the brilliant science fiction writers that can bring substance and intellect to the big screen? Why pursuing on Alien CXVII? Every line of this movie is an attack to intelligence. What was the purpose of the old Weyland? David? The ship commander that looked like a guy that sells drugs in Hillborow – no stance, or charisma. A biologist and geologist both red necked. For a mission of such magnitude to use such characters is bizarre. It reminds me of Idiocracy. As a matter of fact if the name of this movie was Idiocracy 2 I would have probably marked it up. The basic science in this film is trashed. The reasoning does not have major flaws; it does not exist at all. And, of course, the film ended in suggesting a continuation which is bad news already.","1"
"namob-43673","A competent but failed joke of a movie","22 February 2022","The best part of this movie is that the cartographer is the first to get lost, the biologist is the one that wants to touch an alien life form with no protective gear, no testing or study and we have a leader refuses to lead. Not to mention we learn how to run away from things...

All those things are good and well, and should get a chuckle out of anyone watching this nonsense. The evil android, which apparently is a must in an Alien movie, is also pretty funny. Sadly here the jokes end and instead we have a director and writers and actors trying to convey a decent movie and failing at it. I wish they had stayed with the humour, somehow that made the movie better. Crossing an episode of Red Dwarf with the Alien franchise, an attempt Red Dwarf managed to pull off were this movie does not, is all good and well but as said we also need to have some body horror, action and other stuff.

Now this movie is not completely incompetent. It is beautiful, most of the actors do a great job, cinematography and sound design is all great and CGi is mostly flawless. The story is neither that dumb - I actually think the premiss of this movie is pretty great. In other words I can tell there is a good movie hiding here somewhere. Not sure why it is not coming out, neither sure as to why the comedy show I mention above occurs either, but I assume the director, show-runners and the studio had different ideas and tried to tick too many boxes instead of making a good movie.

This cannot be recommended, and I have it at an abysmal 3/10, but I can see one or two people liking this. And if you are bored I am sure there is drinking games to this failed joke of a movie. For normal people though stay away.","3"
"tomimt","Scott's stunning return to sci-fi","6 June 2012","Seeing Prometheus left me in a stunned silence. For a moment I sat in my seat and thought to myself: ""What have I just seen?"" After a moment of silence I asked myself ""Is this a good or a bad question?"" And in all honesty I enjoyed of what I saw, Scott taking me for a ride in the future, playing around, teasing me with oh so familiar bits and pieces from Alien. In many places Scott dangles the bait, winking, ""see, this is Alien... but it is not. And then again it is."" Visually Prometheus is stunning. Scott proves that he's not just at the top of his game, but he has given everything to create Prometheus a visually astonishing movie despite the alien planet is visually less interesting than some other alien worlds. But that bleakness of a dying world is mesmerizing and Gigers designs are just as pleasing as they've always been.

Basic story is as simple as it gets: We go somewhere we shouldn't have and we pay the price. But in this simple story Scott asks some grand questions, which he doesn't answer. And those grand ideas are what left me stunned.

I don't know if Prometheus will become a classic such as Alien is. But what matters is, that Scott still has it and he is much bolder than many other sci-fi directors out there. He doesn't want to let you go to the world where good and bad are basic concepts. Everything is, in the end, gray matter.","7"
"jradbrown","17 douches flounder in a tunnel and kill each other","16 June 2012","***Spoilers !!!

Incredible film. So- 17 people selected by crazy trillionaire to fly to outer space to douche around with aliens. Got it.

The characters of Prometheus, i assume, have trained, studied, prepared themselves- For most of their lives- In order to better understand the known and unknown universe. Scientists, archaeologists, geologists- Brought together for their unrivaled skill, knowledge, and experience to tackle the most ambitious space mission in history- To meet mankind's makers.

...That is all i really knew about Prometheus before i i paid my 20 clams too see it on the big screen. So, it was a surprise to me, as i'm sure it was to many others- that every person on the ship was brain dead clown. This was the first anomaly that i found disturbing in Prometheus. Another was that- of all the brain dead morons on the ship- they were also mostly, kind of- annoying douche bags. After i got my head around the whole ""douchebag tools on a space ship"" thing, I was in a bit of a spin, i'm kind of hazy after that- it was hard to follow but i did get the main bits-

Charlize Theron has some random promiscuous sex with the Captain of the ship (Cap offers to bone her just after they land, while everyone else is exploring alien life forms etc...pretty ambitious move from the Cap...you don't see it coming...you kind of think that because they are pretty much re-writing the natural history of the universe by the second, that a ""cheeky root"" might not be on the cards...but...it is!...sweet times Cap), and, at the same time as the rooting, another of the douche scientists are playing/frolicking with an Alien life form in this Alien tunnel world. At that point- things get pretty hairy-

The tunnel world starts getting out of control with these crazy giant holograms running around....And a lot of the douche bags start falling like flies. So, whilst it's all happening, people die in lots of different ways- Sometimes it is because the scientists poke at the newly discovered alien life forms and the aliens attack them, sometimes- it is because there is a cunning anarchist robot that goes round with this crazy dice-man vibe, that makes random decisions that are possibly based on some movies/TV shows that he watches at the start of the film; this robot dice-man guy goes around icing the douches. And sometimes- Im not even sure if some of the douches die, they just kind of disappear out of the film, and your not sure if they were there in the first place or not. There is also this weird sub plot based on this Christian necklace cross and this annoying douche who gets drunk in the science lab while he watches some of the geologists explode an alien head. Somehow the dice-man robot gets the cross (some significance...i think), and then one of the main scientist chicks gets a caesarean.

Thats kind of where it all wraps up. After the caesarean, there are numerous crazy-alien-freak-out fight scenes, and space ship smashing round with huge sub sound effects. Definitely some kind of sub plot to do with birth- you got the caesarean + there are heaps of other aliens that give birth to other aliens and sh*t, you got heads that explode and DNA and other sh*t like that.

Did like- All the crazy douche bags running round the tunnel.

Didn't like- wish they had some sweeter guns and space vehicles.

Def worth seeing, if you feel like one day you could maybe be a scientist or geologist.","1"

I wouldn't give them that much really, even Fassbender. He did a passable job as an android, but sheesh! Rapace could have done something more original, not a Ripley clone! And I thought all through the movie that the blonde was the supposed ""Captain"", but no. The pilot really was, for as soon as he says he's going to ram the alien ship, she goes running for an escape capsule! Ohhh, I get it. She indicates she is Weyland's daughter, so Daddy gave her a whole big ship to play with! And the pilot! He spends the whole movie looking like some extra they hired, then suddenly he's a hero? Please!!! And to make it worse, two other flight crew join him, both of them treating dying as just another job. Totally unbelievable really.

In another scene, we have two ""scientists"" treating a new alien animal as if it were some cute little puppy dog, heh heh...I mean, seriously, these two actually lean closer so the snake looking thingy can attack them more easily...come on, too stupid to be believed...

No, I wasn't impressed with this outing in the ""Alien"" universe. And here's why: Far too many reused pieces of dialog from all the Alien films. I detested the call ""We are LEAVING!"" That line belongs to Michael Biehn, and him alone, it was so well delivered! Too many recognizable scenes from other Alien films. I won't describe the entire movie, so you judge for yourself. It actually looked like they cut and pasted the script at times, for crying out loud.

One particular scene has always bugged me too. When the Prometheus rams the Engineers ship, it is a mile or more from Rapace and the Captain...so how is it that the alien ship drops right on top of the two ? A really big glitch for me and continuity...

At least they had some very good CGI visuals throughout, that's the best I can give them...

I paid my 20 bucks for the DVD Mr Scott, so you made some money off me. Now I understand the reasoning behind holding back the release, more chance to con as much as you could out of it.

Someone actually started a comments topic as to people feeling that film makers owe the audience. GEE, what a novel idea!!! Of course they owe us stupid! If we didn't expect quality, we wouldn't buy, would we. This movie was not quality Mr Scott","5"
"Hunt2546","The Flaw","10 June 2012","It doesn't seem that anybody's got it yet, so let me explain why all the disappointment with ""Prometheus."" It's that the climactic sequence is arbitrary; i.e., it is not expressive of the ideas of the movie. For an hour and 50 minutes, the film has teased us with provocative whispers along ancient alien lines (Erik Von Dannekin, call your lawyer!), suggesting that life on earth was a kind of experiment by a superior human type with really good abs, who donated a key bit of DNA to the compote that would become life on earth. Not new, but always fun. But at a certain late point, Sir Ridley can get no more thrills out of it, so the movie turns, arbitrarily, into a low vaudeville form that might be called ""The sky is falling, the sky is falling!"" and watches while two Chicken Littles try and avoid being squashed by a rolling piece of space junk. It's exciting as spectacle but meaningless as drama; it has nothing to do with the issues evoked and everything to do with sociopathic gravity. It the space junk had kerplunked to earth a hundred yards this way or that, (spoiler) the ordeal by rolling steel donut would have been avoided and if one of the little chicks had run 50 feet to the left instead of continuing 200 yards on the straight ahead, she wouldn't have ended up as part of the asphalt. The movie can be likened to a '78 red Saville ragtop with the engine of a Corvair. All dressed up and it goes 22 miles an hour!","6"

Now Jon Spaihts, Damon Lindelof and director Ridley Scott have teamed up to bring us this nightmarish movie called "" Prometheus. "" The story is that of an aging rich and powerful C.E.O. of the Weyland Corporation who provides the funds for an deep space intergalactic spacecraft called the U.S.S. Prometheus, it's mission? to seek out the origins of mankind, based on ancient languages and cave drawings. Because it takes years to traverse the length of space, the team sleeps through the entire trip. The only member of the crew who does not hibernate is an android named David. (Michael Fassbender) He awakens the Captain (Idris Elba) and the mission crew including Charlie Holloway, (Logan Marshall-Green), (Noomi Rapace) Elizabeth Shaw, Charlize Theron and Peter Weyland (Guy Pearce). Upon landing, they set out to explore the waiting planet not realizing it contains a dark and sinister secret. The film's landscape is intersperse with vast empty areas pockmarked with mountains, ominous caves and gigantic monoliths which resembles those of Earths' past. Although what is sought is the secret to immortality, what is actually found is enough to keep many of the audience members from sleeping alone in a dark room. Suffice to say it's interesting to see Guy Pearce as an aging billionaire, but more so to see Mr.Ridley Scott returning to his roots. ****","8"
"ikalujny","Reboot that doesn't deliver","3 July 2012","To keep long story short the movie is two-fold. From one side it can be considered a reboot of the original film with all the gimmicks that made the first film a cult, i.e. oral rape with men on the receiving end, childbirth, etc. But either they are done too explicitly or they just don't work the second time, but the overall experience is a flop.

The other side of the film tries to appeal to thinking man's questions like where have we come from, whats the purpose etc., but there is definitely not enough substance to it; This part of the movie feels out of place.

Also events throughout the movie are poorly connected and undeveloped.

Yes, there are some nice special effects, but some of them seem cliché and a copy-paste from a number of different places ( ex.: the vehicle used to travel between Prometheus and the alien ship was pulled straight from mass effect video games series, etc )

"Dave_ATC","Review: Prometheus - Welcome Back Ridley Scott!","10 June 2012","In Greek mythology, Prometheus was a figure who represented the human fight for more, and the quest for more scientific knowledge.

The meaning of life, the process of creation; from The Big Bang Theory, to religious prophecies, to dinosaurs and cave men; it's been something humans have been trying to figure out since the dawn of time.

Ridley Scott was determined to answer the question of creation, by going to the future, and taking a ship where it's never gone before.

Noomi Rapace plays Dr. Elizabeth Shaw, one of the two main scientists for the mission aboard Prometheus along with Logan Marshall-Green who plays Dr. Charlie Holloway. This has been their life mission, and their biggest discovery to date.

They are recruited by Meredith Vickers, a distant, cold, money and power hungry woman played by Charlize Theron. Theron does a good job as the quasi-antagonist with an agenda. The most interesting character they encounter is David, he looks like a human, but is indeed an android, played by Michael Fassbender.

With rumors swirling for about two years that this was a prequel to Ridley Scott's 1979 gold mine Alien, Scott made it a point to shoot down said rumors any chance he could. He stated that Prometheus was strong enough to stand on it's on as a film, even though it would take place in a similar universe. Still the skeptics did not believe him.

With Scott coming back to the Sci-Fi genre, you knew he wasn't going to half-ass it. And it shows. The film is so beautiful, the visuals, the universe which the film takes place in. From the structures, to the discoveries, it's awe-inspiring. The special effects are few and far between, on purpose by Scott who was determined to use as much ""real"" footage as possible as to not tarnish the movie, or make it look like a joke.

This film is all about the thought process within. The search for creation, and answers to our beginning are beyond complex, and after watching this, maybe you'll understand why it's better off not knowing.

Fascinated by their purpose to find answers, the oddity of the film lies with David, played brilliantly by Fassbender might I add. In a role unlike he has ever played before, when we are introduced to him, you can't help but be confused by his mannerism, his speech pattern, and eventually the reasoning for his actions. Being an android means, you're not human, with no feelings or conscious. David states all these things many times, as he is aboard the ship to help those on board with anything they may need. Here's a major connection I madeBack to the mythology...

The titan Prometheus was a servant to the Gods, which aptly describes what David was created for, and, what his role was aboard the ship. Fassbender delivers the best performance of the film, the best performance by any actor in a film this year,so far, and I will be shocked if he doesn't at least get an Oscar nomination for Best Supporting Actor.

More kudos have to be given to Rapace, who leads this film with force. Her character Elizabeth Shaw is so strong, believable, she fights for her cause, and is willing to risk it all. Rapace is sheer brilliance on screen, and is featured in a scene that will be remembered for a very long time for it's horror, gore and shock. Prometheus will be the vehicle that drives Rapace to becoming a household name.

I can't over state how aesthetically pleasing this film is. Forget the nonsense like Avatar, this may be the most visually beautiful film I have ever seen. Nothing is given color unless it is needed, every structure and stone served a purpose, it didn't look cheap, and it's simply mesmerizing.

If we are looking to minus points from the film, the one thing I can point to where the lack of character development, and the inability to defend the actions of the characters. This mainly is attributed to too many chefs in the kitchen, or characters on board the ship in this case. There was not enough screen time, or story to make each of them meaningful. It's almost as if there were major scenes cut out of the film that would have better explained certain actions, and reactions. These issues can be overlooked, but during the film you are often wondering why someone did what they did, and unfortunately there is no definitive answer.

We can also attribute the above to Damon Lindelof, who just so happened to write the hit ABC sci-fi, mind-bending series LOST. There are major plot points at the start, middle and end that go unexplained, just like LOST. From the actual opening scene during the credits, to actions David does to Dr. Holloway. Gotta give us some closure!

I made it a point to tell as many people as possible to temper their expectations for this film, fearing, from the marketing, trailers and general taste of science-fiction films that it would be very hit or miss. If you go into a film expecting greatness, chances are it will disappoint. Maybe that helped me enjoy the film as much as I did.

Ridley Scott is a master of his craft, and we should thank him for coming back to the sci-fi genre. With this picture, he has produced another remarkable notch on his belt, as the direction, cinematography, and beauty of this film cannot be stressed enough.

Prometheus is the most entertaining, thought provoking, and visually pleasing film of the year. Being dumbfounded and blown away after a film is rare to say the least, with Prometheus I was both, and still am.","9"
"proterozoic","Broken promise","10 June 2012","In hindsight, the promotional videos ended up as an excellent predictor. The short ""viral"" film about David the Fassbender was brilliant, and his parts in the movie were great. Guy Pearce in the ""TED talk"" video came off as Eldon Tyrell's phony, pompous kid brother - and that's just how his whole plot line played. The trailer was visually spectacular, but sounded pretentious without much to back it up. We hoped it wouldn't be so, but it is.

First things first, Scott knows how to direct, and Prometheus may be the best-looking movie of the decade. Just for that, I don't regret putting down $15 for a 3D screening. After all the weak CG and derivative action we've been watching for years (orcs on jet-skis in Avengers, anything by Bay or Snyder), it's good to see amazing practical sets, tasteful computer graphics, and effects that FEEL REAL.

It's just too bad that the screenplay is murky, overwrought twaddle without a single memorable line or character. Fassbender is good. Noomi Rapace is good in distress, although, after a certain point, one has to wonder how she could run and jump without massive bleeding and hemorrhages. Almost everyone is flat, disposable, irrational and stupid.

The biggest bubble of them all is when people praise the movie for ""raising questions."" We're science fiction fans. We've read Wells, Asimov and Clarke. All these questions have already been raised long ago, we've been thinking about them for decades. Clarke did panspermia in ""Cradle,"" Sagan did theology in ""Contact,"" and Scott himself did gooshy monsters, evil androids and space ruins in ""Alien."" What Prometheus should have done was explore these questions, and it didn't.

There are dozens of reviews here right now from furious Brits who list the flaws, the plot holes, the perfunctory theology, the pointless twists, the stupidity of every character. There's not much I can add to that, but I would like to tie the awful science of it together. Man, the biology was bad. For a movie about genetic engineering, holy Christ was the biology bad.

So check this out. In the beginning, Earth appears barren. Giant, pale alien humanoids seed it with life. In the first inexplicable move, one of them has to drink some goop and disintegrate into a waterfall. But why?? If they can travel through the galaxy and create biospheres from scratch, surely they'd have found a way to do it without killing off one of their own guys.

OK, now DNA is in the water. Now what? Do we start out with microorganisms that diversify and organize themselves into multicellular life? Do they radiate into plants & animals, fungi, extremophiles, occupy every niche on Earth and and go through the evolutionary history that we know and love? Does this process take 3.8 billion years, and leave fossils in every geological strata? In that case, the DNA that ended up in the water must have been chopped down into really small, basic chunks. After all, if humans and holothurians have a common ancestor, it must have been pretty simple. Then how, after billions of years of mutation, did Earth produce bipedal humanoids that look incredibly similar to the ones who seeded it in the first place, down to six-pack abs and everything? Wouldn't that be vanishingly unlikely?

But wait. In the movie, they run a DNA scan on one of the aliens... and it matches human DNA exactly! But how? Didn't we evolve from goop on planet Earth? How in the world did we end up with the exact same genetic code as the beings that poured some DNA into a river billions of years ago? Even two populations of the same species, if they are split up, will begin to lose their similarities due to genetic drift.

Maybe, somehow, the Engineers programmed Earth's biosphere to produce, among millions of species in every conceivable environment and niche, with every conceivable body plan, chemistry and life cycle, something that had their exact DNA. However, those guys are nine feet tall, completely hairless, and pale like cave slugs. Wouldn't there be some differences between their DNA and ours? How come we aren't nine feet tall? How is there a genetic match with so many phenotypic differences?

You can either bash nitpickers and use the generic IMDb response, ""But it's just a movie! It's entertainment!"" Or, you can try to defend Prometheus as intelligent science fiction. But intelligent science fiction can't have dismal junk science. You can't break biology, then try to ride out on ""raising questions.""

Sometimes, it feels like we've entered the Age of People Losing their Touch. Indiana Jones 4... The Star Wars prequels... Now this. Ridley Scott... you sure know how to shoot movies, but please, get a decent writer next time...","6"
"Akira-36","A faded carbon copy of what could have been a masterpiece","9 June 2012","My high anticipation for Prometheus was answered with a sigh and a whimper. The cinematography, VFX and production design are spectacular. But little can be said of characterization and direction.

There are too many plot holes, lack of tension and good drama that we would expect of Scott's direction. None of the qualities that made Alien such a classic movie are present here.

In fact the entire journey felt like a faded carbon copy of what the original intended movie was - an Alien prequel. If they had stayed true to that plan, this would have been a slightly more enjoyable experience. Although it is a gorgeous looking movie with some allusion to the Alien franchise, I have no connection with any of the character. Except perhaps a little sympathy for David, but even his character is a conundrum.

The movie opens up well up to the point of the crew waking up from cryo-sleep. Even Cameron's 2-dimensional gung-ho Marines from Aliens were much more tangible and sympathetic than this bunch of riff-raff of pseudo scientists. The aliens in this movie are also weak, comical and reminds me of raw seafood.

They don't scare nor disturb me. There is a couple of gory scenes but they had no lingering impacts because they were executed in such abandon for logic and care.

Then there is the Engineers who have a different origin and look than the ones we came to know from the comics. The planet they were on is not the same as the one from the Alien and Aliens, and it's a different ship too.

I was left wanting and felt betrayed by Scott. A sad disappointing movie that is only slightly better than AVP.","6"
"cox526","Failien","11 June 2012","What a disappointment- the long awaited prequel never really grips and lacks the suspense and drama of the original movie. With Ridley Scott back in the helm, there were great expectations there are some moments but they never hold your attention long enough and you keep wondering when is it going to take off when is there going to be any suspense as to what the deadly creature may do or look like or whatever- When action happens; it just happens no build up to it. A film that has great visual and stunning effects but lacks the ingredient that made Alien so excellent- with Alien you were kept on the edge of the seat you wondered what was around the corner. sadly this film you couldn't care less what was around the corner by the time it ends you are pretty well glad the credits are rolling.

"timo-hellmund","Ridley Scott did not forget where he comes from...","18 August 2012","This is one of the most interesting SciFi films in recent history.... maybe the best since Inception. The atmosphere is so intense, you could cut it with a knife. It alone creates the thrill of the film almost on its own.

Another aspect are the hand-crafted sets. They are incredibly impressive and huge and have some kind of a nostalgic feeling so every SciFi fan just need to be impressed. It is good to see directors still know what real set design is and do not create everything in the computer, which mostly looks artificial. Not to mention, the real sets have big impact in the plausibility of Prometheus.

The cast is chosen well. Noomi Rapace and Michael Fassbender do a great job and you really feel with their characters. Seriously, I don't get why so many critics think those characters are not memorable. They are. Even if they are quite flat and mostly are written in standard alien film clichés. Yes, you got those ""the stupid guy"", ""the nerd"", ""the freak"" characters. However, even those have some good scenes which they do not get in other Alien / slasher films. Even those flat and useless characters find or reveal something useful for the plot or for the myth.

The images of the landscapes are mind-blowing. Island really is a beautiful country. It must be inspiration for the whole planet's CGI. You really want to see how everything looks in this foreign place.

Thanks to the clear and non-shaky camera works (thank god!), the 3D is one of the best since Avatar. It is used for building up depth and atmosphere, not for stupid ""grabbing the audience"" effects. Which is great and makes the film even more believable.

Of course, there is some action but this is not the main aspect. If you want to see Alien bang boom shock slasher, you really won't like this film. Everyone else, who is bored by non-stop-action, has to go watch it.

The ending is great and makes every alien film fan cheer. It is a good ending and I don't care what other critics say. They mostly have no idea what they are writing about, nowadays.

AND! The most satisfying part: The music! This film has a melody! There are still film melodies on this planet. Praise the composer for having more talent in making a score which is very memorable than a lot of others of his kind.

This film is great. Not perfect, but if you don't care about flat characters and some minor mistakes, you will enjoy it. Please go revisit this film. It deserves way more box office sales.

Thank you Mr. Scott for coming back to the SciFi genre. You have been missed.","9"
"BharatSamra","Did it Ridley end like that?","16 July 2012","*I would first just like to apologise for the horrendous punny title.

Unaware of its existence as a prequel to Ridley Scott's original 1979 Alien, I approached the ""first screen on your right (enjoy the film)"" unknowledgeable, with exceedingly high expectations due to the unconventional word of mouth, natural technique of marketing.

Aesthetically fulfilling does not do this picture justice. Its estimated $130 million budget enhances the attractiveness, but as we all know, money cannot buy personality. To commence, this film has a personality, a purpose, with an intriguing concept of space exploration in the hope of discovering mankind's greatest question of our existence, abolishing Darwinism in the process. Absurd right? Wrong, well wrong in terms of Ridley Scott's ability to explore some logic and reason behind the idea. Furthermore, we feel a great sense of humanity from our homo sapien (or not) protagonists, which brings it right back down to earth (pun intentional). Ironically however, our greatest sense of humanity establishes itself from our least human character, an android, David, portrayed by Michael Fassbender. His performance within the cast is that of a Usain Bolt on the race track, while the other racers are talented and adequate for their role, their names are forgotten amidst being outshined by the one, one step ahead of them in their respective profession.

Prometheus emerges as another I can add to my collection. Abstract noun. The collection is a thought, consisting of many recent pictures I have seen, embarking on a pattern of decline; decline of quality, of substance, originality and self interest. A scatter graph presenting a negative correlation, we started so well, so high, yet we fell, fell to where we began, at the bottom. Null hypothesis? Down to chance? Absolutely not, Scott and the writers are well aware of their decision to leave aspects of the plot unresolved, and motives of the characters unexplained in order to accommodate for a sequel which will reportedly fill the gap between Prometheus and Alien. Necessary? No. After a strong first 50 minutes or so, this picture's tragic flaw is its acknowledgement that there is more to come from the Alien story, though this should not excuse the fact that the narrative is left as open as the Universe we live in, the one they are exploring. This film has, excuse me, HAD, as much potential as the ambition of Elizabeth Shaw (played by Noomi Rapace) and Chris Holloway (Logan Marshall-Green) in their determination to meet our 'engineers', our creators. It could be an advantage of not knowing Prometheus to be a prequel because it enables one to objectively review the film for what it is. What it is is a motion picture that was begging to conclude itself and the ongoing series. Had Scott and the producers done this, Prometheus would have been a stand alone prequel that exceeded audience expectations, as well as my own.

Sunshine + Alien vs. Predator = Prometheus is the best equation that can be used to describe the atmosphere outputted by the 30ft X 70ft screen (approximately). Forgive me for not having seen the 1979 original, so I can only assess this 2012 release against the more contemporary releases in the series, along with its similarities with the 2007 Danny Boyle sci-fi drama Sunshine. What does Prometheus equal? Unfortunately, too much of the prequel is left unanswered for that equation to be completed.","8"

To sum it up, the movie was a large disappointment.

First the good: The graphics. The graphics were great. The acting was pretty good but they had to deal with the horrible script.

Now the bad: The script was awful. The plot holes were so numerous, so ridiculous, it was just awful. For example, Prometheus is the story of a trillion-dollar mission to discover the origins of human life on a distant planet. Basically, this is supposed to be the greatest exploration undertaken in the history of mankind.

So who do they send? A gaggle of fractious goons whose collective scientific nous is rivaled only by that of the Three Stooges. Within minutes of touching down (conveniently beside the only 'man-made' structures on the planet, ala 1960s Star Trek) the 'scientists' are yanking off their helmets, on the basis of 'it seems fine to me', dipping their fingers into strange organic ooze, and lugging a severed alien head back to an unquarantined spaceship in a sandwich bag.

"dslowen","I blame myself... I got my hopes up","17 June 2012","This review is not so much a way to influence people's opinions about this movie, but more of a way for me to vent. (Btw, I have seen core of the Alien movie series, but am not basing my review off it's connection, but as a stand alone)

First the positives! The musical score was without a doubt the most sweepingly intrinsic score in a movie I have heard in a long, long time. The low tones and rich depth just make you want to stare out at the stars and wonder. Bravo!

Michael Fassenbender was amazing. He was the most interesting character in the film and created such a great persona, (despite the weak dialog he was given and the plot holes he had to keep jumping over along with his fellow actors). The monotoned delivery of his lines and the manner in which he carried himself was beautifully subtle. He really reigned back his emotions which made him so untouchable and rather chilling.

The effects: the creatures, makeup and cg was top notch. The best cg is when you don't think about it, it just blends into the movie without dominating it, and this film succeeded. The makeup, except for Guy Pearce who looked like a poorly painted prune, was great. The white aliens were simple and elegant in look and design, and not like many aliens that go for an over the top, complicated, silly look.

The visuals of landscapes,setting, and cinematography were at times breathtaking. However, here is where I really begin the critique: The scenes were so quick I was never granted enough time to fully appreciate them and take it all in. I'm curious if there is one complete scene that lasts more than 3 seconds before it cuts to another (except for the rather superfluous stretched out scene of a ship/shooting star flying through space).

Also, what was with the dialog? Conversations between characters (there were too many characters and therefore weren't given enough time to be developed) was pointless. Why not fill moments with character development instead of non-plot progressing, cheap dribble? I didn't care if a character lived or died because I never got to know them! When will Hollywood learn the order of important: #1, interesting characters. #2, interesting, coherent plot. 3#, thought-out dialog. So long as you have these 3 in order we won't be critical of anything else!

The plot: simply put... full of holes. Now I'm more forgiving of sci-fi films when it comes to having mystery and unanswered questions in a story. But when you leave the film with more questions then answers there's a problem. There were too many loose ends and unexplained or unreasoned elements that chopped up the flow. It's almost like, as an audience, we weren't let in on the joke, and not allowed the ""ah ha!"" moment. We weren't gently lead through the plot, but forced along on a nonstop ride that lead down multiple paths to... nowhere.

So, while I expected this film to be added to the lofty ranks of sci fi brilliance as a mind bending, thrilling work, what I got was a sensory pleasing, yet confused film about humans and aliens.","6"
"sballegeer","Could have been so much better","15 July 2012","Interesting enough concept but I felt it was handled rather poorly. The visuals were stunning (but the 3D was weak) and it was great to see Giger's designs fleshed out a little more.

On the other hand, we have two young adults who have supposedly risen to the peak of their profession yet apparently haven't grown emotionally beyond being emo fifteen-year-olds. The interplay between them was almost unwatchable and left me feeling the movie was intentionally dumbed down way too far. There's far too many minor characters to even start to sort them out or care about them. The plot is a confusing mess which several times veers off on tangents which then whither and die without going anywhere.

And why not cast an old man to play an old man instead of using bad makeup on a younger man?

Overall, it was deeply flawed but it was still worth going to see for Giger's art.","6"
"joshbaileynch","Stylishly unsatisfying","11 June 2012","Let's start with the positives - the production design of this film is absolutely beautiful (as one expects in a Ridley Scott film) and the performances are generally very good. Theron is excellent as the corporate ice-woman, Fassbinder plays David (the robot crew member) with a nice sinister edge (though he's not nearly as worrying as Ian Holme's android in the original 'Alien') and Rapace works well as a far more sympathetic heroine than the one she played in 'Girl with a Dragon Tattoo'. The first half/third of the film works well in building slowly and generating a good deal of eager anticipation in the audience, but in a way this is where the film's problem lies. The film's second half/two thirds lacks the careful pacing and development of its opening section and we veer from something that feels character driven, to a narrative that descends into frantic plot delivery. The 17 man/woman crew of the ship provides too many characters for significant or convincing development and pretty soon characters are making drastic decisions with little real sense of what motivates them. Theron's character is a good case in point - initially she seems an interesting mystery but there is little done to resolve the huge number of questions we might have about her; why is she so hardened? What is her relationship with the corporation? What lies behind her relationship with her father? How come she's so willing to burn a lead member of her crew to a crisp? All these questions are raised, yet none are answered in any convincing or satisfying way. Similar problems emerge with David (Fassbinder) - while Holm's android had a clear set of reasons for his actions in Alien, there is little real sense of this in 'Prometheus'. In short - characters do an awful lot in this film; but don't expect to be given much understanding as to why they do these things other than because the plot wouldn't move on if they didn't.

There's also a real problem with the rather unresolved plot-line which offers an explanation of where the aliens came from in the first place. Giant, albino humanoids apparently have created them as a biological weapon to destroy humanity, but quite why they have done this and how characters in the film arrive at this conclusion is difficult to discern. There's also a dangerously ludicrous ending to the film which may remind some viewers of the frankly ridiculous ending of 'Mission to Mars'.

It's worth checking this film out for the visuals alone, but its no 'Alien', or 'Aliens' for that matter. Personally I'd have preferred a far simpler plot which did not feel the need to explain where the aliens came from in the first place; after all the mystery surrounding their origin is one of the things that makes them frightening","5"
"tor-claesson","Stupid, unrelatable and pretentious.","15 September 2017","It's taken me five years to write this review, and that's because I don't want to rant. It's difficult though, because whenever I think of Prometheus it's all I can do. My bile-barfing just won't stop when it comes to this movie. But I'll give it my best shot.

First off, I've got to say that this movie could have been good, perhaps even great, with but a few minor adjustments here and there. But no, as is, there's no way for this film to outrun it's flaws for as much as a second. They're always present, through every scene with every character from start to finish.

So, what is this flaw, which ruins everything for me? I'd narrow it down to two words: Relatability and Believability. This film is neither, and that's not because it's a film about aliens. The other movies in the Alien franchise are all pretty relatable, and pretty believable. They contain a sense of logic, both in their portrayal of the alien species and in their portrayal of the min characters. Prometheus, however, fails miserably on both accounts.

I'll try not to spoil anything for anyone who's not watched this film yet (oh, by the way, don't!), but a few examples of this inconsistency and unrelatability has to be put on the table. First off: The mission to find the source of life on earth, which takes the Prometheus expedition deep into space, is funded by a billionaire. It's repeatedly stated how much this man has spent on this journey, and still everyone from crew members to scientists appear to be the very worst and most incompetent in their field. That's just stupid. A redneck crew makes sense in Alien, where they're just flying a cargo ship, but not in Prometheus. Another insanely stupid thing about this movie is how all characters, consequently, disregard all safety protocols and common sense. Aggressive aliens snakes? Let's undress and take a selfie! An unknown atmosphere? Let's all take off our helmets. Utterly, fatally unbelievable. And then there's this new twist to the Alien life cycle. I'll try not to spoil anything, but I have a hard time figuring out how such a species ever could have evolved, since it appears to require both fungi spores and infertile human wombs to even be born.

There's more. The list goes forever on, but I won't let this review will turn into another rant. I've already written a few such on the topic of Prometheus on my blog, so go there if you want to read one. Instead I'll leave you with one final advise regarding this film:

"guy79-14-874142","Film making at it's best.","12 April 2013","Not many words are needed to sum this film up. For years I've imagined what led up to the events in 'Alien' and this certainly didn't disappoint. The script-writing is superb, the acting is superb and the endless unanswered questions from the '79 classic are all there. It's not often I watch a film and during it have that feeling of ""wow"" on more than one occasion but I'm happy to say this film manages it without any unnecessary effort. Tarantino has managed a similar thing with the new 'Django' movie, being true and respectful to the original, and this achieves the same. Certainly a film to savour and it you don't get goosebumps watching it, then you don't appreciate clever, well written, though-out film-making. A must see movie.","10"
"marianojf","Do not let the good reviews fool you.","20 June 2012","I know this is only entertainment, but in order to entertain there are certain goals that must be achieved. This movie deserved believable characters, believable situations, a top-level science fiction script and the best special effects of all time; unfortunately it has none.

If your idea of entertainment is that anything is possible because ""it is just a movie"", then you have a chance of enjoying this film. Otherwise, you will be seriously bothered by completely flat, silly, unbelievable characters; silly situations created because the characters are plain dumb; a script that offers a number of plot holes, very few suspenseful and uninteresting moments, scientific background that requires no degree in science to notice that are just foolish; and special effects that are as good as any other recent movie but by no means a reason to watch this one.

"bnitcamela","Disappointing prequel with sloppy story writing","7 June 2019","Was very much looking forward to this film when it was released in 2012, but sadly it was quite the let down for me, a long-time fan of the Alien franchise, especially, of course, the first two films.

This one invokes a little too much deus ex machina and open ended story arcs to really satisfy as a sci-fi marvel like the first two were, and on a much more limited budget I should add.

All in all this was a fun watch if a bit too long in duration, but it's good enough in this age of lackluster sci-fi movies and endless, usually disappointing (Last Jedi - UGGHHHH!!!!) comic book and Star Wars movie remakes/prequels/sequels.

My personal belief is that 7.0 is too high for this Ridley Scott offering but I'm not complaining even if I do feel a bit betrayed as a fan of his earlier work.","6"

Don't see this, pretend it doesn't exist. Don't ruin the Alien the way they ruined Darth Vader.

The incredible ambiance and atmosphere it pulls you in, Acting was top notch, the visuals and effects were stunning, The plot smartly developed and kept the tension at an all time high, The soundtrack was brilliant.

"Mr_Sensitive","Visually Extravaganza but Ordinary Story brings the whole movie down.","16 November 2012","I think people are too harsh on this movie. All I read was negative review after one another. It was so bad that I decide not to watch this movie. Several months went by I decide to give a try, after all it was Ridley Scott's film. I glad I decide to watch because I really enjoying this movie. Maybe because of the very low expectation but I truly enjoy it.

Synopsis: A team of explorer travels the universe in search of the ""Engineer"" the creator of human to ask them the meaning and origins of mankind. The journey turn fearful as the answer they seek is about to reveal.

I thought it was a great idea to mix sci-fi with mythology and they managed to do that very well. I also like the way it slowly link itself to the Alien movies. The main problem was the lack of character development and the suspense that were there in its predecessor. I suppose that was the thing that people are most disappointed about. Not just only that most characters are so underdeveloped to the point that you don't feel for them whatever what happen to them; but also some of the scene are quite impractical and plain out silly.

Now despite all that, even if you don't know if it was Ridley's film you will know that this is not an ordinary film. The art and craft are clearly showed this is not an ordinary direction because the visual, the direction and the production was stunning; and this cannot be don't if you don't have years of experience. Visually the CGI are just breath taking (especially the opening credit) As for the cast I thought they did a very decent job. Fassbender as an android steal the whole show and is by far the best actor. Noomi Rapace also did a pretty good job too. Apart from these two people I hardly see any reason for other character particularly Guy Pearce who appear for like 2 minutes and the other appear here and there briefly.

I enjoy the whole film and wish it was a little longer. Yes, the story was not good it wasn't a real mess; it is still watchable and pretty much enjoyable if your expectation was very low.

"jerry07","Even with low expectations, you will be bored","10 June 2012","This movie is barely worth a matinée and I would right away recommend waiting for it to come on Netflix or similar. It is unclear if anyone can even write a review containing a spoiler: not only the scenes are very predictable but they make no sense, seem to drop from nowhere and for no purpose and follows no logical order.

Ridley Scott's Alien and the incoming of Prometheus raised expectations so naturally, one may expect reviews affected by the hip going sour. But this is not the case. Even with no expectations, this movie is not well threaded as far as the storyline is concerned and direly suffer from story creativity (the visuals are fine).

You have all read the IMDb storyline so no need to repeat it. How I understand: engineered goo+albino alien= populate the earth with creatures, goo+worm=snake with acid-like blood (why? where does this come from?), goo+human=not sure what but that raging zombie made no sense and did not fit in the story at all, same goo + human having ""intimate relation"" prior to becoming a raging zombie=woman give birth to a squid, squid in a sterile isolated lab with nothing to eat = spontaneous growth out of nowhere to a giant squid, Albino alien+giant squid= Alien (like in the real deal, the Alien movie). Pfiou! We are glad the non-sense cycle ended here - I feared squid + android would create something even more awfully stupid. Again, no spoiler there. As a good sport, I clicked on 'contains spoiler' but you will all know it will happen next when you see the scene unfold.

This movie fails to create the climax of the first Alien movie. There is no suspense, plenty of screaming for no reasons (not even frightening), scenes with scientist who clearly have no scientific background or training (careless, not knowledgeable, erratic), ... the list is long. This is not the crew of the Nostromo. Did I mention the Albino aliens resembles the ones in John Carter ? (lack of imagination is the extra killer).

The grade of 4 I gave are for: - 2 points for Michael Fassbender (David) and Noomi Rapace (Dr. Shaw) performance. I thought their acting was done well all considering and within their characters. - One point for also for the 3D, I could resisted going leaving the theater before the end - One point for some of the visuals - they were very detailed and quite amazing at times, another disappointment at the end at this movie had great potentials but really no story.","4"

Characters were shallow and don't seem intelligent/qualified enough to be manning a space flight. Noomi Rapace appeared to reprise her stumbling role from Girl with the Dragon Tattoo; only less convincingly.

Things happen without so much of an explanation nor motive. ""Style"" over substance?

"dinalt10","Massively over-hyped","8 October 2012","For starters, let's agree that this is a very pretty film - the artistry and CGI is superb................but unfortunately it takes more than pretty effects to create a film.

And especially a film that's a prequel to a true Sci-Fi classic - Alien................and what makes this film even harder to stomach is Ridley Scotts involvement - yep, the genius who created the Alien universe.

This film is so bad it actually makes AvP look deep and meaningful!!! For the flaws of that film, at least it had action even though the plot left a lot to be desired.

There are so many plot holes it's laughable.................and to be honest, the storyline is so similar to the original Alien that it's like watching a 'made for TV' budget remake of Alien a lot of the time (which would be forgivable in a way if it wasn't for the budget and Scott).

However, the original Alien had believable characters - each with their own distinctive personality, and oozed suspense and class.

With Prometheus you get a bunch of misfits. This is from the corporation that spent a Trillion dollars or so on the expedition..........with handpicked scientists who may as well have been recruited from the most under performing college on Earth.

Just arrive at the planet, do an atmospheric survey on entering the planets atmosphere and conveniently find the site they're looking for within a few minutes just by looking - really high tech stuff here.

Let's face it, on first entering the alien craft they decide to remove their helmets - great move considering they could contaminate the craft, or be contaminated by bacteria or virus.

Then you get the robot (which despite the script is a stand out performance by Fassbender). But rather than acting in any way scientific, he decides to keep pressing buttons and interracting with alien goo in a cavalier fashion.

Oh, and the holographic 'black box' that's used.................why so appallingly bad. Maybe it was meant to look 'other worldly', but it just came across as poorly defined out of focus shapes..............seriously, these are supposed to be super beings, and they couldn't master HD lol.

Then of course there's the way they casually open the ship up for anyone outside - without establishing whether it's safe to do so.

The way they casually push electricity through one of the 'engineers' heads..............like a bunch of school kids playing with frogs legs and electricity. Then make no explanation for why the head explodes.

Could go on with the list of flaws in this film - each one further detracting from any sense of suspense or believability. The ending in particular is dire - take the decapitated robot and fly off in search of the 'engineers' home planet................really!!!! The same engineers who created biological weaponry they couldn't control, and the same engineers who wanted to wipe out all life on Earth.

It's rumoured there could be more Prometheus films to come...............I hope not, unless the script, acting and direction is a million times better.

A film that started well, but rapidly went downhill from there.","4"

(note to US readers, dear Americans it is football NOT soccer) Do you love how a team attacks and makes great passes in midfield and a finally a striker puts the ball in the net? And sometimes the attack builds very fine but at last point the striker makes a bad choice and the ball hits the post and goes out. The stands cry out a common response, ""uuhhh""! Yes, this is what Prometheus makes you feel.

Well maybe the expectations were high but even if there were no expectations, this movie still do not meet basic needs; a story that makes you think, a good plot, maybe a good twist or two and most important likable, convincing characters. None exists here. If I were a millionaire investing such a trip, I would never choose any of the ""scientists"" in this group for example. They might be street gangs or sales people maybe in health sector or football spectators - but scientists? No way.

In fact Mr. Scott gives us the hints of the movie in the very first 30 seconds ""behold, this movie will fall apart in front of your very eyes soon!"".

Final note: Dear Charlize, try running out of the way! A little to the left or right would do it. Are you a cartoon character?

"micskogabor","My take on Prometheus...","18 August 2012","I'm a huge fan of the Alien culture, even though the franchise didn't come up with anything substantial in the last fifteen years. After all this time, no one came close in creating such an iconic sci-fi universe which is in the same caliber as Alien. I would have given away my left kidney just to see a modern, mature Aliens movie which is faithful to the classics. Years have passed by, then director Sir Ridley Scott announced Prometheus . I wasn't sure what to expect from this title until the first trailers appeared. Watching these almost made me buy a cryo chamber to freeze myself until the release day. Now that I have finally seen the movie, I must say that the enormous hype, and the wait did pay off: Prometheus is my favorite movie of 2012 so far, even surpassing the highly regarded The Avengers by far.

Prometheus raises questions about ""who are we, what's our origin"", the Creation itself, without answering it. The film starts off in the supposed past, where a humanoid drinks a liquid material on a ridge of a waterfall, which makes it's body disintegrate conjugating it's remains with the water. But is this planet is Earth, and is this how life was created?

Shortly after this scene, we hop in time to the late 2000's: two archaeologist, Elisabeth Shaw (Noomi Rapace) and Charlie Holloway (Logan Marshall Green), find ancient, undiscovered cave drawings which they interpret as an invitation from their supposed creators. These paintings points them to a planet, LV-223, where they expect to meet them, the ""Engineers"". But will they find their genesis here?

Though the premise sound good, the script isn't flawless though. Certain elements of the story were left to our imaginations, and I didn't really got David's (Michael Fassbender) brilliantly acted, but unexplained motives. Character development leaves a lot to be desired, but the acting was spot-on for the most of the time. What makes Prometheus good though, is the fact that it's not afraid to experiment with new ideas. It differs both in tone and suspense from Alien, and still remaining solid and entertaining.

Visually speaking, there is much to behold here: mind-blowing special effects, (including the detailed Prometheus and the Engineer spaceship, the sandstorm, the aliens) crisp, vast array of colors, and 3D (which didn't seem forced at all) all packaged into an impressive scenery. I can't recall any better looking movie in recent memory. Audio-wise, the soundtrack was great. It didn't always fit the appropriate scene with the highly orchestral sounding, but overall Marc Streitenfeld did a terrific job.

Prometheus is an intelligent experience, and is not for everyone. You have to walk in the cinema with an open mind, and don't expect it to be a prequel to Alien, because you will be disappointed. Don't seek the scary, action packed nature of Alien/Aliens, just pay attention to the message the movie is trying to deliver.

"kaan-guven","A king has his reign, and then he dies.","7 June 2012","(CONTAINS SPOILERS. This subjective review is written by someone who has grown up with the sci-fi movies of the 70's 80's era, and thus, places Prometheus in contrast to their retrospective background . Note that this movie claims itself to be the ""prequel"" to one of the milestone movies of that era.)

At one scene, Meredith Vickers, holding her ought-to-be-dead father's hand, says coldly: ""A king has his reign, and then he dies. It's inevitable.""

Those words clung to my ears, making an inevitable referral to Scott's ambition to create a sci-fi movie. Alas...The entire acting in the movie is a manifestation of this bitter truth, save the visuals.

Because he wouldn't allow so shallow characters to wander around in his movies. Ripley would have kicked the butts of the entire cast (including extraterrestrial ones) in a single blow.

Because he wouldn't attempt to display and explain too much at the risk of plot-holes and lame conclusions. It's sci-fi. It's horror. The audience needed vague hints only. Why not let their imagination do the rest???

Undoubtedly, Scott was one of the ""engineers"" who created the classic sci-fi genre and the passionate generation of people enjoying it. Now, he is about to terminate all, like that extraterrestrial creator trying to wipe out the humans. Why? We do not know...

So, I am sending out a warning to any passing sci-fi fans to stay away from the movie, or discard their expectations.

This is Kaan, probably one of the last few survivors of the Nostromo, signing off.

"dfranzen70","Prometheus is bound to please","16 June 2012","If someone had to make a quasi prequel to Alien, I'm glad it was Ridley Scott. This dark, energetic, and unnerving thriller takes us to the purported point of human creation. It's as epic as the hype made it out to be, backed by a fluid, mysterious mythology and a passing nod to not only Alien itself but also to 2001: A Space Odyssey.

It's 2093, and man has discovered the same cave painting (predating known human existence) in remote locations across the globe. They take it as an invitation to visit other planets, although you or I may take it another way. They've pinned down where they think the creators of these drawings and have zoomed off on a long, long, cryogenically enhanced journey to meet their Makers.

Like the Nostromo in Alien, the Prometheus is populated with an array of interesting characters. The scientific expedition is led by Drs. Shaw and Holloway (Noomi Rapace and Logan Marshall-Green) and includes engineers, biologists, and geologists. The captain of the ship is Janek, played by Idris Elba. The commander is Charlize Theron, and - as with most Alien movies - there's a nonhuman, David, played by Michael Fassbender.

We join the crew as the ship arrives at its destination, an unnamed moon in a far-off solar system. This, they think, is where those long-ago visitors originated. They plan to, uh, talk to them. You know, sort of rap with them to find out why they abandoned them and so forth.

Almost nothing goes right. The mission is funded by the Weyland Corporation (its long-dead owner gives the crew a message via hologram), but it's possible that its agenda and that of the scientists aren't a complete match. I guess it's safe to say that everyone finds more than they bargained for.

Shaw and Holloway desperately want to be right - one for the sake of scientific bragging, the other because of more spiritual, internalized reasons. Personally, if I were in their shoes I'd be questioning why I was on the mission (even if I had discovered all the cave paintings) and if my benefactor had any ulterior motives. These are some trusting scientists, is what I'm getting at here.

The movie is dark, which begs the question of why anyone in his or her right mind would pay money to see it in 3D. 3D absorbs light. If you have a dark scene shot in 3D, it will be even darker. And you're in a dark room. Poor foolishness. That's why I saw it in plain ol' 2D. The movie looked terrific, from the bulky, craggy surface of the moon to the tight-fitting chambers within it, mimicked to some degree by the interior of the ship itself.

The best sci-fi includes answers that lead to more questions, and Prometheus is no exception. We know about as much as the scientists know and almost nothing of what Commander Vickers knows. The plot takes some twists that are both plausible and unexpected, and the action scenes are impeccable. Everything adds to the mythos of the Alien universe, but as soon as we learn something - something else doesn't quite add up. Not in the illogical sense but in the sense that there is so much more that our characters (and we) just don't yet know. And that's good storytelling. We identify with certain aspects of most of the characters, even the cyborg David, and that means we manipulate with and are manipulated by them in turn.

It's a majestic movie, especially for one with so many scenes set in confined quarters. Technology, innovation, and creativity, with scarce use of CGI, are on display here. There may not be a scene that's quite the equal of the notorious chest-bursting scene from the original, but trust me when I note that there are plenty of close substitutes, including a couple of pulse-pounding death scenes.

The acting is universally excellent. Theron has a tough role as the icy commander with a lot on her mind, but she pulls it off without seeming too detestable. Elba makes for a fine paradox, a laid-back daredevil. Rapace is a truly wonderful find as the gritty heroine. Guy Pearce shows up, although you won't recognize him. But they all take a back seat to Fassbender, who follows quite expertly in the shoes of Ian Holm; in fact, he surpasses Holm's fine earlier work. Fassbender's David is both intelligent and empathetic, even though he lacks feelings himself. He is at the center of all the subterfuge in this film, circles around circles of deceit.

Prometheus is certainly one of the best in the Alien series, surpassed perhaps only by the second one (Aliens plural). It includes stunning visual effects, a taut, brainy storyline, humanized performances, and an eye-opening denouement.","9"
"jennifer-oleary002","What was Ridley Scott thinking?","22 June 2012","Prometheus is both horrible and awesome. Awesome because I'm a sucker for alien worlds. Great special effects and awesome world building. Michael Fassbender is wonderful as David. A good movie for 3D. But what was Ridley Scott thinking? Some pretty bad dialogue and awful horror/scifi clichés. I don't care for plot lines that only move forward due to one stupid decision after another. The viewer wasn't taken on a journey of discovery. Instead, whole plot lines were resolved thru unexpected short dialogues. I could almost see Noomi Rapace cringing...as if she new the dialogue was bad as she was saying them. Despite the bad lines, Rapace acting is good. Because the Prometheus movie trailer was amazing, I expected a smart and sleek movie. Am I glad I saw the movie? Yes. Am I disappointed? Yes. But,perhaps my expectations were too high. If they had been lower, I could have just enjoyed it for what it was. All that being said, I'll probably see it again on DVD and if there is a sequel, will look forward to it.","9"
"my-two-cents","I walked out... (but don't tell Charlize, in case she asks)","30 September 2012","I find it frustrating when you can identify the characters clichéd roles within the first few seconds after seeing them. It really sets up the whole film to be predictable and dumbed down for ... a low IQ audience? ...unimaginative people? ...first time viewers of a motion picture? Obviously I have issue with this and I find it insulting. (gosh I'm sensitive) I found this especially irritating because of the slow lead in to the ""action"" to, I assume, do some character development, suspense etc... So why beat us over the head with IN CASE YOU WERE WONDERING, THIS MUSCLY GUY DRESSED IN BLACK CLOTHING WITH A SCAR AND A SCOWL IS GOING TO CHALLENGE AUTHORITY AND BE ONE OF THE FIRST TO DIE BECAUSE HE IS ARROGANT AND COCKY.

But this biggest issue and why I walked out was because of the science. I am no scientist, but I would imagine that ones first visit to an alien planet would be a cautious en-devour (thank you spell check). The genre of the film is science fiction, so why leave the science at the door? Why would someone remove their helmet after only being on the planet's surface for 8 minutes? I got the sense that the ship and all might have cost in the area of 10 billion? (and don't challenge me on this #, I have sold many spaceships in my day. And I can tell you, even used, that ship would fetch 10 billion) So why have a 10 cent crew? With such ridiculous scientific intelligence.

I walked out of the film when it was first released, and I am writing this review at the end of September... I was inspired to join IMDb and write this review because I saw Prometheus as #2 on the Movie Meter top 10. So the specific details of my angst have faded slowly into more of an emotional recollection of the film. But I stand by what i have written, the spirit of my words is absolute.

"ani-for-prez","What a disappointment!","10 June 2012","Let me start by saying I am a huge fan of Scott. His Robin Hood, though not a great movie itself, made for an excellent prequel with well- fleshed characters and plot. His Blade Runner and Alien are classics and most of his movies except Body of Lies and American Gangster are incredible. That being said, I cannot believe he let this travesty pass his eyes, let alone direct the whole thing. With such hype, such amazing marketing strategies designed to bring the whole film to life, he could have made something to be remembered for ages. Instead, ridiculous plot, stupid (there is no other description) characters, plot holes and an unsatisfactory ending ruined it completely. The following review is split into 3 parts:

Cast: Cast was amazing. Charlize Theron, already filling a role for a ruthless queen in Snow White fit the role of an ""Ice Queen"" brilliantly. Michael Fassbender was a great choice to play an android. Noomi Rapace also pulled off the naiveté of a religious scientist with grace. The problem was none of these characters was given any substance other than Shaw's nonsensical dream which revealed nothing (which by the way had perfect cinematography instead of being first person which is what every dream is). I simply didn't give a damn what they did or if they died. And the things they did were so stupid they might have left their brains behind in cryostasis. And other than the triumvirate, nobody else was any good with Guy Pierce being woefully underused and Edris Elba given almost no role.

Camera (and all the things behind and in front of): Visuals were stunning. This was CG at one of its greatest heights with seamless integration of live-action footage. Direction and screenplay were not noteworthy and this being a Ridley freaking Scott movie I expected much more. This was a big disappointment but the biggest disappointment was-

Content: Or total lack thereof. Plot was supposed to give twists and turns but instead lacked any iota of sense or logic. Sci-fi movies usually require the viewer to leave some amount of sense at the gate but this was so woefully devoid of any semblance of intelligence I laughed at the sheer stupidity of what was happening. People freak out for no reason but have no qualms about touching unknown alien lifeforms, experimenting with NO quarantine procedures AT ALL, acting super calm when stuff happens all around, being conveniently absent when stuff actually happens and finally Shaw who didn't say a word about GIVING BIRTH TO A SQUID! If this was supposed to be a horror movie (which is what IMDb says it is), it has failed spec-TAC-ularly. Tension was non-existent with cheap thrills from shock moments which failed at shocking anyone. Plot holes abound and they have already been listed by fellow reviewers on this site.

All-in-all this was so underwhelming I left the theatre with sadness at how something which was given so much money which could have achieved so much was dealt with so poorly. Lindelof, you suck.

"pauljeday","A team of scientists have embarked on a perilous journey to investigate the origins of a poor script.","27 June 2012","Prometheus Review (Warning: Contains Spoilers)

I'm going to start by saying I both enjoyed and didn't enjoy this film. I enjoyed it for its grand, sweeping vistas and its unmatched visual aesthetic, but equally, I did not enjoy the story, the plot or the scripting of what I believe could have and should have been a much better film. The generation of film makers I grew up loving throughout the 70s and 80s, seem, in my opinion to have largely missed the mark in recent times and appear not to have engaged with or listened to the huge fan-base to which they owe their fame. In saying that I am not presuming their fans know better, just that they know what they want. Whether it's George Lucas, Ron Howard, Steven Spielberg or Ridley Scott, I feel that they have missed the mark in recent time, aiming to please both the ratings board and the whims of the easy-to-please broader cinema-goers.

Plot: I have never seen a more ridiculous idea executed so poorly as the plot of Prometheus. Pseudo-science aside, the plot is so obviously flawed both in its ideas and its execution that there is no getting around it, nor is there any excuse for it. It's not that it doesn't make sense, it's just pointless. It appears that Ridley has sacrificed great story telling and a simple, but engaging premise, for grandiose spectacle and that, in my view will never satisfy fans of science fiction. The film is neither intelligent nor original, borrowing heavily from texts which are both flawed and irrelevant. In this I feel Ridley has made the shift from hard science to science fantasy. The story at its core reminds me of the very disastrous and unwatchable Battledfield Earth. That's not that the stories are similar, but the ideas which drive them are quite ridiculous.

Acting: Michael Fesbender is the one redeeming character in the whole movie and he isn't even human. Yet even here some of the things he does and decisions he makes are completely at odds with his journey as a character in the end. Here, as elsewhere in the film, Ridley has not only missed the mark, but even more incredibly, has missed an opportunity to explore the relationship between the created and the creator. Chalize Theron gives another good performance, but her character is restricted in ways I cannot understand. More should have been made of her history with her ""father"" and his relationship with Meredith. It's inexplicable that she would lead a mission half way across the galaxy which is apparently not only at odds with her unstated philosophy, but diametrically opposed to her father's beliefs. Here again Ridley has missed a golden opportunity to explore the nature of the relationship and though there is a suggestion that Meredith is possibly herself a creation, the story merely brushes over it as irrelevant. It would have been far more interesting if there was this reason why she is so at odds with Weyland and her ""brother"" David. It is simply implausible, without so much as a suggestion as to why she would make such a journey.

There is so much missing in the story that you cannot forgive Ridley for choosing to ignore or leave it out, even if he covers the background to these characters in more detail (assuming he finds a way to revive Meredith's character) in a sequel/prequel.

Noomi Rapace give a credible, but not brilliant performance as Elizabeth Shaw (I can't understand why people are saying that her performance is anything other than competent). There are moments when her character is believable, but she does not, in my mind, carry the same weight as Sigourney Weaver in her tremendous portrayal of the out-of-sorts Ripley and her character does not develop beyond the sometimes appallingly sulky person she appears to be at times on screen. She should have become a lot stronger than her screen presence suggests in the end, given that she is now alone and heading into uncharted space in search of ""answers"".

Visuals: The one enduring and redeeming feature of this film is the incredible beauty of the stunning visuals, which in my view are unmatched in any science fiction film to date. Without the aesthetics of the cinematic experience, this film would have been as dull as any C grade effort.

Script: There is no excuse for clunky, uninspired dialog between characters, most of whom are scientists that one would expect should have a higher intellect than most. It is bizarre, to say the least, that one of them would have a bong embedded in his space suit. The only reason for it even being there is for comical effect and that wouldn't be so bad if it was actually funny. I did not laugh at this, but was left thinking why? What's the point? It only serves to detract from what otherwise should have been a clinical experience in space. This film is largely a paradox for me. It reminds me of the worst aspects of Mission to Mars and yet some of the visual aesthetics are reminiscent of the best elements of 2001, a film which, despite being almost completely devoid of action, still stands out as the best, most accurate depiction of man's endeavours in space to date.

I enjoyed moments of this film and I will certainly catch up with any extended version to see if the film can be partially rescued with more story, but in the end I was left bewildered, frustrated and at times completely confused.","5"
"estreet-eva","A decent sci-fi scarefest with pretensions of profoundity","21 November 2012","Greek mythology, the origin of humankind, the nature of consciousness all decorate what is actually a haunted house sci-fi scarefest. Squid- like creatures jump out and impregnate space travelers, and duplicitous androids poison people who mutate in Frankenstein Monsters. The film feels very much like underwater alien scare stories like ""Deep Six"" or ""The Abyss"". Of course, woven around this is the Alien mythology who seeks to make the non-Darwinian argument that humans are alien creations themselves much like the old ""X-Files"" mythology does. If you like these ""ancient astronaut"" stories you'll adore the film, if you think they are a lot of hokum, you'll still find some entertainment here. The cinematography, set design and visual effects are masterful. Noomi Rapace, despite her wandering accent, is a mesmerizing actress very much in the mold of Sigourney Weaver. Charlize Theron, who can do anything, frightens as a cold-blooded (or possibly no-blooded undercover android) corporate manager. They work well with a sometime clunky (""I didn't come half a billion miles from any men to get laid"") and wildly unrealistic script. For example, after landing on an alien world some 10X23 kilometers from earth, finding an ancient military base, and leaving 2 crew members to die there, the whole crew settles in to get either high or drunk. I would imagine someone actually in this situation wouldn't need to artificially liven up the day by getting baked and would be too damned scared to throw a few back. More time spent on the script would have helped realize the films potential of being a true classic which it may achieve anyway depending on the success of the sequel.","6"
"nick200352","Neither fish nor fowl","1 June 2012","I went to this film with high hopes and have created this IMDb account so that I can write a review about it. The first half ( subjectively ) of the film was great: deep and thoughtful. The acting was generally great and where it wasn't, I think the fault lies with the script and the direction rather than with the actors. The CGI was also very good, it wasn't lush and vivid as the CGI was in the film ""Avatar"" but it almost seemed real, and was appropriate to the tone of the film. To begin with, the 'homages' were subtle and didn't make me think (too much)of the films that they referenced. An example would be the similarity of the 'cockpit' of the ""Prometheus"" resembling that of the ""Nostromo"". SPOILERS The film began to (really) lose it's way when the two village idiots encountered the 'snakes', engaging in behaviour so benighted that one would not expect to see in a parody of a horror movie.

I'm finding it hard to continue talking about this film.

SPOILER I will skip a lot of inane events and move on to the 'auto-abortion'. In the film ""Alien"", which was great and which I love, but is not without flaws: one glaring plot-hole is how the Alien grows from being perhaps 1 foot in height to about 7'.

SPOILER When Shaw removes the creature from her body it is somewhat bigger than a watermelon, when it is encountered later on in the film it has somehow grown to the size of a grizzly bear - what did it feed on?

This film is neither as good as ""Alien Resurrection"" (pregnant Queen Alien; fecal baby Alien; poorly judged tone; miscasting) nor as good as Alien Versus Predator Requiem, which at least has the dignity to degrade by stages: possibly good film; possibly okay film; creature feature; monster mash etc.

If ""Prometheus"" had set out it's stand as a schlocky monster movie or a comedy horror I could have enjoyed it on that level...

If there's a sequel I hope Ridley Scott gets replaced by James Cameron.

I also do not have high hopes for how the new ""Blade Runner"" will turn out.","2"
"j_great","Very disappointing","17 July 2012","I was really looking forward for watching Prometheus and I thought this movie could among the top movies released in 2012. After watching the movie I was in a shock, wondering if this is indeed a Ridley Scott movie.

I will be precise here :

Good : Visual effects are great. Thats it.

Bad : Slow, predictable, not enough thrills, low on action and disappointing last half.

In such movies you expect action, thrill and there was none. I would not say zero but very less. The plot itself is so so, I thought it started off well but lost it soon enough. I don't know how this movie has got good rating but I think its a total disappointment.","5"
"kruizer04","At last, an intense, intelligent movie, better than I had hoped for.","9 June 2012","Well, I have been hanging for this movie, since I found out that Ridley was going to do it, so I'll keep it reasonably short. Again, the overly clever critics are pulling it to pieces, they will never be satisfied, no matter how good it is, you may also notice that, their names are not mentioned in movie credits, or at award ceremonies, ignore them, and just go see this movie. This is Ridley Scott doing what Ridley does best. Loved it in 3D, don't read the spoilers.

Mister Scott, please, may we have more of this.

Shield your eyes for this part,....... better than Avatar, no fake looking blue aliens here!! Bravo, encore encore!!","10"
"kurtis_75","Your mind will fly if you are an Alien fan","8 June 2012","I'm still reeling from the screening I just got out of. The audience was filled wit big time Alien fans all ready for something that I am sure we've all waited for years to see. For an hour now I've debated doing a video review or a blog, but I'll jot my ideas down here.

I enjoyed the experience of Prometheus. It has some great archetypal characters and some astounding action sequences. I really don't want to mention anything about plot, scenes or major beats. but i do want to advise fans of Alien to go see this film. If you've got Ridley Scotts original masterpiece engrained in your head you'll easily be having butterflies in your stomach and zillions of thoughts going through your head. There will be scenes where you are paying extremely close attention to details in every frame, if not for the duration of the entire film. The actors provide a great performance and all serve their roles respectively, if not exceeding their duties. There's loads of throwbacks to the originals, but trust me at not point are they thrown in your face like ""The Thing"" prequel. The one key point I can make is that there are several ""Holy ****"" moments where you will laugh the phrase simply by being overwhelmed with a tremendous circumstance happening on screen, be it horrifyingly scary or simply tense and deep.

There's masses of people who just hated the film, thought it was a disappointment or didn't tie up the franchise and the questions. All I can say finally is that i did enjoy it, especially the experience of seeing a childhood favorite fleshed out and experience a universe that i have loved for ages.","10"
"paudie","Well made sci-fi movie but no classic","11 July 2012","It is inevitable that this movie is going to be compared to Ridley Scott's Alien, even though they were made more than thirty years apart. Unfortunately and probably inevitably Prometheus falls short of the deserved ""all-time classic"" rating that Alien has.

Prometheus is very well made. In particular the special effects excellent. However the plot is needlessly complicated and there are too many characters. There are definitely too many annoying scientists who ""have to find out the truth"" about man's origins no matter what the consequences.

The acting is fine. Michael Fassbender is very good as the efficient yet sinister android David. The action scenes are good but some of the dialogue is dodgy and the end shamelessly prepares the audience for a sequel.

So erase all traces of ""Alien"" from your mind and you will probably enjoy this movie and then forget it not long after leaving the cinema.","7"
"bombersflyup","Fifield: So you're saying we're here because of a map you two kids found in a cave, is that right?","3 November 2020","Prometheus is a quality production and cinematic experience, it lacks in terms of characters and dialogue.

In this prequel, you can reason or conclude why such and such happened, but it isn't explained in the film. A lot of the events that happen are because David the robot isn't restricted and is freewheeling in this dangerous environment. That's because it's assumed a robot can't act deviously, but someone can be giving it orders and even though they're unaware Weyland's alive, David could still be acting on his orders or Vickers. Fassbender as the robot is essentially the main character after Shaw. Sean Harris as Fifield adds some humour, but why does he get lost, when he's the one who mapped the place and earlier told them which direction to go based on the device findings. Shaw extracting the alien out of herself, a squirm in your seat moment. Rapace solid as the lead, but no Sigourney Weaver. I don't see the point of Theron's character. There's tension, suspense, a decent cast and quality visuals, but the writing could be better.","10"
"avw-394-184007","Pro-awfulness","11 June 2012","Partially good...

Some of the acting is good, the cinematography is good, as well as some of the special effects. These are a few things that have helped to prevent this film from receiving a 0/5 rating.

It is worth watching for fans of the Alien movies, although they will be disappointed: this film should have been, a sci-fi masterpiece setting new standards like Ridley Scott's movie 'Alien'.

Scott is apparently interested in making sequels, although has indicated that that this movie is meant to be 'self-contained' (in case no sequels are made). As well, he has tried to dissuade comparison to 'Alien', insisting that the movie is not intended to be a 'prequel' but a stand- alone film that is simply set in the same 'universe'.

Actions speak louder than words: this film is a prequel, which is clearly evident within the film. Scott is inviting direct comparison to 'Alien', and all other films in the series. This film falls far short of all of them.

There are so many plot holes and screenplay/writing problems (thinking about them after the movie just makes it even worse) and they simply cannot be waved away.

And these problems are literally countless.

We could say that aliens are completely alien to us and so therefore will do alien things: unreasonable, unexplainable, inexplicable. Even if we waived the problems involving the 'aliens', and what they do, it would still leave countless problems with just the human characters. Perhaps we can't understand the intentions or the motivations of aliens... but humans? They do things that just make no sense, and at times the plot is advanced by characters that just burst into a scene and tell us what is going on (although how they got to that point, what their reasoning or rationale is, or how they know what they know, or how they put 2+2 together, is completely and entirely unexplained). Is this bad writing? Yeah... it is.

The ""Luke, I am your father"" scene is even cringe-worthy bad-writing bad.

Online reviews, and sites that go over the problems with this film, are unfortunately (for the most part) correct. However, it is still worth watching (perhaps not paying to see it in the theatre), especially for fans of the Alien movies, and here's why:

It could be at least partially redeemed by a director's cut that added at least 30 minutes (especially 'character development' back-story minutes). It could actually be improved by the addition of as much as 45 minutes, or more, of footage if it also closed at least some of the major plot holes and answered some questions.

Additionally, if Scott made a sequel that actually completed (and helped explain) major plot holes and story-line problems, that would improve Prometheus. But lets be clear; that sequel would have to be unquestionably a 5/5 star movie: an instant classic - a film that, like the original 'Alien' set new standards.

There are so many problems to fix, however, that I don't even know where he would begin: just one example, out of many, is the ship ramming scene.

Here is a 'cut-n-paste' from another review:

Two crewmembers, who we didn't get to know, don't understand, who have no background or interest or passion or struggles or emotions, other than a (very) shallow bet: Choose to stay with the captain when he goes kamikaze. Why? Because the pilot, solely chosen from all humans by the richest trillionaire on the planet, to fly the spaceship, is a (very bad) pilot. And in the next scene, ironically, what unfolds is that the captain presses a few buttons, goes on autopilot, says HANDS OFF, everyone raises their hands, and no piloting is done and they all die, implying the other two didn't have to be there to die at all. They don't even eject an escape pod or anything after the hands off, nothing. The captain just sings his little song in happiness. What the hell!? They're going to DIEEEEE. All they say is, let's keep that bet in heaven. Come on! You don't die like that. There's no, OMG I'm dying, no emotions, not even a cliché I love you man, or screaming, they just keep the bet, sing a song, do a dance and die, two of them (perhaps all three) completely unnecessarily.

I understand that reviewer: Where to even start with this scene?

If the 'Pilot' character was fully defined it might be possible to make this scene more emotional, dramatic, important and even more viable if explained in a sequel – but it would take so much screen time that it probably wouldn't be worth it. And if you did the same with all of the other irrational scenes in the film then you would end up with a sequel that would take you many days to watch as it would be that long. If you were a director-wizard and managed to explain this scene in just a few minutes, you would still have to do the same with countless other scenes, many of which weren't even half as good as this one.

Personally, I thought the CGI sequences involving the squid alien near the end appeared quite unrealistic (bad CGI). But also, in my mind (the whole time) was this question: how did the 5lb squid alien grow to 5000lbs with no bio-matter to consume?

Is breathing air that fattening?

John Travolta gave us Battlefield Earth, David Lynch gave us Dune: they both thought that they were working on masterpieces – compared to Prometheus, those movies were actually quite good.

Anyone posting a review greater than 6 is probably young enough that they didn't see Alien, or Aliens (or even Alien 3), in the theatre - not true 'Alien' fans, or fans of 'good' sci-fi in any way.","1"
"nflovesgday","There was a Spark, but no fuel","15 January 2014","OK here is the thing, i personally liked the movie just because it was decently thought provoking. that being said i honestly think the concept as a whole had amazing potential, this movie could have been very good. if someone told me: "" its in the future, when a group of scientists travel to a distant planet in hopes to find the origin of the human race."" i would honestly be pretty intrigued. but somehow the movie is demoted for a lot of things, : its very ambiguous, which isn't always a bad thing, but in this movie they leave out a lot of ( in my opinion ) very important story building parts.

this isn't even my main concern, my main concern is the ending/transition to the second movie. SPOILER ALERT! for example the end scene when they actually meet the engineers, they make him seem like a crazy psychopath who kills everyone with out any motive. and if you've seen one of the deleted scenes which is very crucial in understanding the engineers motives, we will all kind of assume that his reaction is prompted by the completely stupid question weyland asks him, which is pretty much how can i live forever?

all in all i still think this movie is enjoyable but still could have gone a lot farther, like light years away. worth watching? i would say yes for two reasons, 1: because if they make an amazing second movie which i hope they do, then you would want to watch this one as a preface and just for the information leading up to it. And 2: just because Michael Fassbender is such a boss who in my opinion lifted the whole movie up past the point of sucking.","6"
"LMRusso-1","Disappointing","13 June 2012","Ridley Scott is one of my favorite directors. I was extremely excited at the prospect of Scott coming back to helm a new chapter in the ""Alien"" franchise.

I just came back from catching an 11pm show at my local theater and can't seem to make sense of it. Not the movie or plot points so much as the fact a man like Ridley Scott could have put his name on it. The script was not compelling, the performances one dimensional and the direction...surprisingly weak.

I saw the non-Imax 3D version. To me the 3D was more of a distraction than anything else. It didn't add to the visuals in any significant manner. Many of the 3D movies out today (like Prometheus) aren't truly 3D so much as they simply push the background away from you. It's more of a generated effect than something that makes you feel closer to what's happening on screen.

There was nothing established for me to care about- no threads to follow or objectives to reach for. The science crew seemed not the brightest... taking careless chances in unknown environments with not even the most basic of scientific precautions. Characters act in ways that just never made sense or brought me in enough to care about them.

There are a lot of allusions in the story towards religious and philosophical themes. One gets the sense screenwriter Lindelof was trying to make a cerebral epic along the lines of ""2001 A Space Odyssey""- along with its flat performances (he even has Guy Pearce made up similarly to Keir Dullea at the end of ""2001""). Unfortunately Lindelof forgot that even the most sophisticated of metaphors & plot themes require some minimal levels of storytelling structure, character development and logic.

Prometheus opens the door to more sequels/prequels/whatever- a prospect that years ago I might have have looked forward to. But as I watched the credits, I thought to myself, ""when & if they do come out with a sequel... I'll just catch it on video"".",NA
"theboywillis","How deflatingly disappointing","3 June 2012","Im sorry, i just cant have people reviewing this movie as 10/10 - 10/10 indicates a perfect film and this is anything but.

I've never been so moved to comment on a film before but due to how my anticipation and excitement were drowned and crushed slowly over two hours, i feel compelled.

I feel the high ratings for this film must be down to rose tinted spectacles for the director, originals, and what was a fantastic trailer, but that's my biggest issue - if you've seen the trailer, you've seen something more tension and suspense laden than the film itself.

There are so many holes in this film, i cant begin to start talking about them because it simply makes me all the more depressed.

I walked out of the cinema last night more deflated, saddened, disappointed and frustrated than i have ever felt at watching a film.

"HulkySmashSmash","Stop reading reviews and make your own mind up! The movie is great, the script, not so much.","1 June 2012","I'll say it straight away, the script was crap. Everything else was brilliant! The acting, 3D, music, plot etc. were all great.

It lives somewhere between Alien and Aliens. With a beautiful opening, showing the ""Creation"" of man.

The scenes involving the ampules were amazing and the ""surgery"" scene was an immediate classic. The ending seemed to have been slapped on and was a bit cheesy but the movie as a whole fits perfectly within the Alien universe and does not detract from the myth as it does NOT explain the LV-426 derelict, it merely explains and I say explains lightly, what those beings were and what they did for mankind.

I hope that the Blu Ray release adds about 20 minutes back in so that the characters are fleshed out a bit because on leaving the cinema, the only thing I felt let down about was that the characters weren't given room to breathe. (and of course, the crap script).

Don't go into the cinema with reviews in your mind, just make your own mind up.","9"
"leplatypus","As it's a sequel, you will find which comes first: alien or eggs ? (Imax)","16 June 2012","I totally agree with the Imax promotion saying that you don't watch a Imax movie because in fact, you are in the movie. That's why I wanted to see this space adventure like this and it has been my best Imax screening so far. Staying on board on the ship, watching holograms, exploring this dark mountain for two hours was riveting.

Sure, at first, it looks much like a remake of Scott's first movie than a sequel because the basic plot is the same: a space crew, and especially a strong woman and a mysterious android, lands on a isolated planet to face a deadly threat extraterrestrial menace.

But, in fact, this universe expands in new topics and this brings more originality and mysteries than the last two boring Alien movies. As Scott even said it, Scifi movies has told so much than the actual releases just retell past stories and indeed it's the case: the two new majors ideas are borrowed: the idea of humankind creation by ET and especially with black goo comes from Indiana Jones, X-files and before from famous comics artist John Byrne (see his run on West Coast Avengers). The other idea of seeking God in space is an old cliché from 2001, Mission to Mars, Star Trek V. In addition, if Alien was a horror movie, this one is more a thriller and a crime story. Indeed, a lot of clues are shown without explanations so the audience must think it over to understand what really happens. If the black goo seems to mutate badly living organisms (the worms) and has mixed with Holloway's semen to become the ""baby"" of Shaw, I still don't grasp if the Engineers and Aliens know each other yet. The mural paintings seem to say there are interaction but where are the eggs in this case? And it's strange for those engineers to choose a biological weapon base for meeting. Is this a prophecy then?

Finally, for a Scifi movie, i find it interesting that it's also very backward: it's a quest for human origins that happen in a very primitive but also advanced culture. In the spaceship, we feel a lot of nostalgia of old earth (like ""Blade Runner"") and the Alien/Engineers biomechanic world looks like antiquity and almost fetishist. In all cases, Scott is a great movie-maker because he doesn't rush the story and when it comes for action, it's something else than the 1 frame by second we see in movies today. Unlike Spielberg, he is interested in portraying strong women and like this, he made me discover an amazing actress. I don't talk about the award winning cold stiff Theron but the cute Noomi! Less salary, no Oscar, but she can play and give emotions thousand times better than her Hollywood pal! Behind her eyes, you can tell that she lived a full life so far in spite of her age! Just for her and her robotic partner, this sequel is a fine movie!","10"
"kaysm-71213","Absolutely loved it.","24 July 2022","I wish Covenant had stuck to the uber-large Engineer humanoids, but they didn't so we got only white-skinned people, basically (even tho Ridley Scott said they were Engineers, um, they obviously weren't). I'd gladly take an Alien:Awakening that had the actual Engineers find out that their little band of white-skinned people got annihilated and then go after David in space. Now THAT has potential.

But anyhow, back to Prometheus. It rocked. The 3D was BRILLIANT and came at a time when all the big Producers were showing their talents (Avatar, Hugo). Trust me, if you didn't see it in 3D, you didn't see Prometheus. Get a 3D projector or TV and see it the way it was meant to be seen and I guarantee you, you won't be disappointed. Even with some of the storyline slightly iffy, in 3D none of it will matter. And to be fair, the storyline was largely actually pretty darn great. The whole concept of the black liquid creating monsters was ace, along with the Juggernaut actually being a death-dealing weapon, altho Holloway's metamorphosis should have stayed with their first concept with the Alien-esque transformation, versus the Mars Attacks banal that we ended up getting.

Still, all being said, I loved the dark and morbid tone of the entire story and it set the mood for way better than it got in sequel. Maybe with Awakening there can be some redemption. Take the big budget and do something revolutionary with Those Elephantine Gods. Heck, if Lord of the Rings can put a huge Gandalf next to a minutia Frodo, think of what can actually be accomplished with a decent Engineer plot (even the ending of Prometheus managed a few decent shots of similar proportions). Ever hopeful.","10"

"zetes","Majorly flawed, with some very poorly written characters, but overall a very entertaining, genuinely frightening sci-fi/horror flick","11 June 2012","Despite a number of glaring flaws, Ridley Scott's long-awaited return to science fiction is excellent. A sort of prequel to Alien, this film stars Noomi Rapace as an archaeologist who has discovered a number of star maps in cave paintings. She convinces a corporation (run by a dying Guy Pearce in old man makeup) to bankroll a space voyage in search of those who she believes engineered the human race. For the record, one of the major flaws is that there is absolutely no reason for her or her boyfriend, Logan Marshall-Green, to think this, and they give Rapace an ill-defined religious background that just never makes any sense. On this expedition, among many, are Charlize Theron, the representative of the corporation, Idris Elba, the captain and Michael Fassbender as the android who, much like Ian Holm in the original Alien, may have a hidden agenda. The expedition discovers a pyramid and they go exploring. The civilization is the one who built the ship where the crew of the Nostromo discovered the aliens, but this film is not about xenomorphs. While the structure of the film is much like Alien - after all, it's a sci-fi horror film - it mostly feels like its own thing. The biggest problem is that it introduces a lot of characters and concepts and has to deal with them all really quickly. I don't know that I'd say that I would want to see a cut that ran an hour longer, but they really needed it to ratchet up the suspense and make the character motivations make more sense. The one thing I really do like about the film is that so much of it remains delightfully unexplained - I know it's cliché to bring up Lovecraft when discussing a horror film, but the horrors of Prometheus really do feel Lovecraftian - they are often unseen, the way things morph into other things. We never really understand the motivations of the race they discover, just that whatever they were doing did not work out too well for them. It's all really creepy. Of course, the script was co-written by Damon Lindelof, one of the major artists behind Lost, so that sense of unsolvable mystery is definitely in his wheelhouse. The actors are all fine, though this is definitely more of a showpiece for production designers and special effects workers. Technically, it's about perfect. Between this and The Avengers, this has already been a really good summer for movies (okay, we'll just forget that Battleship exists - it'll be forgotten anyway).

"licktheenvelope","Bad Storytelling + Some decent Sci-Fi Elements","22 September 2012","I finally got around to seeing Prometheus last night and after the first 10 minutes I was already confused at the choices made.

Perhaps my biggest gripe of all was how the movie opened, which contradicts others who were more upset with the ending.

The credits role over a panoramic fly-over of Northern Scotland. Then a saucher shaped spaceship appears... and a white alien (very humanoid by clearly alien) figure stands over a waterfall. He drinks some goo and proceeds to disintigrate into the waterall with the scene zooming in, to a molecular level, to show new? DNA forming in the water...

Hard cut to a cave being revealed in Scotland (near future to present day) and two scientists find a cave painting showing a black figure point to 5 dots above it. They confirm it is 35,000 years old and hug.

Hard cut to a spaceship (!!???) This whole period of 5-10 minutes completely baffled me. If you are telling the story of scientists searching for the creators of humanity why clearly show them in the first 5 minutes? Why show the scene with that particular cave painting? Once the crew of the ship is awoken from cryo-sleep they watch a holographic recording of everything they are trying to do and why... so why does the audience need the alien setup proving everything the scientists are trying to find out? Why has this trillion $ enterprise been staffed by some of the most incompetent scientists ever on film??? (example: the biologist who has no interest in studying the first dead alien body they find... or the geologist who is a lunatic).

Once the main actress has an alien squid surgically removed from her stomach why does no one care? Why does the android feed alien goo to the lead male scientist? It seems to serve no purpose to what the goal of the real leader is trying to accomplish...

Why do these super-advanced aliens need to create alien squids/goo to destroy humans? Can they not just destroy the atmoshpere of Earth? I can think of dozens of other ways they could kill humanity without the needless Aliens they created.

I feel VERY generous giving this movie a 5/10. I like Ridley Scott, for the most part, and the visuals are well done + the sci-fi elements could have been used to tell a much better story... hell I think i would have preferred everything just as a straight Alien prequel.

The film defeats what it sets out to accomplish in the first 10 minutes then proceeds to bumble along as a confusing mess before showing itself as an Alien prequel. Could have been better.","5"
"vssc12","Way ahead of its time","1 July 2022","Was Darwin theory flawed? Were humans on earth created by extra terrestrials only to be annihlated in the future to make earth their second home. Prometheus captures this superbly with amazing CGI way ahead of its time (released in 2012). David as the humanoid creates an eerie effect coupled by the suspenseful plot which revolves around the crew trying to meet and greet ""our creators"".",NA
"ilia-skib","A huge disappointment. Just another average sci-fi flick (at best).","11 June 2012","Firstly, I would like to say that I rarely feel compelled to write a review of a movie, but in this case I feel that it is necessary.

I was really eagerly anticipating this movie. Ridley Scott as the director, a very interesting and philosophical concept, explanation regarding the original ""Alien""....and....what a waste of time!

SPOILERS:

The movie lacks any coherency or depth and the characters' behavior given the circumstances is incredibly unreasonable. OK, I can suspend my disbelief when I am watching a sci-fi movie but not THAT much.

A group of scientists that behave like college kids from fraternity. You reach a planet that may contain the origins of life and the creators of human kind...this stuff might be dangerous and a completely unknown technology/biology...yet they almost feel obligated to touch everything and when some of them encounter an unknown creature, just provoke it to attack.

Then you have the Android that for reasons never explained is trying to sabotage the mission by infecting one of the crew members... Other highlights - one of the characters after performing a self inflicted complicated surgery on the abdominal gets the wound...stapled (yes!) and then runs and jumps around like crazy occasionally remembering to grab her stomach and moan a couple times. People are immobile for weeks after a procedure like this!!! Then, at at the end of the movie some characters run from a spaceship crashing down on them. It is oval shaped, but instead of running sideways they try to outrun it to its length - SERIOUSLY?

With all that said, it's not the plot holes that make this movie so bad. No character depth. No exploration of the mythology whatsoever. No real mystery. The development and flow of the plot is not fluent. Just events stacking on top of each other. So much potential and possibilities ruined. Awful...just awful. It does not really deserve 1 star, but with current rating of 7.8 this movie doesn't deserve anything higher than 6.","1"
"sandra-santagueda","My expectations were fulfilled","7 August 2012","You can say a lot of things about Prometheus but one thing that you can't say is that is a bad movie. Ridley Scott delivers again a good movie with good scenes, spectacular visual effects, strong performances by the well chosen cast and a beautiful soundtrack by Marc Streitenfeld.

All this combined gives us the movie that we were expecting to have. I got surprised and my expectations were fulfilled. This movie gives, in a smart way, some of the answers that we wanted know but some questions do not have the answers and that is because of 2 possible reasons: - Will be answered in the Prometheus sequel - Are questions that do not need to be answered because that is what gives the mystery to movie, not having the answers.

People complain about the answers to the questions but also sometimes we don't need, they to give directly to us the answers sometimes all we need is a little push.

Great movie and for me, Ridley Scott did a good entrance to science fiction films. 10/10","10"
"Red_Identity","Horror sci fi done right, incredibly ambitious","10 June 2012","Prometheus has been my most anticipated for a while. The reviews were disappointing, to say the least, but also incredibly intriguing. Was it actually a prequel to Alien? Well, it shares certain elements to Alien, and I won't say more.

The problem stems from the way people wanted, or expected, this to be like Alien. It's not, at all. It doesn't have the slow pace Alien had, or the slow-building suspense and atmosphere. Instead, it does quite a few things. I would be lying if I said the film didn't seem overpacked with story lines and ideas. As it goes on, one is able to see just how much the filmmakers were trying to do here. Yet it all works. I have heard people criticize the script, the characters and dialogue especially. I was surprised that I didn't find any serious problems with those aspects. Many of the minor characters don't get much to do, but I found myself incredibly captivated by some of the more important ones, specifically Fassbender and Theron's. Both give two great performance here, and they make their scenes all the more exciting because there's so much intrigue and mystery surrounding their motivations.

The main flaw I would point out would actually be the editing. Although fantastic at times, the middle section of the film feels overstuffed. Perhaps better editing would have made it feel seamless and would have paced those scenes better. And, I am happy to say, the film has it's fair share of incredible excitement. There's several amazing moments here, and I am happy to say although it isn't the type of horror film Alien was, it still has its good amount of freak-out horrifying moments. Not incredibly scary, but still extremely disturbing and definitely had me on the edge of my seat.

For all of the reviews I have read, I am rather surprised by what the film actually was. Ever since seeing the trailer I wanted a suspenseful, extremely well-directed, slow-building sci-fi horror. What the film actually is is an incredibly intriguing, fast-paced, sci-fi/horror mystery. It's not as simple as Alien in its narrative and storyline, or as moody, but still a great film nonetheless that, while flawed, is a roller-coaster ride no doubt. I loved it, and for that I am glad.",NA
"k_burden","Poor Movie","31 May 2012","Much like the series ""Lost"", Damon Lindelof started out with a great storyline but was unable to conclude. The idea was good, but the execution was poor! Again like ""Lost"" it left you with more questions than answers, and the ending doesn't exactly suggest they will be making a sequel, so you're left wandering what the whole movie was about. Visual effects wise the movie was excellent, and the actors did a great job, but their was a clear lack of depth in the characters. Over- hyped movie and like Star Wars episode 1 it leaves you feeling a little disappointed. I would recommend waiting for it to come out on DVD rather than go watch it in the cinema.","4"
"cinemike1981","This is NOT an alien movie","13 October 2021","Mr. Scott (and studio guys) tried their best to squeeze the maximum out of franchise, taking it to the direction no alien fan wanted.

I was waiting for everybody just die too see what happens at the end. I'm pretty sure Neil Blomkamp would do a better job, with better ideas, better characters, with better cast. I'm disappointed.

"imdbusrr","if you're going to be a passive consumer you run the risk of going hungry","30 January 2013","It's got so that anyone daring to write anything positive here might be afraid of being lynched. This hateful atmosphere is far from being simple expression of people's having been underwhelmed by a film. People have come here especially to express large volumes of real vitriol. They're hurting, because the film didn't satisfy standard expectations, didn't conform to formulae that are considered to be tried and true.

Worst 'crimes';

-unhappy ending. God turns out not to be so sympathetic or kind.

-no neat wrap-ups. In film, unlike in real life, there have to be satisfying answers to all questions raised.

-answers are given, but not to questions people might have been aware were being asked, and the tinge is in the air that those answers are not 'yes'.

-stereotypes are not adhered to; characters act uncharacteristically. This is perceived as script deficiency rather than plot devices in the service of a fable.

-inversion of sympathies; 'Baddies' have right on their side, but we want to dislike them, and for us to dislike them, they need to be wrong, not right as in this film. 'Goodies' are ultimately seen to be misguided and via their representation the human species is seen as a mistake, as a child born monstrous (one review even attacks the film for anti-human 'propaganda'). The alien/proto-aliens are more sympathetic than the humans they menace.

The film needs to be twice the length it is. Well, a lot longer anyway. The strong impression I've gained is that it's been chopped to bits to cram it into 124 minutes, and that the lost footage contains much of the character development and symbolic references that were needed. The film should have been unfetteredly something that 124 minutes wasn't enough for it to be. It has been forced to try to be something a lot less ambitious, possibly with haste. So it's fallen between two destinations, perfectly attaining neither.

I don't care about any of this. I'm a complete fan. I hope the director will not be deterred by all these squeaks of protest and will sustain the grand vision. God knows the world needs imaginers, risk-takers, askers of big questions. Ridley Scott makes things with a lot of beauty in them. There is inevitably also in reality and in fiction great pain. So our makers were not God. They were incredibly beautiful anyway, thanks to Ridley Scott. Keep going, Ridley. You are doing wondrous work.

It seems mean spirited to bung a rating on the same scale for a film like this as is used for 'lampoons vacation' or whatever they are called. As others have put as close to zero as they could despite having acknowledged the stupendously spectacular effects and design, I'm going to ignore with a vengeance the damage done by forces that tried to smash this project and hastily reconstitute is as cheap entertainment. Ten out of ten for sheer elevation of the wonder of imagination, for profundity. My thanks to all involved for the excellent journey.","10"

Now it's been about 7 years since and I decided to watch it again to see if I still feel the same. Unfortunately I do. How do you write characters that are supposed to be super smart, but yet behave so stupid?

Some examples:

1. They land on an alien planet they know nothing about about. Someone has a defensive weapon before they set foot on the planet, but the genius Noomi tells him no, they don't need weapons. What? Just idiotic.

2. David is a robot and doesn't breathe, but yet he wears a helmet with oxygen, and when someone points it out, his answer is ""humans prefer to be around other humans (paraphrasing)."" What? Made no sense.

3. The crew members took on this assignment to make money, but had no idea what it was? Right, people join a space mission without asking the basic questions.

4. They encounter bizarre and possibly hostile creatures and decide it's a good idea to touch them and play with them, not knowing what the hell it is.

5. Two are left behind and are scared to death, but somehow the captain just cuts their video feed and tells them goodnight. Instead of either helping them of monitoring what is happening to them.

5. The amount of times they are so eager to confront the unknown, even after they have been attacked it just astounding.

6. Ridley set up this story to continue, but decided not to continue it or ever explain any of it.

Just so irritating how bad the writing was and how it got approved to be made. Ridley should be better than that.","2"

TERRIBLE","1"
"Hamlet_Archer","Illogical & Arbitrary","9 June 2012","I do not expect a sci-fi to follow real science, but it should at least get the basic stuff right. Prometheus is so illogical that throughout the movie I was moved to ask how a certain plot was possible, or why no one did the basic research to get that fact/theory right, or why the characters would do something so stupid/arbitrary, or how they managed to get me into watching this crap in a theater.

I wasn't even bothered by the team of scientists taking their helmets off on an alien planet. It's a Hollywood movie after all, and the actors need to show their faces. However, flying a bunch of stupid scientists who haven't even met each other (let alone trained together) on a trillion dollar space mission to a star cluster lightyears away only identified by smudged up cave man drawing; the sponsor of the mission (who is paying for the whole mission and can do whatever he likes) pretending to be dead and hiding on the ship; scientists at the greatest discovery of history turning away because he only wants to look at rocks; then later got lost and got killed because he tried to be friendly to a cobra like alien worm; randomly blowing up priceless alien head sample... etc etc. just do not make any sense whatsoever.

At one point the human robot arbitrarily fed alien substance to fellow crew member even though neither had any idea what it would do. It ended up killing that fellow crew member but not before impregnating his girlfriend with an alien fetus. The robot then for tried to preserve that alien fetus. The robot's actions is devoid of explanation. If there is a parallel between it and the humans (the robot's maker) and between the humans and the aliens (the human's maker), the movie fails to communicate it to the audience.

The pregnant girlfriend then attacked the medical staff when they tried to treat her and used a machine to cut herself open, take out the alien fetus, and literally STAPLED herself back up (technologically advanced staples with nanomachines that stitched up nerves and muscle tissues, no doubt). Throughout that operation I was expecting the attacked medical staff or the robot to come interfere, but apparently they were all preoccupied.

When the mission sponsor finally meets the alien, he has the robot translate what he has to say, and even before the alien opens his mouth, the robot is able to speak the alien language, even though he should have never heard it. The alien has no reason to be angry, no motive to kill these puny humans that are no immediate threats, and even if he chooses to kill them, he can easily regroup with the rest of his species and use their superior technology to kill all the humans, but he chooses to rip the robot apart with his bare hands and eventually get killed in the fight. This alien is the first one the explorers find in the first alien base 5 minutes from their landing site, and one would expect there to be many more on the planet if not in the neighboring site. Yet the explorers somehow conclude that he is the only one, and if they need to find answers after killing him they need to travel to the alien's home planet (it isn't even made clear how they deduce that the planet they are on is not the alien's home planet).

Prometheus tries to address the profound question of human origin, but end up only feeling pretentious and moronic. If you are going to talk about god and evolution, please realize that a lot of people today have reasonably good understanding of the subjects, so 1. you cannot say that the aliens have a perfect DNA match with human and then have them look so different; 2. you cannot say things like the 2000 year old aliens' DNA ""predates"" human's and thus we have come from them (the scientific argument is that we share the same vestigial junk DNA, which suggests that we share common ancestors, but neither one ""predates"" the other, since 2000 years are too short a time scale for significant evolution to take place); and 3. having one ""engineer"" spreading its DNA on earth would not produce the diversity of creatures. Again, I expect sci-fi to be a mix of science and fiction, but you need to get right the basic stuff coming out of the mouth of a top scientist on a subject that is central to the theme of the movie.

I can go on and on about the plot holes in this movie, but then it really isn't worth my time.","2"
"thehotd1","Left scratching my head.","7 June 2012","I had been waiting for this film for so long and prayed that would not be a let down, unfortunately I was very disappointed.

Visually this film was impressive but everything else was a complete shambles, from a awful script to gaping plot holes and idiotic behavior from the characters.

My main quarrel with this film is the amount of unanswered questions that it leaves in its wake, here is some of my main points:

1: The planet the Prometheus lands on is LV-223, whereas in Alien its LV-426.

2: What is the purpose of the black goo contained in the urn looking things found within the ""Engineers"" ship?

3:Why are our creators so hell bent on destroying us now?

4:What really happened to the ""Engineers"" found dead on the ship?

5:What was the deal with the squid that was cut out of Shaw? Doesn't look like any Chestburster iv'e seen.

6:Possible the most confusing of all, why did the ""Xenomorph"" that came out of the Engineer look different from what were used to seeing, not to mention the the Engineer ""Space Jockey"" from Alien was found in his pilots seat with only a hole in his chest not a hole that was basically the whole size of his body???

Personally I was expecting a film that was going to connect the dots between the events of Alien and Prometheus and reveal what we all wanted to know, and I'm pretty sure I'm not the only one who wanted to see such a film, however all we have been left with is something that has created far more questions than it answered.

When the Directors cut becomes available I hope it might shed some light on the situation but overall i fell badly let down by Mr Scott.","1"
"HollywoodJunket","An Instant Science Fiction Masterpiece!","7 June 2012","Review by: Jordan Brandes

What makes a movie a masterpiece? The term is thrown out all too often when it comes to modern movies, usually by studios looking for a fan-base. For some it is a compelling story or the use of revolutionary technology, but all agree that it is an experience that forever changes you.

Taking us on this journey is a crew of scientists and volunteers that have been thrown into deep space on a voyage of discovery. Don't ever mistake this for a Star Trek-type expedition, every member of the crew has their own unique style and seems to be there to get the job done and go.

The core of the story revolves around Elizabeth Shaw (Noomi Rapace) who has been searching for humanity's creators since she was a young girl. Her need to find answers despite the consequences turns her into a truly fascinating character. ""We named the ship Prometheus as a reference to the character in Greek mythology who alternatively gave fire to man or shaped man's image from clay,"" explains Scott. "" In either case, he was instrumental in changing the entire evolution of mankind. He also angered the gods in a big way and suffered mercilessly for it. All three aspects of the myth have clear analogies in our story.""

Of course nothing is as it seems. Everyone seems to have their own agenda, even David (Michael Fassbender) an android created to help the crew on their mission and wake them up from suspended animation once they have reached their destination.

While the entire crew gives admirable performances it is Fassbender's depiction of an android with unknown motivations that steals the movie. While the rest of the crew has been in cryogenic sleep David has been studying ancient languages and watching old movies. By the time the rest of the crew awakes it is David, despite being relegated to a nearly servant role as an android, that is in total control. Working in the background throughout much of the movie, David uses the rest of the crew's naiveté attitude toward him as a means of quiet manipulation.

Although Scott hasn't directed a science fiction film since Blade Runner his return to the genre is nothing short of monumental. ""The reason I haven't made another sci-fi film in so many years, apart from the fact that I've been busy making other films and exploring different genres, is because frankly I haven't come across anything worthwhile for me to do with enough truth, originality and strength. ""Prometheus"" has all three,"" said Scott in a statement.

To be fully appreciated one must view the film as a puzzle waiting to be solved. There are so many elements at work that multiple viewings are not only encouraged but necessary. It is not just some flimsy plot at stake either, with ""Prometheus"" Scott takes the viewer from the caverns of Earth deep into space on a quest for the meaning of life.

While ""Prometheus"" does share clear ties to the ""Alien"" franchise it actually...

"Strictclybiz","Great entrance into another Alien Saga","3 June 2012","Wow! This movie was fantastic. It really goes to show that great directors can still be great with age. I feel that the experience Ridley Scott has at directing fully benefited him when he directed this movie. The movie takes place in the same universe as the other Alien movies and that really spells trouble for the team that investigates an unknown planet. The moral of the story is really felt and grasped onto by the viewer and you won't be disappointed by the outcome. I am really pleased having viewed this movie. You should go see it as soon as possible you won't regret it. If you enjoyed the other Alien movies than your definitely in for a treat, this movie is filled with those action packed scenes that we all come to expect. Just from viewing the trailer you can sense a spot of gripping and suspense filled rides and that is all accomplished through out the film. You will be grasping and sitting on the edge of your seat at times and that is what to come of great films. I give it 10/10 solely because this movie lived up to my expectations and that it was superbly directed. Go see this awesome flick as soon as possible.","10"

"scottemery","9/10. Explores more than the first two and still provides an entertaining thrill ride.","5 September 2012","To start off I would like to mention this in terms of the first two films in the Alien series. This film is a game changer, it still has horror elements of the first but explores so much more than the originals, with the first two basically exploring only the mother-child relationship. It discusses similar concepts to Blade Runner with the idea of what makes us human, beautifully played out in a scene between David(Micheal Fassbender) and Charlie(Logan Marshall-Green) over a pool table. It also sticks it's foot into the fear of death, the idea of meeting our creators and also looking at how faith can be defined.

I think Michael Fassbender is an absolute genius. His performance as a robot with the ability to understand human emotions while not actually having them is superb. You can see that each scene is meticulously thought out, with his character being so very close to being a human but not quite. This is exactly where his character should be and in some parts you start to wonder if the makers of David-8 gave him too much curiosity and whether he has actually gained independent thought. This then raises questions in your mind as to whether we as humans really are that special and you're stuck in this perfect creation of thought made by the David 8 character. Even forgetting the one I have already mentioned there are so many scenes I could pick out, but i'll force myself to just have two. The first being where David discusses what he would do if he were set free when talking to Shaw (Noomi Rapace), and the second is not even in the film. The promo for the introduction of the David-8 model is the shortest film I have ever seen that is worthy of an Oscar nod. Fassbender crying and at the same time explaining how he can not feel emotion is amazing. If he doesn't win an Oscar for his acting in this film (whether it be lead or supporting is up to Ridley Scott), then we need to seriously give the Oscar voters a re-shuffle as they have to understand that sci-fi should be respected genre.

Also on the subject of Oscars this should have one for Cinematography. I don't think I know anything that looked as good as this, I mean actually stunning shots that when you look at them you just marvel in there creativity and detail. From the surface of the planet, to the amazing sets below the surface and then there's the interior of the ship which looks immaculate and beautifully futuristic. In the original two the feel of the films were always tight, cagey making you feel trapped, the fact that this moves to a larger, more grand scale and still manages to create fear is impressive. The visuals used in creating different characters is also brilliant, with perfect design and some interesting ideas working together to make the best looking film I have ever seen.

I would say there are two scenes that are memorable for this film in terms of reminding me of the shock of the original chestburster, not in the same way but new creative ideas. Obviously I can't mention them but there's one towards the end which is part-fight scene and the better one comes around 2/3 the way through and I would love to tell you how amazing it is and how it makes you feel so claustrophobic, but I know that would ruin it for you so i'll just imagine it in my head. The 3-D is pointless and I don't know why Ridley Scott wanted it that way but I suppose for once the 3-D doesn't actually ruin it which is the best 3-D will ever do for me.

On the negative side there are two or three issues with side characters not really being developed. I felt that Meredith Vickers(Charlize Theron) character was not developed enough and I felt another 10 minutes worth of scenes would of helped to awaken her character more, though she still proved to be interesting. Also the rest of the supporting cast could of done with a bit more time on there characters but I must say that this does not mean any of them acted poorly, they just didn't have the options available. Guy Pearce's character had many scenes cut from the movie apparently, which I again would of liked to see more of not only to advance his character but the depth of meaning behind the film as well. Also I would like to say that while the film trys more it is not as good as the first two on the characters or feel. The fear created in the first and thrill created in the second is here but not quite to that standard. On a another small but bad note I would like to mention a ridiculous scene towards the end But I can't, you'll see it anyway you can't miss it, just think doughnut.

To round this off i'm going to mention why I think a few people don't like the film and why I think it is personally the best film of the Alien franchise. The real problem I think people have, but don't mention, is to do with the ending of the film. It ends openly and while this may annoy people a lot, it is what absolutely necessary. The film cannot answer all the question's it poses because whatever answers it gives would not be grand or anywhere near true enough to give the question any credit. This film is made to make you think, not to answer the questions but to put those thought's in your mind. This is why I believe this film to be better than both Alien(8) and Aliens(8) as it actually explores something fundamental to us all, that quest for the answer to ""the"" question.","9"
"mike-3194","SPOILER ALERT - consider it my public service !","8 June 2012","Oh my word... Well I had the highest hopes, all to be dashed by Ridicule Scotts latest attempt at Cinema.

From the outset things looked bleak, (spoiler alerts !!) An Alien drinks a substance that rips him apart, I can only assume he read the script and decided to kill himself rather than be associated with it.

Queue the cast, terribly overdone accents were obviously high on the agenda when casting this movie. Idris Elba the British actor who's normal voice is our English equivalent to Morgan Freeman was given an American accent when his normal tones would possibly have calmed the audience down a bit.

Guy Pearce.. I can only assume he wore the old man makeup to disguise his face out of shame, I would have done the same thing, or drank the alien koolaid at the start of the movie.

The plot was all over the place.. hidden agendas, spiked drinks, alien tech that seemed rather pointless, rolling spaceships.. it all added up into a ludicrous plot that just left you feeling like you wanted to leave the cinema and never look back.

Charlise looked hot, thats about as much positive as I can muster I'm afraid. The other ""leading"" lady could not act period.. and I could not get over the fact that after having your stomach sliced open and an alien baby removed how on earth could you run a lot, attack people, defend yourself from a tentacled alien and abseil off of a spaceship whilst carrying an androids head in a bag that still talks to you despite screwing you all over throughout the movie ?

It's a great way to chronologically kick off the Alien series, followed by Alien Covenant, with a third to bridge the gap. As for the cons, there aren't many. Idris Elba can't do a southern US accent to save his life (but then neither can most Americans).

Again, some who are into straight-up bug hunts such as the Alien trilogy might find that this story drags, but for me everything is just right.","9"
"NotAnotherMovieCritic","A Very Good Introduction to Alien","12 October 2012","A lot of people were very disappointed in this movie. They didn't think that it lived up to its expectation, but then again what movie does? If you think about it a lot of movies don't live up to their hype, that's because we have mind set on how it should be and are disappointed on how it is. That's why I go into ALL movies with an open mind, even those directed by Paul W.S. Anderson.

Prometheus in my eyes is amazing film! Ridley Scott brings us a prequel to Alien that has barely anything to do with Alien. It is more in the Alien universe than anything and introduces another level of fear than what we had seen in the previous films.

We see familiar things from what we have seen in in the Alien films, especially in the deleted scenes (which in my mind many of them should have stayed in the original version). I wouldn't say it's scary like Alien but it sure is thrilling and exciting and a good welcome into the science fiction genre.

Do yourself a favor, go into this movie with an open mind. Don't go into it expecting what you want just watch it and I'm sure you will enjoy it better than most people did who had counted their eggs before they hatched, or so to speak.","9"
"krisey-284-93403","beautiful looking, nothing behind","25 November 2012","Even if someone never came in contact with the story like me, he will immediately be swept away by the impending trip to an undiscovered planet in the vast outer space. Ridley Scott captivates you as always with great picture and powerful effects. Thrilling atmosphere and consistently impressive images. Only unfortunately that is about all. Good actors use pure nothing if the dialogues are absolutely boring, the decisions of the protagonists implausible and their behavior in all situations seems inauthentic, which is probably attributable to the uniquely bad writing. Answers to the many questions raised by the story, aren't being even hinted at! In the end, the viewers has to expect only many question marks, great disappointment and pure frustration with the low expectations that was with me still undercut.","4"
"tesseract149","Ridleys getting old and needs retirement money?","24 November 2013","OK so read some of the negative reviews on here, they pretty much cover all my thoughts as to why scientifically this movie makes no sense. I mean these have to be the Stupidest scientists I've ever seen/heard of. Well....then again there are a lot of bad sci fi movies that have characters this bad I suppose. I.E. Guy trying to touch the alien cobra like its a F***in ewok or something, guy taking off helmet etc., etc. Then there's basic movie 101....No character development, no character arcs, nothing to make the audience relate, or like/dislike the characters. The extraterrestrials in this movie are different enough from Alien (which takes place 25 years later in this fictional universe) that I have to wonder where and how the films connect, yet they are SO SIMILAR that there is no way in hell that you could call this original in any way shape or form. The overall plot is like a Frankenstein of cliché'd sci-fi and conspiracy history themes. Sumerian and Christian conspiracy meets Alien/Stargate/every other sci-fi about us finding a deserted alien colony that is completely F***ED. Add that to the complaints from above ......BOOOOOORRRRINNNNNG. And then there's the Giant in my estimation 20+ft in leg-span cepholapod at the end of the film, OK now in my opinion this is a much more formidable creature than ""Alien"" ever thought to be. It has acid for blood, breeds extremely quick through almost parasitic means, has a ton of teeth and is obviously stronger than all hell. Not to mention probably an invertebrate which means its flexible as all hell, and could probably squeeze through some tight spaces no problem. I'm no scientist but honestly this creature would probably win in a toe to toe match with any of the ""Alien"" ""queens"" from the past movies.

My advice, next time you want some ""thought provoking"" sci-fi, (true intention here was cash though, lets be honest), go dig up a novel by Clarke, Asimov, or Crichton that hasn't been put into film yet and make that instead of writing your own trashy hack job. THEN hire some actors/actresses worth their salt and don't spend so much on CGI.

Visually, the movie was cool. But that's not why I watch movies. STORY? Maybe you've heard of it? Would have gave more than 1 star on the visuals alone, but honestly I'm hoping to drag down the average that this movie has in any way I can, it's that bad.","1"
"Skruffbagg","A guide to what happens when leading scientists suddenly become morons","10 May 2015","Boy howdy was I let down by this film. I recently got the chance at a second viewing, as the first time I tried to watch it I was interrupted on several occasions and put my total confusion of what was going on and the preposterousness of it all down to the fact that it barely had half, let alone my full attention.

Well it turns out I wasn't wrong, they really were all that stupid! This is essentially a study of what happens when you introduce a bunch of characters who are meant to be the best and brightest of what humanity has to offer (save for a solitary grafter, who makes himself known early on with his tattoos, crazy haircut and a cockney accent so rough he might as well have chip butties flying out of his mouth every time he opens it, guv'nor) and then have them suddenly all develop the hallmark symptoms of brain damage.

Within minutes of entering the atmosphere of the planet they have been drawn to by the discovery of ancient star maps from several unconnected cultures on Earth, they discover an alien facility and with barely a warning from their mums, or even due consideration of where they are, they are breaking all reasonable protocol and training they (probably) would have received before the journey, and are removing their helmets and touching things without a care in the world.

Most of these morons masquerading as physicists, archaeologists or suits I couldn't have cared less about as they are given very little screen- time and virtually no character development other than the order in which they do profoundly stupid things or die. The only characters I found any semblance of interest in were Holloway (Logan Marshall- Green), whom I immediately pegged out as one of those in for a horrible, grisly death, and David the android (Fassbender) whose motivations weren't immediately clear until I remembered I was watching a Ridley Scott ""Alien"" movie. The sequence of him learning all about human culture, history and languages and lusting after Peter O'Toole in Lawrence of Arabia to the point of dying his hair platinum blonde whilst the others are in stasis was probably the best part of the movie. Everything after that was straight downhill. Idris Elba was decent but brutally underdeveloped, however he can do no wrong in my eyes so I consider that moot point.

For all its obvious and glaring faults, it is watchable enough and there is an engaging movie somewhere in the mess, it's just buried under a mountain of implausibilities, stupid characterisation and clichés that drag the whole thing down to the dirt where I often find myself on Sunday mornings.","5"
"edenney01","This movie requires incredible suspension of disbelief","1 October 2012","The elements were largely here to produce a very nice prequel to the original ""Alien"", and it would've made for a nice fresh spin on a very, VERY tired series of movies. Unfortunately this wasn't actually a prequel, and the elements I'm referring to have really confused a lot of people that have seen Alien and some of the sequels, but don't necessarily live and breathe the Alien movies. Personally I really liked the tie-ins to the original Alien movie. In fact those tie-ins, coupled with some beautiful cinematography and good CGI were the only things I really DID like about this.

The characters were heavily underdeveloped, leaving viewers with no real attachment to any of them or anybody to really root for. There was VERY little suspense of the nature that made the original ""Alien"" movie so successful. The script was disjointed and just seemed to be thrown together from bits of ideas, almost as if the editor was just handed all of the footage and told to edit it into a movie, without having ever read the script or even conversing with the Director.

And finally, the most ridiculously irritating thing about the movie was the completely implausible actions by just about every single crew member on board the ship. I doubt that I need to rehash all of the specifics... I'm sure it's already been covered countless times in the hundreds and hundreds of reviews. Basically they all just acted like a bunch of stoned teenagers exploring some abandoned building or cave, with no respect for the fact that they were in one of the most inhospitable environments known to man and dealing with multiple unknown alien species.

As an adult, it was incredibly difficult to watch this movie in the theater. Every 30 seconds I was thinking ""oh give me a break"", or ""yeah right, as if anybody would be that stupid"". And we're talking about engineers, scientists, archaeologists, and highly trained crew members that went on a mission that was SO important to them that they were willing to leave their family and friends behind, knowing at the VERY least they wouldn't see them for several years, IF they ever made it back. It's not like these were idiots that just picked up the ""Help Wanted"" sign in a store window and took a 9 to 5 job, but that's definitely the way they all acted.

Perhaps teenagers and/or those with sub 50 IQ's might find this movie much more believable and enjoyable, but personally I found it very difficult to sit through. I would however say that for fans of the Alien movies it IS worth watching at least once...","5"
"res-397-969788","a disastrous failure","15 June 2012","This movie suggests -and actually starts with- an idea that we are the outcome of the transmutation of the pilot or the original who look like taller and stronger version of us and the process of transmutation is neither smooth or linear or incremental at all.

The process of -the evolution, transmutation or whatever you call it- is more like a cycle which contain a complete destruction and a rebuilt from a mutated scratch of genome in our concept.

I think an idea itself was cool but the presentation was horrible and disastrous. the movie presented this idea from the very first beginning part of the movie but never ever talked about it directly. Of course there are something which can be considered as backup explanation in non-direct ways but the problem is none of them is making sense because every single explanation is not an actual explanation but merely a false assumption of characters.

In the last part of movie, one of character came up with an idea which like 'the original one will trying to annihilate who lives in earth therefore we must stop them' all the sudden, and three other people who got a control of the human spacecraft agreed with that idea without a second thought and decided to collide their ship into alien one. and that's pretty much every explanation about it.

And the every single characters are too stupid to be a scientist. One of scientist have seen the entire launch sequence of alien spacecraft. So she knows exactly how it looks like and where to evade when it starts falling and rolling towards them. But she chose the line of certain- death and ran with it.

I'm sincerely sorry for my miserable English, but I'd like to express my anger. I want to advise you DO NOT WATCH THIS MOVIE if you don't want to waste your time.","3"
"colin_dahlberg","Don't listen to the haters! Watch it and enjoy!","9 June 2012","Sure my vote of 10 stars is perhaps a little overboard, but I did it to counter the unbelievably low rating some people gave it (1 star, honestly? grow up). Regardless, I would still rate it at around a 8.5-9 because there were a few inconsistencies. However, they were for the most part trivial and in my opinion should not be taken in to consideration. For instance, how did they find the temple on the surface so quickly? WHO CARES!? Aside from the people who are intentionally trying to find faults in the movie how many of you actually want to see them scanning the planet's surface for however long that would take? My guess is close to none (other than the aforementioned haters). This is only one example of the trivial reasons people voted the film down. Read the other reviews for yourself and decide if they would honestly make or break a movie for you. Nowadays everyone wants every aspect spelled out for them. You need to leave some of it up to your own imagination. Sure I noticed several inconsistencies when I viewed it but I didn't get hung up on them. Overall I enjoyed the hell out of this film.

Everyone is clearly different in what they like but this was a bust in every way to me.

From the cover art and the storyline I expected so much more and maybe that was the problem.

I expected a real movie with real ideas and answers and much better events. I wasn't impressed by the acting or frankly anything else. Cool name but that's about it.

This is one of those movies that asks some of the most important questions about life and our civilization. At the end of our lives we'll ask the same questions: Where do we come from? Where are we going? Why are we here? Who or what created us? Is there an after-life? Prometheus asks those questions and makes you think about what what we are and how we look at ourselves. It's a quest for the truth that will stay with us when we start colonizing other worlds and embark on a journey through the universe in a distant future.

Noomi Rapace is an great actress but so is Charlize Theron and they both did a great job in Prometheus. This is my favorite movie right now and I will see it again next week. I would highly recommend this movie to everyone.","10"
"igorzanga","""we were so wronged...""","7 June 2012","This is my first review and it may very well contain spoilers (although it is not the point here).

I am not going to list bad points and plot holes as a lot of people have already done it, and some really were quite funny in doing so (thank you ian_span !). I just would like to share my view about it, as I have been deeply disappointed by this train wreck of a film.

My first statement would be to explain my view of the responsibility for this failure, because failure it really is. Although the real culprit is in the writing of the cardboard characters, their abnormal behavior and the idiotic dialogs and interactions, the true responsibility lies with Sir Ridley Scott. When you get double billings for production and direction, you cannot run away from your responsibilities (they will roll on you like a doughnut shaped alien spacecraft (WTF!!!)).

I don't agree with all the supposed plot holes mentioned in other reviews. Although the writers are opened fans of Chekhov and his gun (every odd or out place item is to be used further down the road), the story makes more or less sense (as far as considering it panspermia more then intelligent design) if you pay attention to what Deus Ex Machina, euh... sorry, David, and the 16 idiots say during the film. But I have to admit it is a hard task to do, so the writing is idiotic, and it may require several viewing.

No, the real problem is the characterization. They all are adults but react like toddlers. They are supposed to be doctors and scientists but acts like village idiots (surprising for a trillion dollar investment, no?). And what a captain!?! Dereliction of duty or plain incompetence are the closest explanations to his behaviour! He has 2 scientists lost and leaves without any support! There is a mountain of dead aliens piled in a corner and he does not even think to inform anyone about it?? The other problem is the lack of tension. All the supposed fearful moments only involve the robot... how are we supposed to relate to that? Because he is supposed to have been designed to act like a human and use a space suit to make it easier for the other idiots to interact with it, we have to relate to him?!? What the hell is that??? Well it is simply at the image of the rest of the movie: Hyperconvolution, everything is made to be taken way too seriously (e.g. Sir Ridley Scott HAS the answer to the beginning of life!!) Beyond the magic of the medpod staples (my wife wants to know the address for her next C-section!), the main character is really far from Ripley. If there were a fight, my bets would all go to Ripley and Sigourney Weaver. Noomi Rapace is a lovely looking lady but she is no match here. And as casting goes, what is the matter here: aren't there any good English actress so that you have to hire a Swedish one and force a derivative uneven accent? Or if you absolutely need the Swedish flavor, can't the script be accommodated for it and the character named accordingly?? The same goes for the use of a younger actor to play a near death elderly Peter Weyland... was it only for the sake of the viral marketing? If so, it tells a lot about the motivations at stake here. Personally, I would have used this great Guy Pearce for something else then just wearing this ineffective make up. He would have done an excellent Holloway.

On the bright side, the visuals are great. The effects are excellent... as you would expect! But if only to see this, I watch NatGeo. The score is highly ineffective and here again derivative. It does not build tension, it's plain annoying! Actually, the more I think about it, the more I feel sour about the whole experience. When I think about all Sir Ridley Scott's statements (deconstructing and reverse engineering of the first Alien to respect a technological chronology, scaring the living s**t out of me, ...) and the viral marketing at play, and when I compare it to the actual product, I think there is place for class-action law suit!","1"
"aernest","Oddly, I liked it...","16 October 2012","...and I agree with almost all the complaints about idiot plot points!

This movie is so beautiful and asks such big questions that I found it easy to forgive or ignore the fact that the main characters acted very, very stupidly and/or improbably at times. I am a sucker for Ridley Scott's visuals, though - I always have been. But gosh, he blows the roof off with this one. Never has a movie (except maybe 2001) made me feel more insignificant. Scott just nails space and the alien planet. I'm not sure how I feel about the appearance of the Engineers, but I think I'm kind of OK with it - at least I can't think of a look I'd prefer. The scene with David at the controls of the Engineer ship was just magical to me. When I heard this was going to be a prequel to Alien, I was alarmed, since I consider Alien just about a perfect movie, right up there with Jaws. I am perfectly satisfied that not every ""i"" was dotted and every ""t"" crossed. I'm actually happy that the ending of this movie does NOT fit perfectly with the beginning of Alien. Again, I invoke 2001 - not EVERYTHING has to be explained. I prefer the mystery. The cast...hmmm. I could almost see Scott straining for the same mix of working stiffs with higher eschelons that he had in Alien. Did not love Guy Pierce at all. Noomi Rapace photographs very oddly at times, but I think she was acceptable. The whole cast is just so overshadowed by the film itself, I almost tend to forget them. I did very much like Michael Fassbender's turn as the android David. What a little Pinocchio he was. His performance was ALMOST ruined by some bad writing/inexplicable action, but it turned out OK. The story is basically compelling, but would have been much better served with competent and more realistic character development. Everything everyone says about stupid character actions is true - unprofessional behavior from supposed professionals, inexplicable mood swings, yep, all of it. It just didn't bother me as much because these people are just amoebas in the face of what they find, anyway.I liked Scott's take on religion as well. It has become quite the style of late to discount religion or reduce it to the products of simple minds. I like that smart people in this movie still ""choose to believe."" My biggest gripe? Same as everyone else's - the c-section. No matter HOW many drugs one takes, action will simply not be happening after that. She should have been flattened by the drugs alone. But I got over it. One more thing - this movie just MIGHT be more like Blade Runner than it is like Alien.","8"
"mariopopesco-1","Disappointing of the year ! The trailer is better then the movie !","16 June 2012","I am a fan of Alien series. I am generally indulgent with any SF movie. But this is the biggest disappointing of the year ! The suspense from the trailer is lost after 10 minutes from the beginning, there is no horror in this movie. Except Charliz Theron character and the android , the others 15 characters from the crew are so unconvincing ,they are almost invisible. Maybe Naomi Rapace is a good actress, but is not fit for this kind of role and movie. The director fail to keep the pace of action, compared with the first Alien I felt like watched a cartoon movie, even my girlfriend didn't felt any thrill. Another bad thing about this film in the illogical behavior of the characters. There are some elements stolen from Species in this movie, inserted without explication .

Riedly Scott accomplish nothing in this film. Even the final is bad directed, it does't seem heroically !

"BA_Harrison","Maybe it'll make more sense in the extended director's cut.","15 October 2012","One of the most enduring and engaging aspects of the whole Alien series has been the speculation concerning the origin and evolution of the xenomorph, and the conjecture about whether the creature's existence is somehow linked to that of the human race. Ridley Scott's sci-fi prequel Prometheus sets out to answer some of these questions, while providing viewers with further questions on which to ponder until the inevitable arrival of Prometheus 2.

Of course, inviting the audience to study every last detail of a film in search of answers is only a good idea if the script has been so carefully crafted that it can withstand such intense scrutiny, which is most definitely not the case with Prometheus: between them, writers Jon Spaihts and Damon Lindelof have somehow managed to cobble together a mess of ill-considered plot progression, moronic characterisation, and weak exposition that is a million light years away from the perfectly profound experience that was undoubtedly intended. In short, the script sucks.

It's a good job then that director Ridley Scott has made his film such a magnificent feast for the eyes, the impeccable visuals being its one true saving grace. Such is the incredible quality of the CGI, the amazing spectacle of the action, the pure majesty of the scenery and the sheer inventiveness of the production design, that I actually found it within myself to cease dissecting Prometheus and simply enjoy it for the incredible over-blown spectacle that it is. F**-off big spaceships, impressive alien landscapes, an exploding 2000-year-old decapitated head, thrashing tentacled squid-like creatures, powerful mutants, and Noomi Rapace wrapped in skimpy bandage-like underwear: that'll just about do me until something resembling a well-thought out plot comes along.","6"

There was enough action to keep you on your toes the whole time until the very end. The bad guys in the movie were great and fit perfectly to the Alien universe in my opinion.

"alavallee13","An Intelligent Return To Science Fiction","12 June 2012","While there are indeed some moments in the film that make you want to shout at the screen and say, ""Don't do that!"" Prometheus manages to be one of the most intelligent science fiction films made since Duncan Jones's, ""Moon,"" and Christopher Nolan's, ""Inception."" The film is a brilliantly executed 3D masterpiece, with sets that will undoubtedly inspire film-makers and movie-goers for years to come, and a story that not only intrigues, but leaves one terrified and squirming on the edge of their seat during some of the most horrific scenes I've ever seen done in a suspense/ sci-fi film. Just like Scott's, ""Alien,"" the movie has an incredible sense of mystery blended perfectly with just enough terror and suspense to leave one begging for a sequel. ""Prometheus,"" also deals with concepts that haven't been touched since the likes of Stanley Kubrick's, ""2001, A Space Odyssey.""

The colours, actors, shots, sounds and pacing are perfect. Period. I do find the 'convenant' far less smart. covenant is very brutal but lacks much depth. This film does not!! Its beautiful in every way! Again; Its in my top 3 films of all films I've seen. Thats partly due to the lack of quality in all existing horror and Sci-Fi movies. But i actually have seen it more than the aliens... cos it pleasant to see to hear and its above all prob the hardest job in the world! Making a better Aliens movie.... Please for god sake!!!! I somewhat understand this movie wasn't in everyone's expectations. I think most peeps wanted it to be topping the already ( close to perfect 2 alien movies) i think you do not miss the point, but simply might not be able to respect quality.

"FilmStallion","Prometheus...3.5 out of 4 Skittles","6 September 2012","For those of you who don't already knowPrometheus is a prequel to the 1979 legendary sci-fi classic Alien. Ridley Scott is back at the directing helm and easily shows why he is the master touting his routs as a game changer of the genre with the original Alien and 1982's Bladerunner.

Prometheus contains everything a fan of the original would expect from the latest installmentit's violent, scary, action packed, disgustingly gory, weirdly hilarious, and features kick-ass special effectssomething the earlier version can't compete with. The result has you leaving the theater knowing you just watched a badass movie, and provides a satisfying and extremely entertaining result that most Alien fans should be happy with (except the uber cynical ones that can't be pleased no matter what).

The script by Jon Saihts and Damon Lindelof (Cowboys & Aliens and TV's Lost) sets up the alley oop slamdunk for Scott. Even if you haven't seen any of the previous Alien movies this flick easily stands on its own and will entertain story novices. I mean surethere a few plot points that feel slightly forced into the story line, and some moments that may take you out of the reality of the situationlike how was Noomi Rapace's character running and jumping after (without spoiling any of the gory details) an intense stomach surgery. But in the end the script and Scott's spot on direction keep the story moving forward at a thrill rushing pace.

The cast is exceptionally fun from Noomi Rapace, the original Girl with the Dragon Tattoo, becoming the film's new Sigourney Weaver-esque heroine, to the excellent Michael Fassbender (Inglorious Bastards,Shame), who plays the not quite human role to a tee, to Charlize Theron (Monster, Young Adult) who steals every scene playing the stone cold bitch Meredith Vickers. And huge props go out to cast members Idris Alba, Rafe Spall and Kate Dickie who fill out the spirited crew members and bring the human element to an alien story.

I'll admit I've been extremely excited to see Prometheus since I first saw the heart pounding preview trailer last December, and that I walked into the film with very high hopes that made it hard to live up to the hype. That being said, I still left feeling I just watched a kick ass movie, and am strangely happy that Ridley Scott brought my childhood nightmare back to life for another scare.

"judywalker2","Nice looking film with a stupid story","10 June 2012","I'm not really a horror movie fan but I am a SciFi fan. I personally think that aliens is more SciFi than horror. I liked Alien and Aliens, but number three just was dumb and unfortunately this prequel follows suit. Let me start with the good. The movie is visually very nice looking and it starts with a Moon like isolation of David(Fassbender) which is brilliant. The next character is also strong, Charlize Theron; she has really kicked ass as far as acting this summer. Then they start to wake up everyone else and the movie takes a dive that it never recovers from. Not only do really smart people do dumb things in this movie but some of the dialog, especially some of Iris Elba's lines are just poorly written. Durting the film I wanted to like Noomi Rapace's character but I just couldn't and her partner Logan Marshall Green was such a jerk that it was really hard to root for him. The rest of the cast were generic again this really hurts the film.

Now I have to say I was a fan of the original Lost all the way up until it became the John Locke show and this movie suffers from the same tunnel vision that the ending episodes of Lost suffers from. Its hard to go somewhere when you've given yourself no where to go. Prometheus quickly reveals itself to have no where to go and yet sets itself up for a sequel. We can only hope that someone else takes over the story.","5"

The acting is mostly terrible. Logan Marshall-Green did okay as the eye candy jerkwad scientist. Some of the special effects are nifty, but nowadays, that's not enough. Every summer movie has elaborate special effects and stuff blowing up. This one just strings them together with a filigree of Greater Meaning that would still have been pathetic even if they had wasted more screen time trying to develop it more. A few of the sets were worth looking at. But the script should have been sent back for many, many re-writes and even then, they should have hesitated to make it.","1"
"datorsiers2","Massive plot holes.","14 December 2014","This movie has very many flaws and kind of poorly shows what was really going on. What does the black slime exactly do? Creates lives, destroys DNA? It looks like the writers don't even know what was it supposed to do.

How the hell did they find the place so fast? They are on an unknown planet, never been there before, yet they find everything so fast and land incredibly smoothly. They find a huge green gemstone on a platform and nobody even says a word about it? Really? Clearly it was important, since it was on a golden platform. When they land, there is a perfect road in front of them leading right to the huge building, after a brief moment there is a huge storm, so how the hell can a road like that be so clear for 2000 years, if the planet has insane storms all the time, the road would be long gone and not able to see for sure.

It looks like the directors nowadays think that having incredible special effects and good looking landscapes can make up for the bad plot holes, on the contrary, more interesting plot is always better than fancy images.

The way some of the characters acted was way off too, Weylands daughter was this super important person on the ship, yet she didn't do anything, she didn't have any impact whatsoever, all she did was pointlessly yell, a completely irrelevant character in the movie. Also, Fifield snaps easily after one comment, yet when confronted by a snake - like monster coming out from the black slime, it is all cool and no emotions are shown? Yeah, some of the scenes were good and really sparked the interest a little bit for a while, but with an idea like this for a movie, they could have made it way clearer and more interesting than this.","5"
"victornunnally","A Wondrous Oddity-minor spoilers","27 November 2012","I want to love this film. I truly do. It might have been the moment a well educated scientist removes his helmet on another planet. Yes, the readings on his sensor indicated earth like atmosphere but a major protocol was broken and selfishly so. Why jeopardize the mission? The film's story falls flat for me after this absurd action. It was if everything came crashing down on the script pages. One absurdity after another. The film is beautiful to gaze upon. The set designs are superb. The characters are weak in development. Why is Charlize Theron in this film? Her character could have been left out and never missed. Along with many other poor Plot Point B Characters. Guy Pearce?Why? The android David is creepy as all the other Alien Franchise robots such as Ash, the magazine throat stuffer from the first Alien, 1979. There is a Bio-Hazard parasitic life form present in our Universe that creates life and mutates it's host. The worms that swim in the liquid mutate into a higher predator. Is this the birth of the Alien species? Is this how humans came to be, a creation by another alien race? The film is a complete mess even in the end. The radio chat is confusing. Who is holding and releasing that button? The surgical removal of the alien fetus is beyond reasoning. The hieroglyphic universe map is the star of this film. The sequel might help. Hopefully, they'll give the bong a break.","7"
"rich0154","A shocking hack job","10 March 2013","Is this some kind of joke by Ridley Scott? Answer big life questions? I don't think so. I love the first two in the franchise and was bored by subsequent ones taken over by other directors. So this is his big statement? A mess of silly philosophy is what I saw not unlike what Scientologists try to peddle. Bad computer animation/effects, a laborious storyline and a grating female lead protagonist. No thanks but I do give thanks that I didn't pay hard cold cash to sit through this snorefest. In short, I found no redeeming qualities in this opus of excess and hope Scott realizes it's time to call it a career as well as close the franchise.","1"
"GiraffeDoor","Chain this to the rock","2 March 2019","I haven't seen much of the Alien Franchise so I'm watching this with only a memory of ""Alien"" in mind.

I'm afraid if you're going into this eager for a visual stunning, intelectually stimulating piece of sci-fi action adventure drama you're going to be disappointed.

Maybe the nuances of this movie will be more meaningful to someone more familiar with the franchise but I thought this whole thing was kind of derivative.

Now i'm not a snob when it comes to these movies: I'm very willing to believe this kind of thing can be intelligently written and original while at the same time i am happy to have the usual formula of cool monsters, lazer fire and blood everywhere.

We don't have much of a premise, all the characters are pretty bland and wooden and it takes a long time for anything to happen. i get the importance of building atmosphere but this gave me so little in the way of motivation or character beyond a few crude types I wasn't really invested in anyone or anything I was seeing.

There's good production values of course; plenty of great sets and design but it's all more of what we've seen before. They do the ""classical music in space"" cliche which I'd be fine with but it's...just guess...yes Chopin's Raindrop Prelude. Why is it always Chopin? This is emblematic of the level of originality this movie gives.

We are almost halfway before anything really cool happens and the aliens of this movie are few and far between. The motivations of the antagonist are confusing to say the least.

It's not very gripping, not very emotional nor does it give you much to think about except some nebulous ideas about hubris and immortality. it's dull. It took me three sittings to get through it. Maybe i should give it slack for being the first in a planned series and it's job is really just to lay groundwork for the sequel but that still is not a point in its favour.

The ending deserves a better movie to have come before.","3"
"EmmaDinkins","Chix Chat on Film Review: Alien a new beginning.","8 June 2012","Prometheus is the name of the spaceship built by Weyland Corp, a staple in the Alien series, to explore a star system that the lead scientist Dr. Elizabeth Shaw (Noomi Rapace) believes holds the key to understanding the origin of human-kind. She chooses to believe that 'the engineers' of human DNA as depicted in ancient drawings are inviting mankind to come on by and say 'hi'. I had seen the trailer and heard her say that so many times that when it was finally delivered in the film, I just wanted to slap her, and I had a slap for Captain Janek (Idris Elba) with that stupid country accent, and a few other crew members for just being plain stupid. This was one of those rare occasions when I was glad the actor did not consistently maintain his characters accent, Janek was much better when the accent failed. I understand that you have to have a heaping helping of idiots to make for all the mayhem that can jump off on a distant alien planet, but really how can everyone be so cavalier? I expected this Alien prequel (whether you call it that or not) to provide answers, but I was left with even more questions. For one thing what happened to a light year for measuring distance in space travel? When did space travel start to measure distance in kilometers with a mathematical formula that only a genius level mathematician can decipher? Evidently, some time prior to 2093. In just 80 years the technology will be phenomenal, there are space ships that are architectural marvels, the ability to preserve life in hyper-sleep, man has created near perfect synthetic humanoids, and with monitoring equipment on everything and everybody, how is it that when you get a knock at your front door you can't see who or what is there and just open the portal? Why is nobody afraid? What happened to 'be afraid, be very afraid'? I will say that the cinematography and special effects were supreme, the opening credits landscape shots were breathtaking, but why is it that every planet worthy of exploration is in close proximity to or is a Saturn clone? Putting my questions aside, Michael Fassbender (David) gave a brilliant performance. His lack of emotion conveying a personality completely devoid of compassion seemed so effortless, as a synthetic he walked the walk and talked the talk. Hopefully my questions were not misleading giving an impression that I was less than amazed, quite the contrary this film met my every expectations and is definitely green light material.","9"
"kimnjerry-1","The review by Michael-albertsen says it all.","26 June 2012","I've been a Ridley Scott fan for years. I'll see anything with his name on it, and place ""Bladerunner"" at the top of my favorites list.

Michael-albertsen's review (with many spoilers) is on target, and I won't waste space being redundant. I will say that the 3-D version of the film is a total waste of money. There was little noticeable 3-D effect - less, even, than the cheesy promo ad for the theater in which we viewed this film. So (a) don't waste your money on the 3-D version, and (b) don't waste your money on this film. Aside from some middle of the road special effects, there is, unlike the majestic ""Alien"" or ""Bladerunner"" no character or storyline of any consequence, no scene designed to shock or startle which accomplishes that, and no meaningful philosophical question deeper than a couple stoned guys asking ""like where does the universe end, dude?""

Michael-albertsen raises several issues I hadn't considered, and, although his review will spoil the film if you haven't seen it, his assessment that Scott has been on the decline for several years seems accurate.

To me, this film was so deficient, reminiscent of really trashy 1950's sic-fi, that I can't even call it a disappointment. It was a mess.

I'll think twice before assuming that I have to see a Ridley Scott film in the theater; or, for that matter, at all.","1"
"alibahaloo","Illogic and misleading","15 June 2012","The movie is talking about a concept which many people actually have research and studied on; Ancient Astronauts. It's very much possible that we (humans) are the product of genetic engineering by some Gods (aliens), but I'm pretty sure that what was shown in the movie is not the case. In it, the director is referring to some paintings that do exists but has no reference to what the ""dr"" is talking about. For instance, there's a scene in which the mission director is referring to the depiction of Pakal the king of Mayans and talking about star formations, obliviously there are no star formations in that sculpture. Regardless of the main idea, there were many mistakes and illogical errors that just doesn't make sense. It's illogical because many things that was shown in the movie are not physical and biological possible, and I'm not talking about DNA engineering and creation humans, I'm talking about very basic common sense things. It's misleading because I couldn't find any point in it, what was the director trying to say? Was he trying to tell us anything after all? Maybe I'm expecting too much. I believe this movie is not meant for people who are interested and have studied about the idea of Ancient Astronauts. This movie is good for people who watch movies just for the sake of watching something, not to learn or develop an idea.","7"
"jason-baltis","One of the worst movies ever","10 June 2012","I'm a big horror fan and I'm a big science fiction fan. When you combine the two you will find me in a movie theater seat. By the end of this movie I just wanted my money back.

So much is wrong with this movie I don't know where to start. All of the actors/actresses, time and money that were spent developing this movie to essentially tell the viewer where the first alien came from was absurd. I could care less where it came from and to base the entire ending on this stupid fact was total crap.

Many of the characters that were in this movie reeked of Alien and Aliens' characters. If your going to spend the money then at least come up with something new and creative. An android character that was identical to the previous one, a female lead that was a so-called Weaver, and plenty of other personality types that were the same. It was as if I was watching a combination of the first two movies with a horrible script. Nothing was ORIGINAL. And what a total waste of Theron. What was her character even there for? The most pivotal scene between her and her father was horrible and didn't even need to be there either. If you took her out of the movie it would have been the same movie.

The only reason I rated this movie a 2 was the computer graphics. They were at least clean and the colors looked good. Everything else was garbage and the only people that think this movie is good are people who are not familiar with the Alien trilogy. Lousy character development. So few actual horror scenes. So few actual questions answered. Save your money.","2"
"cliffo-1","Too confusing and too many exploding heads","9 June 2012","I have heard that there are 30 minutes missing from the theatrical release. If that is the case then they chose to cut out any scene that could have helped this movie hang together better as a film.

The people heading to the planet were not ""scientists"". The character stereotypes didn't fit at all. It would be more appropriate to call them explorers, or ""adventure seekers"" or even treasure seeking pirates than to call them ""scientists"". Just watch the actual Mars rover science teams to get a feel for how that generalized stereotype might behave when faced with exploring a new planet. There was also supposed to be a difference between the ""science team"" and the ""hired help"" that was pretty blurry most of the time...why was the hired help there exactly?

I lost track of how many heads exploded and how many different types of infections were going on during the movie. And, I just didn't care who died...it wasn't even clear who the hero was even in the end. I guess the formerly impregnated girlfriend is angry now and wants some answers so she is...going to confront a planet of other angry aliens in an act of...? Revenge? Retribution?

"bruce-129","12:03AM Show Redwood City, CA - Naw!","8 June 2012","I have really been looking forward to this movie. That's why I watched the first showing in the area at midnight. This is a tepid, uninspired, idiotic miss.

""Prometheus"" did lots of the same thing that ""Alien"" did when it first came out, so why was ""Prometheus"" so lackluster? That's just it, so much of the same stuff  nothing better in over three decades. This movie insulted the intelligence of everyone who will go to see it.

The first idiotic move was that make the movie about these cave paintings. It was like the first false step the movie took and set it off on a destination of stupid. It just got worse as it contrived to end in a way that would make it a prequel to the original ""Alien"" movie.

SPOILERS AHEAD .

1. The first scene presumably shows the ""engineers"" coming to Earth and ""seeding"" the planet with life. Shades of ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" here, but done almost 50 years later and no better or deeper. Why they had to seed the planet by having one of their own come down to the planet and disintegrate into it was weird also. It tells you that you are watching an idiotic movie.

2. So, if the seeding came from the ""engineers"" before their was life, then how would the primitive civilizations have all come to know the ""engineers"" and why would they have painted cave murals pointing at stars they could not know? No reason, just another moronic Lindeloff-ism.

3. So, Weyland, the megalomaniac wants to live forever, so he spends a trillion dollars to make a starship, and then hires morons to staff it and run it. None of them can take the time to be courteous or friendly to each other. None of them can follow rules. Can you imagine what kind of an idiot takes off their helmet on an alien planet they have been on for 20 minutes? This is strictly 1950's sci-fi movie norms.

4. Since David, the robot, seems to be able to find out so much about the aliens that he can jump right onto their ship and work it and maneuver it, why do they ever need all these other incompetent jokers?

5. What is the problem on this planet? There are weirdo lifeforms in the pyramids, DNA all over the place that is capable of taking over human DNA and transforming the person, and even their sperm into a monster making germ seed that can grow into a monster in 10 hours.

6. I could go on for hours as to why this movie is not much different than ""Alien"" but how it just does not seem to ever connect in theme, character, story, even the effects here are what we have gotten used to. Where ""Alien"" was so strong at breaking new ground, ""Prometheus"" cannot even use old ground to grow what should have been a very interesting movie.

This movie was a major disgrace, it was really terrible and such a lame miss. This was only done for the money, that's for sure. Sorry I gave it to them, don't make the same mistake as me.",NA
"Madelle","Less than intelligent science fiction","19 June 2012","In 25 years of movie-going this film accomplished the unique feat of actually making me angry, which has never happened before.

Let me start off by saying that I did not walk in particularly expecting a horror or action film but rather a thoughtful piece in the vein of Scott's ""Blade Runner"", which ranks high among my favorite films of all time. I expected the ""intelligent science fiction"" so many other reviewers have touted. Instead, what I got was one of the dumbest and most shallow pieces of cinema I have seen in years.

For starters none of the characters are particularly likable, nor do most of them seem particularly believable. Throughout the film none of them behave reasonably but rather continue to make the most imbecilic decisions available to them. The ""science"" part of the science fiction is complete hogwash to a point that--together with the ridiculous plot and characters, seriously hurts the suspension of disbelief of the audience. Mine disappeared approximately after the first 30 minutes and things only got more ridiculous from there. A scene involving a surgery machine, which is heavily foreshadowed, is one of the highlights of abject stupidity. The same goes for a biologist's interaction with an alien life form.

The only positive aspects to the film are the beautiful imagery and Michael Fassbender's performance as David, which is the acting standout. Most of the others are (except for Idris Elba) forgettable, though not particularly bad as such. What lets them down is the terrible script, which unfortunately makes little use of the potential that arises from Fassbender's performance or the concept of an humanity as an engineered life form. The film's purported existential questions are ham fisted and less than subtle. They are not conveyed or discussed in remotely interesting ways. Instead, the film seems insistent upon embracing the continued idiocy of its plot and characters.

The awful script by Lindelof makes this one of the worst and dumbest films I have seen in recent memory. If you want intelligent science fiction look elsewhere. Even as a hollow and empty summer movie it fails to achieve any sort of positive standard.","4"

The theme here is mankind's search for meaning in life, to know where we came from, and pondering why we want to know the answers to those. This is a spiritual prequel to, and not remake of, Alien(it takes place in the same universe and explains backstory for that and as you may already know, it evokes some of the most unforgettable imagery from it, as well, and, unfortunately, it also goes some of the same places we've already been in this series(not to mention that if this is your introduction to these, I doubt it will feel like a full movie to you... if you love the 1979 picture, you'll either have the same response to this or the opposite, and for the same reason it explains things that were left up to our imaginations before) but it does also provide one new take on the biology which will forever haunt you, and that scene alone is worth the price of admission), this is not flashy as the trailer makes it look(do not go straight from the preview to the full thing, the former gives far too much away), in spite of glowy ship buttons, holograms(this is one of the movies that 3D is made for, by the way it enhances the expertly built atmosphere, it is subtle and it was filmed that way, not a post-conversion this may be the only title shot in that manner that doesn't throw anything at the camera(and thus the audience) at any point, it's not gimmicky in the least; FX in general are incredible, I can't tell where physical reality ends and CGI begins) and those light-blue, spandex-like skintight spacesuits(!) that were clearly forced upon all of the well-selected cast simply because they look great on Theron(who's a regular Ice Queen in this(maybe this was the audition tape for Snow White and the Huntsman?), as the woman in charge) and that woman we used to call Lisbeth Salander(until Rooney Mara proved that she is the one deserving that title). Fassbender is the android(hey, it's part of this franchise, there's gotta be one of those in it! At least he has a point in this, he knows ancient languages and the like), established through, at first him being awake whilst the others are in hypersleep, amusing himself with a basketball(I guess outdoing the baseball of The Shining?) and old movies, and then, by him not batting an eye at the sight of a mostly naked, wet Charlize doing pushups. The characterization is very strong, with roles being established effectively through their initial, brief interactions with each other. Acting is phenomenal for all concerned. There is a ton of disturbing content and a bit of moderate language, bloody violence, gore and sexuality in this.

For all the comparisons to Alien, Ridley was right when he said it's not the same type of story. I don't think it'll be as iconic as Alien and Aliens 30 years from now, but this movie got me thinking harder than those. The camera work was awesome, the story seemingly had a few holes in it, but since it's dealing with very mysterious subjects, who's to say if they're really holes or just something the movie didn't get around to showing us, since it packs a lot into two hours. The acting and one-liners aren't as memorable as Aliens.

"mrslythe","Prometheus","10 June 2012","Prometheus

PREQUEL, PREQUEL, PREQUEL, PREQUEL, PREQUEL, PREQUEL, PREQUEL. Regardless of what anyone says and whatever you have read, Ridley Scott's cinematographically magnificent Prometheus is a prequel to the Alien franchise. My opinion may be challenged with the words of the director himself, stating that the movie is not a direct prequel and is an original movie itself. Prometheus is about a group of doctors, geologists, and other scientific operatives traveling across the vast area of space, to reach a planet they think holds the truth of how humankind was created .This Sci-Fi Horror film has re-launched the combination of these two genres to a new level that was once reached by the primary, Alien. With an astounding cast featuring the enticing Noomi Rapace (The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo) and the always astonishing Michael Fassebender (Shame), our generation is lucky enough to view this mesmerizing experience most of us weren't able to witness in 1979.

Reference is an understatement when it comes to Prometheus ""referencing"" certain aspects of Alien in this film. Prometheus flourishes in giving homage to the first Sci-Fi Horror to really put such an everlasting effect on an audience. From the smallest visualization of the ship's monitors to the unforgettable chest-bursting scene, this film is a re-boot to show that Ridley Scott is still capable to impact an audience and to remind the world about the film he released 33 years ago. The hype of this film was very high and audiences across could possibly walk away with anguish on their faces contemplating why they paid $10 to see such a film. The reason why critics and movie viewers are so disappointed is because we've already seen this type of film before and it's nothing new. Yes a different story and a different cast with better developed characters, but what's different? It's not about being different with Ridley Scott, it's about sharing his updated newer version with a generation that always asked, ""How did the Xenomorphs (Aliens) become to be?""

The cast of the film was brilliantly chosen. Noomi Rapace who is known for playing disturbing roles, played the role of Elizabeth Shaw just as impeccable as Sigourney Weaver did Ripley in Alien. The difference between the two women is that Noomi's character was dismayed by most of the situations while Weaver's character was a bit stronger and confident in her doings. The very humorously talented Idris Elba played the captain of the ship who had no care for the mission, he just flew the ship. His presence is the most likable because he gives off a jokingly sarcastic response to most of the crew allowing the audience to gain respect for this witty yet determined actions. Charlize Theron who is having an amazing two weeks in theaters, plays the very distant woman in charge, Meredith Vickers, whose job is to make sure everyone else does theirs. She's the antagonist of the film, always hesitating on orders and commands and has no care in the world for what is going on during the whole mission. Theron plays the role flawlessly, probably picking up some pointers from her villainous role in Snow White and the Huntsman. Last but not least, the man of last year Michael Fassbender, plays David the robot. Most human beings have trouble being themselves, so how Fassbender is able to play a robot so perfectly still haunts me as I'm writing this. This hopefully nominated for supporting actor performance is judged solely on the reason of emotion. David the robot is unable to apprehend emotions because he doesn't have a ""soul"". The actions of David are what drive him to do things that he is beginning to understand due simply to observing the ones who created him.

The movie itself was amazing and I'm still blown away. At first I was hesitant to watch this film because the writers wrote films such as The Darkest Hour and Cowboys and Aliens, two movies that didn't do extremely well in theaters. Knowing how well made and passionate Ripley Scott makes his films, I had no choice but to see this filmmaking pioneer. The story doesn't have many plot holes and the ending is a traditional ending that most audiences would expect but are still capable to blow us away because of how divine it looks. The biggest reason why I liked the film is because of the fact that it is the best prequel I have ever seen for a film and answered so many unanswered questions that I've asked. My high recommendation is to watch Alien first or after because you'll want to be like me after walking out of the theater and smiling to yourself saying, ""Wow so that's why that... and that... and this.""

This review was very simplistic because maybe I'm still very excited about the movie. I did leave out a lot of information that are very big spoilers because I want everyone to enjoy this movie and to see it for what it really is. I described some characters and how the film is definitely a prequel to Alien. I can't stress this enough and I'm annoying myself just thinking about the similarities both films have. I'm going to make a review later when the BluRay/DVD comes out and I'll do a full review with spoilers and all the good stuff I didn't post now. Here's simply what you should know,  Story - Nothing new, yet refreshed to our generation.  Characters - Each have an inducing different personality similar to the one's in Alien.  Cinematography - Beautiful  IT IS A PREQUEL - Marcel Urena","8"
"aquin-dmello","Genesis re-written by politically correct, technically wrong oligarchs.","24 September 2012","Before I begin my criticism, I'd like to point out to whomsoever decides to watch this drama; remember the first scene. It kind of hints at the entire presumption.

The movie deals with the eternal question of what we are, where we come from and where do we go from here. As expected, it is a very difficult one to answer so the movie toes the account of Genesis, which is a good start. Had they stuck with it, it would suffice. But no, they had to toss in some sitchins, some childresses and then a dash of political correctness, making what should have been an epic into nothing more than a costume party.

I don't know if it's pressure or just obstinate behavior, but the filmmakers just don't seem to want to put any intellectual property into their work.

Having said that, I wonder why they left evolution out of it all. More surprisingly, why haven't the evolutionists trashed the movie, which by all means they are the first to do on IMDb.

"TheSeaLion","Better than the first time I watched it","26 October 2014","When I first saw ""Prometheus"" a year and a half ago, I described it as a hodgepodge of bad ideas. Taking a second look at it now, I realize that my original views on the film were a little harsh. ""Prometheus"" in no way reaches the level that ""Alien"" and ""Aliens"" is on, but it is still an impressive movie with a few problems that do bog it down.

After discovering a series of similar drawings on location of ancient civilizations that never had contact with one another, two scientists, Shaw (Noomi Rapace) and Holloway (Logan Marshall-Green) believe the drawings are a map back to their creator's home world. Sponsored by Peter Weyland (Guy Pearce), the crew of the Prometheus is sent to the location shown in the drawings to try and find the creators, who are dubbed engineers. Among the crew of the Prometheus is Vickers, a Weyland company employee named(Charlize Theron), an android named David (Michael Fassbender), Captain Janek (Idris Elba), a geologist named Fifield (Sean Harris), and a biologist named Millburn (Rafe Spall).

Like the original ""Alien"", it Scott makes the audience wait for the creatures to appear and the horror to start. Only after the movie is half over do we get the first casualties on the mission. The film also does have a scary premise that our creators are not happy with us, so they want to destroy us. The only problem with this is that the engineer who is trying to kill the crew of the Prometheus has no known motivation to do this.

A problem that I had that I've never seen anyone else bring up is the lack of relationship between the characters. Yes, Shaw and Holloway are in a relationship, but it never actually feels like they are. Vickers is actually Weyland's daughter, but they are given very little screen time together, and Weyland views David as the son he never had, which could of had potential for an interesting relationship between Vickers and David. Shaw discovers that David killed Holloway, but is barely shown angry at him, until the end when he needs help and it feels like it comes out nowhere.

Like most people, I think there were some dumb and confusing character moments in the film. Shaw and Vickers running in a straight line from the rolling ship is something everyone has pointed out, as is Millburn (the biologist) being scared off by a dead alien and then being interested in an alien snake creature. Fifield and Millburn get lost when the Prometheus has a sophisticated tracking system and Fifield has all the mapping equipment. David's motivation for infecting Holloway with the black goo is something that does not make a lot of sense.

The movie does have very impressive visuals and some strong performances, the best coming from Fassbender as David. The entire landscape of the world that the crew was on looked amazing and like it was really there. The movie also has the second best scene in all of the Alien franchise with Shaw getting the creature cut out of her.

The movie has a few problems that bog it down, but the movie is held up by its premise, the performances, the visuals, and Scott's superb directing. I didn't bring up anything about the loose ends because there were not as many as I remembered and none of them bogged the movie down for me. This is definitely a movie I like but I can understand why others might not.","7"
"sun_jot","This is not an alien film, those who fail to see this sure will be disappointed","11 June 2012","One of the things I learned these few years from movie going experiences is that I should never have much expectation of what the plot could be or what the movie should be about. Prometheus is not a film about Aliens and it's only remotely related to the alien film that you saw with the big round ship and mother alien. Now if you enjoy sci-fi novels and TV-shows from the old time, you probably will enjoy this film greatly like I did. I was in awe with how many details Prometheus had to offer in the film. None of the other sci-fi movies in recent years had done so well in depicting space-shuttle, high tech and alien planet, making them very much so believable (and fascinating). Avatar was a good film but it felt more towards a fantasy film rather than sci-fi.

And another thing is that a good sci-fi novel/film does not need to explain itself head to toe. Leaving things open and questions unanswered (for the reader/audience to fill and answer) is good strategy in my mind. Some of the negative reviews I read here pretty much all complained about the character behaviors and misclassified mythology. Some of the questions people asked actually are implicitly answered in the film. With a second viewing I am sure the questions might be answered. Rather than say to your face hey this is what's going on, the film makes you think and makes your own Hamlet.

All in all, it's great sci-fi movie in my opinion, the best sci-fi film I have seen in last decade I must say. Give it a try and leave off the ideas of going to see another alien films (don't we have enough of them already?). The movie is called Prometheus and I assure you this will be a unique experiences and will be worth your time especially if you are die-hard sci-fi fan.","10"
"buddybhupender","All great things have small beginnings!!","25 June 2012","OK straight to the business-

What's good: The story, the special effects, twists and mysterious appearances of characters, the out of the universe environmental feel and some stunt sequences!!

What's Bad: it differs on intellectual level or how much one can be flexible to accepts the flaws of the script so keeping that in mind i would say..many audience were not convinced out of the science or biologically impossible alien mutations...so no answers how it happened, lots of questions unanswered about the aliens or so called Titans origin and the whole mythology based storyline somehow makes you feel that you have not grasped the whole concept in the first view so most of the people (probably non English) will see it again to understand the basic idea of the movie ultimately hence this movie doesn't suits for every one only people who have seen the alien series and interested in similar movies will definitely enjoy it others may avoid it.

Verdict: A Really Great entertaining movie for Sci-Fi fans and others as well if you don't mind some unexplained phenomena and the whole backdrop of the Titan Mythology. Ridley Scott has yet again created a new kind of unexplored Science and Alien related possibility which we will definitely see more in the future!!

Loo Break??: Well here you will be not able to take your eyes off even for a second so keep staring at the screen otherwise one might miss the whole understanding of the movie!!

Watch or Not?:I would say all the great things in this world were never perfect in their beginning only in later stages of their life they achieved the perfection and greatness..so if you know that sometimes there are loopholes in the script or impossible or unexplained events takes place..give it some time and you might find your answers!! so keeping that in mind i waited till the movie finished and the way it ended it provided an opening for the sequel and as a hopeful enthusiastic person i am; i think in the next part there will be explanation for most of the things which left unanswered in this movie or till the climax. Moreover i also read some reviews where people criticized the Director Ridley Scott that how these mutations can take place or why did not the characters made sure that on the alien soil there can be microbes and other biological threats present which can put their life in danger like insects or bacteria in the soil & air. The characters are behaving like they know this alien planet because their scanners said so. Story is not perfect and it just creates stereotype elements and characters so don't go and watch it blah blah...!!

OK i get it..but on the whole i loved the movie..there can never be a perfect movie or script only a better one...so the movie entertains and it is more enjoyable in 3D!!

Direction & Technical Aspects: Ridley Scott has done a good job and like his alien series he also used really big sets and equipments to make this movie a real deal and the technique used for special effects and 3D effect is mind blowing; i thought that if that kind of CGI techniques would have been available at the time of Alien series that movie would have been much more scarier and yet a treat to watch so no complaints here!! The technical parts, visual and special effects were terrific. Pietro Scalia's editing was perfect. Sonja Klaus's set decoration were amazing and they took us more closer to the possible alien world out there and making it more real then ever before so Hats off!! And yet again Ridley Scott has used large sets and technical facilities to make a terrific movie!!

Star Performances: All the characters were good in their respective roles yet some characters were there only to sacrifice according to the need of the story and moreover it is a sci-fi movie so not much scope for real acting. Noomi Rapace as Elizabeth Shaw once again plays an action role after her much successful native movies of the girl with the dragon tattoo series but this time with a PHD. Michael Fassbender as David was most impressive. The kind of variety of emotions he showed not from his face but from his actions were amazing..otherwise not much to do for others!!The only person not justifying in the cast was the character of Charlize Theron..she never did anything in the movie the whole time so what the casting members were thinking before signing her!!

The Last Word: Prometheus is an entertaining movie and perhaps the best so far in the sci-fi category this year and it brings something new and unexplored material which is worth a watch despite its complexions and loopholes. And this movie perhaps more enjoyable and entertaining in 3D so go and enjoy it!!","10"
"FilmFanatic03","Unique, fresh, enjoyable","2 June 2012","Prometheus is a fresh, different and unique film. Yes it is argued a prequel to Alien, but in today's landscape of film it really does stand out. It had the right balance of scares, shocks and time for the plot to develop and to be engaged with the characters. At the end of the day it is a really good sci-fi/action film where, because it is different, you were unsure where events of the film would lead to and you were unsure of the fate of some characters. Ridley Scott managed to draw you into this world (it even works in 2D) and you don't question the credibility of anything until the end when you remember, it is just a film. The whole cast were brilliant: Noomi Rapace lead the film amazingly, Charlize Theron managed to pull off this cold and heartless character and so on, but Michael Fassbender was one of the standouts of this film. Playing robot David, he portrayed his character as a cold, mysterious and interesting character who has a big part to play in the film. It felt like Ridley Scott gave us about 90% (in a good way) because he doesn't want to give too much away. It felt like that he wanted us to feel like we wanted to see more, equalling a possibility of a sequel. Prometheus manages to be an engaging, interesting, enjoyable, unique and clever sci-fi film which at the end makes you want to see more of this world Scott has created.","9"
"kastri_gr","Have you seen it?Not yet?Then go","6 June 2012","Prometheus is the most waited film of the year.In Prometheus we expect to get answers about the space jockey and the xenoform.And at one point Ridley Scott has managed it.He is triggering with questions like where do we come from?what is our purpose?He gives a deeper meaning to the film.

The film starts with a mysterious alien form (in the film we know them as Engineers) from whom we were created.This creature decides to leave hints so later mankind come in contact.And this is what happened.After a 2 year journey Prometheus reached its destination to LV-223 where a team of explores decide to investigate a mysterious pyramid where above are the engineers fossilized for unknown reason and they took a sample back to the ship.A sudden storm forces 2 members of Prometheus to stay back where both of them will be attacked by a mysterious small life form which has the same characteristics with the Xenoforms from alien and they both die.Back on Prometheus an android called David puts a genetic material on Charles Holloway and he gets infected without knowing it.And he is going to pass it to Elizabeth Shaw an embryo of the first form of Xenoform.Furthermore,David knows exactly what was the purpose of Engineers.They created the Dna of the Xenoform so they can kill the whole humanity but for an unknown reason they lost the control and there is an Engineer alive but frozen.The final battle will be between Elizabeth,Engineer and The Xenoform (do not compare it yet with the alien) where from this battle will rise the form of the Alien as we know from the films.

There are many similarities between Prometheus and alien.The planet is not the same (LV-426 was in alien)but the main idea is the same.We get to know why these things were created,what was the purpose only to find out the human factor has played an important role in the story.A total different experience in 3D believe me you wont regret.

Although it is not a direct prequel it has those characteristics with the alien franchise.I mean if Ridley Scott decided to make a direct prequel i believe it would be a total failure like AVP movies.Prometheus presents a new kind of science fiction and i hope in the near future we can see a sequel but i wish it would be from a great director.And don't forget that David mention that there are other space jockeys around the galaxy.If you ask me which of two i prefer i would alien because it is a classic film but Prometheus gives another aspect a new kind of franchise.","10"
"StonedMagician","Great: 9.0","27 July 2019","Many of the best science fiction, not just in film but in all media, uses its generally futuristic setting to ask fundamental questions about humanity, and what it has to do with something or another. And they usually answer these questions in their own way, and these answers can be either predictable, satisfying, or sometimes both, and in the worst cases the former but not the latter. Prometheus does not take any of these routes. It instead asks questions and leaves the answers up to the audience. There is no real payoff, which is both this film's saving grace and biggest weakness. I will proceed to talk about the plot as little as possible, to avoid any spoilers. The plot itself is actually fairly formulaic. Guys fly a ship, guys find alien life, alien life fights back, guys die. Nothing special. However, the philosophical angle is what makes this film's story a unique one. It hearkens back to the days of truly intelligent sci-fi, such as 2001 and, yes, Alien. The film asks and seemingly answers the question ""where did we come from?"", but the question of where our makers came from is one that will have to be answered in the sequel. This is one of the tantalizing mysteries that Prometheus drops on us, and one that I cannot wait to find the truth of. Seemingly knowing how important this film is to those who will be seeing it, the actors have put their all into their characters, who all have just enough personality to avoid seeming like androids with differences in their programming. The one who truly steals the show is Michael Fassbender, whose performance as David the android is one of the best I have seen in a science fiction film. His movements are fast and precise, making him truly feel like the artificial person he is. Noomi Rapace and Charlize Theron both bring the necessary strength to remind viewers of Ripley, continuing the series' legacy of strong female leads. Scott has stated numerous times that this film is not meant to be like Alien, but rather as a sort of companion piece set in the same universe. In this sense,the film succeeds brilliantly. The horror elements return in full force, and are still as squirm-inducing as they were three decades ago. The action takes place in some of the most gorgeously rendered and built sets I have ever seen in a film. This is a technically incredible, so much so that it almost overshadows the story the writers are trying to tell. This film has the definite feel of a prelude to something bigger. This is not an especially good thing, as movies with this trait tend to end in a rather unsatisfying manner. The final scene feels too much like a bone Scott has thrown to rabid fans of his 1979 classic, and those unanswered questions do not help. Despite this, I left the theater feeling like I had seen the most intelligent sci-fi film to come along in some time, and for that, Prometheus deserves to be commended.","9"
"hennyxu","Annoying stupid characters","23 September 2014","First let's make a couple of things clear. This will be the second time that I've seen this movie over a period of circa two years. I know that this movie originally had a perfect script, biblical almost, but it has been Hollywoodnised (I know not a word). And lastly, I haven't completely seen any of the ALIEN movies. I have partially seen movie 1 and 2 but for some reason I just never got around to it. So NO I will not be comparing to the alien franchise, but I will be referencing it a little. I know not seeing the ALIEN movies is a cardinal SIN, but there are so many good movies in the world, plus it's not like everyone has seen ""into the wild"" (one of my favorite movies  ), so let's continue.

As some of you may know ""Prometheus"" is a prequel to the Alien franchise and it tries to tell the origin story of the Aliens. It all starts on prehistoric earth where an alien species known as the engineers laid the biological foundations for humanity. We then jump cut to the end of the 21st century and scientists discover that these engineers have left clues in the form of coordinates. After a long journey we finally arrive at the engineer's planet only to find death.

Let me first start with what was good about it: - The quality of the visuals is gorgeous. People, who know me, know that I really dislike the fake feeling of CGI or the fake look of green screen effects. While not perfect this movie has great effects that provide depth. In addition, great set pieces and props (I like big props). It is a shame though that this was mostly limited to the first arc of the movie.

Produced and directed by Ridley Scott. This doesn't mean that it is a good movie but it does give the movie a feeling of grandeur, which is something I've come to expect from him.


Soundtrack, the movie didn't really have a lot of music but the little sound it did have gave the movie a mysterious and tense mood.


One single bland character that held the movie together, which can be considered the saving grace of the movie, I will elaborate it later. The point is, in this movie there is a robot that discovers almost everything and he perfectly relates to the movies main them, which is life or the purpose of life to be exact.


So let's rip this movie apart: - The visuals may be good but this alone doesn't make a movie. Even though film is a visual medium it is an art form that tries to convey a story. The story of Prometheus does have potential to be good however, sometimes during the movie it becomes obviously clear that certain scenes have been changed or added to please a more ""general"" audience, which in the end killed the overall second and third arc. So basically what I'm trying to say is that it becomes boring at the end of the movie and this is truly a cardinal SIN! - But my main grime with this movie is the characters. Who thought that it would be a good idea to put preschoolers into adult bodies, because that is how the majority of the people behave in this movie. They keep doing stupid things that a normal person wouldn't do (e.g., person X sees a creepy alien worm. His reaction how adorable I want to pet it) and that really makes you lose interest in the movie. The only explanation for why they behave as they do is to move the plot forward, which is a perfect indicator that to script isn't done yet. The only person with a descent story arc is the robot and he is a bland character.

It knows that it is related to the Alien franchise and it has many easter eggs. This can't be considered a good thing, because the movie doesn't have enough substance to stand on its own.


The movie was bad and I can go on for hours ranting about how to improve it, but the truth of the matter is I've seen this movie a second time. The story and characters may be bad but it is the combination of the mood and visuals that have a certain ""je ne sais quoi"" that makes it interesting enough to re-watch it. It is definitely better than the mindless piece of ""PEEP"" that Michael bay is producing. Do I recommend this movie? Yes, but only for one time.","6"
"charles-limcw","Lobotomised and Crippled by Infantile Characters and Crappy Amateurish Dialogue","17 December 2020","Very promising start when there was only one character and little spoken, all mainly driven by the visuals and sounds.

Once the characters pop up and opened their mouths, out spewed amateurish dialogue from equally cartoonish infantile characters.

And things just got worse and more ridiculous by the minute. Even the usually competent and reliable actors couldn't save the stale pong they had to mouth.

Saving grace - Visuals and sounds superb throughout.

Everything else - at best barely B-Grade pretentious fest.

Kudos to the cinematography, production design and special effects folks - well-deserved their Oscar and BAFTA nominations.

The writers - be rightly shamed and go get other jobs that require ZERO writing.","5"
"cafelucy","Oh where do I begin -","24 June 2012","Spoiler starts now! while this film was beautiful to look at that alone could carry it for the hour and 20 minutes of pure crap writing and acting. I'm not even going to get into the flaws or insane actions of supposed learned people. It is true it is a prequel and it is a poor one at best. Alien was a great film and not just for the horror, it was great for the acting and development of the characters. This movie has none of that...not one little bit. In the end, you want a origins store to give you the ORIGINS of the story!!!!you get none of that either. you are only given a poor plot devise that leaves you with too many questions like - Did they create us?if so why do they want then to kill us? Also if they did create us then how would we know to write on cave walls were they left the ships filled with death. I am sure that there is another 20 minutes of back story on the editing floor but it still will not fill these holes! And why in gods name would you go about killing anything or anyone by making this alien infestation/changeling/can not be killed -over populating menace like the ""Alien"" to begin with!. The point of killing off anyone is to kill them - not leave in their place a race of self replicating, super killing creatures. Not to mention that if they can kill off your enemy that makes them more of a threat then the enemy your TRYING TO KILL OFF.

It is clear that Scott has lost his sight for telling the difference between what is good and what just looks good! it the end he let the writer just steal the reason we wanted the aliens in the first two movies (as a weapon for the company) and made that the answer to the origins of the aliens (a weapon). He tossed in the ""they made us"" thing to give it some depth but never answered why then would they want to wipe us out. In fact, he never really answered any questions at all. I know it is just a movie!!! but... Ridley Scott was always one of my favorite directors but he has committed the biggest sin of all, dumping on his great work and not even having the good sense to keep us engaged enough to not notice.

Now, if you want a good alien origins idea I'll give you one. We were created as a ""wet"" device to mature the aliens in (a host body to bring them to a better state) and we developed into our own independent race. The alien developed organically and have a symbiotic relationship with the race that created us for them. Due to harsh conditions the aliens died off on earth but not elsewhere. As slave hosts, we had some knowledge as did the creator drones (hence the cave art). We could then develop more and go off looking for them not knowing what we would find t-at least then the reveal at the end would have been something less expected. By the way, I came up with that in 10 minutes...we've been waiting 33 years for this movie, the least they could have done was more than this.","1"
"eflament06","If you liked Lost","8 June 2012","I went to this movie hoping for a revolutionary sophisticated new sci fi genre. Nope. This movie was written by the guy who wrote Lost and it was just as pointless. It was like he crammed every theme you could possibly think of in the movie and then didn't even bother trying hard on any of them. The characters were completely unrealistic. They don't seemed to be interested in the fact that they are the most important explorers that have ever lived. Or that they have discovered the greatest discovery ever. Or that there is a squid alien they just left behind in the medical bay. They're all hostile toward each other for no good reason. No one in the movie acts reasonably at all. If you take out all the visual effects, you don't have a movie. If you decide to go, just bring your ipod and listen to music over it or something. They didn't even put that awesome sound from the trailer in the movie!","1"
"cory-huff3897","Prometheus - A bold, brave, and terrifying new direction for the Alien series.","10 June 2012","Stop. Right now. Forget what you think know about the Alien franchise. Forget what you think you're about to see. You're all very, very wrong.

Prometheus returns Ridley Scott to the franchise, and arguably the genre, that he created and delivers something very special and spellbinding. It marks a true return to science fiction that the series has desperately needed, and will leave you with more questions that are unanswered than you may like. But isn't the point of good science fiction?

Elizabeth Shaw (Noomi Rapace) and Charlie Holloway (Logan Marshall-Green) have been discovering cave paintings all over the world. These exist among multiple cultures that have existed over time with no contact with each other. What is puzzling is that in each of these cave paintings is a common element. Man is worshiping larger than average humanoids, referred to as the Engineers, that are pointing to a unique set of celestial objects. What the scientists have discovered is that this actually is a solar system well beyond the boundaries of our universe, and that within this solar system is a moon that closely resembles Earth. Who are these creatures? Did they create us? Do they negate the idea of God? The Weyland-Yutani Company has decided these are important enough questions to answer, so they sponsor a trillion dollar effort to explore these possibilities.

In the truest essence of its science fiction roots, Prometheus provides us with some unique and complex characters. Shaw is a believer in God, but is still a scientist at heart and wants her own answers to our creation. Holloway however is a pure scientist: driven, and often reckless, in his pursuit to prove that science has truly won over religion. David, the android played by Michael Fassbender, is the care giver assigned with watching over the crew during their hyper sleep across the galaxy. He is fearlessly intrigued by the team's discovery, and may or may not have come along with his own hidden agenda. Fassbender really brings a calculated and nuanced disconnect with his human counterparts. He's programmed to protect them, but is just as much out for his own answers as anyone else. Meredith Vickers (Charlize Theron) is the company representative that is there to keep everyone in line and on mission. Rounding out the main cast is the ships captain Janek (Idris Elba). It could have been a really throw away kind of role. But Elba breathes life into him, especially as he starts to see the dangers add up and concludes what it could all mean for humanity.

I would highly recommend ponying up the premium to see this in IMAX 3D if it's available in your area. It's easily the best 3D since Avatar, if not better, and really does add to the immersion. Scott films most of the film practically, only relying on CGI when absolutely necessary. The planets and locations are all stunningly presented and fully realized, especially the alien relics that the crew explores. The final product feels familiar and foreign at the same time. The same can be said with the creature effects. I won't go into detail so as to avoid spoiling the fun, but rest assured they are as nightmarish as ever.

We walked out of the movie and spent the next two hours talking about it. The events in the finale and the nature of the Engineers are left purposefully enigmatic and open ended. Not in a lazy way by any means, which is the pitfall of many recent science fiction movies. The fundamental ideas and questions being posed are universal to humanity. The quest for the truth behind our existence is part of the human experience, and Prometheus is smart enough to slow down and ask these questions of the audience. It's also smart enough to not necessarily answer all of them for you.

If Prometheus is any indication of where Scott and screenwriter Damon Lindelof (of Lost fame) plan to take the Alien franchise, then I'm all aboard. As familiar as I am with the series, I can see the possibilities of where things can go from here and it's pretty exciting. The horror elements blend seamlessly with the science fiction and the action. Throughout the two-hour run time none of the elements feel under or over balanced, and they manage to coalesce into a haunting and thought provoking experience. The perfect amount of respect is paid to the original that started it all, with a brave new path being laid out for future installments. This is exactly the movie that fans of the Alien series have been waiting for.

"darrell-19","Not a perfect film, but definitely the film ALIENS should have been.","12 June 2012","First of all, I am so pleased that I went to see Prometheus having avoided almost all reviews and spoilers. I had no preconceptions about the storyline whatsoever. I am not setting out to spoil the film for anyone by this review, but I won't hold back from discussing what I have just seen so if you want to appreciate the film the way I did then stop reading now.

One of the only things I did hear before seeing it was that this is NOT an Alien sequel or prequel. What a load of rubbish! Anyone who says this isn't part of the Alien series must have watched a different film to me. From start to finish Prometheus references, homages, and develops the story of Ridley Scott's Alien original. In fact I would go as far as to say this is the film that ALIENS should have been... it is where the original director would have taken the sequel instead of the brainless follow ups that other directors and writers churned out.

The film's flaws lie in how much it borrows from Cameron's ALIENS, with the crew waking from stasis, the mission briefing being given only when they are already light years from home (who would sign up to such a mission?). When the film actually develops new legend for itself it is a credible and quality sci-fi film.

It also feels like there are few surprises because of its adherence to ALIEN continuity... such as the synthetic human. But there is an original story and some decent character development (some ropey too, but I'll let that go).

On the whole, if you accept it for what it is, Prometheus delivers a good storyline, impressive visuals, and a few genuine jumpy moments.","7"

"blackberry2-397-582716","Good imagery, plot holes, and poor character development","14 June 2012","Although I enjoyed this movie a lot, I have to say there were many flaws from it.

NO SPOILERS

There were many general plot holes and impractical situations. There was confusion when it came to the antagonist, in that it was difficult to distinguish who was the antagonist and their motives.

There seemed to be lots behind Noomi Rapace's character (Elizabeth Shaw) however, because of the scripting and plot almost none of it was gone into detail, which could have added appeal of her character. Elizabeth Shaw's death of her mother, relationship with god and science, and inability to have children could have gone into further detail. MIchael Fassbender's character (, who wasn't supposed to show emotion, sometimes showed emotion which was contradictory. Charlize Theron's character (Meredith Vickers) added almost nothing to the plot. If she was removed from the movie there would be little to no change in the overall movie. Overall the character development was poor and should have been more of a focus of the movie

The graphics were incredible, the landscape and set was superb, that was probably the most consistently good part of the movie.

For the acting, I have seen Noomi Rapace in several other films such as the entire Girl With the Dragon Tattoo Series (Swedish versions), and Babycall and I feel that she is an incredible actress. I feel she was not given enough background information about her characters and was not given a very good script to express her character. Noomi did what she could with what she was given for her character and I think she did a good job. Michael Fassbender, did a good job acting like a robot. He was plain and unemotional to the point of creepiness, which I believe was the desired affect. He did a fine job with his acting also. Charlize Theron did a good job however wasn't a very significant character throughout the movie. She did a good job with what she was supposed to do which was act cold. The supporting crew members were completely forgettable and added very little to the movie as a whole

The two standout performances in this movie were Noomi Rapace and Michael Fassbender.

Noomi Rapace performs the best scene in which she acts desperately, and in severe pain. She makes her pain come alive and vivid for the viewers

This movie could have been very good with a little extra character development and less plot holes, however it did not live up to the hype","6"
"matt_february12","Ridiculous and insulting to even the most unintelligent person. Don't pay to watch this movie if you have a brain.","13 June 2012","It actually starts out really visually interesting for about the first 20 or 30 minutes, but leaves you wondering when something is going to happen. Gimmicky marketing tricks make you think this is going to be a movie in the same class as the Alien movies. The plot is some kind of weak push toward the idea that humans came from giant space aliens and there is no God. This is a very slow scattered movie with a horrible story and a mess of a script. There is no action, no drama, no suspense, no tension, no adventure, no background story, and no character development. There are no connections or attachment to any of the characters. The characters are unintelligent and annoying. This is literally one of the worst movies I've ever seen. I don't know how the same producer of some of my all-time favorite movies including the original Alien movie can put out this complete piece of garbage movie.","2"
"jwardww","Greatest Science Fiction Film of All Time, and Even Before","5 August 2012","What most creative teams in the business forget is that engaging science fiction requires wonder, not preaching or tidy answers. This film provides a rich tapestry of ideas, ambiguity and visceral thrills that probably should be left as a stand-alone, as it does not seem likely that anyone in Hollywood would have the creative chops to produce a satisfying sequel. This movie is less a prequel to Alien, than a brilliant sequel to Angels and Insects. Appropriating the ideas of Darwin, spiked with a Wagnerian grandeur and the narrative genius of the Odyssey, Prometheus makes all the Alien movies, from best to worst, seem to be trivial sidebars. It does this in a most ingenious way. The particulars of the Alien movies, which were at best tales of infestation, are given magnificent cosmological scope here, where everyone and everything might turn out to be be the result of a monstrous lab experiment. Like our own race which strives for eternal youth and perfection (whether for ourselves or our android charges), the other-worldly Engineers have been at genetic improvements for so long that, by the time they head for Earth, 2,000 years ago, with an unknown sinister purpose, they themselves bear a striking resemblance to the idealized sculptures of Herakles found in Flavian bathhouses. Is that really a look that happens in nature? Two mysterious iconostases are found in the chapel aboard the spaceship of the Engineers, one an idealized godlike human head, the other a precious high relief of the Xenomorph, whose first cousin went on to wreak havoc in the Alien series. Which of these is the deity is not clear. So lots of fun unanswered questions remain. Did the Engineers develop this silicon and hydro-sulfuric acid survival machine as their ideal of nature? Or was it a misstep during millenia of unchecked eugenics? The writers are careful to include the story of humble earthworms that get jacked up on the black DNA goo to become indomitable phallic cobras. No, the canisters do not contain just one result. A vodka cocktail with dingy DNA makes an archaeologist transmogrify after begetting his own octopus that has a nasty resourcefulness similar to the creature in Alien. Some of the casting is bad, as are many of the performances. Most of the scientific staff could have used a few lines in the patois of their fach to be taken seriously. The oil-rig worker mentality and bavardage of Alien is wrong for this crew of elites. The male archaeologist, Charlie Holloway, is someone you wouldn't expect to pass a driving test, let alone earn a Ph.D. And Charlize Theron's wonderful talents are wasted on a character who is unnecessary here. Maybe she is more pivotal if she is scheduled to be resurrected in later installments. The movie is amazing because all these shortcomings don't matter. The big ideas are wonderfully actor and writer proof. The action is spectacular, including one of the most dramatic collisions in cinema history, registering as powerfully as Donner's hammer in Das Rheingold. I hope there are three more Prometheus movies planned, as there are three more operas in the Ring. But if they are not as good as this one, we are better off without them.

The production values are high: art direction, cinematography, special effects. The photography is heroic and breathtaking. The part of the soundtrack that has a memorable hook was composed by Harry Gregson-Williams. That for the creature is a reprise of what Jerry Goldsmith wrote for Alien.

The tantalizing questions posed by the film might lead to greatness. David, the android with coconut milk blood and a fetish for blond movie stars, is an analog for the Xenomorph. Does he feel hurt at the indifference of his human creators. Is his status as a sub-human and the pain that causes him meant to echo our relationship to the Engineers, who appear to have been responsible for our genesis?

The fountain of youth enriches this story of eugenics. Are the canisters of DNA key to Weyland's regeneration? If he is about 100, how is it that his daughter, Theron's character, looks only 30? Again, the curious moral implications of this angle make the story so much more interesting than a mere alien invasion.

What was the motive of the Maverick Engineer at the beginning of the film. Did he populate the earth with his DNA to evolve a species capable of saving his own race from the seemingly indestructible Xenomorphs?

Did the Engineers evolve the creature as a biological planet cleanser, a deity or a flawless survival machine?

If the answers to these questions can be handled intelligently, we look forward to more in the saga.","10"
"sooperman23","No Science in this Sci-Fi","9 June 2012","Yesterday I watched the film ""Prometheus"" and was so moved by it, I felt I had to share it with everyone. This movie is total garbage. Do not pay to see this film.

If you are a science fiction fan you will be tempted to walk out within 45 minutes. The whole thing lacks plot. The acting is hard to judge because the script is so ridiculous. And finally there was extremely very little science in this science-fiction movie.

The main so- called plot of this film is clearly stated in the previews, but beyond that, there is no continuity. The idea is that all life on earth originated from an ancient, advanced, humanoid, alien life form with the goal of evolving into copies of themThere are obvious holes in this theory. Evolution is based on random biological mutations. The environment dictates the evolution of DNA. DNA is more like a record of where an organism has been, not where they are going.

So these aliens created us in the beginning, and you get to actually see that moment within the first couple of minutes of the film. However you see the same exact humanoid aliens at the end of the film. Why haven't they evolved further? You'd think there would be some changes to their appearance in 3.5 billion years! Apparently there is an apex of evolution and once you reach their level there is nothing moreNot believable in the slightest.

Once the movie explains the basic plot you are now forced to believe that within a matter of a few years a trillion dollar space exploration mission is put together and on its way to a foreign planet, which by the way is only two years away. The closest solar system to ours is, Alpha Centauri, which is 4.7 light years away. That means you would have to travel the speed of light, for 4.7 years to get there. They did not travel the speed of light and only had a seemingly conventional propulsion system. The best they could hope for was mars.

The ship was ridiculous. No attention was paid to scientific accuracy, or scale for that matter. It is supposed to be a scientific exploration vessel, why does it have a basketball court? The lab is extremely small and seemed very ill equipped. They had plenty of booze on board, but very little medical equipment. Except for a miracle machine, that can do surgery, but only on men. The supervisor of the trip has a huge extravagant suite complete with the largest TV you will ever see, wet bar and tons of swanky furniture. I am surprised there wasn't a fireplace and bear skin rug. All the crew members have small private quarters with their own bathroom and vanity. It also has a huge cargo hold that carries tons of vehicles (one the size of a short bus), and flame throwers.

During the pan out shots of the ship it can be estimated at no more than 100 meters in length. The real life space shuttle is 40 meters long! There is no way you could fit all that junk in that tiny space craft. They clearly did not build an actual ship set. You never see the crew walk through the ship from one end to the other, this is to hide the true scale.

Once the crew wakes up from their 2 year hyper sleep they regain all there strength within minutes and are really hungry. LOL. Then they take their positions on the ship and immediately find an alien structure. No searching or orbiting. Bam they find it just like that. Lucky I guess Everyone suites up in there very stylish space suits and just walks right into the structure. No hesitation.

One of the crew members is an android named David. Why didn't they have more androids to do their dirty work? Why didn't they just send a bunch of androids in first to check it out? He is very smart but totally unpredictable. He touches everything and contaminates everything.That is very annoying, when you are trying to explore a potentially dangerous site.

Characters in this film have no substance and really no logic. One minute they are screaming around hysterical about a spooky hallway and the next they are trying to pet an alien cobra, calm as can be. The characters also do every cliché B movie thing they can. Take off there helmet to find out if the air is OK, start pushing buttons to find out what they do the list goes on.

The main character is a total enigma. Her boyfriend,who later impregnates her with a squid, has four lines in the whole movie. He is a totally forgettable character. They all are forgettable. You are kind of happy when each one dies because it's one less annoying character and you know it's one step closer to the end.

There are no explanations about the aliens, or the squid baby or the black goo you see everywhere. You are just guessing what everything means. I suppose this is just a cheap ploy to get you to come back and see ""Prometheus 2"". I can only image the garbage that would be. At the very end you are graced with the appearance of a traditional alien. It makes you laugh. Not scary at all and everyone is either already dead or safe.

The only positive thing about this movie is the design. Everything looks pretty cool and it's even kind of fun to see all the design elements that went into it. It's not worth a movie ticket though. Bottom line- This movie is bad, really bad. Every second of this movie is implausible, laughable and totally ridiculous. Do not give 20th Century Fox, or Ridley Scott a single penny more for this film!","2"
"bob the moo","Engaging sci-fi that was over-hyped but still satisfying","29 September 2012","Advertising for me is something that I regularly still fall into the trap of; products that look amazing and promise the world but yet cannot ever really deliver the way they suggest. With summer blockbusters this has worn off a little bit for me and generally I do not get excited by the big trailers or the hope of fans that the new blockbuster will be the ""best film eva""; such things are generally followed by equally silly claims at the other extreme when of course the film cannot live up to the marketing hype. So it was with Prometheus, a film I was happy to catch one the crowds had been and gone. It was also a film that I didn't pay attention to the trailers, hype or reviews – nor was I in a frenzy simply because it was a part of the Alien franchise, a franchise that now has more misses in it than hits.

The ideas with Prometheus did interest me though and of course it helped that they were presented within a multimillion pound film. The film explores a planet used by the original creature from the first Alien film which was overcome by some infection; a team of scientists discover more than they bargained for and it all goes to pot. As such it is familiar territory even if it must be said that the film doesn't ever really directly touch the Alien creature as we know it (or at least not till the final scene – a scene that feels inserted because the fans need to see the Alien and also come back with their money for the next film). The tone of the film does though and in essence it is a horror movie with good ideas as creatures of one sort or another pose a threat to the humans. I found it quite tense at times even if it is never a frightening or as consistently tense as I would have liked it to be. It does still deliver plenty of horror of a sort though and I enjoyed the bigger picture which it fits into – I can understand why some were not satisfied with this aspect of it, but for me it was fine.

The special effects are impressive but it is a credit to the overall film that they are never the reason I was engaged; the effects mostly were just part of the story. The cast feature plenty to look at as well, with lots of names and heavyweight talent. Rapace isn't quite Ripley but she is a good lead. Fassbender is solid and manages to make good with the role despite walking a very familiar path. Theron is a good addition while Guy Pearce is a surprise and almost unrecognizable behind his makeup. Elba has a weak American accent (not sure why – he was brilliant with it in The Wire). Wong continues to make himself something of a cult when it comes to being involved in British sci-fi.

Prometheus may not be the brilliant Alien prequel that it was marketed on, but it is still an interesting sci-fi horror that fits into the bigger picture and delivers a satisfying yarn with strong special effects.",NA
"alex-dimitriu","A disappointing testimony to what sci fiction has become","14 June 2012","This movie (by no means a film) was hyped as being a cosmic exploration into the origins of mankind on earth. Instead it was a boring, predictable prequel to the ALIEN series. Good special effects did not compensate for the very simple story line. Also poorly cast with falsely dramatic acting reminiscent of the clever mockery of ""Team America."" This movie also leaves you wondering what grade actress Theron has become. An okay action movie, but by no means great Sci-Fiction. Prometheus was not thought provoking by any means, and completely unoriginal. It is unfortunate that this type of movie draws such a large audience. I think a 6th grader could have written a better story.","1"
"i_am_groot","Amazing piece of true Science Fiction","8 June 2012","I've come to notice on here that reviewers on IMDb are usually not in tune with film and its appreciations. This lead me to write my first ever review on here. I saw Prometheus today. This is a masterful film. And to those who are not knuckle draggers or 19 yr old Google loving dummies who live in an age of needing answers and shiny objects in their film, they will agree with me. Prometheus is a piece of science fiction that hasn't been explored since the likes of The Matrix, Blade Runner, and, yes, Alien. Science Fiction is meant to be atmospheric. It should scare us. Its gross. It is unnatural. It leaves questions unanswered and open to debate about the theologies of what we just witnessed. Enter Prometheus. A film that does all of these in it's short 2 hours and 3 minutes. Like Blade Runner (was Deckard really a Replicant? There is proof to show he is, or he isn't), The Matrix (what is the Matrix, were they really in the Matrix within another Matrix?), or Alien (where did the ship come from, what was the Space Jockey doing, what do the original xenomorphs look like, where did they come from?), we get the genre type again. True, unsettling, horrific, unanswered science fiction. Enter David, played masterfully by the ever perfect Michael Fassbender, the android who is doomed to become the antagonist. He does his daily chores and prepares the ship and himself for what is to come. This is the perfect opening for the film. Noomie Rapace is a fantastic, and very strong, female lead and will now be remembered for this film. As they enter the cave, we then start to learn what this species was doing? But what were their plans for Earth? Were they really going to destroy it or was the sacrifice at the beginning an inkling to the idea that they were soon wanting to create more life? David is already fascinated and sabotages Charlie (Noomie's love) which therefore brings us to a very unsettling discovery of Noomie being impregnated by a very primitive face hugger. Those of you who know your Alien lore should be in heaven now. To see the evolution of it all coming together. This scene is true horror. No jumpy scenes (that is not horror!). Just gut wrenching horrific sequencing and a very unsettling and masterful performance from Noomie. Its definitely not an Alien prequel, but small questions are answered for those of us who really love Alien. I am confused as to so many reviewers who are mad that it was ""a prequel."" It definitely is a film of its own pure genius that just so happens to have great homage to the Alien story. I'm very intrigued for a possible sequel and love to question: who was the sacrifice at the beginning? Is this the particular scene of the creation of Earth life? What was David's full purpose? Will Noomie get her answers? By films end was David truly wrong? Who created the Jockeys and will Noomie and David find out? This film provokes thoughts on religion, theology, human existence, evolution and pure science fiction. If you love Transformers... stay away. If you love Twilight... get the hell away! If you understand film as a true art form and know exactly what true science fiction is meant to portray... this film will stick with you for days! P.S. Michael Fassbender has my vote for Best Supporting Actor. Seeing as how he has been snuffed in the past..","10"
"inspectorbob","Great...but aargh","7 November 2021","Great acting. Great sound track. Great filmography. But not enjoyable.

It all depends on what you want to get out of a movie. This one promises profundity in every third scene...something amazing, but ends up being a romp through space experiencing the grossest aliens that Ridleys team could come up with. So disappointing.","5"
"zaferzipzip","Truly inspirational movie","8 June 2012","The script was so bad, after watching the movie you find yourself contemplating to fix the moronic script, if you got inspired so much as I did, you may even find yourself rewriting the all script. After seeing screening duration which is ''two hours'' I asked myself this question ''how the hell will this movie fulfill my philosophical expectations on the origins of mankind just in two hours?''. well it can't and won't. The origins of mankind is just a brilliant motto to market a cheap story, acting and directing even if Scott is a true master. Probably they will try to resell this bullshit with director's cut or extended cut release , viewers can actually find the answers they look for in these DVD's ,but I AM NOT GOING TO BUY IT , CUZ ALREADY PAID FOR IT WHEN I GOT THE TICKET!!! Sorry but I am not a 10- dollars bill to be picked up by a money greedy Hollywood tycoon. Well they did once, but not going to be ripped off twice, at least not on this one. IMDb must add 0 point to the vote, this one really deserves it. i still wonder if the robot was smarter than the scientists ,and he could understand and operate alien tech within a time frame of seconds, why would the ultra rich bastard hadn't taken 17 robots on board rather taken 17 idiots with him? something is SO WRONG WITH THIS MOVIE...","1"
"jhintz4444","Great sci-fi movie","10 October 2012","While it may not be as great as the original Alien movie, this movie is getting a ridiculously bad reputation. I think many people went into the theaters with the wrong expectations. This isn't a horror film or an action movie, it's a science fiction film with some thrills thrown in. I love the feel, tone, and colors used in Prometheus, along with the awesome CGI.

People can complain about plot holes or bad scriptwriting, but I don't see this as the case. In my opinion, the best sci-fi movies are the ones that leave their questions unanswered and their plot holes unexplained. Imagine if Kubrick had tried to explain 2001. Or for a more modern twist, what if Looper had attempted to fix it's paradoxes... These movies would have lost their fun.

There are several things that still upset me about this movie, but what I do know was that this is the only film in a long time that I felt the need to go out and buy on DVD. This is a movie that you really have to go watch with an open mind.

At this point, I would like to note something. It's impossible for me to believe that people actually think this was a 1-star movie. There are thousands of worse movies. Don't review because you didn't think it was worth the hype. Don't review because you need to 'balance out the score.' Review the movie based on how good it was. Just because it isn't what you thought it would be or isn't what you wanted doesn't mean it was a 1-star movie. Don't believe all of the user reviews.","9"
"classicsoncall","""Sometimes to create, one must first destroy.""","16 February 2017","For a movie that didn't make a whole lot of sense on a scientific level, I thought it was fairly entertaining. You just have to suspend disbelief at appropriate times, like when Millburn (Rafe Spall) tried to make nice with the cobra looking thingy, or when Shaw had her abdomen mechanically stapled and was good to go following her aliendectomy. I have to admit though, the whole concept of discovering where humanity got it's start left me in the dust; very confusing and not credible in the least. The alien/human DNA match was one of those one in a quadrillion shots that didn't pass muster with this viewer. I wasn't aware of this movie when it first came out, and ordered it up when I read it had something to do with the Alien franchise. So that's where my attention was focused the entire time, and wouldn't you know it, that didn't occur until the very end of the picture. In my case it was worth waiting for, because even if most of the story wasn't very credible, it still provided some cool special effects and those surreal scenes of David's (Michael Fassbender) disembodied head talking to Shaw. Almost as good as the first time it was done with Ian Holm in the role of Ash in the original ""Alien"". Hard to believe that film is almost forty years old as I write this.","7"
"michael-macdonald-83","Great visuals but massively disappointing","31 May 2012","The stunning visuals that open this film and the success of the 3D gave me hope this was going to be a great film. Until about half way through I had that hope, it was building, there was a chance it would be good. However, it completely failed to deliver on every front. The characters (other than Michael Fassbender's excellent performance) were limited, cliché's that have been seen time and time before. I simply felt no sympathy for them at any point. The plot was basically non-existent and there was no tension to resolve. To say this film is a massive let down on the build up would be an understatement.

Great cinematography and effects but the rest was just pulp for the brain with none of the intriguing dynamics of early Scott sci-fi.","4"
"ChristianUnchained","Despite it's flaws, this film blew me away","23 April 2013","I honestly don't know where to start with Prometheus, Ridley Scott's spiritual prequel to the much loved Sci-Fi horror classic, Alien. The whole film was a phenomenal trip from start to finish. First off, the visual team of Prometheus deserves a round of applause. Ridley Scott uses special effects professionally, but more over uses them judiciously.

Where some movies rely on too little visual flair, and some rely entirely on it, Prometheus hits that perfect sweet spot of exploring incredible, real life sets as well as exploring the imagination with stunning cgi. Ridley Scott is the best at using a dark hallway of a decrepit ship, as well as using his extreme attention to detail to produce gorgeous interstellar vistas and the incredible technology of the future. The amount of set usage is much more than most Sci-Fi films of late, which is a refreshing turn towards a genuine old school feel, obviously reminiscent of Alien. The acting is also as strong as the visuals, as each character has moments of glory, but the true shining star is Dr. Shaw, the self conflicted female protagonist of Prometheus. Her performance evolves as the film progresses, similar to Ripley's in Alien, and her end result is strong and intense. Dr. Shaw is a strong central character that truly evolves over the course of the film, both externally and internally.

Michael Fassbender also plays his role extremely well, and his performance is strong across the entirety of the film. The script and screenplay are also strong, peppered with one or two moments of comedy along a ton of metaphors, both visually and in the script. It's smart, deep, and extremely well told. And everything else that one would expect from an original Ridley Scott film is here: heart-pounding suspense, incredibly intense moments, many memorable scenes, and a haunting original score, reminiscent of the original Alien.

The only negatives that hamper Prometheus are the cliché's that sometimes get in the way of the brilliant and exciting storytelling. They are frustrating and totally disappointing. Don't worry, these are nitpicks that most average movie-goers won't notice, but these are the things that keep Prometheus from breaking through the atmosphere. And if you are a fan of Alien, the events at the end of the film will have you discussing theories, character interactions, and will undoubtedly leave fans begging for more.

A fantastic stand alone film, but even better as a prequel, Prometheus is excellent. It's so close to perfection that it hurts when some of the moments that hamper it occur. It's haunting and intense, suspenseful and gory, but most of all it is epic in every regard. It may only live on as a cult classic, and that is perfectly fine with me. Prometheus has landed, and its mission is a success.","9"
"rickbu-297-808100","Lost Opportunity","12 April 2013","In honor of Roger Ebert's recent passing, I'm going to quote one of his reviews, for a different movie (""Tommy Boy""), because I feel like it's just so appropriate to Prometheus: ""... is one of those movies that plays like an explosion down at the screenplay factory. You can almost picture a bewildered office boy, his face smudged with soot, wandering through the ruins and rescuing pages at random. Too bad they didn't mail them to the insurance company instead of filming them."" The plot of Prometheus is just so riddled with inconsistencies - with cause and effect nodding strangers, at best - that you can never really get involved with the movie. It's pretty to look at, but you'll never feel the primal and suffocating fear, the mounting horror that you felt when, for example, in Alien, the crew of the Nostromo was being stalked by a relentless and pitiless fate.

David's actions, in particular, are completely inexplicable. Other than the obvious ""why bother to wear a helmet when he doesn't breathe?"", why did he poison the doctor with some black liquid he found leaking from a canister? Because it's ""organic?"" And he could determine that, how, exactly?

Here we have an interstellar-capable society - and they don't have any kinds of tools to analyze what the substance was, and what it might do? ""I know"", thinks David, ""I'll slip a mickey into the doc's drink and see what happens. Serves him right for mocking me."" Why did he randomly turn on various alien gadgets, and how did he understand the symbols, not to mention language? I know, they try to imply that somehow, the Engineers taught us language or ""their"" language. But seriously, why would they teach us hundreds of languages, all of them their own? W

hy would the aliens leave a roadmap to their non-homeworld? And recall, those were planets, not stars on the map - not only would they not be visible from Earth, but they'd be constantly in motion. Even if they were stars, think 5 stars might move dramatically in thousands of years? Basically, that's like finding 5 grains of sand on the beach, and saying ""Ooh, I've seen that pattern before."" Imagine spending a trillion dollars to send an expedition on such weak ""evidence.""

And really, this advanced (Earth) civilization, which can master interstellar travel, designs a surgical machine that's only calibrated for *men*? What's the matter, not enough RAM?

Apparently, the cylinders were all packed with kind of mutagen, that created random ""things."" So, what, this ancient, super-advanced (and apparently ultra-violent) society doesn't know how to create a container that doesn't leak? Anyway, an advanced society millions of years old would certainly have the technology to create a weapon to wipe out humanity with a weapon or virus or at least something that they could avoid spilling and killing themselves. And geez, some dark dirty caves? What an awesome place to design and manufacture biological weapons.

And, what, some single guy offing himself and dumping his DNA into a waterfall in ancient times would result in dinosaurs, fruitbats, organgutans, trees, fishies, oh, and humans, too?

The behavior of the ""biologist"" ""Here, snakey, snakey"" was ridiculous - and really, the behaviors of all of the scientists - ""Ooh, look, some unknown cells are growing - let's plug some electricity into this mummified head and see what happens.""

I thought ""Alien"", with their rather blue-collar crew, spoke to the commoditization and routine of space travel - basically, they were like merchant marines. In Promentheus, these were supposedly scientists, but their illogic and rash actions were anything but ""scientific."" Like taking off your helmet in an alien environment that could be (and should be) crawling with unknown organisms - remember the leaking canisters?

Just absurdity after absurdity.

On the plus side, Michael Fassbinder delivers a great performance as David; think a less overtly violent, but equally treacherous Roy Batty, from Blade Runner, meets Peter O'Toole's ""Lawrence of Arabia"" - (not that the movie leaves you in any doubt about the latter model.) Cool, chaotic, he had the best lines in the movie (not that there were many.)

And Noomi Rapace (this movie's ""Ripley""), always commands attention when she's on the screen. There's just something about her ...

Visually, it was nice, but it can't overcome the lack of a properly edited script.

Poor Idris Elba, I think he was supposed to be modeled on Sgt Apone (from Aliens 2), but that accent was just ridiculous.

Finally - is it me, or was Weyland the spitting image of Keir Dullea's ""Old Man"" sequence in 2001?

In concept, this movie had tremendous possibilities. But the illogic of the script and cookie-cutter characters left me badly disappointed.","2"
"pp31246","The Three Stooges--er, scientists--explore a planet....","22 May 2013","Still stunned about this movie. All that money and potential, plus a couple of hours of my life, wasted, and for what? A movie that proves yet again that no matter how dumb a script is, as long as the effects are up to par it will make a mint. And we need more such proof?

Other reviews have covered most of these points, but let me revise for my own satisfaction:

1. Scientists travel for two years in stasis. When they awake they don't know each other. Eh? Wouldn't they have trained for this mission for many months? How could they not know each other?

2. They conveniently discover and land near an alien structure. Weapons are discussed, but the team leader says no, no weapons, this is a scientific expedition. Eh? No weapons going into an alien structure on an alien planet?! This is doubly stupid, since scientists would not be handling weapons anyway. On a real mission, they'd be accompanied by a detachment of armed marines. But even given the current premise, to even think about stepping outside unarmed is retarded.

3. They go in and discover an alien corpse. For no discernible reason one of them--who remember has traveled for two years in stasis to encounter alien life--suddenly freaks out and starts shouting in everyone's face. Since this guy is played by ""Mikoletto"" from The Borgias with a brush turkey haircut (a scientist?) and regional English accent, this scene proves somewhat unconvincing and not a little embarrassing. Anyway, he heads off back to the ship with a companion and, despite having a direction finder, immediately gets lost. At this point something that looks like an albino cobra pops up out of the slime, but instead of panicking as he did at the site of a 2000 year old corpse, he enthuses, totally out of character, about its beauty, and reaches toward it. Eh? This is not only ridiculous, but this character would never speak thus anyway. And this thing is not only not beautiful, it looked damn dangerous, such that you'd run off screaming if it popped up in your back garden. And this is an alien planet! Yikes!

Not much more room, but I just have to mention the oddly nonchalant attitude of everyone for everyone else's safety. The Captain for instance treated the two lost scientists' panic as a big joke. No one asked why a female character had staples across her abdomen and was covered in blood. (Is that maybe normal on space missions in the future?} No one seemed to care about anyone else's demise, and since there'd been no character development neither did we. Worst of all, no one looked or acted like a real person throughout the whole film, so that I often wondered if the whole thing wasn't supposed to be a dream sequence. Since the last time I wondered that was while watching The Silver Chalice, that can't be a good sign.

I think I'll skip the sequel, thanks. I want the two hours I've lost back, not to waste another two.","1"
"alexandruiga","Dumb Sci Fi cliché","18 June 2012","I'm a Sci Fi Fan and went to this movie with great hopes seeing the score rating from IDMB. Have to say that I'm really disappointed. The plot is confusing and hard to fallow to say the least, maybe because people do and react to situations unnatural. Don't want to spoil anything but those aliens don't deserve to be an advanced civilization if they die in such hilarious ways. I left before the movie ended as i already knew how the movie will fail(end).

To sum up the guys at Hollywood don't realize that after you do the same thing in 3 or 4 movies it becomes a cliché, it's expected. As it was for me with absolutely everything in the movie.","2"
"vitaly-tomilov","Full of blunders","1 June 2012","Below are just a few stupid mistakes that came to mind during watching...

1. Prometheus is a four-thruster exploration ship? This is nonsense. First off, four-thruster configuration is needed only on military ships, to provide utmost maneuverability. Exploration ships will be built with engine configurations optimized to reach farthest distance, using single-thruster engines.

2. For a mission of such magnitude and budget the ship would surely be weaponized, so there would be no need ramming into the alien craft to bring it down.

3. Not a word on how a spacecraft on four conventional thrusters managed to reach a remote world in just 2 years.? Really? Sorry, I didn't know there was yet another earth like planet in the solar system, because that's about as far as they would get in two years on conventional thrusters, or just about in the outer frontier of the solar system.

4. For a mission that cost billion dollars to hire a crew of idiots... Especially the guys with red irokez, who gives out this line: Not here for your damn friendship, just to make money . I mean, come-on, is this the best that a billion dollar can buy in the near future - a skank and a mule? The mission of such magnitude is expected to have the best professionals from the earth, not some trash. A real Mr. Weyland would be ashamed to surround himself with such people.

5. Prometheus appear to be using a lot of standing controls, i.e. one must stand in front of them freely, instead of being tightly strapped, like to see the captain standing at various consoles and shaking buttocks during the ship's landing looks real stupid.

6. In a mission like this to start instructing people on what it is all about only after they have reached their destination? Is that a quick top-secret military op? Really? I was under impression scientific missions are normally planned a little more thoroughly, like a few years in advance...

7. Just as Prometheus lands, nearly the entire jock bunch rushes into the alien caves. This one just beats them all. In reality they would acquire a complete scan of the place first, and then send android there alone, to evaluate the environment before any human attempt to go there, which would likely be a group of 2 or 3 people at most, never most of the crew as was shown. On top of it, they almost immediately remove their helmets, while an alien world could easily have undetectable to them contaminants, that's just outright stupid.

8. Imagine you are on an alien world, lost in a damn dark and creepy cave, full of dead aliens and scary stuff, and suddenly a creepy alien tentacle emerges from some disgusting-looking liquid. What do you do in this case? - Crap your pants and run away for 10 minutes scared to even look back? Well, that'd be my guess. But according to the genius of Mr. Ridley, you just pretend to be an American tourist - you start taking pictures, you try to give it a hug, and even tearful, you will probably try to kiss it - for real, my first alien, yo! 9. The discovered aliens appear to be the lost cause. They synthesized some genetic mutators that they failed to control themselves - how stupid of them! That was some buggy specimen they ""engineered"", however, they did make it creepy as hell, so we applaud them here...

10. Holograms manifest themselves almost spontaneously. It does look creepy, alright, but I think even in our underdeveloped age there is understanding that a hologram does take some equipment and energy to create, they don't just run through the rock by themselves.

11. DO NOT TRY AT HOME: The girl gets herself wide-open by an operation equipment, then simply gets stapled nearly all the way across stomach, and then just walks away. The droid says - that's the spirit, I like, and we applaud - Na-a-ii-ice! And to think that I was hoping for something more intelligent...","7"
"jon.h.ochiai","Lost Fire in Prometheus","11 June 2012","""Prometheus"", Director Ridley Scott's much anticipated ""Alien"" prequel that is not the prequel, is amazing for the first hour. I saw it in 3D IMAX—it is like nothing you have seen before. In the last half hour ""Prometheus"" collapses into manic action, suffering from the weaker story by Writers Jon Spaihts and Damon Lindelof. Ominously, chillingly calm Charlize Theron as Weyland Corporate Lead Meredith Vickers warns her surprise passenger, ""If you go down there, you're going to die."" Theron and Michael Fassbender as duplicitous android David are awesome. However, given the vibrant promise of its beginnings and despite some logic glitches, ""Prometheus"" dismantles as a thriller, and disappointingly fails to answer captivating questions or ask compelling new ones.

In Greek mythology, Prometheus was the god who stole fire from Zeus and gave it to Man. For that Prometheus suffered eternal punishment. I think Scott's grand ambition in ""Prometheus"" was to search for the answer to ""Where did we come from?"" In the opening scene, Scott is inspired. Eons ago a pale skinned, bald, humanoid creature with a shredded body stands atop the majestic waterfall in the presence of an alien ship. The creature drinks a mysterious potion. Spaihts and Lindelof lead us to believe this event altered human life on Earth as we know it.

In 2089, archaeological scientists Elizabeth Shaw and her lover Charlie Holloway, played by Noomi Rapace and Logan Marshall-Green, uncover a pictograph star map in the caves in the Scottish Highlands. That in context with other pictographs sourced from distinct cultures, point to human life on Earth originating from the distant constellation of our creators, whom Shaw refers to as ""Engineers"". She enthusiastically says this is an ""Invitation"" to meet our creators. Paradoxically, Shaw has faith in God as she begins this journey, to discover answers she doesn't really want to hear. Given the masterful set up, I think ""Prometheus"" fails to honor the journey or elicits the transformed questions. This is too bad, because what remains is great.

After a 2 year journey, the spaceship Prometheus arrives at its destination on an Earth-like moon in a distant solar system. Elderly and charismatic Peter Weyland CEO of Weyland industries, played by solid and unrecognizable Guy Pearce, financed the trillion dollar venture to discover our origins. Perhaps dying Weyland has another agenda as well. Weyland's surrogate son is android David, played by Fassbender. Fassbender is powerful balancing David's trained humanity and deathly curiosity. That curiosity is perhaps his tragic flaw. While the rest of the crew is in bio-stasis, David studies being human from watching Peter O'Toole in ""Lawrence of Arabia"". Fassbender nails the eeriness. Theron is lean and fit with the icy stunning veneer covering Vickers's darker soul. Theron is spectacular in another evil turn as in ""Snow White and the Huntsman"". She and Fassbender have a powerful scene revealing their past bond. What is really going on with this mission?

Noomi Rapace may be miscast in ""Prometheus"". She is spirited and faithful. Rapace radiates intelligence and innocent curiosity. She is strong, particularly in a shocking self-surgery scene. I don't think she is enrolling in the transformation to hero. That may also be the result of Spaihts and Lindelof's nebulous dramatic arc.

Scott filmed some of ""Prometheus"" in Iceland, so the moon has an existential air with the spectacular lava rock and ice. The crew discovers amazing pyramids—remnants of the ""Engineers"". Scott creates Gothic images of dark caverns populated with metal modules, and gigantic stone statues. What happened to this god-like race? What is the deadly menacing force at bay? Here is perhaps the tie to ""Alien"". Somehow all the interesting questions are forsaken as ""Prometheus"" propels into action overdrive. David says, ""Big things have small beginnings."" I think Prometheus deserves a big ending as well, instead of just a loud one.","8"
"Mashmarriner","Would be a good film if...","23 November 2021","This would of been a very good, visualy pleasing and entertaining sci-fi horror. If they hadn't forced the whole ""it's in the alien universe"" part of the movie.","7"
"ffrenes","Horrible. Awfully horrible.","17 June 2012","Um, so basically to sum it up, this movie is worse than watching Miley Cyrus act. I practically feel like slamming my head into a wall right now. Prometheus was maybe the worse movie I've ever seen in my whole life, other than Grease 2. The events that occurred were completely random and really did not go along with the plot. I mean, really, wtf does the doctor's baby have to do with the story at all? How could she be running around after a C-section? What in the heck was her boyfriend doing with his legs behind his neck after being killed? REALLY?! Going into the movie theatre knowing what the plot was, I thought it would possibly change my beliefs about the beginning of life. I now know how much I believe in God. Dear lord. Don't waste two hours of your life watching this load of crap.","1"
"robartin","Overdone, Underacted","17 June 2012","Read through some of the really tedious reviews about this being tied in to the creation of humankind, Jesus, blah blah blah. And then remember this was supposed to be a prequel to Alien. Remember, that horror movie about a space bug killing astronauts?

Somewhere along the line somebody's ego got WAY out of whack, and here we are with Prometheus, a prequel to both Alien and the Bible.

Regardless of this film's lofty aspirations, it's just not that good. The acting is bad, the writing is bad, the story really just doesn't add up, and all of the characters are either jerks or idiots or both.

In the end, it looks great, but it can't decide if it wants to be a prequel to Alien or this really deep movie about the origins of humanity. Here's a hint, if you try to do both at the same time, you fail.","4"
"morfejs","all good writers still on strike???","6 June 2012","I'll start with a disclaimer: I've always been a big fan of science fiction, loved first two (even first three) Alien installments etc. Also I believe visuals matters -movies are a form of visual art after all. So I really looked forward seeing Prometheus. Sci-Fi, thriller, Ridley Scott, big bucks, modern CGI technologies – nothing could go wrong, right? Wrong! I will not go into details (many other commentators already did that), but there are countless plot holes of every size and form! It was only about 5 minutes into the movie, when the first MAN-WHATTA-HELL-WAS-THAT? happened. OK, to cut it short – it appears to me that all good writers in Hollywood have moved to making movie COMMERCIALS instead of movies itself (the best part in attending a movie theater is commercials, have you noticed that?). What is wrong with great directors, good actors that they are accepting such shitty screenplays? Money and production deadlines are the answer, I know that. But it's so sad, isn't it I rated the movie 6 because of visuals.","6"
"Tcarts76","Beautiful Scenery, story somewhat lacking","18 September 2012","OK, I give this one an 8 out of 10. I wanted to see this movie from the first ten seconds of the trailers. As expected the scenery, sets and CGI were stunning. The Gigeresque look of the Alien/Aliens movies were in full effect and were even better than those Ridley Scott masterpieces. The story however was just OK, and a little bit lacking to me.

Maybe the Sci-Fi geek in me was just expecting too much. I like the whole ""Ancient Alien"" theories that I watch on the History Channel, And I would have liked to see more of a lead up on that to the actual voyage.

The star of the movie was definitely Michael Fassbender as the protagonist anti-hero David, the robot. He gave a wonderful performance where the others were so-so. Although I understand Charlize Theron's character, I also think she was just inserted in to pull more people into the theaters at $20 a pop because they wasted a great movie star with pretty much a cameo, phoned in appearance.

It is worth watching for the sets alone, but the movie as a whole seemed a little small minded in a genre that could have led to much better mind bending intelligent places. Hopefully Prometheus 2 will sort it out.","8"
"uaiti","A must see","5 June 2012","Prometheus is probably the WORST movie I have seen in years. It redefines the word ""bad"". After watching it, I look at Tremors 2 and Dreamcatcher with a totally different perspective, as in comparison they were not *that* bad after all! This movie remains though a ""must-see"", as it sets a good low bound in terms of how bad you can go with a movie and teaches us important lessons about what *not* to do: poor dialogs, no characters, weak plot, broken story-line, incoherences, and plagiarism. Finally, sometimes also terrible movies can be entertaining, but this is not the case for Prometheus: in fact, this movie is so predictable, full of stereotypical scenes, and full of deus ex machina that manages to ruin also the few fun moments in the plot. For completeness, let me though add that the photography of the movie is decent and the visual effects are decently made, though used excessively during most of the scenes. Without a doubt this movie deserves 1-star rating, and it is only sad to think that it was made by the same director who made very inspiring movies for generations: it is really the other side of the coin.","1"
"morbelle","A great sci-fi film!","3 June 2012","Now I will start by saying I'm a huge fan of all the Alien films, even AvP. So that was what initially drew me to this film. As the build-up progressed I learnt it wasn't a direct prequel, more of a build-up in the history of this franchise.

I still made sure I watched Alien before going to see it.

And it was a great film! It took it's time to set things up, which is quite rare, and had a plot - a reasonably simple one, but then again, space exploration is simple. Why do we send out probes and scan planets and things? To see what is out there - which is exactly what this film is about.

It has great effects, surprisingly so considering the relatively small budget, and looks very like Alien. The differences in holograms etc. can easily be explained by the Prometheus being a science vessel and top-of-the-range, and the Nostromo being a freighter.

Acting was good and believable - I imagine a little was cut for the cinema as a few characters could have done with a little more screen-time, but still good.

The engineers / Space Jockeys were good too. I've seen reviews where people slate the film about it all being too easy - how the humans saw the security footage etc. I think they are missing the point - it's a trap! The Space Jockeys wanted whoever found them to reactive them so they can leave and colonise Earth. It also occurred to me they could have colonised many planets - so whoever found them would be an advanced race, possible a threat to the Space Jockeys, so they would go there and release the Alien on them.

Remember - this is not the planet in Alien - so the octopus and proto-Alien are totally in-keeping with this. They may not even be direct descendent's of the Alien as we still don't know how the Space Jockey in the original Alien got there.

Overall a great film - it kept me focused and I enjoyed it. It has a lot of good touches and has a very good premise. There are lots of detail and back-story. It is not Alien - if you were expecting it to be, despite all the news, then you will be disappointed. If however you want to see a good sci-fi film and learn more about the Space Jockeys then you will love it. Hope there are more!","10"

"abogadosolis","Not bad but.... I expected something better","6 June 2012","I went last night to watch this movie with a lot of excitement. It was from the ALien universe with its original director.

The good?: from the beginning you notice the photography and specially the music. Overall, production is top! With planets like that, you wanna be a space cowboy and go into the adventure. Also the acting is quite good, specially the main characters. You don't get to know or care a lot for the others in other hand. The movie also rises questions: who are we? who created us? which is good to have a chat after the movie with your friends.

What I did not like?: Somehow the scrip gets rushed in the second half, with some unlikely situations and things seem to happen very fast in the last minutes, as if they ran out of time and had to end it up quickly!

Sadly maybe, it's not ALIEN, and it shows. But let's you understand quite a lot about what we already know about that movie. I'm not sure that this movie will cause the same impression in others like ALIEN caused. For me, ALIEN changed the way I felt about movies and still today is one of the best movies I have ever seen and remains as one of my favourites.

At the end you spend a fun time, enjoying the trip to another world and feeling amazed with the incredible views of the movie.

"sunburntorange","Did Not Live Up to the Hype","9 June 2012","One of the worst things in life has to be when you get really excited for a movie and then it is nowhere close to what you expected. Well, I had that experience last night as I wasted my time watching this movie.

For one, maybe I am not observant, but I had no idea it was supposed to be a prequel for the Alien movies. I have not seen the Alien movies, but with that said I also think this movie standing by itself is terrible. The one thing I did like about the movie was the technology that Ridley Scott designed there to be way in the future--and the list of things I liked about this movie end here.

So the audience discovers at the beginning of the movie that the whole TRILLION dollar expedition is happening because these doctors ""have a feeling"" that there is life on this series of planets based on cave drawings. Seriously?

Then once they find the planet, they almost immediately find this pyramid thing that they want to check out.

Next, all of the characters in this movie are completely stupid. Especially David, the robot creature guy who just makes decisions willy- nilly without considering consequences. (And he didn't follow Asimov's rules of robotics). David also inexplicably watched Dr. Walsh's dreams while she was in cryogenic sleep. None of the characters had an ounce of depth.

And the plot holes! The huge huge plot holes. I've read some other people's reviews discussing how Dr. Walsh could walk after her surgery, why the aliens were freakishly hostile and wanted to destroy mankind, why that old man faked his death, and a few other things. The one that bothered me and my boyfriend the most was about the alien DNA. It was match to human DNA patterns. However, the alien creatures look really buff, plastic, and pale. They have strange eyes and strange teeth. If our DNA was an exact match, why don't we look exactly alike?

So to sum, the story line doesn't make sense, the scientist characters are idiots, and there are mammoth plot holes. But, I'll give Ridley Scott that the movie did have great cinematography and I liked some of the technology he developed for the Prometheus team.","2"
"kipo05-385-267386","'A King Has His Reign. And Then He Dies. It is Inevitable.'","1 June 2012","Before I begin, I should point out that I have been waiting for another legitimate release in the 'Alien' franchise, as have my fellow fans for many, many years, sure I was disappointed in 2009 when it was announced that it would not be a 'direct prequel' but I still had a good feeling about how the film would turn out on the whole. Giger was back, Scott was back, the Space Jockeys were back, it was always a spectacular recipe for a potentially spectacular movie.

As I walked into my local movie theatre, I was greeted in the lobby by one of the projectionists who spied my Wayland-Utani t-shirt and proceeded to tell me 'Ahh Prometheus. I saw it this morning. It was good, not great.' my heart sank and I began to worry. But I shouldn't have been worried because fortunately 'Prometheus' is exactly what I wanted it to be, an Alien movie, it answered some of the smaller questions , pieces of back story which had always fascinated me, but it also posed tonnes of new questions as well.

The film is beautiful, it's hands down the best use of 3D I have seen to date, it doesn't get in the way, it isn't dark (when it isn't supposed to be) and it does add something to the experience. The film is very well acted on the whole, however some of the characters are lacking in depth, while the script fails slightly here, more importantly it does not make any prequel Star Wars-esque lore atrocities (assuming 'Alien Vs Predator' is non-canon) and alludes CONSTANTLY to Alien, it is subtle and you have to look carefully but it creates a wonderful sense of tension and doesn't let up for a minute, my heart was literally in my mouth as the crew of the 'Prometheus' proceeded inside the bio-mechanical 'bone-ship' and the story plays really well with the expectations of the viewer.

In terms of mood I would say that it falls somewhere between 'Alien' and 'Aliens' but falling more towards 'Alien', it has dead silence, it has stillness and moments where you doubt what you are seeing, but it also has some very intense action towards the final act.

I am certain that there will be some fans who will be disappointed by the lack of answers, however in my humble opinion they are slightly missing the point, 'Alien' basically told us nothing, where are they from, where were they going, why is the Derelict on LV-426? To me half of the fun of this story is not knowing every little detail, that being said there are still some wonderful nuggets of lore which the fan-base can add to the canon.

Pros: The film is beautifully photographed, the soundtrack is pretty average although they did manage to sneak the theme of the original film into one scene which I thought was a nice touch. It continues to tell stories within the Alien universe and gives answers to some of the smaller questions whilst leaving a degree of ambiguity towards the end. For fans of the Alien franchise this is essential viewing, I can't stress that enough, it just might not be EVERYTHING you expected.

Cons: Some of the minor characters' personalities and motivations are more or less nonexistent which is a shame because this is something which the other films in the series have done very well and it probably isn't as epic as the trailers made it out to be, although I suppose that is rather the point.","10"
"billcarr31","Ridley Scott ought to be ashamed","16 May 2017","I read the first 4 reviews and see that everything has been said already. Apart from the amazing visual effects this is a terrible movie with a quite unbelievable and in my opinion childish plot. In fact it has so may inconsistencies one can hardly call it a plot. To take a few points: The automated operating theatre does not know how to operate on women even though the owner of the ship is in fact a woman, but manages to do a caesarian on Shaw. The foetus appears to be a smooth creature with a few tentacles, however she manages to escape the pod without the

very lively foetus following her and immobilise it after just undergoing a major operation! Presumably by doing something to the machine. However a short time later the creature has not only escaped but grown into a huge octopus powerful enough to strangle the very powerful alien; a little later another creature bursts out of the body of the dead alien, and guess what? It looks exactly like the 'alien' from the movie Alien. There are so many weird creatures/infections on screen but they seem to be unrelated. Surely the very advanced 'people' who visited earth could have killed off any dangerous life forms inhabiting their 'ship'. The 'snakes' also seem capable of easily smashing the helmet bubbles of the astronauts. There is also the signal of a life form on the scanner which disappears and is called just a 'glitch', surely so far in the future the technology would be so far advanced that 'glitches' would not occur. The 'alien ship' also seems to be part cave and part high tech space vehicle, capable of taking off after 2000 years of idleness! It also looks like a doughnut with a bite taken out of it. Finally I am getting tired of film makers showing huge spacious space vehicles, with vast halls and corridors. In this case a huge private space pod with a grand piano!! maybe that was supposed to be a joke. Do they not know anything about space travel in which interior space would be at a premium?","5"
"mboyd1986","This Is A Comedy, Right?","23 July 2016","As a comedy, I'll give it 4 out of 10.

As a sci-fi film I'll give it -10.

I mean, there were times when I burst out laughing, like when the two reptile things emerged from the black goo and the stupid guy started getting closer and saying how beautiful ""she"" was right up until the moment the beautiful creature broke his arm and strangled him, bled acid all over the other stupid guy and then went down his throat.

Well, that was so funny I nearly fell of my chair.

Did the producer - good old Ridley Scott - not actually watch any of the moon shots? Did he not notice a sort of ""professionalism"" in the way actual, i.e. real, astronauts behaved, how they went about their jobs, how they talked to each other?

If so, how can he expect anyone to believe these characters in this film were believable? They weren't believable and so the whole film becomes a joke. So perhaps he meant it as a joke.

Pity really, because instead of remembering Ridley Scott as the producer of the excellent Alien films, I'll now remember him as the producer of this nonsense.

Update June 2017:

Just started watching it from the beginning - looks like I missed the first 10 minutes before. So I have a question:

The ship is full of people who were in some king of cryogenic status and were re-activated. Then the first thing they do is attend some kind of induction meeting where they learn what the trip to a galaxy far far far away is all about.

So are we supposed to believe that all these people didn't know where they were going or what the purpose of this momentous trip was all about?

Just like real astronauts, I guess - you know, no training, no knowledge of how to use their ship, just a bunch of idiot people signing up for something they know nothing about.

So very realistic.

I didn't expect from R.Scott to fall that low, to plagiarize one of his own and best ever movies, copy/pasting chaotically scenes one after another without any felt of shame for robbing his own old but good product and using it just to make a pointless,CGI pumped, popcorn flick that is both with poor plot and mostly unmemorable characters, intended just for quick sell. I'd wish to be wrong, but it seems the able filmmaker RS, is also sucked into the briefly made high budget crap-movie industry, destined for easy moneymaking. Sad.","3"
"Hey_Sweden","Problematic but not totally without merit.","14 August 2014","Ridley Scott returned to the ""Alien"" series universe 33 years after having helmed the visionary sci-fi horror classic, and the results are, rather predictably, only so-so. It hits a number of the same beats as the 1979 film, while also attempting to provide us with answers to some of the questions that it may have provoked in the viewer. Where did the derelict come from? How did it come to be a wrecked hulk? Who was the Space Jockey? And what exactly was the purpose of the cargo?

Scott seems to be more or less just going through the motions here, working from a script credited to Jon Spaihts and Damon Lindelof. ""Prometheus"" is technically well made, if obviously not nearly as fresh an experience as ""Alien"" was 35 years ago. There's almost zero tension, the characters are mostly just not that interesting, and the plentiful CGI is nowhere near as memorable as the special effects of the original film.

Two scientists, Elizabeth Shaw (Noomi Rapace) and Charlie Holloway (Logan Marshall-Green), collect evidence that they find in ancient cave drawings that would seem to indicate that mans' origins lie in the stars above. Together with an assortment of technical crew, a helpful android named David (Michael Fassbender), and icy corporate type Meredith Vickers (Charlize Theron), they travel in an exploratory vessel to a distant planet, where they make some supposedly interesting discoveries.

Scott and his crew do take full advantage of the advances in visual effects over the subsequent decades, so this is a very slick looking film. But it's largely lacking in the thick, overwhelming atmosphere of Scotts' earlier effort, and this whole idea of exploring the mystery behind elements in ""Alien"" isn't too satisfying (the prequel to John Carpenters' ""The Thing"" suffered from the same problem). Also, to put it quite frankly, it isn't scary at all. It's really not that distinguishable from a lot of other genre productions these days. The one truly memorable sequence involves some emergency surgery.

The cast (also starring Idris Elba, Guy Pearce, Sean Harris, and Rafe Spall) is certainly game; Rapace is very earnest in the lead, but the only real standout is indeed Fassbender as the android, who in the tradition of Ash in ""Alien"", may make you wonder if he can be trusted.

This kills time fairly well for a little over two hours, but it can't help but fall short compared to a superior predecessor.

"Toazterz","Beautifully meaningless","1 June 2012","This movie doesn't deserve a lot of words. Ridley Scott and Fox show their CGI mastery, but it seems that for every dramatic looking scene they gave in on storytelling. Needless to say, this movie is full of dramatic looking scenes...

The problem with Prometheus is that it tries to develop too many characters too quickly, which results in the fact that viewer can't 'bond' with any character at all. This also means that the viewer doesn't really care and hence takes away a lot of the suspense. If you can't relate to a character, you don't get involved into the story.

Prometheus looked promising, but even with all the wonderful CGI, left me disappointed and even bored at times.","1"
"Zazwaz","Disappointing","1 June 2013","I suppose I'll start with the plot, at least in so far as Prometheus has a plot. There are holes big enough to drive a tractor through. The most frequent problem is that throughout the film either things happen for no reason whatsoever or that the characters come to conclusions without any real reason to. An example of this, without spoiling it for you, is a scene where one of the main characters goes through a very grueling surgical ordeal, only to come out the other side, covered in blood, and be completely ignored by the other characters as well as the plot. Another example is a character who spends the entire film doing next to nothing to contribute, yet somehow towards the end he magically knows exactly what is going on. I can't even begin to sum up the sheer amount or holes in the plot, suffice it to say there are a lot.

As for the characters, if you can call them that; I can draw stick figures with better personalities. One of the crew is a robot, but in my opinion they might as well all have been robots for the sheer lack of emotion and growth they showed.

The acting is reasonable, given the material the actors were given they did a competent job. I sensed there was a lot of ad libbing going on, most likely desperate attempts by the actors to squeeze a few drops of personality out of their cardboard cutout characters.

So the writing is mediocre at best, what about the directing? This is where Prometheus salvages itself. Scott is a competent director, even if the script he was working with was a more horrible abomination than any of the monsters in the film. The tension is first rate, and despite all the holes he manages to still keep you wanting more. As for the visuals, if you have seen any of Scott's other films (Ailen, Blade Runner, Gladiator, etc.) you should know by now that Ridley Scott is very much a visual director. The cinematography is amazing, and the stunning visuals alone are reason enough to watch this film.

So is Prometheus worth watching? I have to say when I left the cinema the first and only thing in my mind was: What did it all mean? And that wasn't just because of the bad writing, but by the questions raised by the film overall, and a film that makes you think and try to interpret it afterwards is a good film, regardless of its flaws. Therefore, in my opinion, Prometheus is worth watching. However there is a lot of wasted potential here. Going in I thought: this is a prequel to the Alien franchise, by the creator nonetheless, he couldn't possibly go wrong. Little did I know that Scott had gone full George Lucas on it. Perhaps my expectations were too high.

Whatever the case may be, I can recommend you watch Prometheus, just don't expect too much from it.","6"
"maxtucker-387-777515","I hope Ridley Scott reads this!","3 June 2012","It's been a while since I've looked forward to a film so much, but equalled with anticipation that some things should be left alone. Unfortunately, the latter is present here in abundance. Ridley Scott seems to have taken a leaf out of the George Lucas book of how to make a film in the 21st century; in short throw a bunch of poor actors, loose plot and treasure chest of special effects together and hey presto you produce nothing short of what looks like a sci-fi series extended edition you'd expect to find on TV.

Either Ridley Scott wasn't really the brains behind Alien, or like once a boxer in his prime, he is now past his best. I won't spoil anything to those who haven't seen it, but Alien, Bladerunner fans will understand this when I say the 'mystery' of those classic films capture you and draw you into them, whereas Prometheus is so eye-blindly blatant that it doesn't make you think....you just come away wanting to jump back in time and burn that script before it made it's first pass.

The plot itself is poor, actually really poor and if Ridley wanted to do a cult film on origins he should have put a crow bar separation between this and Alien.

Just like Indiana Jones 4- this is one experience I would rather forget. Ridley, Lucas it's time to retire!","3"
"bts11","disappointing","11 July 2012","this film could of been great, but there's no real tension. no-one has there own individual death scene, except vickers and Halloway, and both of them make no sense. vickers could of just ran side ways, and davids motives are random as hell. weyland secretly going along while lying to everyone was pointless,he could of just told them. most of the crew aren't even named and are killed of by zombie fifeld. how he even got lost is stupid, the cave/ship was being mapped.

the sacrifice at the end could of easily done by one person. also, Shaw, the person who told janek and the co-pilots to blow them selves up, doesn't even bother mentioning them in the warning message.I mean, all they did was sacrifice there lives to save every person ever.","6"
"lordjord96","Brilliant film which confused itself.","1 June 2012","Well, Ridley Scott has struck as with another glorious looking film. The actors, aside from the Scottish guy with the Mohawk, were all brilliant. The CGI was stunning and the idea for creation was highly interesting.

There is one large problem that has been annoying me since I went to see it. From trailers I could tell it would have plenty of links with Alien. I liked this and believed the film would develop into a direct prequel. The reality was quite different. Image Prometheus and Alien on two ends of a spectrum. The plot line of this film zig-zagged between the two story ideas. It was an independent film which wanted to be a prequel. The ideas were trying to work with each-other simultaneously which simply didn't work. It SHOULD have spent the first half developing and wrapping up the ""engineer"" idea before ending with a direct link to Alien; not splitting between the two at the end. Either that or it should have dealt EXCLUSIVELY with the ""engineer"" idea.

So, although it is clear that Ridley was a bit TOO clingy to Alien, where the idea wasn't linked it was truly superb. The links to Alien just opened up plot-holes and pointless sub-plots which took away from the film overall.

So a visually stunning film executed brilliantly but with a very confused story line behind it. If it was completely independent to Alien it would be 9/10, but it isn't, it's 8/10.","6"
"lasttimeisaw","Prometheus","11 June 2012","As one of two most anticipated summer blockbusters of 2012 by most fervent cinema-goers, me included (the other is THE DARK KNIGHT RISE, doubtlessly), I watched it in the cinema, a plain 2D version, but in a nutshell, it is not satisfactory at all.

The film has wrought some doze-prompted moments, there are just too many routine procedures have to be dealt with (tediously) to tell a tale (with cliché-ridden dialogues and stereotyped roles) before any flare or more precisely, casualty to take action. Then quite ironically, the ill-fated first casualties are the geographer and the biologist (no career-based prejudice, I may watch too much of THE BIG BANG THEORY), whose raisons d'être are never being expounded on, just like most of the remaining crew.

What I could not expected is the mono-designed location, because one might take it for granted that with such a budget, at least, the crew of Prometheus could bring its audience to experience more polychromatic locales, but no (anyway, I cannot be too picky as the original ALIEN 1979 is also largely constricted), which cause some aesthetic fatigue since the same palette has occupying the screen for almost 120 minutes.

The meat-and-potatoes virtue of the film nevertheless lies in its astronomically staggering SFXs, though trapped in a pretty dark hue background, the outer spaceship's emergence and the laconic crash has its magic spell to conquer any Sci-Fi fanboys' cravings.

(Tiny spoilers below) The suicide attack is too reckless to feel cogent under its life-and-death circumstances and Ridley Scott has no intention to exude any mercy towards the cast, leaving no side branches makes the film desperately yearn for a new page and commence another chapter.

The cast, the never-do-wrong Fassbender captures the spotlight again in his unexpected role (I will not spill the beans here) and a Ridley-remolded heroine Noomi Rapace picks up her gauntlet to emulate Sigourney Weaver's idolized torch-blazer, which comes out to be a shade pessimistic, but the surrealistic and unsettling self-operated Cesarean section is plain too shocking to believe one's own eyes, let alone the consequent recovery, this gal is not a woman, even not a human!

Has another leading-lady-goes-supporting role in a mainstream summer production, Charlize Theron's faculty has not been fully dug (she could create and pull off more strain and mayhem if had given her role a bit more dimension, damn you screenwriters!), and so is Guy Pearce, whose presence is so unnecessary, if not just to pay extra stipends to the make-up team.

Ostensibly to seek for human race's genesis, the film eventually left too many unexplained questions for it's supposed sequel (the box office is slightly under-performed so far), so if there will be one, Mr. Ridley please assures that it is the script which should be the paramount task to labor over!","6"
"JBlueNote","To Prequel Or Not To Prequel?","8 June 2012","This movie met all of my expectations. It may have even surpassed them. Even after all these years between the movies, Ridley Scott has not disappointed me. What an amazing movie this was that I just saw, and what an amazing cast this was. The girl who played in the original ""Girl With the Dragon Tattoo"", Noomi Rapace, absolutely shined in this movie playing as one of the explorers of this foreign moon that she and many others embark on. Charlize Theron playing the commander of Prometheus seemed to act in the same kind of cruel, fierce role as I saw her act last weekend in ""Snow White and the Huntsman"". Idris Elba, who played as the captain of Prometheus, was great, too in this and seemed to act the same as he did in ""Takers"" without the British accent. The sole survivor from the movie ""Devil"" who played as another explorer did wonderful, too. And last but not least, the actor Michael Fassbender, who mostly everyone remembers acting phenomenal as Magneto in ""X-Men: First Class"" did just that as the ever-so-too- smart-for-himself android of the bunch.

The movie seemed to follow the same plot as ""Alien"" where they explore a cave and leave with something unknown that changes everything. Like the first, Ridley Scott again shows how we are so mesmerized by things we have never seen, not giving into account of what dangerous things it could be capable of. Unlike the original movie, there was obviously more to it. It actually didn't feel like a prequel until the very end of the movie that I wish not to spoil. 

The visual effects were definitely something to see, especially it you're fortunate enough to see it in IMAX 3D like I did. It was set in the year of 2093 (which if I am alive by then, I'll be 100 years old) and definitely like what we think that year might be like. Holograms were everywhere and most of the controls were touch screen, just like how the smartphones of today are. If you didn't think this movie was a prequel to Alien going into it, your mindset could have changed at the revealing of the title since it was just the same as it was in Alien where at first it looks like symbols but then forms into letters. 

I definitely recommend this movie whether you've seen the other Alien movies or not. The ending may even make you want you buy or rent those movies at a store or check them out on Netflix, and I'd recommend those, too. If I were to rate this movie, it would be given an 8.5/10. With this movie finished, the next big movie that I'm really anticipating is the last Batman movie, ""Dark Knight Rises"". There is the other Spiderman movie, but I think this movie I just saw, and Batman will be of the greatest movies I've seen this year.","8"
"schomy","Another failed prequel or why is it so hard to make a decent movie these days?","9 June 2012","I am giving the movie 2 start and I am feeling generous. If there weren't for some nice visuals it would not deserve even a single star. There is no entertainment in this movie, it's flat, dull and stupid.

I honestly can't believe the movie got to 7,8. Anyone who gave this move more than 7 stars ought to have their brains checked because the have been lobotomized. All who gave it 10 stars are probably outsourced drones from India who did not even see the movie (lucky bastards).

******CONTAINS SPOILERS********* (but believe me it can't spoil the movie, it is that bad)

1. CAST They are just empty shells; a means to an end; just not believable. The character of Dr. Elisabeth Shaw and her boyfriend Dr. Hallaway just don't match. Charlize Theron is too robotic and without agenda. And who in their own right mind would cast a 40-something actor to play a 90-year-old. Shortage of old actors in Hollywood?? Fassbender is OK. In general it is a hotchpotch of characters that are dull and uninteresting. Most are not really introduced.

2. DIRECTING Scott is or should be a legend. He failed us. One would expect a little more from a person who created the Alien universe, directed Blade Runner and Black Hawk Down.

3. MUSIC Music just does not fit, it's not there and when it is it's that title theme which really does not work for me. But the real head-scratcher is why did Ridly allow this to happened when he had collaborated with so many good composers (Vangelis, Hans Zimmer).

4. VISUALS Really good, but that is standard these days. Only the makeup on Guy Pierce stands out... but that was mission impossible anyways.

5. PLOT This is actually where the movie fails big time. I felt that I was actually watching not one but 3 or 4 movies because the plot kept changing directions in some futile effort to reach the inevitable end - to give us explanation as to what happened to the space jockey and it failed there too?!

ANDROID Android somehow knows everything there is to know about Jockeys (he can open their doors, understands their technology...) and yet his actions have no real purpose. Sometimes he is Ashley the robot and sometimes Bishop (Alien vs. Aliens). He brings on board (without anyone noticing) a fairly large urn in his backpack a potentially dangerous artifact, he make an ""in vivo"" experiment on Dr. Hallaway but than decides to help the only survivor Dr. Shaw to fly away (maybe he wanted to stay alive but then again he is a robot).

DESTRUCTION OF EARTH We are told that the alien (space jockey) ship is a threat to Earth and its launching is the reason for sacrifice of Prometeus, its captain and remaining crew. Why? What stopped the initial launch of the alien ship and what happened to all the other ""space jockeys""? It's all just poor attempt at creating tension.

SCIENTISTS A biologist freaks out when he sees a 2000-year old alien corpse but a live alien which kind of reminds of cobra does not scare him a bit. The guy in charge of mapping gets lost and has to remain inside until storm passes. Neither herd the call for evacuation?? Why did everyone else then hurry so much to get back to the ship? they could all have remained inside the alien temple, no? And where do they choose to sleep, in a goo-ridden room with a giant human-like face, of coarse.

SPACE JOCKEYS The purpose of the room with the giant head? What happened to the space jockeys who got in? Did they invent the ""aliens"" who then killed them (probably yes, but we do not know). We have the scene with them dead on a pile, but that plot line ends in a dead-end. What is the ""goo""? What about the ""glitch"" life form? Or was is there only to direct Fassbender's character to the ship? Weyland has sophisticated projection technology yet jockeys have noisy black and white images?! And their sole purpose is to give us some background information, but we are left with more questions than answers.

ALIEN This film should not be so much about the origin of mankind as much as origin of alien xenomorph. Yet we can still only speculate on how they were created and that probably the experiment went bad or something. The problem is that the path to its appearance is controversial. The substance out of which it appears first has an appearance changing effect on Dr. Hallaway's character. He is killed by but comes to back life a few hours later?! And then is like Hulk?! Dr. Shaw gets impregnated by it and the ""baby"" is growing like mushroom. It is then removed in a worst operation scene and fastest post-op ever and supposedly killed in a decontamination process. Fassbender is obviously playing the Burke here now but after the alien is removed everything is right as rain?! Thirdly the alien-cobra attacks the scientists and gets into his throat but there the plot ends and lastly the Dr. Shaw baby becomes a giant squid (how, why, and why it did not die in decontamination process is beyond me) and serves as a pre-facehugger and as a result a pre-alien emerges. And as soon as that happens the film ends.

We should ask for refund!","2"

"StevePulaski","Scott's formula proves to be among us along with some possibly-foreseen life forms","9 June 2012","It is a vast understatement to label Prometheus one of the most anticipated films of the year. This film was said to have so much and occupied a great deal hype that it was truly impossible that a film could live up to it all. It was rumored to be a prequel to Alien, and I guess now we're just labeling it ""strikingly similar."" Not seeing Alien in probably six or seven years, I can't totally state if the mythology is reminiscent to that film, but I could judge on what very few people are judging it as; its own film.

The film's plot wasn't clearly revealed in any trailers and online speculations and leaks were very slim, so it's hard to decipher where the fine line of general information and spoilers are when describing the film. The jist is that it is the year 2089, and a gang of archaeologists discover a rare star map that is apparently linked to the forerunners of the human race. The main scientist funds the creation of the scientific vessel, dubbed ""Prometheus,"" so that a group of archaeologists can travel to the moon LV-223. Guided by an android named David (Fassbender), the gang sets off on what becomes a four year journey through the galaxy until they finally land on the distant moon.

From there on out, it's exploration time, hopefully answering some much needed questions about the world we inhabit today, the life on this moon, and what lies ahead. The scientists we come to vaguely know are Elizabeth Shaw (Rapace), the man who funded the trip, Peter Weyland (Pearce), Captain Janek (Elba), Shaw's crush, Charlie (Marshall-Green), the monitor of the trip, Meredith (Theron), Milburn the botanist (Spall), and the geologist, Fifield (Harris).

All the actors do a very good job at performing throughout the picture, particularly Michael Fassbender as the android. At this point, the man can do no wrong. He has proved himself to be a man of true versatility and charisma, transcending characters from a depraved sex addict to someone non-human. It is rare that in this day and age we get an actor so committed to cinema that he is willing to take roles seemingly for more than the pay. Other crew members, like Idris Elba and Charlize Theron, too do a great job in their respected roles.

Not to mention, on an atmospheric note, the film looks remarkable. The visuals are remarkable, some sequences on the moon are very staged brilliantly, and a lot of the environment is put to great use.

After we are greeted with these favorable elements, Prometheus starts to become a relatively conventional sci-fi story. Its look is great, but nothing wholly different from what we have seen in recent years, its story is not a deeply moving or one we haven't touched on, and the characters lack depth and sympathy from an audience perspective and that is a big problem. At times, the film seems to be overly concerned with asking questions it doesn't know the answers too (which quickly becomes a burden on the audience's part), and all building up towards the inevitable, forthcoming sequel that will be among us faster than this one can gross a record number.

In the original Alien, not only was it fun to watch, but it was delightfully unexpected for its time. It was a surprise to see such technology put to great use, such developed characters functioning inside a different and organized plot, and everything felt fresh and inviting. Prometheus feels like a tune already sung before, just given to a different band.

Ridley Scott is the kind of director who you could see getting a barrage of different ideas and making them into capable and memorable epics. The problem is he has a growing talent for choosing scripts that spend too much time on the landscapes and the intricate features rather than character development, tone, and progression. I could compare Prometheus a lot with Gladiator, in the respect that both films are long, sometimes difficult to sit through, not always interesting, plagued by repetition, and are lifted by one performance in the supporting role. They aren't particularly awful films, but painfully ordinary and traditional.

It has been mentioned numerous times that the film occupies plot holes. Without thinking too hard about the story, I can think of one. We are greeted with some A-class technology here, some of the brightest, crispest, most involving use of computers I have yet to see in a film. Everything seems so lifelike, accurate, and impenetrable, that if this is rumored to take place a century before Alien or be a standard prequel, I have one question; how is the technology more accurate and everything so meticulously advanced? Starring: Noomi Rapace, Charlize Theron, Michael Fassbender, Guy Pearce, Idris Elba, Logan Marshall-Green, and Sean Harris. Directed by: Ridley Scott.","6"
"pool13","One of the dumbest and messiest movies you will ever see","22 February 2020","I know i know that seems to be an exagaration, but in honesty it is not.

This movie only exists because Mr. Weyland found the dumbest people on earth with a degree and put them in his ship. Some of these dumb decisions no normal human being would ever think of, are:

1. Opening an exosuits helmet before checking the atmosphere (of a foreign and uncharted planet) for pathogens or other harmful contents. 2. Electrocuting an alien head (to make it talk!) and then have it explode. 3. A biologist gets freaked out by a dead alien but then tries to touch an alien lifeform that makes is VERY clear it does not want to be touched 4. The geologist of the group gets high in his suit 5. One of the scientist notices he is infected by something bad (worms in his eyes), and he just thinks:""Nah, it will be fine"". 6. An alien chip is about to crash on Weylands daughter and the main protagonist. The ship rolls like a donut on its narrow side and they run straight from it for hundreds of meters, instead of 30m sideways to escape. 7. The guard nudges the black goo-zombie with his foot while it was lying there but still looking at him, giving him a clear indication it wasn't dead at all

Now i want to list some things that are shown in the movie that don't make sense at all or is just plain stupid:

1. The geologist who owns the small laser drones that map the structure they are in and has the map on its sleeve display gets lost as the others evacuate the structure because of a coming storm. 2. While two people are lost, the captain goes bonking Weylands daughter 3. The only engineer alive rips the androids head off and kills Weyland for no reason 4. Instead of ignoring them altogether and getting into his ship, the engineer follows Elizabeth and tries to kill her. 5. They see a hologram of what happened to the engineers. The engineers flee from something INTO the room with the dangerous black goo. 6. They analyse the DNA of the alien head and the analysis shows it is a 100% match for human. I know Ridley thinks we are all just stupid but everyone knows that this is impossible. DNA can only be identical between 2 different beings if they are clones or identical twins. First, there is no 100% human sample because we are all differenz and a 6ft blue alien is hardly human at all. 7. The biggie in the room: The black goo can do anything senile Ridley Scott needs in the movie. It can create zombies, it can create alien snakes, it can create 2m face huggers and can create a pre-version of the alien. No clear logic or structure behind it, just magical wonder-goo to fill the plot with random creatures 7. And the highlight: the operation! Elizabeth gets into the medical suite to remove the alien fetus she knows shes infected with. The medical suite doesn't give her any drugs or anything, the laser just zips her open, jams the big thongs in, janks out the uterus (with the alien squid in it) and leaves it dangling. Elizabeth has to rip the umbelical cord with her bare hands and then the suite just staples her up and she can run around in the ship. This is so extremly dumb i lost it at that point.

This movie has some beautiful visuals, but thats about it. The plot is nonsensical, the decisions are dumb, the characters are unlikeable, laughable and unrealistic. They are so annoying you want to switch off the movie. The alien lore gets destroyed and replaced by this messy garbage. It is a travesty.

There are other stupid things happening, but let me just say that this movie should be viewed as bad non-canon fan fiction by any REAL Alien fan who liked the mystery of the alien creature. Where did it came from, what was his past, how did it come to be? Was it a bio-weapon created by the space jockeys, was it a sample picked up from a planet where the aliens evolved..we don't know and this makes it scary and interesting.

The ""answers"" given in this movie diminish this mystery and the scariness.

One thing that many pseudo-interlectuals don't seem to understand: Mentioning a question that is worth exploring does not make a movie deep. Prometheus picks up a few interesting topics like religion and the creator / creation dynamic but does NOTHING with it. After all Elizabeth has seen and experienced in the movie, she just says, yeah i still believe in god despite the fact that she just learned that humanity was created in a petry dish by 6ft blue bodybuilders that can be killed and are by no means god-like.

This garbage is Ridley Scott at its worst. It is very hard to reconcile that this man had anything to do with the Alien-movie in the first place. The fall from grace comparing Alien to Prometheus is like a CEO of Google that now lives as a bum on the streets of New York.

I'm sorry to say this, but everyone who things this is a good movie has no idea what good characters and good character development is. No idea what a good script looks like and no idea how to tell an interesting and well thought out story. If the characters are the stupidest people on earth, how can anyone relate to them or care for their fate?

When i hear something like ""Oh Prometheus is so deep and it gives good answers"" i just shake my head and get really scared for the future. Imagine these people in scientific or leadership positions. If that happens we can really kiss our society goodbye.","2"
"wizkids-landry","Some of the worst Sci-Fi ever produced!","13 July 2012","I am a huge Science Fiction fan and have been for over 40 years. Indeed, my favorite Sci-Fi film series is the Alien series. In 1977 I read the first release of Alien in Heavy Metal and then when I saw the original movie by Scott I was immediately bowled over. Any good Sci-Fi movie MUST make sense, and MUST follow some basic rules. In the original Alien, Scott did the best job EVER doing just that.

Prometheus is JUST the opposite. Visually stunning, yes, but as a story and screenplay, this is pure and utter garbage just loaded with mistakes. Once again we have a movie where it appears the effects were created and THEN the movie was written around them.

The opening first minutes of Prometheus are visually stunning and the first scene is very eye-catching until you realize (much later) IT HAS NOTHING AT ALL TO DO WITH THE MOVIE!!! Then Scott begins a lllooonnnggg trail of over-complicating what could be a good story.

The mistakes are so silly - example - in the first scene we see a quasi human ingest some foreign substance and his body falls apart. About 45 minutes later one of the crew members ingests the same substance and becomes super-human?!?!? Huh??? Whoever was doing the continuity on this movie should be fired and never work in Hollywood again.

Another example of blunder - when the spacecraft lands on the alien planet we see FIVE domes (called pyramids) on the planet. THEN THE ENTIRE MOVIE TAKES PLACE IN ONE OF THEM, NEVER MENTIONING, SHOWING, OR EVEN DEALING WITH THE REMAINING FOUR. This is a PERFECT example of a movie being writing around an effect.

As for Alien purists like myself this movie is WORSE than the horrible Alien versus Predator Requium - and you have to be pretty bad to go that low, but thats just what this movie does.

Worst of all - the initial ""entry point"" to the entire Alien story is the derelict craft found on LV426 in the beginning of the original story. Promethues tries to ""explain"" that. My Lord I wish they had simply left that alone!!! Instead we get this convoluted, poorly written story where near the end, instead of explaining the craft, we are shown that the first movie must be some other planet because all the wreckage and garbage left behind (literally) in this movie NEVER appear in the original.

Simply put, along with Steve Spielbergs ""War of the Worlds"" remake, and ""AI"", Prometheus now rates in my book as one of the top three WORST Sci-Fi movies EVER! I would normally say 'wait until it comes out on DVD to see it' - but with garbage this bad, I say - don't even bother seeing it - you're not missing anything worth seeing and sure not worth even the couple bucks to rent it.

If you don't care about story and only want visual ""wow"", sure, see Prometheus - some visuals are fantastic - but for me, that only further denigrates just how bad this movie is. Good visuals lost in a dumpster of a movie that wants you to take it seriously, but you cant.","2"
"kumarkyle","Prometheus Movie 2012 Producer Ridley Scott Screenplay Damon Lindelof, Jon Spaihts Running Time 124 minutes","26 September 2023","""Prometheus"" (2012), under the helm of director Ridley Scott, is a visually striking and intellectually ambitious precursor to the iconic ""Alien"" franchise. From a cinematic perspective, it showcases Scott's knack for creating captivating imagery that immerses viewers in a world teeming with grandeur and enigmatic intrigue.

The film's special effects are truly awe-inspiring, breathing life into alien landscapes, cutting-edge technology, and eerie creatures with astonishing detail. The hauntingly evocative musical score by Marc Streitenfeld complements the visuals, heightening the film's sense of wonder and foreboding.

Yet, on the storytelling front, ""Prometheus"" delves into intricate inquiries about the genesis of humanity and our interactions with extraterrestrial life, though some may find the plot perplexing and the characters' motivations occasionally perplexing.

Despite these narrative challenges, ""Prometheus"" remains a cinematic spectacle, offering a thought-provoking odyssey into the enigmatic, replete with breathtaking visuals and philosophical undercurrents. It's a film that stirs conversations and leaves a lasting impact, even if it doesn't offer all-encompassing explanations.","8"
"Mr-Fusion","Pretty good scifi ruined by identity crisis.","21 January 2015","There was enough grandeur and scope that PROMETHEUS could've easily stood on its own two feet; a visually stunning idea movie with a good cast. It had enough problems with rigorously washing away any enigmatic flourish by answering its own big questions . . . but it also runs itself ragged by serving as an ALIEN prequel. It's got the same story beats, the archetypal crew members, the maybe-sinister android, the strong heroine running around while being terrorized. I could even hear it in the score. And that shot of Shaw blasting off would've made a great capper, but they had to have just one more showing a damn alien being born.

You will not care who lives or dies, you will not know what is going on and where this is leading you to. Its like a bad sat nav journey.

Save yourself the money yet again and just stay in and watch the first movie for the chills, the second for the action and if you have a brain in your head, the third for its feeling.

"jessie_norris","too high expectations?","30 May 2012","Well, Im one of those that has the opinion that the original Alien was far the best (having watched a lot of those debates were people were arguing about Alien vs Aliens). I loved the atmosphere, characters and the tense that built up throughout the movie. It was really really superb. After having watched Prometheus I became some kind of frustrated, how can something that is made so beautiful leave you with so little thrill? Yes Prometheus is incredibly beautiful, Im really amazed on that part. But sadly, that was the only thing that amazed me in a positive way. The characters in this movie are completely non-interesting, David with a few exceptions now and then. And even then David joins the rest of the crew on the train that in my world is called ""non realistic characters"". Sadly Prometheus are filled with characters that you get to know so little about that you don't care for them at all. The actions of the characters often makes very little sense. In that way I didn't find them believing. Thats one big minus for the movie in my opinion. Another thing I didn't find in the movie, was some tense scenes that could put me to the edge of my seat. I hate to admit it, but even Alien Resurrection had that. But that was also a thing Prometheus did not deliver.

I was hoping for a great science fiction movie and instead found it to be a horror movie (i.e. gratuitous violence and gore) with a very clichéd approach to ""big themes"" touted in the advertisements. **SPOILERS FROM HERE ON.** The science fiction part was something you've seen before a zillion times if you have ever watched Star Trek (i.e. aliens seeding planets with humanoids; a disembodied android head talking; dangerous parasites; etc.) People have praised the special effects, but prowling around in underground structures left by ancient peoples is nothing original, nor was the way it was depicted. The film did not deliver at all with regard to the big questions it raised (about the origins of human life, why those who created it tried to destroy it, etc.) so it was much ado about nothing. After watching it I turned to one of those cheapie made-for-sci-fi-channel-type movies about glaciers overtaking North America (or something) and got more enjoyment of that because I knew it would be dumb fun. But my high expectations for Prometheus made for disappointing viewing. I had had high hopes for it going in but it ended up being just another horror squirm-fest.","2"
"Imdbidia","Disappointing","22 August 2012","Prometheus wants to be a prequel (or at least connect) to the ""Alien"" saga, including the stories narrated in the two ""Alien vs Predator"" movies, so the story, in a way, has to fit the bill.

Prometheus also wants to move away and go beyond those movies to create a saga and mythological world in which all the stories are included and embedded, but it has its own autonomy.

Prometheus also wants to pose some philosophical, theological and ethical queries about human nature, the soul of androids, and the origin of life, very much in connection with many of the themes explored in ""Blade Runner"".

Prometheus wants to provide the viewer with a science-fiction teleological mythology infused with philosophical and metaphysical queries... it sounds pretentious. Well, it is pretentious.

I love action movies, but if you want to mix action with metaphysics, you better work hard on putting together a story that links well all the elements, create engaging characters that have an emotional background, are well connected, and have a purpose within the story. Most importantly, show respect to the viewer who is willing to believe anything if it has inner logic and makes sense.

The film is very sleek, and some of the scenes are wonderful and unforgettable, grandiose and spectacular, as well as the special effects, especially those filmed inside the departure chamber, utterly gorgeously, if that can be said. The blue, golden brown and white-ish tones of the film are perfect for the story and create the right mood, from warmth to cold, both physical and emotional. The photography, mostly shot in Iceland and Spain, is beautiful, and the landscapes chosen really look out-this-world. On the contrary, I did not find Marc Streitenfeld's original soundtrack especially inspired, and it sounds like hundred other science fiction movies soundtracks.

The male and female characters are unevenly treated by the story and the result is that the actors who play them, shine or not depending on it. Naomi Rapace is completely wasted as Elizabeth Shaw. She does her best at doing what is requested of her naive passionate and a-scientific scientist character - no acting would have saved it. The same can be said of Charlize Theron, whose talent is wasted in her role of Meredith Vickers, the intriguing ice-cold beautiful manager of the expedition; not much is demanded of her, beyond wearing styling super-tight clothes and moving like a supermodel on a catwalk.

On the contrary, Michael Fassbender is brilliant as the quirky witty android David. David is the best drawn character in the movie because it has a sense of purpose, a background, an inner logic, and a well-defined ""psyche"" and a soul that is missing from the human characters. Fassbender really brings his character to life, and gives him both mechanical and human color in movement, facial expression and performance. What a great actor he is.

Guy Pearce is good and almost unrecognizable in his role as Peter Weylan, the patron and sponsor of the expedition. The rest of the supporting actors are just OK in their respective roles. They do what is requested from their roles, which is not much at times.

Prometheus is a super-production that does not deliver what it promises. This is an action movie with amazing visuals and interesting premises that gets lost in itself. It is hedonistic at times, superficial and preposterous most of the times. The movie feels like a blockbuster made to utter wows; yet, the wows are never uttered because there was no previous thinking, the story and characters are just sketched, and the viewer is expected to disregard ridiculous events, completely unscientific behavior by scientists, and even the laws of Physics. Furthermore, Prometheus seems anchored in old philosophical queries that, despite still being valid. are presented as if the world had not changed much since the 1980s, science and technology were far less developed, and their impact on Society were less profound, and new queries were needed to be present for the film feel contemporary in that regard. There is a lack of focus in the project, and the result is a chaotic film, that is enjoyable at times, ridiculous and stupid others. Visuals and style are never enough to make of a movie a good one.

The movie ends with unanswered questions, on purpose, as a sequel has to follow. Oh dear.","6"
"851222","Great Sci-Fi Epic","31 August 2016","Greetings from Lithuania.

""Prometheus"" (2012) is a great sci-fi thriller, adventure epic. It works as a prequel to ""Alien"" as well as standalone story. Production values are first rate. Cast was great and everyone did uniformly good job with Michael Fassbender stealing every scene he is in. Many disliked this film because it plays in many genres - it is one of the rare sci-fi movies which can be safely placed under adventure, thriller and even horror sci-fi movies.

Overall, ""Prometheus"" can be uneven, but it is a great sci-fi movie which has a big scope, plays with big ideas and doesn't forget to show some chilly moments - all wrapped up in a terrific production values. Can't wait for a sequel.","10"
"JohnDeSando","It brings some fire to the summer.","8 June 2012","If you're looking for a summer treat and you thought the Avengers is all the good sci-fi available, then look no further, for Prometheus is a satisfying rouser not better than Avatar or the original Alien, but an unpretentious pulp delight.

Giants from the stars painted in Earth caves (see Erich von Daniken's Chariots of the Gods for a '70's take on the influence of terrestrial visitors) inspired the journey the Prometheus is taking to ""meet our maker."" It takes a couple of years to get there with the help of a Hal-like robot, David (Michael Fassbender).

Director Ridley Scott is the Alien helmer, whose image of severe indigestion resulting in a grotesque C-section of a xenomorph is forever enshrined in the memories of even the most temporary geek. In this version, it's probable that the late 21st century spaceship seeking out our makers is a prequel to the alien franchise, but no matter. While few lasting images occur since most of the creatures are derivative, the sets and CGi are splendid.

No wonder because H.R. Giger's designs and effects that won a 1979 Oscar are newly minted for Prometheus. Although large-headed insect-like attackers and cobra-like menaces are here again, they are wrapped around by a good, not great, story that at the very least stimulates argument about evolution, the role of science, and the origins and fate of mankind. In addition, the crew is largely scrappy, scruffy mercenaries who can provide a light moment but who generally serve as fodder for the monsters.

The crew goes easily to their eternal reward because they are so thinly drawn as to elicit no sympathy from us. However, Dr. Elizabeth Shaw (Noomi Rapace) is drawn fully as she agonizes over her love, Dr. Charlie Holloway, a hot-headed colleague contrasting the level-headed and intrepid Elizabeth. Rapace is no Sigourney Weaver, whose turn in Alien gave her a permanent place in the heroic sci-fi actress pantheon. Yet Rapace has the intelligent, survival-prepared persona who serves as our representative aboard that calamitous vessel.

Charlize Theron, playing the self-centered Meredith Vickers, who represents the company that funds the trip, is a half-villain with much more restraint than her bad-girl dark queen in Snow White and the Huntsman. That was over-the-top acting unfit for an Oscar winner. Here she's relatively calm while still playing bad.

In all, Prometheus doesn't bring a whole lot of literary fire to the summer, but it is entertaining. Just don't expect to have a coherent discussion of the big philosophical questions; however, you do get a bunch of reveals that will titillate.

Including one that promises a sequel. See you next summer.",NA
"r-balaji-610","Prometheus: Simple. Brilliant.","9 June 2012","Only 7.8/10? This film deserves a lot more.

I watched Prometheus today. Set in the last decade of this century and in the Alien universe, it is a film about a group of explorers who set out on an expedition into space on a ship called Prometheus to discover the origin of human kind. But when they reach their destination, they discover something really dangerous not only to them but to the entire human kind.

This movie is scientific fiction at its best. Dark, adventurous, horrific and highly creative, it is a signature Ridley Scott movie, highly reminiscent of Alien (naturally, as it is happening in the same universe). There aren't any absolutely unforeseen plot twists, but the magnificence of the movie and the way it is filmed will keep you rooted to the edge of your seat. The story is plain and simple, there are certain scenes where you'll know what's gonna happen but one must understand the film is not about complex plot twists. It is pure sci-fi, a captivating story brilliantly told. And also, there is a big surprise waiting for you at the end.

If you are not a hard core sci-fi fan, there is a chance you might not like this movie. If you are, you will find that this is one of the best sci-fi movies in recent times. There are some questions left unanswered, certain scenes which require more explanation, but hopefully they'll be cleared in the extended cut or a sequel. But in either case, rest assured that the film would have left some sort of impression on you when you leave the theater. It would definitely make you think.

So, overall, is it worth the money? Yes. Go watch Prometheus. The 3D is really good too, though there are not many scenes where you'll find the effectiveness of the 3D. But you'll definitely not be disappointed.","10"
"stevie-parmentier-360-779691","Good ideas poorly executed","30 September 2012","This movie is a mess. It feels like three different sci-fi stories were butchered to make a single one - but not a single great one, no. A single mess of badly cut scenes, where there's no focus except to throw a jumble of scenes at us.

It starts off rather well - we're introduced to all the crew members, the basic plot is kicked off and we discover what Prometheus set out to do. As in all traditional sci-fi movies of this kind, there follows a discovery which turns against the people involved ... and then it all becomes a giant heap of badly connected scenes - a dozen different plot elements are thrown at you, none of which are really resolved or fully explained. It's like they sat around a table and said ""what crazy stuff can we think off"" and then proceeded to throw it into the movie. The worst part, is that these different elements are barely even connected. In scene A something happens and in scene B, the characters seem to have forgotten all about it.

Example: When Elizabeth suddenly becomes pregnant (without her belly showing it AT ALL), the whole ""you should go in stasis"" scene makes no sense. Crew members assist David in trying to get her ready for stasis - why? And when she does escape, no-one seems to be following her - which makes little sense. Even worse, is when she returns and walks in on the old geezer and it's as if nothing happened! No-one asks why she's covered from head to toe in blood and why her belly is stapled. Neither does she even mention what happened and neither does David respond. It feels as if half a dozen scenes here are missing!

There's also no real focus on anything - the movie can't seem to decide who is the main protagonist. Is it Elizabeth? Is it David the android? Elizabeth is no Ripley, however, and none of the characters really stand out except for David. Neither can the movie decide on a ""goal"" until the very last few minutes and then you're left with a cliff hanger. Really, Ridley? Really? Sure, there's a lot of great ideas there, but most of them have nothing to cling on to. When a dozen different things happen at once, it's hard to care or to be on edge. The pacing really is that poorly done.

There's also too many mysteries and barely any answers. Over half the things that happen in the movie are left unexplained and at best, there's a lot of conjecture based on small hints and even those don't fully make sense. For example David experimenting on Charlie and then acting as if he forgot all about that, not paying any attention to the current state of Charlie - does that make sense? Common sense would dictate, that David would keep a close watch on Charlie to monitor what is happening. It's also not explained at all, why David can read and use the markings that are on the walls, using the controls as if they were some ancient language - not to mention how he can speak the alien's language when it's very well known that ancient languages are a complete mystery to us. In the end, you're left with very few answers and a lot of guessing and because of the many elements that make no sense, guessing seems pointless since it involves wading through the false facts and poor character behaviour.

The small saving grace of this movie, is the wink towards the Alien movies - although, in a way, I wish they had left the origin of aliens alone. Part of the strength of those movies, is the mystery and Prometheus seems to try and answer some of those questions despite it barely answering any of its own. We are given an idea how aliens came to life, but why did they create them? Was it a biological weapon? And if so, why would they send it to earth? Were there different factions where some wanted mankind to evolve while the other sees us as a threat? Whatever the answer, a lot of it makes little sense and that seems to be the underlying theme with the movie. Even when you're given ""answers"", they only reveal more flaws in the flaky plot.

The end result is a movie which isn't terrible, but just is too rough to be considered a classic.","5"

"ps316-333-942776","Could this ever have truly delivered? A brave attempt at something great.","1 June 2012","SPOILERS...

I entered the cinema last night with both tempered cynicism and a real hope that this film should live up to its (predictable) hype. I have been a great fan of Alien, its sequels and all things science fiction since being introduced to them at an early age. Prometheus had been long in the waiting from the man himself: Ridley Scott. I hoped that unlike the unfortunate later Terminator sequels this film would really build upon the Alien franchise in an original and fresh way whilst retaining some of the Alien 'DNA' (pardon the pun)which made the original two films so great. After all, one should never underestimate the importance of a quality director (which terminator 3 and 4 sorely missed). I must also say that I approached this film from the view point of a Biologist and as such any fiction film which claims to be rooted in some sort of science (as Scott claimed this would be), attempting to deal with the creationist vs darwinian hypotheses (albeit in an overblown, entertaining way) is going to get my juices flowing, as it does for many people from all backgrounds. However perhaps I was always asking too much of this film that it should ever deal with some semi-accurate 'pseudo' science and a plausible discussion of such profound questions with a modern audience, big bucks and, needless to say, a dreaded sequel, stamped into the producers' minds.

This does not mean to say that Prometheus is a bad film:

The acting from Fassbender is of significant note drawing great similarities to the androids from Alien and Bladerunner that came before him. Rapace is also capable (but no Weaver) and Charlize Theron delivers a strong performance. Other supporting actors also do the original crew of Nostromo justice, although I have to say fault lies with the script for a lack of emotional engagement and care for the majority of the casts' lives.

As many others have said, the film is visually stunning and the 3D worked well to immerse rather than to distract and as such the film is worth seeing just from a visuals point of view. Having watched the trailers I was worried that this film had turned all Star Trek on us in comparison to the 'gritty' atmosphere of the original films, yet it all stacks up considering the budget the Weyland corporation is said to have set aside for this particular mission.

I also have to say that whilst the score is very different to the original Alien films, it is fitting to the grandeur of this particular story.

Where this film really falls down is the plot. It loses it. To me it wreaks of the TV series LOST and has the disappointment to boot, hence there is little surprise that Lindelof had a big hand in creating the story. I have to say that I am very surprised Scott let this film hit the screens as it currently stands. It is as if they either wrote the story as they filmed it (LOSTesque) or just forgot to edit it. The first 45 minutes build the story very nicely and I thought we were really in for something. Needless to say it all rapidly falls apart during the second and third acts. Not only is there way too much going on, it is also at times farcical and just generally makes little sense.

The writers could have gone down one of two routes: make an avatar-esque film of wonderment and human discovery (mixed with a little bit of sinister monster action) or make a full blown horror film in space (more like Alien/Aliens). What they end up with is a mediocre compromise. Whilst there are scenes reminiscent of the original Alien film (e.g. in the medical booth), there is little/no surprise or originality and (mostly due to the fact that there is just so much happening) importance/tension attributed to any of these individual scenes. Some of these scenes are just ridiculous (SPOILERS): making an alien head wake up by basically plugging it in... then doing a genome association study in about 5 seconds only to claim the alien has identical DNA to us (if it has an identical genome then why is it 10 foot and built like a God?). Another example being the fact that Noomi seemingly has the constitution of a whale and is able to run about chasing spaceships with her stomach literally stapled together. Then there is the geologist who by some miracle turns into more of a freak than he already was, before killing a load of hopeless crew and being run over by an APC to never be spoken of again. The list goes on and on. I understand that this is science fiction, but the beauty of the original aliens is that their lifestyle and the action that followed had a sense of engineered plausibility. If you were going to go down the route of making a terrifying and macroscopic bioweapon then it might look something like an xenomorph, it's as if Scott gets this science from a comic, why couldn't the engineers design an effective weapon from the start? Why do they want to kill us anyway? The film opens far too many questions and answers far too few to remain an interesting proposition.

Of course it is very easy to pick holes in any fantasy film but I am disappointed by the amount of ammunition this story has provided. Undoubtedly many of the big questions will be answered in a sequel/s and I am sure there is far more to this story than meets the eye. I can only pray that Scott doesn't get stuck in a circular argument of Gods preceding Gods, for he is no philosopher.

Either return to sci-fi with some original material or leave it alone, someone needs to tell the old-timers to quit while they're ahead.","5"
"tcecoleshaw","Good but far from great","18 October 2012","I have high expectations for any high-budget sci-fi film when you consider the best ones are done on a shoe-string. And on paper Prometheus has real promise; Ridley Scott, Aliens (though not as we know them), a strong if not quite A-list cast, and special effects to rival the very best; whilst I can't even think of a more highly publicised film this year thanks to relentless ads on every internet page I frequent. Yet throughout the film it felt rushed, pre-dictable and uninspiring, with unimaginative forgettable scripting and boring characterisation. All in all it's a big boxed Christmas present that turns out to be nothing more than an empty CD rack. You fail to bond with the lifeless characters (ironically Fassbender was the most convincing!) and care very little for the events that befall them. When a character can have a self-initiated C section one minute and then run around the ship the next, it loses all credibility you know you don't need to bother suspending disbelief at whats in front of you any longer. And whilst you do feel the occasional sense of peril, there is no longer-lasting sense of terror, or any paranoia that the creature crawling up your leg is indeed a face hugger rather than the less intimidating family pet. The film labours unnecessarily on Elizabeth Shaws religious orientation (which was almost in the vein if Dana Sculley in the X files), when you consider that the whole premise of this film is that humans were created by alien engineers not God. Does the film really need to ask the bigger question - did God create the alien engineers? This film is full of ambiguity, which actually works in it's favour as it gives you the opportunity to fill in the story with your own ideas and form great talking points. However this is spoilt when the writers decided that an alien autopsy would reveal that human and alien DNA was identical. Come on! As if that's the big revelation we've been waiting to hear in this (or any) film? Would it have been so difficult to suggest that the alien DNA was merely similar to human DNA and imply that (and perhaps more plausibly) we originated from the same source, and leave our quest for knowledge and understanding of the mystery of our own existence in tact? On the plus side you do get a John Hurt moment in this film, but sadly not a memorable chest-exploding scene that actually made some cast and crew sick on set in the original Alien. This film is just a bit limp compared to Ridleys best work. The Peter Weyland character is irksome. First of all, he's meant to be over 100 years old but the makeup is so terrible he looks more like 200 years old which isn't very acceptable in a high budget film. And to be honest Guy Pearce did not play the character very convincingly and is probably the weakest link in the film. The film would have been far better without the Weyland character and plot - as if aliens were going to give him the gift of life in the vein of an Indiana Jones film. Noomi Rapace almost looks like a young Sigourney Weaver but the similarity ends there and isn't strong enough to be the leading character. Altogether the film needs to be longer (perhaps a cynical directors cut DVD will follow), with greater character and plot development, some hard core alien gore and some memorable scenes that will send shivers down your spine. It's a film to watch once, but that really is it.","3"

I filled out my questionnaire, gave it to the Fox representative, and walked away telling my fellow movie reviewers goodbye. I stated that I hoped I could have a better day after it started out being ruined by a morning filled with disappointment delivered by Ridley Scott. I could sum up my review of the film in one sentence: Lower your expectations.

""Prometheus"" felt tired to me. It was a conglomeration of recycled ideas and nostalgic bits and pieces spread out so ""Alien"" fanboys and girls could look over at each other and wink while watching it together. Fanatics of the franchise will be ""in on"" the subtle and not-so subtle references to the original, while others who never saw it won't be ""lost."" That being said, the only viewers who should be surprised by anything that happens in this movie are those who never experienced ""Alien.""

"seanhimdb","Astonished at the Good Reviews","15 February 2015","Even the venerable Roger Ebert (RIP) said nice things about this movie. RottenTomatoes scores it 73% and on IMDb it's a 7. All of which shakes my trust in Reviews to the core. Suckered, I paid good money for a ticket, and the 3d glasses, and I got the best seat in the house (easy, as the cinema was totally empty apart from me - word had gotten round, it seems), so I enjoyed perfect 3d vision of the lovely CGI, and the utterly dreadful movie that contained it.

All the other low-star reviews have detailed what's wrong with this movie (basically, everything but the CGI), so I needn't repeat. What they haven't addressed is why. And the overall high ratings maybe offer a reason: Ed Wood was right, after all, the audience doesn't care, won't notice, you can't insult their intelligence because they haven't got one.

I'm sorry, but still, NO. Despite the fact that I buried my head in the popcorn bucket during the opening, because of its main music theme which reminds me of Jurassic Park, I wanted so much to open up to this movie. But they lost me again from the moment the crew woke up and Prometheus coveniently found their point of location minutes upon entering the planet's atmosphere without scanning the surface in the first place.

I was particularly paying attention to David for him to give answers to the issues I had with this movie. Even though I agree that David might be the key to the story, it still doesn't hold up. So much holes in this amateuristic attempt at a movie.

It remains a shallow story which, even at a second viewing with lowered expectations, comes off as either annoying or as a brainless story that just looks good.

No more Prometheus for me. It's a shallow, element-stealing movie wanting to appear unique. (AVP rehash, anyone?)

"frkingz","Major Disappointment","17 June 2012","There are spoilers in this review.

If you are expecting another movie of the quality of Blade Runner or Alien or Kingdom of Heaven or any other Ridley Scott film I believe you will be sadly disappointed.

I think Independence Day and possibly even Armageddon made more sense than this movie. And those were some pretty awful movies from a scientific point of view. If the movie had been designed as simply mindless entertainment that would be one thing. But it was obviously made with the intent of having significance and deep meaning regarding our origins. If you are going to make a serious film you have to take the subject matter seriously.

Sadly, even an excellent director can't turn a terrible script into a good movie.

Also, 3d contributes nothing to the film. Especially since the movie is primarily set in such dark and dreary locations. See it without the 3d. Much better color and detail.

Many other reviewers have done an excellent job pointing out the almost innumerable inconsistencies and just plain stupid plot points but there is one I must mention. If you know that an alien race is planning to wipe out the entire human race do you think maybe you should maybe warn the human race!!! Instead of taking your talking head on a road trip to the alien's homeworld to whine about why they are doing it? I'm just saying.

It's OK if you want to do a dystopian future noir movie, just don't include any references to the great future noir movie you did all those years ago. Let's face it, 2012 marks your 30th anniversary for not making a decent film. Sure Gladiator was a box office hit, but a good movie? Not, really. But let's not dive into that here, Mr. Scott. I'm asking you not to do to Blade Runner what you've just done to Alien. Where did you put your talent? Or did the producers just want to cash in on the Alien brand, and made you put in all that trifle, clichéd, predictable nonsense to distort the fragile plot. A plot that worked in the original because it was, well... Original. Oh, that's right, I just remembered, you were also the producer... Just thought you ought to know, Mr. Scott. But maybe my expectations were too high. After watching the promo videos I was all revved up for Shakespearean, space opera. But alas I was disappointed. It follows the simple plot of Alien: a monster and a single twist with a backstabbing android. So that is just recycling. It is the amount of clichéd fill and two dimensional characters, and a few plot holes/logical errors, that bugs me. And though the wrapping is nice. The present itself just feels too sterile, soul less and half hearted. So again, please don't touch the Blade Runner universe, Mr. Scott.","2"

The movie has very little action, but the action scenes are highly condensed and pretty much the entire final 25% of the movie is action packed. I think that the characters in the movie act irrationally and unrealistically in certain scenes, but it's nothing too gratuitous, or else I would have deducted more stars. I know it's difficult to make the characters in a film make rational and realistic decisions (since then the film would be over a lot quicker), but honestly, often times it's not that difficult at all.

Overall it's a good movie, and a very good sci-fi movie. Looking forward to the next one from Ridley.","8"
"Floated2","Visually Stunning and Entertaining","9 October 2015","Prometheus begins on Earth when two scientists (Noomi Rapace and Logan Marshall-Green) make the connection of various hieroglyphics and cave drawings with an ancient visit to this planet by alien beings. A subsequent two-year trip into outer space lands the hibernating crew (Charlize Theron as the captain and Michael Fassbender as a devious robot) on a planet where the human race may have begun. But once the ship Prometheus lands and begins its investigation, well, things just don't seem to go right. From there, various conflicts and emergencies play out, with Scott orchestrating every one for maximum effect. As the film goes, we are treated with a variety of twists and turns. Prometheus contains well shots of scenery and the creature along the way are well designed. The film is well above average simply due to the stunning visuals and the performance of Fassbender.","8"
"kira02bit","Ambitious, but completely implodes as it progresses","14 April 2013","Is there such a thing as being too ambitious? If so, then Prometheus would certainly qualify as a case study. Lots of ink was justifiably spilled over the news of director Ridley Scott's return to the Alien universe - made even more intriguing in that he would not be making an ""Alien"" film, but making a prequel that took the storyline in a completely different direction. So far, so good.

Prometheus opens with an enigmatic scene of a strange muscular white alien conducting some bizarre ritualistic experiment on a planet we come to find out is Earth. The storyline then jumps ahead to the future where archeologists Noomi Rapace and Logan Marshall Green follow clues that seem to indicate that there are engineers of the universe and they are laying out a map for us to find them. With the help of a dying corporate billionaire (Guy Pearce buried in old age make-up), an interstellar journey is set in motion to find the answers on the secret of life.

The filmmakers deserve quite a bit of credit for the most part. For a film set in the ""Alien"" universe, they never opt for an easy predictable path. The film looks spectacular and delves into BIG, DEEP questions, much like writer Damon Lindelof's TV series Lost. Unfortunately, like that series, Lindelof and company cannot gel his ambitious notions into a cohesive and satisfying whole.

The set-up for the film is great, but as the story proceeds huge problems and holes become become too hard to ignore. The characters never really develop in any satisfactory way, which keeps the viewer often at arms length of what happens. Like Lost, Lindelof's plot twists begin to take on a rather frustrating and simplistic phony religiosity that fails to fit comfortably into a film which is suppose to thrill and terrify while making one think. Conversely, the film more often than not does not thrill or terrify, and makes one think too much in that one starts to pick apart the illogical notions and inconsistencies. Lindelof seems determined to make us believe in a higher power even when the evidence he presents to us is scattershot and contradictory.

The film could do with a healthy dose of a strong central character like Sigourney Weaver's Ripley. There are two stand-out performances. Michael Fassbender is usually a fascinating actor and his work here is no exception. Playing an android with a Lawrence of Arabia fetish and major daddy issues, he often seems the most interesting person on screen, even when the story is positively schizophrenic about his character. Similarly, an underused Charlize Theron is also strong as the icy company rep overseeing the mission, who keeps us guessing what she may really be up to. She is solid even when spouting groan-worthy dialog. By contrast, Noomi Rapace's scientist searching for God and higher meaning is downright boring, although she does get the film's most memorable and suspenseful scene forced to give herself a desperate make-shift abortion. Marshall Green, as her fellow scientist/love interest, is saddled with playing a shallow jerk, while Idris Elba is wasted as the ship's captain.

The film sports an unhealthy list of ill-conceived decisions. Fassbender's android repeatedly reminds us that he is not subject to emotion, but his actions throughout the film seem to belie that. This subplot ultimately gets forgotten or bungled. Further, Marshall Green may be a bit of a jerk, but he definitely does not deserve the nasty fate assigned him by Fassbender. If Fassbender is emotionless, why does he single out the one character that needles him for his ""experiment"", when there were many other far less essential players that would have fit the bill better. Characters insist on wearing protective suits in one scene only to blithely discard them a moment later on the flimsiest of pretext, and then insist on the importance of using them AFTER their exposure to foreign elements. Pearce's subplot of the dying man seeking immortality is one of the few truly predictable things in the film and does not make a whole lot of sense in the final moments. Why is the attack/deaths of the first characters handled in such a klutzy fashion (and why are they so stupid and unlikable)? Why do these engineers seem to suffer from such uncontrollable rage? Why would Theron leave her escape pod for no reason to simply place herself in harm's way? Am I the only one that finds the ultimate denouement of Rapace's aborted alien fetus and its tie-in with the ""Alien"" a bit silly? Finally, after all that she has witnessed, why would Rapace insist on pursuing the ""engineers"" across the cosmos to demand they answer her questions about life? She already witnessed that they feel humans beneath contempt and not worthy of even one word of response - so why is she under the rather dumb notion that a horde of them will react differently to her queries? It seems a rather badly thought out effort to leave the door open for a sequel, especially since this film answers almost none of the high-minded questions that it presents.

In final analysis, the film is ambitious to a fault, beautiful to look at, but almost criminally unsatisfying on any intellectual, emotional or thrill level. The cast is filled with competent performers, but only Fassbender and Theron make an impression. Much like the frustrating Lost, the screenplay has a lot of questions or thinks it has a lot to say, but delivers nothing in the way of answers or closure on any front. All combines to make this a royally frustrating misfire.","5"
"kyle-takacs","Excellent Movie But Might Disappoint Hardcore Fans","9 June 2012","I love the Aliens series and I thought this movie was amazing and well worth ticket price, but many people who watched it spent the whole time nitpicking and comparing it to the originals. Don't go in to the movie expecting it to be just like one of the Aliens movies, because it really is a completely different movie. The acting was great and there were some intense scenes. The movie is definitely not for the squeamish mainly because of one scene in particular. But overall Prometheus tells a great story with a ton of symbolism and the only real flaw I found was unanswered questions. Hopefully they will be answered eventually, maybe in a sequel?","8"
"oliver-brown-394-597767","Disappointing... of course. But why ludicrous?","11 June 2012","Spoilers!! But thats why you may be reading this. After watching Prometheus today the first thing i said to myself was 'ok - i'm going to check the reviews on IMDb to see if other people found that as dumb as i did'

i'd read the mainstream reviews and they said very little and on the whole seemed very forgiving. I liked the acting generally and the CGI and scope is stunning. As others have said its not bad and you don't want to leave but as it goes on you're thinking 'OK i'm going to ignore that as i've been looking forward to this and i'm not going to ruin it because i'm getting hung up about ... that... and that... and that... the warning bells begin soon enough and it becomes a veritable tsunami of nonsensical situations that are B movie through and through.

i like SF, with 3 kids this was the first chance for me to see adult cinema for 7 or 8 years. So i wanted to not ruin it for myself and i'm still trying. i've looked at other reviews and tried to come out with some decent SF explanations. i'm also an OBGYN so i guess I can comment on the Caesarean surgery scene.

Plot holes with me trying to give a decent explanation which really should not be necessary 1. The dreams sequence. Yeah OK its SF but i think if this complex, open to abuse, tech was around they wouldn't let the creepy robot be checking everyone out in stasis

2. How did they get to the installation so quick? There are many minor details like this that i'm not going to bother with as they don't really effect the story and it doesn't bother me that much - I'm a fan!

3. Why were the crew Hollywood stereotypes? Sigh, no Main Stream Movie can escape.

4. The mapper geologist ? he gets lost in the space of a distance that the heroes cover in a minute down one way tunnels. that was really poor and there is no excuse for treating the audience like fools. but i forgave it at the time

5. Touch the cobra alien? Especially after just having witnessed a heap of crumpled dead bodies - not believable but maybe IQ's have dropped in the future. Best i can do for you Ridley...

6. Why on earth would a scientist remove their helmet? Well covered in other reviews. Ridiculous.

7. What does this black slime do that the robot just grabs for himself and proceeds to murder one his crew-mates with? we see the goo at the start where i think they are trying to say that this is the way these Engineers seed a planet and dissolve their DNA into the planet at ground level... otherwise what was that opening scene about?

8. The entire head scene is amateurish B movie stuff where i think they were paying homage the original alien...

9. Why does the head explode? See B movie.

10. Then the geologist comes back as a zombie. OK i needed some shooting...

Now 11. The 'pregnancy' - ' the laws o physics captain'

If the alien is going to get to chest-burster size within 10 hours from bodily fluid stage then it would have to be implanted on a huge blood supply - one that would be fatal for removal. Just like in 'Aliens' where people were killed removing them before Ripley and the cavalry got there She is supposed to be infertile. Did she have a hysterectomy? Maybe the pregnancy is not in her womb. An ectopic pregnancy is even more deadly because it doesn't come off its blood supply without major hemorrhage so thats no explanation

12. The 'birth' surgery - i may be able to help here as i've done several thousand myself.

To make this scene sensible all the machine needed to do was say 'Yes' - prepare for emergency Cesarean surgery - a messy operation with gore aplenty. but no its blokes only.... wait though its still zip zip and the gelatinous face-hugger is removed from somewhere (but not her uterus by the lack of blood), for a blokes machine the equipment used to remove the alien is a pair of obstetric forceps... i'm happy with a quick spray and jabbing yourself with a needle for pain relief but i'd imagine there are a few women in the audience thinking 'i couldn't walk for 24 hours after my Caesar' so its taking the mickey a bit. A few staples and she is good to goand how. Just a really naive scene where alien did it all so much better.

14. There was no point to half the people there - those 2 copilots when offered a year marooned in a survival boat with Charlize Theron say 'nah - i'll just die thanks'.... Hmm OK.

15. The Vickers line... what was the point in any of it?

18. Why does the tentacle creature expand at such a rate? after the birth it obviously hooks itself up to 20 IV's and chows down all the steroids in the hospital. i give up....

If i can help in one way i think its to say that i think it was a queen birthed at the end, and i think they are trying to say these things can take their hosts DNA on board and evolve to be at least part human...

Sadly this team cannot be allowed anywhere near any Bladerunner sequel.","3"
"trescia-1","Big Laughs","23 October 2021","I just watched this thing and I'm still laughing. The problem is that it's not supposed to be a comedy. I'm pretty sure of that. All I can really say, without revealing the super-spooky spoilers, is that, if I had invested in this film, I would have been weeping by the end of it. It looks as if somebody took a reasonably good script and then ""sprayed"" bunch of gore/sex/action onto it in a really, really silly way. I actually laughed out loud, and laughed hard, several times. Not during silly scenes. During the scenes that are supposed to be horrifying or intense.

Really. This film has destroyed by opinion of Ridley Scott and maybe western civilization. Four stars for groovy images. Otherwise, it's garbage.","4"
"xebec_roy","Prometheus UnSound","11 June 2012","P.B.Shelley composed Prometheus Unbound in 1820 which depicted the confrontation between Zeus and Prometheus, the Titan, who gifted Man the use of Fire.Prometheus, is thus, represented as a messiah for mankind.

In Ridley Scott's movie, Prometheus is the name of the spaceship which has taken flight in the not so distant future in search of the origins of mankind. Could have been an interesting premise, but it all becomes a tiresome study resulting in an Unsound mind.

Unbelievable prurient adolescent displays from Scientists which makes the term 'logic' vanish from anyone's dictionary, futile attempts to engage viewers through rehashed and further rehashed stock situations and the sheer denial to LET GO of the concept of Alien, which is a distant remnant of its super-horror original franchise element and is now just another funny avatar - that's what Prometheus is all about.

Still I had to give it a '4' because of the C.G panorama and the isolated grandeur built on screen. It's a technician's solid deliverable although we have seen enough of these. Heart, the movie has none. Boredom and yawns - plenty. Aliens, Predators, Aliens vs Predators and now Engineers ( you'll know the term if you feel like watching this whimper on a big screen ), Aliens, Humans - You have seen it all, many many times. Ridley, give us something original again. At least a repeat of Maximus from Gladiator or a Hoot from Black Hawk Down. Not Another Ripley from Alien, please.","4"
"jaguiar313","Disappointing prequel to the Alien saga.","8 June 2012","Prometheus is not only Ridley Scott's long awaited return to sci-fi but, also to the same universe that his breakout classic Alien took place in. Prometheus is a prequel of sorts detailing events that may have set the story of Alien in motion and created it's iconic creatures. So why at the climax are we so unsatisfied by what we just saw? As with all Scott's films Prometheus is a gorgeously designed and filmed movie but, despite the interesting set up about the possible origins of man and the existence of other superior beings, the visuals are a just an empty candy coating as the film goes nowhere with these ideas. We get a story about Dr. Elizabeth Shaw (Noomi Repace) who discovers numerous occurrences of a hieroglyphic throughout various earth times and cultures which she interprets as an invitation from a extraterrestrial race. Enter the Weyland Corporation (The villainous ""Company"" from the Alien films) who fund an expedition but, apparently with there own agenda. And the Prometheus is off to investigate with it's cliché' corporate villain captain (Charlize Theron, who really doesn't do much but be a company bitch) and the usual suspicious android, David (Michael Fassbender who has the best role). And here lies the problem, we start out expecting to find something fascinating and Damon Lindelof and Jon Spaihts' script gives us a cliché' story of extraterrestrials whose intentions aren't as noble as first believed and slimy corporate villains who want to use what they find for there own nefarious purposes. Sorry, been there, done that. Seen it all before. The beings true purpose in their genetic tampering is never revealed nor does it make sense to leave evidence of their existence on earth when they are ultimately up to no good. Prometheus leaves the most interesting questions unanswered and instead moves the plot along by having characters do the stupidest things... seriously, genius scientists taking their helmets off in an alien environment without any clue that there might be an undetected threat?... Are you kidding me?... I'll admit there are a few tense scenes, although the film is rather laid back pace wise, and could have used a lot more suspense and energy if it wasn't going to get overly interesting with it' story. And most aggravating of all, is that the film is open ended. It doesn't even give us a satisfying conclusion. It leaves the most important questions unanswered and implies we have to wait for yet another film to find out how this story ends and how it links to the beginning of Alien, which it eventually will. A major disappointment from Ridely Scott and company.","5"
"MLDinTN","did one know scientists could...","7 April 2013","be so dumb. Well, they are in this movie, that was marketed as the prequel to Aliens, which is still one of my all time favorites. It seems some scientists see ancient drawings on cave walls and concluded the drawings were referring to the creators of humans. So with it being almost the year 3000, technology has advanced and a group is sent into deep space in search of the planet in the drawings. They reach the planet and go exploring. And this is when the scientists get dumb. First, they decide to take their space helmets off in a creepy cave. Mess with a dead alien body and steel the head and not pay attention to the moving black stuff. Plus 2 of the geniuses get lost and don't make it back. Instead one of them decides it would be a good idea to stick his hand in front of a snake like alien creature. Bad idea.

So things keep getting weirder on the planet, but the lead female, Shaw, is still OK with going back out. They find an alien still living and is anyone surprised when he isn't too happy about it.

And it's set up for the sequel and I did like the very last scene when it gives a clue to how Aliens began. What I didn't get was the very beginning when the albino guy falls down that waterfall, what was that about?

FINAL VERDICT: A descent sci-fi film. It did make sense, and had its tense moments.","6"
"welshmof","Complete and utter waste of time and money!","18 June 2012","I haven't been to the cinema in a very long time so I was naturally quite excited (being a fan of Alien, Aliens and yes even Alien 3 OK, that could have been better!) however I left there feeling that I had been raped of my ten pounds and sanity! My advice would be watch it because this is an example of how Fox have continually cheapened this once wonderful series since Alien 3.

The legacy of the Alien and Aliens is being pounded into submission by crap scripts, rubbish stories and clichéd acting! Fox wont give a damn because most people have gone to see it under the assumption that they finally got the series back on track...BOLL OCKS! You will therefore find yourself agreeing with all of the negative reviews here and those who did enjoy it are obviously deluded!...

For those who ever saw Star Crash....id recommend that as an upgrade in viewing pleasure! Wont be going back to the cinema for a while again, come to think of it never!","2"
"Remy_Azhary","Definitely a prequel...and then some!","6 June 2012","PROMETHEUS is a unique film in that it's a mishmash of all those space adventure movies that we've seen so far...and then some!

Its opening sequence felt pretty much like Stanley Kubrick's ""2001"" where it all began with man's discovery of the beginning of life and his inquisitive drive to find out the real truth. But instead of drawing a metaphoric picture of primates evolving into more sophisticated creatures as theorized by Charles Darwin we were spared from those dry images of the Kubrick's iconic film.

However, there's that unmistakable similarities from the 1968 film in which a single character was then introduced in an isolated environment of a spaceship in the distant universe.

Then as more characters are being introduced I couldn't help but feel like there was also an essence of the 1997 intergalactic horror, EVENT HORIZON, in which we certainly feel like we're totally alone in deep space and that something fatal was about to happen.

No doubt that there had been speculations and even rumors that this film is a prequel to Scott's 1978 ALIEN or that it reflected that film. Even I refused to think this was so given the fact that otherwise it defeats the purpose of Scott even considering making this film to mimic his original masterpiece. But indulge me for a little.

But the truth of the matter is it did reflect Scott's original ALIEN and there was that predictability of what's going to happen next in each scene.

And like I said earlier about this film being a mishmash of other space (or rather, alien) movies, towards the end it felt so much like the suicidal version of Will Smith's 1996 INDEPENDENCE DAY.

But here's the real kicker, the ending was somewhat a giveaway to all those speculations and rumors that we're forced to face with. Let's just say that the predictability of it (for those familiar with Scott's ALIEN) explained a lot to why most people would say that PROMETHEUS was a prequel to ALIEN.

As for the characters there was not much of development in them except that we would see striking similarities to ALIEN. Another thing was that it was strange to see how the coldness in Charlize Theron's portrayal of the evil queen in SNOW WHITE AND THE HUNTSMAN sort of rubbed off in her stiff and rigid role in this one.

Nevertheless, there was no short of suspense in PROMETHEUS and the visual effects were equally spectacular to reflect the futuristic image of space.","8"
"fjwolski","Nothing in the movie that wasn't in the trailer","21 June 2012","There's one strong side of this movie: visuals. They're very impressive, especially if someone's into sci-fi sort of thing. Otherwise, this movie is -2. It's a longer version of it's trailer. It was promising to explore some interesting ideas, be a bit more than other series Scott is famous for. Instead, we have flat characters (archeologist who spent life digging around the Earth, and gives up 3 hours on new planet), no attempts to justify anything happening on the screen, and in general ectoplasm, aliens, architects, humans and robots killing each other, then surviving some more, then killing each other again. If you like Alien, enjoy. If not that much, stay away.","3"
"mebegnat","a weak offering","22 June 2012","The special effects were generally well done, but most everything else is lacking. The acting was sub-par for the actors and actresses, each of whom have demonstrated their skills in other features to be much better than here. The story lacks consistency, the editing and continuity is poor-- some scenes add nothing to the story and appear to be merely filler perhaps to fill contractual screen-time commitments-- the overall impression I left with is a SyFy channel project with a Hollywood budget. It was simply a disappointing effort for Scott and easily the weakest installment to the Alien universe.

There were many things the which jarred my sense of plausibility; which destroyed my 'suspension of disbelief'. Without spoiling, some of these are: - characters whose personal sacrifice are a major plot element, yet their 'character development' consisted of no more than 3 scenes discussing a wager.

an astrobiologist uninterested in an alien's body.


the same astrobiologist shoving his hand in the 'face' of an alien because it's 'cute'.

"pieginodino","TERRIBLE Writing, Plodding and So Very Uninteresting","12 June 2012","The first hour of this film plays out like some bad future rendition of a dysfunctional family's vacation home movies. It's a look at a long trip that is dull, plodding and so very uninteresting. Even the last half of the film offers nothing but nonsensical events that I didn't find entertaining in the least. There's no depth to anyone and the story falls as flat as can be. They totally missed the boat in terms of exploring the origin of life or the nature of faith. They mention each but only as a vehicle for them to get to a few lame horror sequences. The visuals are as touted and are quite well done but that in no way can save a story that is this poorly crafted. What exactly was the purpose of Charlize Theron's character and if you cut her character would it change the story even one bit? I'm actually amazed that a director this accomplished would even try and shoot a script that was this bad.",NA
"Ranbud","A Real Disappointment","8 June 2012","What started off as a great movie, went downhill fast and never really got interesting. Love these movies, and the ending was the best part as it was clever to relate this to another series. Visuals were good, Loved Theron in this, but really disliked the story line. To many directions to go with to many possible story lines to fit it all in. Lots of story, short on action.

I will say that this does leave this open to several possibilities for additional movies, which may have been the main purpose of this film in the long run, but with all the hype the previews got, this was a real disappointment to watch.","6"
"MistyNoble1987","Ho Hum.....","11 December 2012","I am one of those weird people who have not seen any of the Aliens movies. I am also one of those weird people that had no idea this was a prequel to the Aliens trilogy until about 20 minutes before I watched it. I love alien movies, however, this movies was lackluster for me. Very slow beginning, the actors were kinda blah (except for Theron, who I have always loved), and you don't actually see any aliens or action until about an hour into the movie. With the big budget they had for this movie it fell short of a smash hit like its Aliens counterparts were. Many questions unanswered, just not good at all. I had interest in seeing the Aliens movies before this, however if I hadn't and I had seen this prequel to it first, I would have no interest to see the rest of the series. However, when you think of it, most prequel sequels have been less the exhilarating, with Rise of the Planet of the Apes as one of few of these types of films I can think that lived up to the original.","4"
"Aaron1375","A new start for the terror.","18 October 2012","I wanted to watch this film at the theaters, but never was able to make it. Part of what destroyed my drive to see it were the many people who had bad things to say about it. So I waited, and probably never would have seen it if not for someone I know buying it and me watching their copy. Suffice to say, it was rather good. I mean the film did not answer all of life's answers for me and explain everything, but it entertained me and that is what I was looking for. Seriously, you cannot spell out everything in a two hour movie, if the filmmakers went into super detail about why this travels this fast or why that got invented the film would be five hours long! No, this story tells a story about a team following what they decipher as a map to an alien world.

The story starts out quickly. You see a strange alien drinking stuff and dissolving, then you see a discovery by some scientist types and then wham, they are on the ship about to arrive at their location. Sure they could have shown us more on how they got here, but that would have made the film too long and too talky. They quickly discover a facility on this planet and explore it and it is a very ominous place. Things get bad in a hurry!

There are some cool deaths in this one, but I think they could have done a better job varying things up. It was awesome seeing the strange snake like monster attack the two scientists who got left in the facility when the storm struck. However, after this when the one went on the rampage I was disappointed as I was hoping for something a bit more interesting as far as the deaths of the crew. Still, some enjoyable chills in this one as we witness the creation of a new form of life.

This film is a movie format I enjoy, which is explore the mysterious planet or town or forest. I love people going into an area that could prove hostile and that is why I enjoyed this one so much. There is something interesting to me about people going into a place for the first time and trying to figure out what a place really is.

So the movie to me was good. It did not leave me completely satisfied, but for the most part I was happy with what was presented. It makes me want to watch the first Alien film again to see if I can see where they are going. I am wondering if they are going to do another prequel, though I do hope they do not do a remake of the first film. Science fiction horror is what we have here and it is a pretty darn good one.","8"
"capelaez","Outrageous","30 October 2012","I wanted to see this movie so much, just because of the title (which I thought hinted at some really interesting story) and because of some posters I had seen (Which showed really nice aesthetics).

Other than that, I was completely unprejudiced: I had no idea it was a Ridley Scott movie, I had no idea it was a prequel to Aliens.

I lamented not having been able to see it in the theater, but was happy enough to get it on BluRay. And when it started I stopped watching 7 minutes into the movie because I though I needed to see this with a whole bunch of friends. It seemed like what was going to come was going to be epic.

What a letdown! The only word for this movie is ""Aggravating""

1) The loopholes in the plot are too many to enumerate. They exist in every scene, some are just stupid and inoffensive, but many are very damaging to the story.

2) The whole point of SciFi is to build believable and marvelous fantasies based on the wonders of science. This movie is about a spatial adventure in which they let stupid scientist come along. Oh my God the were so stupid all of them! They kept screwing everything up!

3) Again, SciFi has to be somewhat believable in order to ignite your brain. In this movie you can have abdominal surgery, suit up and go fight monsters. Normally you are willing to take some bull from bad scifi, but this is too much. It's like they don't even like science :'(

4) They have a perfect setting to tap questions about science, the concept of humanity, faith, evolution, God, endeavor, loyalty, big corporations, Love, immortality, greed, ... But they never get into any of this topics. So much wasted potential. What's really frustrating is that they kindasorta bring these questions into the conversation only to answer them with a corny, clichéd line (most of them literally from other movies, as a form of inappropriate homage to them).

5) You could remove every character but two and the story wouldn't change. This movie could have lasted about twenty minutes.

The more I remember, the more I hate it. The reason for this is that is not just another bad scifi movie, it's because they had the chance for one of the best, most meaningful stories that could have been told and they decided to make a horrible piece of non-action, non-scifi, non-character film.

One and only good thing: Aesthetics. But not good enough to sit through it.","1"
"paytonprovo","A great movie with a few adaptable weak points","10 June 2012","Prometheus is a great sci-fi movie, not an action or horror movie. Going in to it I thought it would be a horror movie like alien, but it is not. I also thought it would be a prequel which in a way it was, but it was also its own movie. Like some examples of it being a prequel is at the end, they Show how the xenomorphs or ""aliens"" (as they were called in the alien movies) were created. Also the ship in the original Alien movie was rounded like the alien ships in Prometheus, and there is an alien in that ship that has its stomach exploded. That alien is the same as the engineer aliens in Prometheus. The crew is the dumbest crew I have ever seen in a movie, at one point they open the ship to a crew member who has been missing . The guy comes in and kills 3 guys and then the crew members kill him. That was a pointless action scene. Afterwards the crew doesn't even talk about it. Stuff like that happens but that still doesn't stop the movie from being great. I think the morale of the story is that the scientist did not find there answers, so we didn't get our answers. What I mean is that a lot of the story was not explained about the engineer aliens because the scientist did not find out a lot about them. All in all this is a great sci-fi movie and I recommend it to sci-fi fans and fans a of the alien movies.","3"
"briancham1994","Visually resplendent but messy","4 June 2020","This film was an interesting attempt at a prequel to the Alien series but it fell short of the mark. The themes were too heavy handed and tried too hard to sound profound. It dwelled heavily on the idea of creation but most of this was cribbed from laughable Ancient Astronauts hypotheses from the 1970s that are now seen as insensitive (""your ancestors were too stupid to make this by themselves, aliens must have helped them""). The identity of the Space Jockey was super disappointing - wow, it's a big bald white guy. What kind of alien is that? I can see those on Earth. It was better as a mystery or at least make it look elephantine like the original Alien (1979) implies. The story was super messy and so many things were unexplained or disconnected. I won't go into every example, but one of the worst offenders is when a character has a major reaction after an unexplained and unsubtitled conversation in the extinct Proto-Indo-European language. In the entire world, perhaps ten linguistics professors can understand this language, so how is the audience supposed to know what's going on? The team is incredibly stupid and unqualified to the point of disbelief, like breathing and touching everything. There is a fan edit (the ""Agent9 edit"") that restores a lot of the deleted scenes and it actually makes a lot of sense this way. This shows that the messy story is more the fault of the editor than the director or writers, and I would actually give that full version eight out of ten stars, but I am reviewing the real final theatrical release of this film here and not a hypothetical version, so I have to leave this as a side note. That said, the visual style and quality of this film were amazing. The design, cinematography and effects were all incredibly stunning. Michael Fassbender's performance is perfect and I definitely admired him more as an actor after watching this film. These make up for some of the flaws and bump up my rating a bit, but overall the film is still a mess.","6"
"capone666","The Vidiot Reviews...","10 October 2012","Prometheus

Aliens love Halloween because it is the only time of the year when their favourite candy comes to their doorstep and rings the doorbell.

And while this sci-fi movie isn't about mouthwatering minors, it is about dinner being home delivered.

In the future, an expedition team (Charlize Theron, Michael Fassbender, Idris Elba) funded by a billionaire (Guy Pearce) and lead by archaeologists (Noomi Rapace, Logan Marshall-Green) embarks on a mission to locate a planet suspected of spawning human life.

On the surface of the planet they discover ancient structures that they investigate in hopes of finding new life.

Inside, however, along with strange cylinders filled with an ebony liquid, the team only finds certain death.

A quasi-prequel to the Aliens franchise, Prometheus is visually stunning and also stomach turning. Unfortunately, its ambition storyline leaves too many loose ends.

Furthermore, educated minds already know that humanity sprung fourth from God's balls. (Yellow Light)

"ryanskywalker-87402","""Sometimes, to create one must first destroy.""","11 May 2017","Within the pure sci­-fi genre, Prometheus is arguably one of the best movies in years. Fortunately, it's an utter failure as a prequel to Alien, which allows Ridley Scott to expand the universe created by himself and to explore other aspects of science fiction. Instead of another monster movie, this is a hardcore science film that gets its inspiration from the best of them all: 2001: A Space Odyssey.

The opening sequence is incredibly captivating and immediately sets the tone of the film: dark, but not too much, and bold. Besides, it'll have you thinking about it throughout the whole movie and trying to connect it to the main narrative. In the same fashion of the monolith in 2001, that creature will leave you wondering how did that being end up there and what exactly did it (he?) do?.

After that, the main characters are introduced and the first half hour is fast-paced and what every blockbuster should be. Between beautiful imagery and exhilarating theories about the origin of mankind, there is a lot to enjoy in Prometheus. In the mean time, the giant human head seen in one of the posters finally makes its appearance and the lack of attention given to it is rather surprising, especially considering that it is one hell of a mysterious artifact. The mid events are not as interesting as the ones from the beginning, but towards the end it gets a lot better again. Besides, there is never real suspense and the main thing that keeps the viewer glued to the screen is that opening sequence and the eternal question: who put that there?.

Michael Fassbender's android David has to be one of the most underrated movie characters ever. Fassbender's performance is smooth and unique, which slowly builds up David's intellect and many of his actions are opened to personal interpretation. However, some characters are poorly written and, therefore, uninteresting, such as Charlize Theron's Vickers, who plays an unnecessary human (is it?) villain. Idris Elba's Captain Janek is a cool character, but not as cool as they thought he would be. And Noomi Rapace's Elizabeth Shaw, aka supposed Ripley, is a pleasant female lead, but not that exciting. Oh, and the guy who plays the other lead character is a horrible actor.

Many elements in the movie seem very surreal, which makes sense given the constant references to surrealist artists, and that only enhances its mystery. Obviously, not everything will be deciphered upon the first viewing and that is, or should be, the main goal of any movie of any genre. Yet, some mysteries will hopefully be unravelled in the sequel.

Ridley Scott definitely knows how to sell a movie and everything in this one looks absolutely terrific; the visuals are literally otherworldly and there are no wasted shots nor annoyingly noticeable CGI. Prometheus is a visual treat, and its experience gets even better with the amazingly effective score.

Prometheus is a very solid and satisfying sci-fi movie and it should be an inspiration to blockbusters in general. The closing sequence, when the birth finally occurs, is brutal and it reminds you of why you love movies in the first place. And the question remains.","7"
"nairtejas","This Is Both Pointless & Pointmore! What Have You Done, Ridley?","25 December 2012","Alien & Predator persuaded me to watch this and I tell I was disappointed. With indeed all the aspects - from visual effects to makeup to the plot to writing. The music stands out, though!

Prometheus tells you the story of a manned mission to some Saturn lookalike planet and tells us why it is wrong/bad to interfere with the ethics of nature. I mean this is just predictable. There was only one nerve-racking scene which involves Naomi Rapace in a capsule. That was the only fin part. Indulging almost all the genres into a sci-fi is not gonna work out anymore at a time when we have Looper & Salmon Fishing In The Yemen!

Prometheus is not an enjoyable movie as it lacks decency and doesn't answer audience's questions. Better luck next time!

"franciscoraposo72","Ridley's Big Comeback","20 June 2012","Prometheus, where do I even begin for Christ's sake? I loved it. Although it gives us the questions that we want to be given the answers, they did not answer all of them that well, so I for my perspective there will be a sequel with all of that, but that doesn't matter, what matters is that Mr. Scott got back together with space, ships and aliens and he's done a terrific job, I'm serious, you know how much I liked it? I have doubts if Alien or even Aliens is better than Prometheus. That much. Prometheus has a terrific cast, this movie is full of amazing stars, the special effects are breath taking, the soundtrack is amazing and the premise and the story is brilliant genius, so by this I mean that the next time we'll see Prometheus will not be in a sequel, Prometheus, we'll see you at next year's Oscars. Prometheus was also scary, it had Alien(s) scare-caliber and it also had some gross-out scenes, but hey, this is Alien style, right? Sow, go watch it, if you loved Alien and Aliens you watch this right now and don't you dare to download it, it's not just an insult to all the work it was necessary to make Prometheus, you just have to watch it in a theater, cause not even a Blu-ray will give you half the feeling of watching in a theater, hearing the sounds, watching the sets and don't forget the 3D experience, which is just unforgettable, it was well used and it satisfied a lot, oh, and don't forget the fact that almost everyone went to see Alien or Aliens when it was young, so going to watch Prometheus is like a journey to the past with a little bit of future involved. It's so good, that I admit that Prometheus is the 3rd best movie of all time, trust me.

Ridley Scott is genius, his directing was marvelous, he's always amazing with movies, Blade Runner, Alien and Gladiatior showed that his brilliant and Prometheus shows how further he can go directing movies. Nommi Rapace takes the lead, I loved her performance, she was kind of this movie's Ripley and she also had Weaver's acting-caliber, she was truly amazing and I'm super glad they dragged her to Hollywood, she started with a foreign language movie, The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo, than they brought her to Sherlock Holme's sequel and than she worked her way to the top, she's now in a Ridley Scott directed movie that develops in Alien's same universe. Overall, I truly loved her performance, Noomi is the best. Michael Fassbender is spectacular, he was by far the best played artificial person/robot int the whole Alien saga and including Prometheus, he was excellent and Prometheus showed me that Fass will go far too fast. Charlize Theron had an okay performance, that's all. Idris Elba was fantastic, I loved his role as the captain of the ship, he was amazing and he played a fantastic character. Logan Marshall-Green was great too, I've seen him before and know I definitely know that he's a great actor, his performance was great.

2000's 80's. Elizabeth Shaw (Rapace) and (Marshall-Green) is a married scientist couple. When they find some clues about how we were created, they get a ship with a good crew and fly to space so the experience can be done. Most of the crew after 2 years sleeping in the ship finally wakes up because of the arrival to the destination. Jerkan (Elba) is the captain of the ship, Meredith Vickers (Theron) is the arrogant person in charge of the experiment, David is the robot, nearly a person that serves many requests, and the rest of the crew is completed by the Shaw's, Fifeild, Milburn, Ford and Ravel. When the expedition begins, everything starts to go bad and what was supposed to be the search for our beginning, could lead to our end. But will they find the answers of these questions. How were we created? When do we go when we die? They'll try to get those answers, but they'll soon try not too die.

The story is genius. It has some fantastic twists and it has some brilliant happenings. The characterization is also amazing, it's like echoed some actors with Alien's character's egos and it has a few big similarities to Alien, like the slow beginning, but later they finally 'take off' and we have a hell of movie with big thrills, scares and much more. But one of the highlights of Prometheus is the premise about those amazing questions that everyone would like to get the answer but it can't, and although there's many questions unanswered that I though it were going to be answered, in my opinion, will soon be answered, I hope so, by a possible sequel of Prometheus. And now, changing subject, I say it again, Prometheus is not an Alien prequel at all, it even ocurres years before Alien's happenings, I've seen many people thinking that, but it's not, they just share kind of the same universe and some similarities.

"harry_tk_yung","Not entirely living up to the expection-built-up","9 June 2012","After the media hype and tantalizing secrecy, this alleged prequel of Alien (1979) seems to be receiving a general verdict of: certainly a good A-movie but still not quite living up to the lofty expectation that has been building all the way to its release. Can this be a case of perhaps too high an expectation?

Ridley Scott packed this movie with so much self referential and cross referential, explicit and subtle both, that there is no point pursuing the matter except for those who look at this as an opportunity to show of their eruditeness, imagined or otherwise. Among those referenced are iconic directors such as Stanley Kubrick, David Lean and David Fincher who might have been perceived by Scott to have stolen the directorship from him for ""Alien 3"". (""Aliens"", the second in the series, directed by James Cameron, is generally considered to be not really an ""Alien"" movie, but rather a war movie casting the aliens conveniently as enemies.)

With the ""Chariots of the gods"" (1970) as its ground-root backdrop, ""Prometheus"" hints at a lot of things surrounding the lofty question on the origin and ultimate fate of humanity, without any attempts to explore it. The main attraction of this movie is in its unsurpassed visuals (3D or otherwise) and jaw-dropping action sequences. A mandatory mention in any discussion of this movie must be a highlight set piece about a fully automatic medical operation – sheer brilliance. Nothing like that has ever been seen on screen and there is really no point for anybody to copy it (although undoubtedly some will) as it is so unique.

While this is not exactly an Oscar bid for anybody, the cast did a good job. Noomi Rapace, with her impressive credentials from the original Swedish version of the girl with a dragon tattoo, has proved herself a worthy successor of Sigourney Weaver. Personally, it was an interesting experience watching Charlize Theron in the two movies back-to-back - ""Prometheus"" and ""Snow White and the Huntsman"" – as two versions of equally icy beauty – a ruthless corporate executive in charge of the expedition and a fairy tale an evil queen. She is splendid in both but has been given considerably more depth in the latter. Michael Fassbender as android ""David"" (why this name, you may ask?) project more subtleties in any version of artificial intelligence you have seen before, as fully expected of an actor of his calibre. Guy Pearce as the dead-but-not-really-dead corporate giant behind the expedition is so much fun to watch. Idris Elba, the solemn guardian of ""the portal"" in ""Thor"" as you'll remember, assumes a very different persona here as the captain of the titular spaceship, and has actually been given a degree of character development rarely seen in this genre. Not as fortunate is the rest of the crew, an assortment of stereotypes or even merely moving props.",NA
"fredbred","Prometheus - the good and bad things and the biggest mystery","3 November 2012","So what's bad and good about Prometheus? The bad first - the script seems to be a huge line of holes with a little plot in between. It might not even be written with words, but rather sketched as a comic book and the dialogues and actions are the direct result of an immediate improvisation of the actors trying to get from one scene to another.

The characters behave irrationally, professionals act as pure stupid amateurs. The whole team is acting (and looks like) as a bunch of junkies when exploring a junk-yard. Luckily there are no safety procedures and protocols on the ship, so the misery wont take long.

Ridley Sotts' science consultant has just finished the first grade school. But that's just fine, because the anatomy consultant must be a pre-school, cause his knowledge is based on first 'How was I born' answer = You were in mama's belly and the doctors opened it gently and took you out. The ship was designed with the imagination of a 16 years old, as it is cool to include a snooker room, a lot of alcohol and a huge gym where the android can play basketball and ride his bike. In the end it's called a space ship for a reason - cause it has a lot of space in it! The android, however, is very limited and his input-output interfaces are the eyes, ears and mouth.

To wrap it up, from the moment you meet the crew in its full beauty, you're only waiting for the members to die. The only fun is to guess the order (I am sure you know who the first will be the moment you see him). Since they are junkies pretending to be scientist you feel like they deserve it and you shall not miss any of them. (Some should have chocked already in the cryo-sleep anyway).

Now the good things about the film. Some scenes are really nice - for example the first 30sec - but are these even related to the rest of the movie? But the best moment was when I read some of the critic reviews with spoilers, I nearly wet my pants.

The big mystery of the film - how on earth can it have 7.3? Either the audience 'chose they want to believe' or Hollywood has paid 1 Trillion to create 150,000 IMDb accounts and voted 10!

I would hesitate to recommend this film unless you can watch it for free and love special effects (and even so you will waste your time).","2"
"asgrrr","Positive features dragged down by negatives","30 March 2018","This film has much to recommend it for. Visually excellent, as is to be expected. The film nicely fleshes out some elements left obscure from the beginning of the Alien saga, and adds a new direction and dimension of urgency, the ""Creators"". It feels fresh by not merely adding complications to the end of the saga, as a sequel might, and has done in Resurrection. That said, the film has serious problems. The characters are mostly unconvincing and out of place. The crew of scientists chosen for this important and ambitious mission seem to be far from the cream of the crop, rather like a bunch of immature, irresponsible bungling idiots with behavioral problems. Other crew also show a relaxed attitude to the mission that seems out of place. The plot is somewhat ludicrous. The crew recklessly, repeatedly and consistently ignore the very obvious signs of biohazard, in a rushed approach that is driven by no apparent reason or urgency. What should be serious characters repeatedly skirt discussion of their situation, and rather wander blindly - repeatedly at that - into a threatening situation. Contrast that with the first Alien film, where a crew that should be of a considerably lower caliber carefully appraise their situation before acting. Elizabeth's feats in her medical condition seem unlikely, to say the least. Some characters have problems with motivation, especially David, although that might be resolved in a sequel. Nevertheless, a film worthy of repeated viewing - use local anesthesia for the problematic parts.","6"
"steveandollie","Stay away from those clams, lady.","22 June 2012","This afternoon, me and my best friend Steven borrowed some money from Mum's handbag and went to see that new movie that everyone is talking about ""Prometheus"", the hotly anticipated prequel to Ridley Scott's sci- fi horror masterpiece, ""E.T: The Extra Terrestrial"". There's a lot of excitement as it's is supposed to answer many of the questions surrounding the original film, giving more background to where the alien came from and why his spaceship looked exactly like the barrel from Pop- up Pirate. But does it provide answers to these burning questions? Does it bloody! The aliens don't even look anything like the scary ones in E.T! There's not even a single bicycle or toothy little boy in it. What rot.

Despite this initial disappointment, the plot isn't half bad. It's a classic tale - bunch of scientists and a robot go on a holiday to outer space and have a great time mucking around with some black slime they find in a hole. But one of them has to spoil the fun by eating too many oysters and ends up having a messy belly operation. Remember kids, if you don't want to end up with a squid in your tummy make sure your oysters are dead before you eat them (If they smell putrid and make a clacking sound when you tap them, they're safe).

As you can imagine, this film is pretty scary. I found some of the action scenes in Police Academy 6 quite startling, but let me tell you, some of the scenes in Prometheus takes soiling yourself to a whole new level. And it's easy to see why, the film features three of the most frightening things known to man: space aliens, dark caves and mysterious ooze. When the crew of the Prometheus entered that scary old dark cave I could barely keep hold of my Fanta with fright, but when I found it was both dark AND full of murderous oozey space aliens I was so spooked I ended up trying to sew my eyes shut with my shoelaces.

Now, there's been a lot of people who have been getting all upset about the problems with the plot, and I do agree with them. You could say it has more holes than some swiss cheese (joke lol!). For a film that was supposed to answer questions there were too many things left unexplained. For instance, who built that big spaceship? How come none of the characters had to go to the toilet during the film when I had to go four times in the first hour? The fact that Ridley Scott couldn't address these simple issues makes me seriously consider his skill as a director.

Anyway, it wasn't all bad. For me, the stand out performance was Michael Fassenbender's fantastic turn as David, the Machiavellian synthetic man. It made us suspicious of our own friend David who talks a bit weird, so later that night we went his house with a knife to see if he had milk instead of blood. However, he wouldn't stop screaming and crying (artificial?) tears so we let him off the hook, but not before we threw his PS3 down the stairs. That's one machine that isn't going to play naughty tricks on us. The rise of the machines is averted, for now. As for the rest of the cast, there were far too many people on that spaceship for my liking. The queue for the bathroom in the morning must've been diabolical, perhaps that's why everyone was saving their wee up until they got back to Earth. Anyway, here are my thoughts on the rest of those urine retaining space knuckleheads.

Dr Sure: Oyster Mum. She was supposed to be from England, but she sounded more like her mouth was full of antiseptic wipes. Didn't like her.

Holloway: He was wipe lady's boyfriend and I think he pretended he wanted to go to deep space so she'd kiss him but when he got there he didn't like it. He saw that the cave was scary so he pretended to be ill but they called his bluff and incinerated him.

Vickerz: My feelings of her are ambiguous. She was pushy and rude, but her tightly fitting space costume made me feel funny in my tummy.

Benny and Bones: Benny and bones don't really do much in the film. They pilot the ship in the first act and then pop up again to perform a suicide mission in the last twenty minutes. It's weird that they were so ready to sacrifice their lives despite barely participating in the mission at all up until that point. I know how they felt though, sometimes when you are working in a group if you don't speak up, after a while you find yourself volunteering for anything just to feel included.

The Wolfman & Specs: Wolfman and Specs were the most sensible crew members. When they discovered that the dark cave was full of alien corpses they decided to go back to the ship where it was safe. But unfortunately instead of going back to the ship where it was safe they wandered deeper into the cave and died in the dark in a pile of tears and cobra bites. As anyone who has got lost in Wookey Hole will tell you, hold Dad's hand and don't ever, ever let go.

Overall, Prometheus has everything a great film should have; actors, sound, colours and a long list of names at the end. Despite it's shortcomings I have to award it five stars, mainly because I have no other frame of reference. It's the only film I've ever seen at the cinema, the only other film I've seen is Police Academy 3 which Mum taped off the telly in 1992, and I've watched that so watched that so many times the tracking has gone all mental.","10"
"parkville","Must see film","10 June 2012","I absolutely loved this film.

A few things - no spoilers -

It seems that many (but not all) of the folks slamming this movie truly expected it to be a complete prequel to Alien. As has already been said in the media, there are some of the same elements but it is not, and if that's all you're expecting and looking for, this is not the film for you.

I loved Lost and I see some of the same elements in Damon Lindelof's script writing here - more than one way to interpret the story, some mystical elements, and a well constructed plot with parts that drop into place throughout the film. Sure - there are some things completely open to interpretation and that's OK with me. I don't want a 20 minute V.O. at the end of the film addressing each element.

Finally - as seems to be agreed even by the folks who seemed to loathe this film - Michael Fassbinder's performance is astonishing. A very nuanced and well thought out and acted role for him. I will definitely see the film again, in large part to watch someone really at the top of his game in a role.

I've given this film a great deal of thought since seeing it about 24 hours ago and continue to connect more dots making me appreciate it even more.

This film is well done, well acted and gorgeous to look at.

"devopamb","Blockbuster? Nope.","14 June 2012","I know what you are wondering, does the movie live up to its trailers? Promising trailers portraying a movie with lots of action, fights with an alien race maybe, awesome story, mesmerizing eye candy visuals AND it is the prequel to the Aliens series of movies! Basically giving you an idea of a movie which will blow your mind away and give you the memory of an amazing summer blockbuster. Well, sorry to disappoint.

Prometheus is not your traditional sci-fi horror because the aspect of horror in this movie is very little as compared to everything other than horror. The movie starts out slow and initially does manage to excite you for the rest of the movie with certain key scenes and beautiful vfx, however, as the movie progresses, you realize the excitement was in vain. The characters are not allowed to grow on screen to create an emotional bond between them and the audience nor between the characters themselves. Though efforts were made, it fell flat. It even seemed like it was deliberately done. It seemed rushed as if making a huge effort to cram and be done with the characters mumbo jumbo to show the magnitude of vfx in the movie. You would expect the movie to compensate with insane firepower and action sequences, sorry to disappoint again.

As far as acting is concerned, except for two characters, namely, Elizabeth Shaw played by Noomi Rapace and David, the android played by Michael Fassbander, both characters played brilliantly by the way, special mention to Fassbander, his acting was just brilliant and he does complete justice to the character. The other characters just felt like props that needed to be placed to carry the movie forward no matter how significant or insignificant their role, yes, including Charlize Theron's character Meredith Vickers, whose existence in the movie didn't make sense. Pretty soon into the movie, apart from Rapace and Fassbander, you realize all the others are losing grip over their character.

As far as the script is concerned, after a point of time, you lose track of what is going on and what is what and why. The jump from one plot to another is so quick and without any proper explanation that it becomes bugging, leaving you with more questions than answers. There have also been characters in the movie making big sacrifices when they were barely involved on screen or in the expedition or even emotionally connected with each other!

This being said, the movie does deliver in certain areas. It does make you sit on the edge of your seat at times and it does make you want to close your eyes but then these moments are very occasional and not influenced by the plot at all. The movie does give a believable explanation to the origins of Aliens, however, though this movie might be liked by a full on sci-fi fanatic simply because it is the prequel to the Aliens series, it might not strike the right chord with the audience who got influenced by the trailers and were expecting something mind blowing.

Although this movie had tremendous potential to be something amazing, it simply falls flat and fails to match the expectations set by its predecessors or by other blockbusters released this summer. Lower your expectations created by the trailer and you will find this movie to be just about entertaining and if you are a fan of the aliens series, you will be provided with a satisfying if not overwhelming answer to the origins of Aliens, no, you won't get the same thrills as its predecessors, not even close.

What is the movie about? A group of explorers find clues of the origins of mankind in a cave and take it upon themselves to spend a trillion dollars to go into space and check it out because they think all the clues are invitations for them to come over. Now, what happens when you see a ""welcome"" mat at a strangers doorstep and decide to bring your friends over and knock on his door because you thought it was an invitation?

All in all this movie was a big budget mediocrity with high expectations. If you are looking for action sequences, don't, because it barely has any, it is pretty slow, the script just about delivers and you get confused about what is going on half way through, however, the visuals are indeed beautiful. When the movie ends you cannot help but feel that it was incomplete and rushed and a bit of disappointment will set in. What IS noteworthy in this movie are the visuals and brilliant acting done by Fassbander.","5"

"wolf_rahm","Too much like aliens.","5 June 2012","""The movie disappointed me because it went in a different direction than what I had hoped for."" That's my opinion, and also a good analogy for how overused the ideas in the movie is.

At times I was frustrated by the predictability. Some movies have a solid story, and can provide surprise twists in a natural way. Other movies have less of a story, and then they have to experiment with doing the opposite of what the audience expects. Ridley Scott apparently does not feel he has to do anything to create twists in this completely mundane storyline.

You will see unprofessional crew, scientists vs soldiers, obvious expendable characters, young actor with ""oldman mask"", stereotypical alien base, stereotypical aliens, casual making the greatest discovery in human history, and so on. I believe they are ""TV-Tropes"" or whatever...

I don't understand why there must be retards on spaceships that make tons of stupid mistakes just to further an empty plot. JUST LET EVERYONE BE SMART, AND MAKE THE ALIENS SMARTER! One good thing about the movie is the main character played by Noomi Rapace. Heck, all performances are at least decent. The CGI is great, it has some very beautiful sceneries. The story isn't terrible either. My beef is mainly that a movie about aliens should feel alien, shouldn't it? And the idiot/expendable characters... FFS.","6"
"Boba_Fett1138","Good enough as a genre movie but it doesn't really adds anything new, let alone to the Alien franchise.","6 June 2012","So this movie wants to be seen as a standalone movie, rather than a prequel to Ridley Scott's own 1979 movie Alien, which takes place in the same 'universe' as this movie, so lets also take it that way. And as a standalone genre movie it is pretty good, though it's nothing new or too exciting really.

It's actually a shockingly standard movie, with a quite standard story in it, though I perhaps should also add that I have seen plenty of other science-fiction movies, that did some similar things as this movie as well. I still say shocking, since after so much secrecy surrounding this movie, I expected something deeper and more clever perhaps. I just never really got any of that out of this movie.

This movie only has hints of a great movie and great ideas in it. in that regard this movie maybe works better as a setup movie for a potential sequel(s).

The final 30 minutes of the movie are definitely its best but before that it mostly is being a slow moving one, even while it gets apparent pretty early on already what direction the story will be heading at and what will happen next. But still, the movie is such a well made- and good looking one that it never becomes boring to watch neither.

Despite not wanting to be taken as a prequel, the movie still makes a few nods to the other previous Alien movies, especially to the first movie ""Alien"". For instance with certain scenes, things that can be seen, pieces of dialog, characters and character behavior, etcetera. It's all enough to please the fans but not too much for those who aren't familiar yet with any of the other previous Alien movies. So in other words, it never gets anything too annoying or distracting from this movie, for anyone.

The casting is being a bit of a mixed bag. Some actors fit their roles very well, while other clearly don't. Charlize Theron for instance isn't being very good or convincing as a tough, cold cooperate executive. She just doesn't has the right looks for that, unless she gains 30 pounds and stops showering for a week or two, like she did for her Oscar winning performance in ""Monster"". Michael Fassbender on the other hand was much better and probably also the best and most interesting character out of the entire movie, even though he plays an android that is not supposed to have and show any emotions. It perhaps should also tell you something about the movie and its characters that he was being the best and most interesting one, out of it.

Seems that the movie wanted to have far too many characters in it. Really, 5 or 6 characters should had been the maximum. But because there are so many different ones, you don't ever really feel like you get to know any of them and some of the characters even get pushed to the background way too much, which also goes at the expense of some of the great actors in this movie. There are even persons with hardly any lines in this movie. The Asian looking guy for instance didn't had any lines, until its very end! I could be wrong though but point is that I didn't even knew what his purpose was. And that is the case with too many of the characters in this movie, that is besides for most part is missing a good, strong but above all visible main character in it.

Another thing I really didn't like about this movie was its musical score. Now, I know that Jerry Goldsmith is dead but just listen to the scores of the other Alien movies. It's all being somewhat similar in tone to Goldsmith's score and share some of the same motifs. The score for this movie, composed by Marc Streitenfeld (who?), really didn't seem to suit this movie and its atmosphere, or it at least did nothing to strengthen it. It's just being too much its own thing.

Still it really isn't a movie that you could or should hate. The only way someone could hate on this movie, is if that person was expecting a new brilliant movie like ""Alien"", or one that was being more similar to it at least. But really, you should see this movie with a more open mind and don't have you expectations up too high for it. When you are able to, you will get to see a pretty good genre movie. Really, technically and visually there is very little wrong with this movie.

It still remains a great and well made genre movie but it's just still nothing to get too excited about, in my opinion.

"Phildevans","Ridley Scott turns into Tim Burton:Beautiful film but poor script!","10 June 2012","The good news - Prometheus is a beautiful looking film. The special effects are incredible.

The bad news - major plot holes, lack of character development, a script written for the stupid, lack of suspense and excitement, totally unmemorable and boring! This film is badly written. David Lindelof has created a script for the stupid. Its full of ridiculous scenario's (laughable, really!)-characters do stupid things totally at odds with their professions. Plus, they are underdeveloped, so you simply don't care about them. The script lacks any credibility. It also lacks any kind of suspense and is completely boring! I'm a huge fan of sci-fi, but this insults my intelligence.

Approach with zero expectation and admire the way the film was shot - its beautiful, but don't expect anything else.

I rate this film 4 (for the direction and beauty), but 0 for the script.","4"
"stevegordon9","BEST PREQUEL EVER","14 May 2023","PROMETHEUS was the first of 3 connected prequels planned by Ridley Scott. It is a wondrous and philosophical film in itself as we follow David, a synthetic played by Michael Fassbender, and Weyland, his powerful and human creator, seek the potential creators of humankind, thought to be represented by the mummified space jockey's race in ALIEN. It is important to understand that there are two types of Alien fans. First there are the supporters of Ridley Scott and his originating film ALIEN devised and scripted first by Dan O'Bsnnon (who worked with John Carpenter on the student film DARK STAR, an early vehicle for his idea of an invading alien lifeform). And then there are the supporters of James Cameron's sequel ALIENS. These two groups have been at loggerheads ever since and the difference between the first two films is that Scott is asking questions about our place in the universe through a suspense film while Cameron has made an action film primarily. So when Scott returns to the Alien franchise with PROMETHEUS in 2012, there is much criticism from ALIENS fans that Scott has made a lumbering shallow movie from a multiplicity of scripts. Nothing could be further from the truth, and it must be noted that Scott does not make action films, and all films have many script changes in their making. Those action films like Marvel films are largely the shallow and boring movies. James Cameron is capable of making deeper films too - his ALIENS is still a good picture and continues to promote the Ripley character as heroic as well as the controversy surrounding profiteering by Weyland Industries over ethical behaviour but his AVATAR is one of the most boring films ever made - but Scott always has a deeper subtext going on in every film he does. However, with Scott there is a slower unfolding of the story because he wants the audience to think about the issues raised as they watch and he also wants to build the suspense like a symphony. It is not for nothing that Scott often has shower scenes in his films in a subconscious homage to Hitchcock's PSYCHO. Scott won't have an explosion every 10 minutes like Roger Corman's B movies. He wants to develop the characters and the ideas that form the subtextual meaning of his work. I point out the discrepancy in fan valuations of Scott and Cameron in order to say do not be put off by those that criticise Scott's work, because there is much that is thought-provoking in PROMETHEUS. And it is a film that is meant to set the stage for two following related prequels to ALIEN. The film itself is incredible to watch and though much has to be explained to set up the next films, it is once more a battle between Woman and Man, and Woman and Alien just like the original. But it is also much, much more than this. See it with an open mind, the way all movies should be seen.","10"
"alankerr81","looks good but ent no classic","8 July 2012","spoiler alert

its like most other films that try to tell us they are the next big thing, that we're gonna love it, in end they seem to only disappoint. like that god awful Avatar, now Prometheus A film that yes i got caught up in the hype of, but it was hard not to. it looked amazing and the discussions i had with friends on possible plots and story twist were great.

o.k about the film; it looked amazing. the acting was great, apart from the extra crew members. shaw was amazingly beautiful. it had potential. but sadly that is all, it had no substance, no clear direction and was truly just the first film of three. you know like pirates of the Caribbean 2, just purely there to set up the next films and this shouldn't of happened as Scott kept saying this is a film of its own, not part of alien. there was no real direction in this film, it could've just been the beginning then cut to the end because, people who have seen it camon the bit in between was throw away, there was no need for any of it.take the three or four main bits in it, any of which could have been made into a film on its own, could have supported this film on its own but what does Scott do? throw them away.

1. Charlie gets infected, could have built a story around that, what happens they kill him right away.

2. shaw gets pregnant, could have built the whole film around that, what happens? she cuts it out and gets on with things, u don't see it again til the end where its grown for some reason and don't get me started on the fact that oh lucky there is a machine on board that can do surgery and oh no one bothers to follow her and say hey you cant do that she just hits two people the goes for surgery then catches up with them later even though I'm sure someone on a ship that would probably have scanners or at least cameras on it would go hey she hit them and went for an op.

3. that other guy gets transformed. yeah yeah hes at the door, hey it looked good with his legs all up round his head but what happens? he just gets up kills all the extras that we don't need and haven't met then after a wee while gets killed. oh he was a wee bit harder to kill but got killed. what about making him run around killing them all one by one terrorising them?

4. OK four is a two part annoyance. part one; i agree with a lot of people that have done reviews on it that Weyland on board was rubbish and added nothing to the film, what happened you ask? he gets killed. pretty fast. so thats Charlie infected then killed right away, pointless. shaw pregnant then cuts it out right away, pointless. that dude turns into a monster, oh hey it takes them a couple more bullets but guess what? they kill him right away, pointless. now weylands on board, why? pointless thats why, filler for what is part one of a trilogy. OK part two annoyance; the jockey guys, wake one up and he's no too happy he'll just kill you, all that waiting and ends up they're just grumpy buggers, pointless. oh and just rip David's head off. yeah and by the next one she probably have put it back on or why else take his body with you? all that build up of what the new android would be like, would he be bad like ash or good like bishop, a bit of both in end. like they couldn't decide themselves. i thought he lets give it a go of making him the hero, everyones expecting him to be worse than ash. oh and Vickers? pointless

we as viewers wanted answers and we were promised them, i think thats fair to say, but all we got were pointless things that happened to fill the first part of a three part film.

now as i said at start i does have its good points, David is great, shaw too, and their wee thing at the end setting things up for a buddy movie i thought was good. i think the subtle hints from David that he is learning and may in fact have a soul were really good. i like the fact that she isn't going back to earth and is going to their planet but then that just shows that this film was just a pointless way of getting to that point, yes it makes you think what the hell is the next one gonna be like, but then i remember the disappointment of this one and think they'll just mess it up again. even though they are going to their planet in the next one they still need to go back to the one in this film as they haven't actually shown the jockey in the ship from alien yet.","4"
"Maleplatypus","Beautifully photographed nonsense","13 September 2012","Having all the Alien films ""burdening"" my back (and I still think only the first - which should also be the last as a true masterpiece and a SF par excellence - and partly Mr. Fincher's third were good, involving Dan O'Bannon as a scriptwriter in both cases), I've entered this film expecting Mr. Scott's expertise on the matter, his unique aesthetic approach and a good psychological study of humans in unusual helpless circumstances. Instead of that here we have a mess. No science whatsoever (starship rumbling in open space, hyper-advanced robot, yet C4 method of determining age and so on), no character in characters, parts almost randomly put together creating an illusion of continuity etc. It does not seem like Mr. Scott at all. More like some infantile producers with lots of money and lack of brain. And the story has such a potential. Cast is also excellent but wasted for nothing. We could get so many answers from this movie but instead we got a question - why? Five stars for camera work/photography, Mr. Scott's struggle to get something that makes sense out of this and the cast. Everything else, less than -273 degrees Celsius.","5"
"spidermonkey220","Not all its cracked up to be.","8 July 2012","When i first saw this advertised it did look a bit rubbish, yet all the reviews i read told a different story. so naturally i took myself in with an open mind.

And i wish i hadn't, i never thought i would say this about a film but there was really no point to making it at all, there was countless of scenes and characters that were made out to be important to begin with but ended up really not being, and to use Charlize Theron and not make use of the acting she has to offer is a shame, her character really did not hit the spot with me, especially since the release of snow white and the huntsman was out at the same time and that was amazing and a amazing performance.

I do enjoy these sort of films but there really was something about it that really wasn't good enough.

"phoenixyk1","Something short of genius... But not bad!","5 May 2013","I am going to warn people straight away, If you have not yet seen the Classic ALIEN - DON'T WATCH IT BEFORE PROMETHEUS or you will be Disappointed!

The film itself is well made but lacks a bit of depth. The only character I really felt anything for was Elizabeth Shaw (Noomi Rapace)who was far more delightful on screen than Charlize Theron.. Just my view.

There are many viewers complaining that the story did not ""Fit"" well... This is true, there are more questions by the end than answers. Overall, its not bad! Effects are great and there is some great acting from Noomi and Fassbender.

But - And now for the spoiler - Key Elements for a prequel are that it SHOULD fit with the original story... his film FAILS major on this point as in ALIEN, The ""Pilot is seen in his cockpit with a ""Chest Busters"" Hole in his body... Yet the film ends with the ""Engineer"" (Pilot) attacked and dying elsewhere...

MAJOR BAD PLAY THERE!

Technicalities aside, Worth a watch but far from Scot's best work... A bit of a let down for fans.

***UPDATE*** If rumour is to be believed, The reason the story does not ""Fit"" is because a sequel is already planned that will expand on the history once more - Apparently there will be 2 More films...","6"
"ellisgarvin","After 5 years of daily IMDb use, I FINALLY register to respond to some of this rubbish!","20 June 2012","I'm a huge fan of science fiction. Alien and Blade Runner are probably in my top ten favorite movies of all genres, and of all time. I had (((HUGE))) expectations for this film. It's the first film I've bothered to see in a movie in a theater in over 2 years.... What did I think of it?

EPIC.

To all the folks saying this film is utter rubbish let me start here: are you even sci-fi fans? And if so, are you also a fan of the space/alien/action sub-genre? If you are not a fan of this genre and sub-genre, then don't judge this movie based on your personal preferences. Judge it on it's own terms, based on it's actual merit. Otherwise you will be acting like a narrow-minded bigot, who attacks things simply because they are not like himself. It is a lot more honest, not to mention intelligent, for you to just admit that you don't really like space/alien/action films no matter how good they are....

And if you don't like sci-fi films with aliens and action, then you won't like Prometheus because that's what the whole movie is about! And if you don't like that, that doesn't make it a bad movie!

If you ARE a fan of space/alien/action movies, please tell me what space/alien/action movies actually do meet your lofty standards? You probably like Alien. Any others? Maybe one or two more? Out of the entire history of film making, probably two or three space/alien/action movies are good enough to satisfy a whining, post-modern, ""nothing is good enough for me"" angst. If this describes you, guess what? You're probably not really a fan of the space/alien/action sub-genre! That's okay, but stop trashing Prometheus simply because you don't enjoy the genre.

Some reviews of Prometheus by supposed fans of space/alien/action movies, are picky beyond belief! ""The sunset on the alien world didn't have enough burnt orange in it"", and so on. For real? Is this movie perfect? No, of course not. But what movie is? Trust me, I could pick apart ANY movie if I wanted to, including your personal favorites. No matter how good a movie is, there will be flaws that I can attack. But why??? Is that why we watch films?

Is Prometheus as tight and powerful as a stand-alone movie, as Alien was? Maybe not. For one thing, Prometheus is not a stand-alone movie. It's a prequel. It has a mission of explaining the origins of what happened in Alien. That makes it a very different kind of movie than Alien, which was a stand-alone movie. Add to that, as one reviewer said, Alien was a haunted house movie in space. Part of the terrifying mood of Alien comes from being trapped and completely isolated out in the far reaches of interstellar space, with a monster on board who is eating us one by one. Prometheus doesn't have that mood because Prometheus is not that kind of movie. It is much more of an action / adventure / exploration film than Alien was. In tone it is more like Cameron's Aliens, than Alien.

Does Prometheus succeed on it's own terms? ABSO-effin'-LUTELY. This movie TOOK ME to an alien world, totally immersed me in it, and then thrust me into a terrifying and fascinating adventure which didn't let up until the closing credits were rolling. I was so mesmerized that I couldn't leave my seat even when I had to pee really badly (let's just say I was glad I was wearing shorts and had an empty cup handy! ;) This movie was so exciting and mesmerizing it really could have been 30 minutes longer in my opinion... When I walked out of the theater I was totally blown away (and yes I brought the cup with me! ;) I was ready to give Ridley Scott a big wet kiss on the mouth and that says a lot since I'm a very straight man. As I walked to my car I noticed at some point that I was repeating the word, ""Epic..... Epic..... Epic...."" to myself over and over. Out loud.

I can only pray there is a sequel....

To all the smug sci-fi Luddites out there who are trashing this movie, please slink back to your Tarkovskiy films, go watch Primer again, or go dust your Philip K. Dick hardcovers or something. You can congratulate yourselves for being so darn intelligent and special that almost nothing is actually good enough for you.

Or better yet, just own it that this movie is not your cup of tea because breathtaking and awesome space/alien/action movies just don't turn you on. Whatever you do, please stop trashing this great movie or they might not make a sequel, and I will be very, very sad...","10"

This is a very visually interesting movie even 11 years later. There are a few glimmers of compelling philosophical ideas in there too but holy moly is this movie and its characters ever dumb.

This was one of the worst movies I've seen in a few years. Oh well. The plot seemed to jump around from story to story, and never quite jelled. The actors were good, but didn't seem to have good material to work with. Some of the aliens did expected things from other movies, and mistakes were in some of the things the humans did that they couldn't have possibly done in real life.

"yairsm","All the haters of this movie are just a bunch of sore disgruntled Alien fans...","20 April 2016","Truly an EXCELLENT movie. In fact, one of my favorites. I've watched it several times and managed to be entertained every one of them, even though I generally don't enjoy watching movies over again. All the haters here bringing this movie's average rating down and writing bad reviews are simply a bunch of sore disgruntled Alien fans who were expecting a proper prequel to the Alien films, despite the fact that it wasn't intended to be. This movie is its own film; it has its own story and, despite being clearly tied to the Alien series in many ways, works best as a stand alone film. The other haters complain about the fact that the movie leaves a lot of open ends and questions unanswered. Well, news flash: not all questions must be answered, and it is pretty obvious that these mysteries were left open ended for future sequels. People need to get out of the whole ""I need to know now"" mentality, expecting to get all the answers spoon-fed to them, and they'll enjoy the film much more. A big part of the movie's charm is its ambiguity; it's a mystery film. All the complainers would probably enjoy Avatar much better; the whole film is centered around exploring the CGI world with little to no plot. This film has a solid plot; its setting is in a world however that we know little about, and we are thrown into there at the beginning with the same amount of knowledge on it as the characters. In other words: what we know is what they know. The open ended mysteries of the film are what make it interesting and exciting, and I am very much looking forward to the sequel. Don't listen to all the haters and complainers; they're not judging the film itself, but rather rating it and complaining about it based on their unfulfilled (and unconfirmed) expectations of a proper prequel, and their frustration at not getting all of the answers to their questions handed to them on a golden platter. Excellent movie! 10/10","10"
"davispittman","A truly magnificent piece of work","6 July 2016","Prometheus really is a magnificent piece of film. Taking place in the same world and universe as the Alien movies, this movie serves as a prequel to the first 1979 film. It tackles issues like the suppose it origin of mankind and aliens. The crew that board the Prometheus go to this planet to try to discover the origin of mankind, they do find what they came for, but in a much darker and more twisted version than they expected. One thing I would like to say is that the special effects in this film are absolutely magnificent, I mean they are truly some of the best I've ever seen! It really did deserve that Academy Award nomination for best visual effects. And the cast does a great job at portraying their characters, this movie does have a star-studded cast including Charlize Theron, Michael Fassbender, Noomi Rapace and Idris Elba. Also the ""engineers"" in this movie (the people and they believe created them) are very cool/interesting looking, and I love the way that the filmmakers made them look, so real and very life like. And you know the actual alien, like in the 1979 film, doesn't really have a huge presence here, it's more about these ""engineers"" than anything, although don't get me wrong, aliens do make several appearances here. But you know that's one of the things that excited me most about Prometheus, this whole prequel idea about where did we come from, and you know the movie doesn't leave you with all the answers, but it does give you just enough to satisfy and to keep your interest, because we do know that these engineers that are shown in the movie created us but we don't know their motives behind wanting to terminate us. So go ahead and rent Prometheus and just have a great time, this is truly a magnificent film that just about anyone can enjoy because it's so well acted well-made and intriguing. 9/10!","9"
"jmupton2003","So near and yet so far","20 October 2012","To summarise the much anticipated Prometheus:

Fantastic visual effects Amazing attention to detail Lots of nice little nods to the 'Alien' universe Wonderful soundtrack

Pity therefore about the non-sensical storyline and lousy script then as this made absolutely no sense whatsoever. I like a challenging story that actually makes you think but the only thing that this - and lets be honest here – utter mess made me think was 'what the hell is going on?' and that was before we even got to the last third of the film where things really fell apart.

For me this was one of my most anticipated films in years, a brilliantly created build up of trailers and other publicity sold this film (as it should of course) and almost tempted me to go and see a film at the cinema for the first time in twenty years.

Oh boy am I glad I resisted that temptation as when I put the DVD in my player I was gob-smacked at how disjointed and completely muddled up the storyline was. Whilst it was lovely to spot the nods to previous 'Alien' films that were nicely incorporated throughout and I was delighted to see that the same visual look had been continued, it did little to hide the fact that from a story telling point of view, this film is a turkey.

I so wanted this to be brilliant and in all bar the story (and some of the rather wooden acting) it was. Therefore for me I have to say this was a very nicely done missed opportunity that should have been so much better.","4"
"hopszilla","Laughably bad in every way. Skip this boardroom formula flick. Spoilers","10 June 2012","I am not a movie buff nor one that typically writes movie reviews so bear with me.

This movie is typical of a disease which infected Hollywood long ago. Basically they have a checklist which they mark off while editing which they believe ensures profitability. This checklist does not include storytelling which is evident in the lack of in Prometheus.

The checklist includes having someone represented from every race for characters.

It includes Left wing agenda like having an abortion to get rid of a parasite. However, the spineless people behind the movie do not want to offend Christians as they are a large part of the movie going public so include a cross necklace and the woman saying "" I just believe it to be so"" a lot.

A lot of the plot holes like mercenary punk scientist guy and hugging the alien life form have been mentioned so I won't repeat the stupidity of the script writers.

To keep it brief none of the characters have any development and you do not care about one of them. The only interesting character, the android, they hint at being evil, never explain why and then have him act good at the end.

The space jockeys are supposed to be an advanced race of scientists but upon encountering the fruit of their labor the 8 ft tall wannabe Avatar creature acts like an ape on PCP.

Some of the effects are nice maybe we should have just paid to see effects and nothing else? Because there is little else here.

The end is so laughable with the enormous mile wide ship rolling on the ground like a car tire chasing the two women.

I don't know what to say else really. Complete garbage and Theron's only reason for being there was star power and to walk around showing her booty in skin tight jumpsuit.

In closing the acting sucked, the script is so bad I could have done better as a non-writer and the alien threat is a squid.

JUNK!!!

Edit: I do recommend this movie if you go see it as a comedy. If you go in looking for laughs and approach it as an Ed Wood type flick you can have some fun.

Key laughs:

Women gets in medical lab machine but it is only set to work on males. HAHAHAHA really?

Medical lab machine cuts her open, rips out giant squid and staples her shut. Then it squirts iodine all over her belly and rear end. She ends up running down a hallway looking like she had messed her pants. HAHAHAHHA

Women with staples in stomach smeared in iodine, after running down hall, opens door and collapses. The people inside have no reaction and do not ask one question such as ""what happened?"" She, having suffered a horrific experience, doesn't mention it and they talk about going to meet the engineer. STUPID!

Zombie douchebag scientist guy knocks on the ship door or something so the Captain opens up the ship. They end up running over the guy in a scene that looked like Toxic Avenger and shoot and set it on fire. Hows about just not opening the door?

The android at the beginning of the flick is shooting basketball and watching movies? HE IS A MACHINE! He would be shut down until needed for technical support. What the android is bored?? HAHAHHAAHAHA

The group suicide at the end with the captain and crew members laughing and holding their hands up. This has to be a joke right? Right?

Anyway. This movie is a comedy. Plain and simple and as such is a success.","3"
"hsjones2112","A dead-on flawless prequel to end all prequels of the first (and only) ""Alien""!","9 June 2012","Yes, after a second viewing, I give Prometheus a 10. I looked back and I'd given Alien a 10 after my last viewing (a couple months ago), and this is at least as good. I read a Ridley Scott interview in which he went out of his way to downplay Prometheus as a prequel. All I can guess is he didn't want people going in with too much preconcept, so he could optimally f*ck all our brains! 'Cause it *is* a prequel, in every way, and an astonishingly better one than any of us had the right to hope for.

One thing I will tell you about the plot is that there are some things that don't seem to make sense at first. Just go with it. About half your questions will be answered before the end. Trust me, he's a clever bugger that Ridley; give him the benefit of the doubt that he knows what he's doing. The only other thing I'll say is, that the other half of your questions... well, no I shall say no more. This is a masterwork suspense film. The brighter among you have already read too much. Just go! The casting isn't 100% flawless, but where it matters most it's perfection incarnate. Noomi Rapace and Michael Fassbender may well have established themselves as *the* top SF actors of the next decade or two, and both are deserving of Oscar nominations. Carlize Theron is almost as good, and wouldn't be un-deserving of a nom herself.

I don't know if it's because of Fox or if Ridley Scott just lost it, but this movie makes no sense.

The scenario is absolutely flawed, it is centered around the most basic existentialist questions without providing any answer or making any sense with them.

There's no suspense, there's no action, there's no thrill, there's nothing to think about, just scenes that are patched up one after another which make no sense overall.

Maybe a director's cut would be something good, because this thing's even worse than Robin hood.

Honestly, i'm surprised at what Ridley Scott's becoming, after doing masterpieces like Alien, Blade runner, Black Hawk Down, Gladiator, Kingdom of Heaven... I mean, even Robin hood is a masterpiece compared to Prometheus, to say how low it sank...

I wish this movie was longer and kept some of the extended cut, as well as the script dialogue when David speaks the language and reads the murials. YouTube explains a lot of things in even more detail e.g. Who were the Engineers? Why did they turn against humans? I dare not write anymore so as not to spoil the movie.

I absolutely cannot wait for Part 3. Ridley Scott is the modern day Picasso and Vincent van Gogh.

I don't often write reviews but I am appalled at the low scores by some reviewers. Clearly they are not Sci Fi fans.","10"

To make it short, an expensive expedition ship, full of idiots, are trying their best to get killed. They mostly succeed, but the process takes way too long. Bonus points for the relief I felt when some of the more annoying characters were finally killed. Oh and the visuals, they looked superb.

SPOILERS AHEAD!

If you're gonna get rolled over by a gigantic doughnut, don't run away from it in straight line in its rolling direction, just step to the side.

If you find a (not so small) space cobra on a planet with no vegetation, guess what it'll have for dinner before trying to cuddle it three times.

If you're on a foreign planet and your computer tells you the atmosphere is breathable, don't take your helmet off just yet, maybe (just maybe) there's bad stuff in that life sustaining air.

If you're pregnant with an unknown, fast growing, life form and need to have an abortion by caesarean, do not expect instant recovery and further heroic deeds that day. And don't forget to tell the others why you're covered in blood and tuckered around your waist, 'cause they won't notice.

And so on. So bad it hurts.

"tuanvu2112-1","ALIEN's aware folks: half spoiled","25 June 2012","the original ""ALIEN"" contains not only the better script and originality in all characters, and is topped w/ sci-fi substance, and suspenseful and climactic ending. This ""Prometheus"" title bears nothing exotic that promises effects of thrill, creativeness coupled with clarity in terms of the script, or portent of any cinematographic virtuoso, and this lack of imaginativeness can be seen in the non-communicative aspect of the film in terms of its non-unified sequence/scenario amounting to a non-climax that would fail to captivate the viewers the same way the 20-year past movie did; that is, the ""ALIEN"" masterpiece this title tries to imitate. If you enjoyed (or are half-spoiled with) the original ""Alien"", be prepared or get ready to lower your expectations, as this film will disappoint, except for one bright spot played by the main character; and even this character does not achieve much in leaving the viewer with lingering (positive) effects when the viewer is walking out of the theater.","6"
"fredrikgunerius","Alien 30 years later","18 October 2023","With Ridley Scott returning to the science fiction genre's space travel segment, and doing so with a lot of ambition, he cannot help but raise the stakes and create high expectations. And rightly so, because since making a name for himself in said genre with films like Alien and Blade Runner, Scott has continued to output large-scale productions of a high quality, although he has arguably never again made such iconic films as the two aforementioned. And as Prometheus opens, with its alluring combo of creative existentialism, Star Trek-ish robots and the genre-typical crew composition and presentation, it's difficult not to get sucked into the possibilities it opens and the promise of it all. The story and backdrop is so well thought out and aptly handled, and Scott keeps us aptly in the dark with a notion that there is more to the story than what meets the eye.

As our spacecraft approaches its destination, and the narrative turns from voyage to operation, Scott still retains his thought-provoking, sly style of storytelling. The film grows increasingly eerie, and Scott starts introducing a few horror elements which moves Prometheus closer to Alien territory. Although there is no characterological connection between the films, there are more than subtle hints suggesting that the creature that Prometheus' crew is dealing with shares a good deal of DNA with Sigourney Weaver's old friend. And from the middle part of the film and on, our protagonists (notably Rapace and eventually Fassbender) must try to solve several recognizable space-travel mysteries: Who were there before them? What happened to them? Who can we trust onboard? And will we be able to get the ship back in the air?

Prometheus does remain interesting throughout, but the originality which Scott looked to have promised us early on, mostly remains just that - promises. There is loads of unexplored territory and potential here, and we only get hints of the undeniable potency in Guy Pearce's character and the relationship between Rapace's and Fassbender's characters. Towards the end, we realise that this may well be because the filmmakers have their minds set on pre-planned sequels, and that this has lead to an intentional obscuring of information and storyline. I guess that's the way to make money in the business these days, but it's not the way to make great art. And Ridley Scott, if anybody, should know that.","7"
"eshwarmail","A welcome addition to Alien franchise","20 October 2012","What starts as a visual spectacle quickly transforms to an action packed thriller tightly binding the story thread abruptly cut off by the 'Alien' movie and even created a strong central female character in Noomi Rapace similar to Ellen Ripley. Treatment of this edition is actually a hybrid of both his own and Cameron's versions combining slow building suspense with high octane action sequences. Though the theory of alien life influencing/creating human life was used in some earlier movies (most notably 2001: A space odyssey and Contact), this one too doesn't do too bad for itself.

An exploration team is assembled by a wealthy but dying old man Peter Weyland (Guy Pearce) to find the origin of human life after a scientist couple (Noomi Rapace and Logan Marshall-Green) figure out the location of a planet in a different galaxy placed in a solar system similar to ours. This mission is commanded by Weyland's daughter Ms. Vickers (Charlize Theron) with the help of a droid David (Michael Fassbender). Soon after landing, they find the remains of an exterminated race of species similar to humans but much larger in size. While investigating the cause of their death, they encounter the life form which terrified humans in the next supposed four sequels.

Thank God Ridley Scott didn't bring back that ridiculous central computer 'Mother' that annoyed me crazy in the Alien franchise. Noomi Rapace delivers an excellent performance that has shades of similarity to Sigourney Weaver's Ellen Ripley character (mostly from Alien 2 onwards). While Alien was considered innovative for its time, Prometheus definitely misses that awe element, though there was some promise and content in the first few minutes. Ridley Scott is a veteran of science fiction genre and a pioneer of this franchise, so he exudes confidence in his story and screenplay. Fassbender gives a controlled and apt performance and is definitely the best humanoid so far in this franchise. Background score does not standout, presentation is slick and the dialogs are at times cheesy.

What I liked about this movie: 1. A storyline that stays true to the Alien franchise 2. The interior visuals of the Alien ship is matched inch to inch with the original 3. Noomi Rapace's strong performance 4. Climax What could have been better: 1. How the characters Fifield and Milburn die 2. Guy Pearce's make up 3. Closure of a few more threads 4. Shaw's climax motives and motivation

It is neither as poetic nor has that chilling thriller element of 'Alien' but is definitely a welcome addition to the franchise with its spectacular visuals, tight connection with the original storyline and a fast paced screenplay.

PS: After seeing most Alien franchise fans being so disappointed about story being in disarray or its too blockbuster type, the main reason is that Alien movie is too hyped up inside our heads and any shortcoming in this is magnified. If we go back and have another look at the Alien movie, I am sure to find so many glitches there too.","8"
"Marx_Bros_Fan86","Meh","10 June 2012","Ridley Scott has mastered the flawed masterpiece. Most of his movies have flashes of brilliance, but he doesn't quite seem to be able to fully realize all of his ambitions. Prometheus is no exception. This prequel to the Alien series gives us an origin story to the ""space jockey"" that was found in the first Alien. Unfortunately, it never quite achieves the level of suspense that it aspires to nor is it particularly thought provoking as a science fiction film. What it can offer is brilliant production design and an excellent performance from Michael Fassbender. But this isn't quite enough for me to recommend it.

Scott attempts to imbue his Alien formula with a Kubrickian mystery regarding the origins of life on Earth- an ambitious task. Elizabeth Shaw (Rapace) and her boyfriend Charlie uncover several identical inscriptions on archaeological expeditions that they believe will solve the mystery of the origins of human life. Their discoveries lead them to a planet in a solar system that is similar to Earth. Along with the Captain and crew of the Prometheus, owned by the Weyland Corporation, Shaw and Charlie excavate a cave that is eerily similar to the derelict space craft from Alien. From there, they encounter alien and some not so alien enemies that threaten Earth.

The film's greatest strength is its dense visual design- no surprise for a Ridley Scott film. He should seriously get a lifetime achievement award for best visual filmmaker. The cast is also good for the most part. Noomi Rapace, a scientist who believes that Aliens created the human race yet clings to her Christian faith, captures the innocence and enthusiasm demanded by the script. Charlize Theron plays the bitchy representative of the Weyland corporation very well. Fassbender, however, steals the show as an Android whose motivations are mysterious. The other cast members are adequate, nothing to write home about. For the life of me I don't understand why they cast Guy Pearce as an old man though- the makeup was terrible. There are some underdeveloped relationships in this movie too, particularly between Charlize Theron and the ship's Captain.

The movie's largest failures are in the suspense and story departments, however. Ridley Scott's movies almost always start out slow, but even when the pacing is supposed to pick up in Prometheus it just doesn't feel suspenseful. The villains aren't particularly scary, partially because we see them in almost the first shot of the film. Mystery is key when it comes to monster movies, and the only mysteries in Prometheus come from its poor writing. The motivation of the enemies remains a mystery, but not in an intriguing way. Furthermore, all of this movie's talk about the origins of life and the motivations of the creators of the universe don't really amount to anything.

On a side note, I've heard people say that scenes were probably taken out of the film that were vital to the story, and a director's cut will be able to fix its problems. This may be true, but why can't Scott make a movie that doesn't need a special ""director's cut"" to work? Shouldn't he be able to get it right the first time? Anyway, I can't endorse this film as a horror movie or a science fiction story. It is ultimately far too dull. I think Ridley Scott has lost his touch.","5"
"jroberts-greenday","Terrible film, excellent execution.","1 June 2012","Let me first state that I have never written a review on IMDb before, but this film was so god damn awful that I just had to write something to explain to other viewers my reasoning.

Being a longtime fan of the Alien franchise, I honestly had very high hopes for this film, and even went to view the mid night screening in hopes of Ridley Scott could redeem the franchise after the AVP franchise butchered it. I was sadly mistaken.

Let me state that as far as cinematics and special effects go, this is by no means a bad movie. The 3D, ships, creatures, landscapes, weather explosions and all other special effects are by far some of the best I've ever seen in a Sci-fi film, and if wasn't for the god-awful plot, I daresay I would have been completely immersed.

As for the story, this film does about as much to explain the Ridley Scott Xenomorph universe as the AVP franchise itself does, and certainly makes a lot less sense than the latter in attempting to do so.

The characters are completely bland, easily forgettable, by the end of the movie I walked out only remembering about three of their names thankful that it was over. You will not care who dies, and the characters seem to act completely random, freaking out when they don't need to, and acting incredibly calm in tense situations.

The plot is absolute garbage, Weylen corp makes an appearance again, obviously only along for the ride for some form of personal gain, that much is made clear in the first 20 minutes. The first of the two 'big twists' are revealed within the opening sequence, and the second is figurable within the first 40 mins.

Now for the rest of the nonsense plot. When Prometheus touches down, they immediately locate the base of what they're looking for (visually mind you, no radio signals or anything to guide them, they 'just happen' to land right above where they need to be) then they find a weird gene morphing goo which turns some earth worms into powerful boa constrictors, yet also causes the engineer's heads to explode, yet also turns the crew into rabid killers, yet also impregnates the main heroine with a face sucker. So which is it?

No attempt is made to explain this new bio weapon, and it's effects are completely inconsistent throughout the movie. The 'tense moments' a virtually non existent and the film does nothing to draw you in and captivate its audience. To be fair, by the end, I didn't give a damn if any of them survived.

Then finally when the last engineer is found in cryo, he turns on the cast and tries to wipe out humanity by flying the bio weapon to earth with no explanation as to their motives at all. Why go through all that trouble of creating a race, then getting them to come find you if you're just going to wipe them out?

Then there's the final scene in which the face sucker (now about 7 feet tall) impregnates the last engineer, and the Xenomorph queen bursts from its chest fully grown. This seemed more like a tribute to the squealing fanboys rating this film 9/10 than actually making any attempt at explaining their origins.

I'm still holding out for a sequel to better explain this load of garbage, but trust me, don't waste your time. Wait for the blu-ray.","4"
"AvBaur","Visually stunning, but utterly frustrating","23 August 2012","Well... let's start with what works: Visually, this movie is amazing. The production design, the visual effects, and the cinematography are completely stunning and unlike anything I've seen before, and the sets and landscapes are often literally breathtaking. Technically, 'Prometheus' is a marvel. And the cast isn't too bad, either - Michael Fassbender in particular is very convincing as a morally ambiguous android.

It's just a crying shame that all this technical excellence and these good actors work in service of such a terrible screenplay. It's not even that it lacks fascinating ideas or doesn't ask interesting questions, but that it just doesn't put any of its (too) many ideas to good use or provide compelling answers to its questions. But that wasn't even my biggest problem. I probably could have done without the answers if the characters had worked for me at all. However, almost nothing they did seemed even remotely like something real scientists (or real human beings, for that matter) would do, none of their reactions seemed genuine and believable. It's telling when the emotionless robot is the only compelling character in the movie...

All in all, I'd say this was one of the most frustrating experiences I've ever had with a movie. On the one hand, I was constantly marveling at the technical achievements and the dense, creepy atmosphere, and on the other hand, I was extremely annoyed and utterly frustrated by the characters and the half-baked ideas and story developments. Still, while I think the movie is ultimately a failure, it's certainly a very interesting failure and I don't regret having seen it.","5"
"juneebuggy","Tries hard to be epic but is just another oops we released the alien sci-fi","16 January 2015","I thought this was supposed to be a smart science fiction movie, I mean it was really hyped as the next '2001' or something when it came out, but this was so full of plot holes and dumb mistakes or things that are just plain ridiculous that I don't even know where to begin.

The special effects/CGI are impressive and I did enjoy the opening scene with the white alien and the whole origins of man theory. I also liked the premise where the crew of a (2093) spaceship embark on a voyage to a distant planet in hopes of discovering these origins based on cave drawings and interstellar maps but jeez.

All along this felt like it was trying too hard to be unique or epic, taking itself seriously in a very pretentious way when really the plot is like so many other sci-fi disaster, oops we released the alien movies I've seen before.

To begin with this is a ""fairly"" important mission, with a one trillion dollar budget, a team of the best scientists and then some (seemingly criminal) blue collar workers thrown in (?) and damn do they make some dumb mistakes along the way. I won't get into all the instances but one example; Charlize Theron has her own personal medical pod but when it comes time to use it, huh, its only programmed to be used on males. Wouldn't she have checked it out before they left?

Okay, I did enjoy Michael Fassbender as Data I mean David, a great character who steals every scene he's in. And in the end I liked that this was a prequel to 'Alien', it made zero sense but it was still kinda cool. 12/3/14","5"
"siderite","Beautiful visuals, ridiculous script","9 June 2012","I understand that this was supposed to be an Alien prequel originally, people left it unfinished due to the pathetic movies in the Alien vs Predator universe, then remade it to be independent. That means that at least two scenarists and probably more, read and wrote this script. Then people read it and approved of it. All those people should be fired and preferably destroyed until no biological trace is left of them.

Now, you might think it is a dissonance between a grade of 8 and such anger at the scenarists, but it is not that strange. The film is beautifully made, clearly thought out for 3D, not something they added as an afterthought. The aliens are great, the monsters scary and visceral and the atmosphere dark and brooding. It is such a nicely done film that to foul it with such a stupid script should be considered a crime against humanity and dealt with as such.

Bottom line: if you have any scientific training or at least a vague idea of what that should be, try to temporarily abandon it before starting to watch Prometheus. Any background in physics, medicine, biology, geology or interface design will hurt your viewing pleasure. Otherwise, a great film. Try not to let its moral ""parents are crap and children a-holes"" ruin your day, either.","8"
"Caius44","Utter rubbish","5 July 2012","I have just returned from a showing of Prometheus and I must say that this film is completely absurd. Unlike many reviewers here, I did not partake in the hype surrounding this movie and did not come in expecting a great masterpiece. That said, I must add that I was certainly not ready for such a mediocre movie, especially when one considers that Ridley Scott has directing credits for some of the greatest Sci-fi films of all time.'Prometheus' not only boasts shallow dialogue, poor performances by most of the cast, a predictable plot, zero character development and more plot holes than any movie I have ever seen, it also has little or nothing to do with the 'Alien' franchise, and should not have been publicized as such. Such deception makes one wonder whether this movie was ever intended to be anything more than Mr. Scott's personal vanity project, perhaps an attempt to show the world that his repertoire of film genres is not limited to epic historical dramas. Since many of the plot holes have been elaborated upon and analyzed in other reviews, I'll just say that the only reason I gave this movie more than one star is due to the agreeable performances by Michael Fassbender and Noomi Rapace,the interesting concepts regarding the alien species and technologies, and the fan bonus of getting to know about the 'Space Jockey' race.","3"
"smashthecontrolmachine","Almost rendered speechless","3 May 2017","This film is easily now in my top 5 movies of all time. Michael Fassbender's performance as David alone would put it in that top 5 list. To those reviewers who gave this film any less than 10 stars must have seen a different movie. I unfortunately didn't see this movie when it was in the theaters, in fact I've just recently watched this epic movie. From the opening scene to the last, this is breathlessly brilliant. Every film has flaws I always say but I can't really find any in this one. On cinematography alone I would say this is a must see. I'm truly shocked it didn't win the Oscar for achievement in visual effects cause it really deserved it. I'd say a scifi film that makes you care about it's characters to some degree is rare and this one does just that. Not to mention from scene one you are pulled into this film and it doesn't let you go till the end and even long after the credits roll, you'll continue to replay the movies brilliance in your head scene by scene. If you have yet to see this film, do yourself a favor and see it, experience it, you won't regret it!","10"
"TdSmth5","Love the robot and aliens, hate the humans.","10 December 2012","In the intro we see some muscular pale humanoid drinking something and he literally falls to pieces into a waterfall. Flying above him is some giant UFO.

In 2089 we meet a pair of scientists who have discovered the same type of ancient drawings all over the world- humans pointing at some collection of UFOs.

Then we are aboard the Prometheus, a giant spaceship en route to a planet identified to be the home of man's ancestors. On board are our two scientists and a ragtag bunch of multicultural and foreign characters, one more annoying than the next. There's also a cold hot blonde who pretends to be in charge and very human-like robot- named David, what else. The whole project was funded by some dead billionaire.

Once they reach the planet they find some straight road, which can't be a natural occurrence and a mountain with a head on top. Some of these clowns go investigate inside the mountain. David is already proficient in the alien language and starts operating doors and other devices. One of them shows a holographic movie of the giant aliens, called engineers, escaping from something. They find a pile of engineer corpses. Behind another door is a giant head, liquefying vases, black liquid and worms. We learn that David is up to something.

He actually infects one of the scientists with the liquid from the room. The scientists have sex, the girl ends up pregnant with a fast growing worm. They bring a head from an engineer corpse to study. It turns out it's a helmet and inside is a humanoid alien head. Meanwhile all hell breaks lose inside and outside the Prometheus.

Prometheus is an interesting sci-fi movie I must say. It offers more than just nondescript aliens eating or shooting at people for no good reason- that would be your average sci-fi movie. The sets, the he ""science"", the theories, all is pretty fascinating in this movie. At least it tries to tackle the issue of the origin of man and creates an interesting mythology. It offers more questions than answers, which is just as good. Perhaps the answers wouldn't be as satisfying as the possibilities the questions open. Not to mention that they have to leave something for sequels. But it does have some major weaknesses--namely most of the humans, which are annoying, unprofessional, and just plain stupid. It is a mystery how presumably intelligent people-all the writers in Hollywood-can write nothing but dumb and obnoxious characters. This crew might as well be a bunch of reality-TV star wanna-bes in space. Sci-fi is the one genre where writers could get nerdy and show off their smarts. But no. Prometheus does have some good ideas and it provides food for thought, if nothing else it makes you think of all the ways this movie could be better.","7"

It's hard to know even where to begin describing the idiocy of this film. A complete insult to anyone's intelligence. Worst acting I've literally ever seen. Non-story composed of non-ideas with non-dimensional characters. It's like Ridley Scott has alzheimer's disease and all the writers, actors, and crew are trying to keep him from finding out so that they can still collect their undeserved paycheques. They should nuke this thing from orbit before it contaminates this planet any further.","1"
"CrawfordFilm","People Need To Chill Out!","15 September 2012","I loved this movie. So it really saddens me to see all the hate people are giving it. So I would like to say why.

Okay starting off with what I loved about it, I adored the overall look of the movie. From opening shot it looks outstanding. I rate this over Avatar in terms of look, before you hate on me I'll say why. Avatar is a CGI masterpiece, no one denies that, but it is 100% CGI nothing real. With Prometheus it was 70% CGI or lower, and the rest was completely real props. See movies like 2001 had real sets instead of computer effects, which is why it still holds very very strong today. I feel that that will be the case for Prometheus, and that's why I prefer it's look to Avatar.

The performances and characters. I loved Michael Fassbender as David, he killed it as he always does. He had great dialogue and great execution. Naomi Rapace did well. She is no Sigourney Reaver/Ellen Ripley or anything, but she was a good heroine. Edris Elba was a really cool character, cant wait to see him in future projects. And finally Charlize Theron did fine but didn't completely stand out. The only bad performance and character was Logan Marshall Greene I thought, other than that, solid characters and performances through out.

Now I'll have a brief statement on what I didn't love. I thought it got a little weird and gross at times, like the mini sharktupous that came out of Elizabeth Shaw ( Noami Rapace ) and how it impregnated the engineer. Weirded me out a little.

And I have to admit this film does leave a little hanging. But I doubt they'll not explain at least some of our questions. But that was part of the beauty of Alien. You didn't know a whole lot about it, and really we still don't but hopefully In The future they'll make sequels that explain some of our questions, and maybe people will start to realize that Prometheus is a good movie that is highly unappreciated.","8"
"divncom","A sci-fi fan's science fiction movie.","11 June 2012","I'm stingy with my ratings. I seldom give out anything above an 8, even to the most impressive films.

I'm giving Prometheus a 9.

There is no weak link in this movie; there is nothing to point at as useless filler. Every inch of it is filled with meaningful things: Things which have a purpose to exist.

In offering these things, we're treated to a master-work in the art of creating atmosphere on the big screen. The most apathetic and stoic of us will find it difficult to remain completely unaffected by the intensity of suspense encountered here. It moves in grand strides: The serene, human dominated world - one of technological sterility and human born power is created. The narrative introduces a twist ... nature. Nature reduces mans illusions to tatters. It's a powerful arc when done properly.

To truly enjoy Prometheus (a film which I would most aptly describe as a mixture between Alien and 2001: A Space Odyssey) you must have gone further: You must have totally absorbed the environment, characters,realities, weaknesses, the entire essence of this world - its archetypes, and their predecessors.

And make no mistake, this is a profoundly symbolic film.

On watching the movie once as of writing this, I clearly appreciated the fluidity and genuineness with which the director was able to summon the archetypes, plots, dynamics and human drama of cinematic past (or future, in the films case). I would imagine I could only appreciate the vast landscape of symbolism even more on repeated viewing.

There are a plethora of lyrical, visual and sensual payoffs to keen observers. This is a movie which demands and rewards attention.

Ridley Scott has crafted something difficult and done it with a perceived ability of ease and flawlessness which is inspiring. Various sci-fi masterpieces meld together in this epic; the genre being represented in almost every way shape and form.

In the end, though, what we have is a philosophical film. It's up to every individual to take what they can/want/will from the symbolism and drama portrayed here: And there is a great deal of it. Death, life, mortality, the contrast between the sterility of technology and the vividness of organic life ...

Herman Melville wrote about man's epic duel with nature ... one he is destined to lose. Prometheus continues this great philosophical legend with masterful visual effects, effective and unwasted dialogue, and an unwavering focus by the director on the core of its message.

And as if this all wasn't enough, as an afterthought we're presented with the most convincing female lead since - well ... Alien.

Man ... Materialism ... Vanity ... Nature ... Destruction ... it's all in this one.","9"
"Quillmaster","A few loose ends","1 June 2012","Well... don't get me wrong, I did enjoy the film, but...

Putting ""Alien"" to one side for a moment, this is a pretty good film. The special effects are very well done, particularly the portrayal of the race that came to be known as Space Jockeys, which are very convincing. The characters too are likable, with an exceptional performance from Michael Fassbender as the artificial person. Tension is suitably high in places. Like I said, I enjoyed it, but... for a film that makes it abundantly clear that it is a prequel (Space Jockeys, the original Alien ship, and the Weyland Corporation) to the original Alien, there was at least one gaping hole for me that broke the connection, being the fact that the original space jockey did not die in his chair. If they could have just tied up that one major loose end, it would have sat a hell of a lot better with me. I find it somewhat baffling with the attention to detail elsewhere that they let that detail slip. Add to that the infuriation of never hearing any form of explanation for their actions from the space jockey himself, and you end up feeling a little cheated by the end of the film. Maybe my friends will enlighten me on something I missed.","8"

Unfortunately, this movie is not up to his usual standards. I won't go into any discussion about whether this is a ""genuine"" Alien movie or not; prequel to otherwise. I won't give away the plot either.

What I will say is that, unlike other movies which Ridley has directed, this one suffers from unimaginably large defects in character behavior. The plot isn't too bad, and anyone who has viewed the trailers will have a good idea of what to expect. However; for a multi-trillion dollar mission into deep space, the crew involved all fall into the most ridiculous tropes of clichéd horror movie behavior (and pay the consequences).

I went to see this with my brother - we'd been anticipating the release for some time. Sadly, both of us were laughing out loud many times during the movie. The reaction of many others was the same.

So - sorry about the negative review Ridley (and movie-goers). This is a BAD movie, and no amount of excellent CGI and production will disguise it as anything else.","3"
"Nemesis7293-1","Hollow Pretension","14 January 2013","Visually impressive, but otherwise a massive, hollow disappointment. A shockingly uncharismatic ""heroine"" not fit to polish Ripley's boots, characters that...aside from ""David"" and ""Janek""...are utterly unlikeable and generate zero sympathy, effects and situations that manage to be grotesque without ever being at all frightening, just barely above Syfy Channel level CG for ""The Engineers"", and worst of all, a script that takes perverse pleasure in being as obtuse as possible. I loathe being spoon-fed by a film, but I loathe even more a film that absolutely refuses to part with any information at all...and the pretentiousness inherent in that. That pretension is greatly in evidence here. Ridley Scott is a brilliant director when he's making entertainment, because his entertainments frequently achieve the level of art. When he's purposely trying to make art....he's a thudding, crashing bore.","3"
"The-man-from-Troy","It's a big Universe with lots of Aliens","9 June 2012","I laugh at all the reviews about how Prometheus wasn't this or that. I's Science ""FICTION"" and people forget about the enjoyment of making up what the future could be and not the real science of it can't happen now. Prometheus was an Excellent movie in the realm of the Alien Universe, and don't forget it is not a direct prequel to Alien.

To all you hard core Alien fans don't fret cause it's not linked to Alien but for a Strand of DNA just like Scott said.

Just go see it and enjoy it for what it is, a great movie ride and a very thought provoking story about what could have started human life on Earth.

I've seen it twice all ready and plan to see it again while it's in the theaters...Great job Sir Scott.","10"
"JamesIan2021","Spookiest Of Sci-Fi's","3 May 2015","Sci-Fi doesn't get any better than this. One of my favourite movies of all time, Prometheus is an astounding and very dark movie that features an exceptional cast, stunning visuals, teeth gritting tension, beautiful set design, an intensely dark atmosphere and excellent performances all round, all these great aspects come together to create a near perfect and totally enthralling movie, dive into the world Prometheus! In the Isle of Skye 2089, archaeologists Holloway and Shaw uncover a star map which interprets an invitation from Engineers, essentially our creators. Peter Weyland, head of Weyland Corp, funds a scientific expedition to distant planet LV-223 to uncover the origins of mankind, but once there the crew of Prometheus uncover more than they bargained for as a life form so powerful threatens the future of our race. Space has never been more threatening and frightening, every tunnel and corner of the distant planet has something lurking down there whether it be bodies, slimy aliens or ancient messages, everything has a powerful effect on you. This is similar to Alien, that being the tension and spectacular sci-fi universe but at the same time it's not, this is a whole new adventure from Ridley Scott who proves he still has the talent to create a gripping sci-fi movie with mixed in elements of deep space horror. Charlize Theron is top notch in her sinister role, Noomi Rapace is compelling and motivated to find her answers, Idris Elba delivers a touch of humour and I'm really impressed with Michael Fassbender as David the android, everybody in this fascinating movie delivers. Prometheus is a thoroughly enjoyable movie that immerses you into the darkest corners of the Universe.","9"
"craigwilson83","Very confusing, I can't decide if I liked it or not.","7 June 2012","I have been waiting a long time to see Prometheus and now I have seen it I really aren't sure what to make of it. The film looks brilliant especially in 3d and has some great acting(particularly from Fassbender, Rapace and Elba)and it had some great action. I think what lets it down is a story that didn't really make much sense to me. The story about how the scientists are going to find our beginnings didn't really seem to have much relevance to anything and just confused the film. Then there was Guy Pearce's utterly pointless character who didn't really add anything yet seemed to be controlling most of the main characters motivations. Also it was Guy Pearce wearing an old man costume, why couldn't they just get an actual old man? Who knows. Also Charlize Theron's character added nothing to the plot and I'm not sure what she was doing there apart from to have a completely pointless twist involving Guy Pearce's character. Despite this I sort of enjoyed it there was a certain amount of tension at the end and Michael Fassbender's character was very good and he dominated the film. Overall I think this film was quite disappointing I was expecting a film to rival Ridley Scott's masterpieces Alien and Blade Runner however what I ended up with was a poor story which was saved by some top class acting and great directing. 7 out of 10","7"
"christian-stevens","Good with Glitches","6 June 2012","Prometheus had me very intrigued! Having seen the Alien saga, I was very excited after seeing the teaser for Prometheus and have been eagerly awaiting it's arrival from the beginning. So did it reach my expectations?

Yes!....and no...

***BE WARNED, SPOILERS AHEAD***

The film has a brilliant start, Fassbender plays David brilliantly and while Rapace, Theron, Marshall-Green and Elba play their characters well, they fail to match Fassbenders talent at being both robotic and yet also human. The visuals and designs are flawless and fit the film perfectly. From the start, Scott does well to impress.

But...

As the film continues, no answers are given, but more questions are added. The film seemed to be unsure whether it was trying to be a prequel or create it's own saga. This question never really seems to be answered and the ending leaves the audience with more questions then before. Also, Guy Pearce seems to be unnecessary. A good actor he may be, but why not cast someone that fits the age description? Besides the TED trailer, Pearce plays an old man for the entire film.

But, I still think this is a great movie. Why? I went in with the wrong attitude. I think that someone who HASN'T seen the alien movies would think this to be a fantastic movie as they'll have no questions going in and they won't mind the ones they have coming out.

Lastly, the ending is open ended and hints at the possibility of ANOTHER Prometheus movie separate from the Alien saga. I am worried about this. They might have done this in order to squeeze more money out of this franchise (I sincerely hope not) OR...

Scott has a longer story to tell. If another movie is made, then hopefully my questions will be answered, but back to the movie at hand

Despite some unexplained hiccups (Fifield zombie attack?) which hopefully may be cleaned up in a sequel, Prometheus is a brilliant film if you go into the film with the right attitude. Which is:

1-Forget about Alien. 2-Be ready for new things. 3-Stop looking for answers and enjoy the ride, it may be slow but it doesn't disappoint.

A lot of this review goes on speculation on whether Scott actually has a plan for the future or not. In short, if he does, I'll expect great things if not, then they're just sucking this franchise dry.

Overall, I give Prometheus an 8.","8"
"cantinaklen-miroslav","Ridley Scott directed this?","19 July 2012","I just checked on-line,Ridley Scott directed this fancy thing and also,Bladerunner. I wasn't sure that was possible. OK,he's 30 years older,but still,people should get smarter with years,or not? This thing that i wasted 2 hours and 5 Euros on,reminds me of Japanese-Godzilla movies from the late 70's. Like it was made for no-brainer,harmless 2 hour cheap thrill,just to pass the time. Ridley Scott really damaged his reputation with this one,failing to repeat,at least,the suspense of the original Alien. And this time,he had a lot more space to work with,and less limitations,being that this was supposed to be the beginning of the whole story. Instead,he just proved to the world that it's time for his retirement. Rewiewers before me pointed out all the all his moronic mistakes,so I won't repeat that. What bugs me the most,is that,at the doorstep of 22. century,a scientist that discovers how life on earth was created,still drools over a cross like a preacher's wife from Alabama,and frase ''Jesus!!'' is still being used in conversation,i think 5 times in the movie . Bitch,please. Not too demanding teen audience should enjoy this,being a really cool made movie,with great scenes and CGI effects,but every serius,30 years and older,SF fan,is surely,as disappointed as I am. Shame on you,Ridley.","2"
"geir-h-ellingsen","lots of unexplained, unlikely or illogical.","4 June 2012","When watching this movie I noticed 36 thing/issues/actions that is either unexplained, unlikely or illogical.

An example from the movie (spoiler): One scientist is at one point scared of a dead alien body. Later he tries to cuddle an alien cobra-like parasite. WHY?

other questions (spoiler): Who would join a space mission without knowing why? Why put makeup on a young guy to make him look old, instead of using a old guy? How can a creature grow without nutrition? How does the android robot know things (alien security codes, people and creatures locations and so on)? why does a male medical-pod have birth medical-tools? Why so many retarded decisions?

If you expect a good sci-fi, you'll probably get disappointed if you watch the entire movie. Maybe stop watching the move when their spacecraft lands on the alien moon (early in the movie). If you expect some kind of weird comedy, you might get entertained.

"matrix_swatcat","Typically Ridley Scott, typically epic.","8 June 2012","Prometheus: (vaguely spoiler free as always)

Perhaps not everyone's cup of tea but if you're a fan of Sci-Fi thrillers like me, it was simply splendid! Thankfully it's not a horrible over-the-top Hollywood disaster, with more to offer than just the scenes in the painfully overplayed trailer.

Reminiscent of other greats of the genre, it is at times slightly predictable but definitely a good trade-off as Id rather have a textbook-ish (but certainly not cliché) genre based film rather than an experimental mishap with lackluster effort (Rodriguez's ""Preadators"" easily fitting the bill there). It definitely pulls no punches and the odd plot-twists throughout the film only add to them film's consistent level of intensity. It was a film that started out being a prequel to the ""Alien"" series that went on a creative tangent only to end up being a standalone film with ""Weyland Corporation"" being the only tie to the Alien universe in the film. I repeat, its not an ""Alien"" movie and you shouldn't go in thinking that it is going to be one. With regard to the plot, it is wholesome enough to fill you in yet leaving enough for audience interpretation and questioning, a trait of any good Sci-Fi/thriller and something that modern day cinema tends to lack more and more nowadays in our dumbed down Bayformer films becoming increasingly rampant.

The acting was definitely above par with the cast including great performances from Noomi Rapace and Michael Fassbender who successfully pulls of playing a humanizing robot, an odd gray area that was definitely felt by audiences.

Ridley Scott does an amazing job with masterful directing and cinematography and shooting straight in 3D, avoiding any post processing bullshit. ""Prometheus"" is easily one of the best modern day Sci-Fi's I've seen of late and a sure, soon-to-be favorite of mine.

"hnt_dnl","Scott drops the ball big time!","29 May 2014","Ridley Scott's highly anticipated film PROMETHEUS (2012) falls short of it's tremendous expectations. A prequel to Scott's 1979 sci-fi horror masterpiece ""Alien"", ""Prometheus"" tries to be several things, and in doing so, really ends up about nothing. The film plays like an uneasy blend of 2001, Alien, and Aliens, with even a nod to Lawrence of Arabia. Of course it would contain elements of the latter two movies, as it occurs in the same universe as ""Alien"". It has philosophical and religious overtones, but they are presented in an extremely clunky way.

The film's plot is that in the late 21st century, archaeologists and lovers Shaw (Naomi Rapace) and Holloway (Logan Marshall-Green) discover cave drawings that are indicative of the creator alien race of ""Engineers"" on the distant planet LV-223. The Weyland Corporation funds the mission, led by corporate bigwig Meredith Vickers (Charlize Theron) with her android sidekick David (Michael Fassbender) maintaining the ship while the crew is on life-support for the 2-year journey to the planet. The crew also includes the captain Janek (Idris Elba, sporting a weird accent), medic Ford (Kate Dickie), punker geologist Fifield (Sean Harris) and geeky biologist Millburn (Rafe Spall). Upon arrival, David brings the crew out of cryogenic stasis and they land on the planet to investigate.

The film doesn't work for a variety of reasons:

(1) The plot is paper thin, explaining away the origin of man too simplistically. The overarching theme of this film is stolen right from 2001. The Engineer at the film's start is basically the ""monolith"" from 2001, but with the added ""bonus"" of initiating life on Earth, not just providing basic knowledge, like the apes in 2001. The archaeologists who discovered the cave drawings are substitute for the moon expedition that discovered the monolith. The 4-year flash forward to the Prometheus-LV223 expedition? Same as the jump to the Discovery-Jupiter expedition in 2001!

(2) The viewer is ""treated"" to too many scenes of characters unconvincingly spouting off nonsense about creation and the meaning of life. The convos are incredibly forced and inorganic. The actors don't even seem to believe in the dialog! And there are WAY too many ""confused look"" moments where characters look clueless, and I guess WE are supposed to be curious or afraid along with them or trying to figure out what they're thinking, but I found myself frustrated because NOTHING was really happening.

(2) Except for ironically David, all the characters are incredibly one-dimensional and lifeless. Most of them don't even seem like scientists or explorers, except for perhaps Shaw, who at least exudes an aura of being a person of deep thought and reason (if you ignore the ""hunch"" part). Holloway comes across almost like an overbearing frat boy, who seems more interesting in consuming alcohol than in the mission itself; I didn't buy his character for a second. Plus, Shaw and Holloway are not convincing as lovers at all, possessing no chemistry. Vickers is essentially a watered-down female version of Burke from ""Aliens"", a company lady who only looks out for number one, except she actually has no ulterior motive. That ""honor"" belongs to android David, who seems to be a mixture of Ash from ""Alien"" and Burke/Bishop from ""Aliens"". Although well-played by Fassbender (in the film's ONLY good performance), David remains an enigma. The geologist-biologist duo Fifield and Millburn don't even seem to care about the mission at all, do NOT seem like men of science, and are literally useless! Fifield says he's in it for the money (didn't know research was THAT lucrative) and Millburn, for whatever reason, is content in being Fifield's best bud. You've just found the origins of life as we know it and you traveled for TWO YEARS to this point so you could blow it off and lay back on the ship doing nothing?

(3) After what happened to a couple of the characters upon being exposed to the alien DNA, why would Weyland STILL want to use it to try and cure him? The 2 crew members who were exposed went bonkers and ended up wreaking havoc, and their bodies could take it because they were young men. No way a man Weyland's age (he looked at least in his 90s!) could survive that!

(4)Characters just automatically believed each other's theories without any further debate or investigation. Character A makes a theory, then Characters B through Z believes them!

(5) The ending with Janek (the film's most frustrating character, mainly because of Elba's decision to use an odd Southern accent, but also he just acts weird throughout the whole film) and his borderline mute co-pilots was strange to say the least and ties into my point #4. No character in this movie has a discernible personality!

I found the setting of this movie to be incredibly dull, static, and uninteresting. Scott spent a lot of money and effort to create one of the most drab Hollywood sets I've ever seen. Most of the ""action"" takes place in that Engineer ""cave"", with characters just spouting off nonsense dialog and acting odd for much of the film's run.

Now, to the BEST part of this film: Figuring out how it ties into ""Alien"", because at the very least it's interesting picking out the ""Alien"" easter eggs (no pun intended!) that are throughout the film. It's at least fun comparing parts of this weak movie to an actual GOOD one! Of course the ending itself is a hoot, but overall this movie is 2 hours of nothing happening to get there. I think I give the film 1 star for David, 1 star for Shaw's body (you'll know what I mean when you see it!), 1 star for the easter eggs, and finally 1 star for the ending!","4"

"krocheav","Prometheus is Pretty Preposterous","22 September 2017","How to make a Si-Fi clone: First, re-cycle the script for Alien (which someone has already said, was really not much better than a 50's B movie anyway) then add a couple of ideas very similar to 2001, shuffle a few pages around - add one or two minor new thoughts to make it look as if it's somehow different. The result: Prometheus - a multi- million dollar effort that struggles to deliver. Pity the poor folk that paid good money to see it, thinking it might be special - only to come away wanting their money back.

Next, add heaps of gore and repugnant CGI monsters - with tons of explosions and you have a movie for sci-fi addicted audiences the world over. But, from the look of so many user comments...most saw through this box office 'mix' of emptiness. I've always found Riddly Scott to be somewhat overrated but then, some are not that hard to please or just don't know the works that are being copied. Apart from a good looking intro/main title - accompanied by interesting musical orchestrations and a couple of good performances, the rest that rolls out is either old hat or scientifically ridiculous.

Story is incoherent with dropouts that would be answered in a sequel. Photography and special effects are good but 3d is a failure as most of the movie is in 3 colors gray white and black. There are many clichés borrowed from the other alien movies to make the viewer more comfortable. But getting lost in the story from the first scene, reason for the creation of humanity and science versus religion theme, till the last,is inevitable.I got the feeling that its write as you shoot movie. Acting is good; Charlize Theron and Michael Fassbender did a great job. They could save the day.",NA

The storyline is pretty much a joke, the character development is very shallow, the action sequences are highly predictable, and the list goes on. What we kept thinking all through the movie was: what was on Ridley Scott's mind when he agreed to do this? Is he really getting too old to make a Good Movie? I'm not much of a writer, but frankly: even I could have come up with a better script. Take Alien, mix it with any dumb action movie made in the past 10 years, throw in some faux Kubrick, served by good to great actors in bad roles and you get Prometheus. Thankfully we still have Alien, which remains one of the best movies ever made. Unfortunately, Prometheus is to Alien what a Happy Meal is to an exquisite dinner at a three star restaurant.","4"
"aikighost","Visually stunning let down. More holes than a colander.","8 June 2012","General consensus... confused, badly written with characters that do things that make very little sense and a plot that makes bold statements without anything to back it up.

For the most part the characters are horror movie cyphers put there to drive forward the flaccid and overblown plot. Fassbender and Rapace come out of it reasonably well due to their genuine acting chops but even they cant save the dire and often nonsensical dialog.

Very pretty but massively badly written and meandering. Avoid like the plague, wait for it come on TV. Yes its that bad. ___________________________________________________________________

Please don't read beyond here unless you've seen the film..

I'll set out some of the plot holes and also just generally stupid things that happen in this trite piece of rubbish. Strap in this might be quite long.

1. How did the Shaw and Holloway convince Weyland to launch a multi billion expedition on such flimsy basis? If your answer is ""Wayland is obsessed"", how come thousands of con men didn't convince him before?

2. If David is there to help Wayland achieve his goal, what is to be gained by dosing up a crew member with a biological contaminant that will have unknown consequences?

3. What was the purpose of David allowing an unknown creature grow inside Shaw's womb?

4. Holloway acting like a maudlin child about the fact that there were no live aliens to be found rather than excited because well ""we found an alien civilization, here comes out noble prize"" was just silly.

5. The part with everyone removing their helmets? That was just stupid. Have someone call him out for being an idiot, and have him reply that it's safe, none of the air samples they took had any micro-organisms.

6. How did the geologist who's responsible for mapping the whole thing and invented the system that did so got lost in the complex?

7. Why would a biologist and an already freaked out geologist react the way they did to the ""snake"" creatures rather than running away till they had appropriate gear to deal with the situation.

8. What was the purpose of infected Fifield turning up at the ship and killing people, other than a meaningless throwaway action scene? How did ""infected Fifield"" even remember where the ship was if he's no longer human and merely ""zombie attack biological weapon Fifield""?

9. Why did the alien engineers have no defensive weaponry of any kind? To protect against the technological biological weapons they presumably created?

10. Why did the engineers decide that destroying humans/earth was a good idea? Even further why bother using a genetically engineered creature to do it? Why not just hit the earth with a plague? Or even nuke it to hell and back?

11. Why is Wayland and co. taking Shaw with them when they go meet the progenitor? What's the reason behind that? Why is she going along?

12. How the humans know that the Engineers were planning to come to Earth and wipe people out. There is a massive leap of non logic there. 13. Why would a superior intelligence and technologically advanced creatures pretty much instant reaction to being woken by the humans be to start beating them to death like some Saturday night creature feature monster of the week?

14. The two co pilots staying on the ship while Vickers escaped, both of who seem to gladly accept their need to die with a smile, thumbs up and quip about the lame who's going to ""win that bet"" ongoing non joke. I was WTF? Who accepts their death in such a silly and throwaway fashion? Terrible writing & execution right there. Kill the non characters by all means but at least make me believe they actually needed to be there on the ship to die.

15. Why would Shaw trust David after he had so obviously been responsible for most of the bad things that had just occurred?

Any time you answer ""because otherwise the movie wouldn't happen"", here's your plot hole.","3"

"michiel-vanaalderen","Great cinematography, decent acting, mediocre character design, extremely flawed story line","3 June 2012","First of all, cinematography was excellent. Scott implemented the same typical design as he did in the alien series.Overall, the acting was alright, not great, alright. Especially Michael Fassbender shines in his role of an android with its own agenda. I found character development throughout the movie to be flawed. Especially the character played by Charlize Theron. She plays the daughter of a rich entrepreneur: a physically tough, cold hearted woman desperately to fulfill the role of the son her father never had. However, despite her harshness and tough manners, she easily beds the captain of the ship halfway through the movie, and also her demise at the end of the movie leaves questions as to what her purpose in this film really was. Other than David, an intelligent parallel to the struggle between mankind and its creator(s), the rest of the characters consist of archetypal tough guys, scientist and fools and do not add much to the movie. The storyline, to my opinion, is extremely flawed and leaves the watcher with lots of questions: In the opening scene, an 'engineer' drinks a substance after which his body falls apart. Did he sacrifice himself on purpose to create life on earth? Also, the star system depicted by the several different cultures, why did they all point to an 'engineer' military outpost that was purposed to wipe out humanity? Why does the Fifield character gets lost in the complex whilst he has 'pups' that had just mapped the complex entirely? Why do some of the infected ones become raging zombies and why do aliens larvae explode from the bellies of others? And lastly, the operating scene: very, unrealistic, anatomically incorrect and over the top.

"iamdbm","David, the Soulless Android","11 June 2012","If they renamed the movie ""David, the Soulless Android"" viewers might have a better sense of whether or not they want to see it: the movie, like the character, is soulless. Despite some good acting and a solid story idea, this movie is flat out terrible. It's hard to believe that with the time, talent, and resources that were poured into making the movie no one bothered to do any meaningful character development. The only really surprising moments (and this is not a spoiler) are when a character displays some emotion. To call the emotional content of this movie uneven would be a gross understatement. It's so disappointing to be sitting in a movie and be able to detach from it completely and recognize when the creators are using heavy-handed, misplaced music to create emotional tension because they've done such a poor job of creating it by actually writing characters with depth.

"edojaya","Another unintelligible and disgusting Alien movie","14 June 2012","I had waited for the movie for some time. The trailer give me the impression of an original idea and enjoyable movie. There are great scenery (which seems to be Ridley Scott's expertise), cool science fiction's mechanics, and actions.

However, the flaw is simply too much. The worse of them all is the storyline. A trillion dollar mission wouldn't gather a bunch of incompetent idiots, who know nothing about safety and science. Any scientists should know that any creature that is similar to 'us' are most likely aggressive creatures that would have great weapons of mass destruction. A simple study on history of man and animal evolution would show that the more advanced a creature is, the more efficient he can kill (e.g. 20th century nuclear bomb vs. middle century guns and swords). So, Weyland's mission to be 'saved' from death by meeting the creator is simply stupid. And, stupidity never give anybody trillion dollars. Then, there is also the problem of safety and regulations. All scientists always move with the highest safety standards. No one would take risk like them. It is unrealistic. This is worsen by the scientific inaccuracy. The story on how Holloway get infected and died is simply illogical. The infection tract is hard to believe. Any organisms would need continuous supply of energy to survive. Any organisms that hibernate to last for a long time would weaken. A weaken organisms that is dipped in alcohol 40% (Vodka) will get weaken further. Furthermore, a weaken organisms (due to hibernation and alcohol) should not be able to stand human's stomach acid and survive. How did it get into the blood tract? Then, suddenly go into the human reproductive system and came out with sperm?

The disappointing illogical story line is worsen further by bad acting. Vickers' act on being cold failed to arouse the emotion of the audience to feel her coldness. Fifield act tough and gangster with his tattoo in the start of the movie. It made me thought that he is the security agent, yet he is the Geologist! And he is not tough and gangster. None of the actors play their character strongly.

I hope that they do not make disappointing movies like this anymore. One must have the intelligent and knowledge of primary or junior high school to miss all the flaws. in the storyline.","3"
"inner_horizon","Whadda we do NOW huh? GAME OVER MAN, GAME OVER!","10 June 2012","It is curious that the current IMDb rating for this film is 7.8/10 and yet the opening 20 user reviews (as well as the reviews of many professional critics) consider Prometheus an abomination.

I contrast this with discerning (review-writing?) audience members, who insist at the very least, upon a cogent STORY.

So instead, I'm going to focus on the over-arching problems of this film (and so many recent films like it): (a) inconsistency within its own paradigm and (b) lazy usage of character stupidity to drive narrative.

(a) Everyone understands that you have to suspend belief a little when watching a film, but a film should not be so inconsistent with its own 'rules', as to contain outright impossibilities or to have the audience is screaming ""BS!"" It's OK to have an intergalactic spaceship, so long as you don't later refer to its engines being powered by Gandalf, pogo-sticks and happy thoughts. Characters must also be consistent with themselves. Spaceship captains that 'can't fly for sh*t' are a big no-no, as are scientists who propose space missions based upon belief rather than evidence, as are mega-corporation executives who spend trillions with only hearsay as proof of return-on-investment, as are biologists that seem blissfully ignorant of obvious cobra-like 'threat posturing'. Why does Shaw need to stop and think, when asked about (normal human) sexual liaisons/pregnancy likelihood? We have JUST HEARD that she is infertile and has been in hyper sleep for years!!! Bottom line is: films and characters have to make some sort of sense, within their own context.

(b) This brings me to my next point; the creative laziness with which plot is driven. A plot should move along with characters' actions driven by plausible, understandable (hopefully logical) MOTIVES. Instead, film-makers will lazily throw any old nonsense into the mix because they can't be bothered thinking up a more sensible way to achieve preconditions for the scenes they're after. A Prometheus example: in order for some minor-characters to meet grizzly demises, it was necessary to have them isolated from help at the time of an attack. But how does Ridley Scott achieve this? By having the scouting party REFUSE the presence of armed security personnel (why lug them light-years away if you're not going to use them?); by having characters become hysterical for no reason and seek 'safety' by separating from the group and running deeper into an alien complex riddled with bodies; and by having the Captain leaving the bridge/cockpit/communications unmanned (on the possibility of a shag and we never even find out if he gets lucky or not), knowingly risking the lives of two vulnerable crew mates (and his own) when all he had to do was say ""Hey co- pilot... can you take over for a while?"" - Charlize EVEN GIVES HIM 10 MINUTES TO DO THIS. Point is, if characters' actions and motives are complete nonsense, the audience cannot empathize with them, becomes detached and the it's all over.

Like the minor characters of their films, the grandfathers of the cinematic science-fiction genre have all wandered off into the dark and fallen prey to sinister villains - hordes of Hollywood 'yes-men', weird fetishes/preoccupations with aesthetics (CGI) and the temptation to lazily elaborate on masterpieces (like adding lipstick to the Mona Lisa's smile.)

All at the utter expense of a compelling story and inspirational heroes/heroines.

"clivecollett","Changed my mind","10 October 2012","The mistake I and most other reviewers made was to expect a straight prequel to 'Alien'. It's certainly what I wanted, as a lifelong fan of the Alien genre...(apart from Alien 3. I'll never forgive them for killing off 'Newt'.) After watching the film last night, I was disappointed that there were no eggs, face huggers, xenomorphs, colonial marines, very little explanations leading to the presence of the derelict spaceship on LV 426. And yet, there were references and explanations of sorts; just not the ones I wanted, and then even more questions to answer, obviously paving the way for more sequels, or is it prequels? In the end, I think it was all just a bit too clever for its own good, it terms of origins. The science is probably a bit questionable, bearing in mind it is supposed to take place about fifty years before 'Alien'. Some of The technology would certainly have been out of place in the 'Alien' universe.......mapping devices and surgical pods: that said, the adverse effect of the hyper sleep process on the travellers was suitably 'retrograde'. 'Cumbersome' would be a good word, and I certainly agree with many of the other reviewers that several of the crew characters were not only unnecessary, but particularly annoying and one dimensional. I will watch it a few more times, and sincerely hope that the next prequel will take us closer to the Ripley experience.........it's not too late Mr. Scott.","7"

"toader_alexandru","I don't recommend watching Prometheus","1 July 2012","It is written by the guy who made Lost series. If I new that - I am not sure I would have watched it.

Aliens series always was a B type movie - with aliens growing in an hour without eating anything and other issues. It was a hurried idea all around but better over other SF alternatives. But B type well made are a nice branch of SF.

And what we always waited for - something to take it out of this ridicule and give it a solid line and put it in line with the serious movies. And what do we get? A joke. Do they think we are stupid? They have to think so. Can someone please assassinate Damon Lindelof the writer? They are trying to do the Lost thing on us again. They going to add so much crap hoping people will get excited until they will run out of ideas. And then they will just made a horrible ending.

Why did they have to ruin Aliens? They could have hired this guy for Dallas or some other crap.

It has 7.5 I think on IMDb - I would mark it as 3. Or 4. Please vote down this movie on IMDb - we have to send them the message that this not the way to go with this series.","3"
"cat_ranchero","Interesting...","4 June 2012","First off, the film looks stunning, Ridley Scott has a great eye and all of his films look fantastic. I saw the film in 2D and I still thought it looked great (I won't join in the 3D debate here).

There has been a lot of debate about whether this is a prequel to Ridley Scott's film 'Alien' (1979). Well, I have it on good authority that it pre-dates that film and the planet they land on is not the one depicted in that film. In fact, I've heard Scott say in interview that there's enough material for two more films to bring us up to the point where 'Alien' starts. But I digress, personally, I found the film quite engrossing and some of the ideas about the origins of life on Earth very interesting. Yes, there are parallels to be drawn between this as 'Alien', but even so, I found the faster pace and the visuals did just enough to make up for any weaknesses in the plot. You have to remember that its fantasy and its entertainment, as soon as you start to take it too seriously you're probably going to be disappointed. I was prepared to go with it and consequently very much enjoyed the experience. Would I watch it again, hell yes!... RECOMMENDED.

"bomars-494-480095","BAD JOB: more questions than anything else","5 October 2012","(to not let this movie become a complete waist of my time, I'm writing for the first time a review here on IMDb, hoping my invested time might be of help to others)

Why wasn't this movie in the first place considered a ""Horror"", because sadly it's nothing else than that in a sci-fy-environment. Would I have watched it as such, it would have gotten a better rating, cause the scenes and images are made with much effort and detail. (from a horror movie, I wouldn't expect a consistent story. In fact that is a good reason for me not to waste my time with such movies.)

One might agree that leaving questions unanswered and a story line with many holes and more questions, is a way to get your story to appear mysterious. But is it a satisfying way? And more so: is it an intelligent one?

The big holes in the plot begin with a crew, where the members just wake up from a 2 year cryo-sleep on a spaceship without knowing each other, nor the interest in changing it. WHAT THE F***?! - On the other hand: I get it. It's meant to leave the audience without positive emotions towards some of the characters, which surprisingly!-) get to be the first slaughtered victims. (OH, NOOO!) - By the way, I don't count in the very beginning where this alien is left on earth and he is willingly taking in this substance just to look even more so shocked about it's effects. We will NEVER KNOW what this poor guy actually wanted. (nor the director) - This way it continues till the very end of this movie... things appear, things happen just to make SOMETHING happen, or to bring out different effects for the audience. They don't happen, cause it makes sense inside the story. (I mean, who would try to run away from a giant wheel in the same direction, instead of getting to the side? Out of it's way? - Really??) On the other hand some effects, are totally missing. For example a missing impact on the ground, when a giant spaceship hits it falling several hundred feet.

One can find many things that are missing in this movie. Not because one may want them. No, it's because the story shouts out in pain with all these cruel holes in it's body.

This is yet another American action movie relying on gross special effects and an inept, far-fetched screenplay. Ridley Scott is an overrated film director whose latest films go from bad to truly awful. I just cannot understand how mature viewers can give high ratings to such sci-fi nonsense while there are excellent films from all over the world that go completely unnoticed simply because they were not made in Hollywood and are not shown in multiplex cinemas where people are more interested in noisily chewing pop-corn and gaping at silly special effects than being intellectually challenged by clever movies.","1"
"alisoncolegrooveq","In Space nobody cares about the whining of Alien fanboys who can't let go and enjoy a great romp..","9 June 2012","OK time for a little balance.. put down your xenomorph figurines and stop your whining!

Prometheus is nowhere near the supposedly 'awful/woeful/appalling' insult to the apparently sensitive intellects who have posted so many negative reviews..

In fact it's quite a fine, if imperfect, film which demonstrates that Ridley Scott still has a firm grip on crafting stunning looking (acknowledged by almost everyone who loathes it yet almost immediately & conveniently ignored) engaging movies.

The leads, both Rapace and Fassbender do a fantastic job and in many ways they're the glue that holds together the weaker parts of Prometheus.

There are a few standout scenes of humor, horror and action and though the pacing is somewhat erratic and some of the dialog a little undercooked - and please, NOWHERE near as insulting as many like to pretend - Scott still manages to touch on themes that have resonated through his previous efforts such as Blade Runner (what does it mean to be human?) and reference classics such as Star Trek and 2001. That's no mean feat. Sure, the basic narrative is the same..boy and girl meet planet and find ugly stuff going on! But since when did anyone hold that against so many other beloved films in the genre?

Sometime last year i remember reading an IMDb review that lambasted the original Alien film as 'boring and not scary at all'.

I only bring that up because I think Prometheus in many regards is born into a very different world than Alien and just like it, will find an audience who are not so obsessively tethered to the halo that fanboy tragics have created for the original Alien film which it is somewhat connected to.

Personally I think it's a modern classic alongside District 9, Sunshine and Moon. Switch off the internet and go for the ride..","10"

"alangsco","Pointless answers to pointless questions.","1 June 2012","The cast was impressively fashionable, the movie trailers looked amazing, and Ridley Scott was again at the helm. What could go so wrong?

The most overblown and disappointing film of the year so far starts off OK, with the scene set nicely and the tension beginning to build. Unfortunately, the story goes nowhere fast or particularly interesting. To get the audience invested in the fate of the characters they have to care about the characters, and I couldn't help myself wanting most of them dead halfway into this movie. I will say that Michael Fassbender definitely did display a sufficient emotional range for his part, however.

I thought Prometheus was a separate movie from Alien (albeit with significant overlap) and tried to judge it so, but all it seemed to be doing was to try and answer questions that tied up the unknown elements of the Alien plot. In addition to that it puts together such a confusing sequence of events that one of the minor characters actually has to spell out in plain English what those answers are! Really, if you want to tidy up some little plot sidelines (which didn't need cleared up in the first place) you could maybe go down the Star Wars route and make a cartoon version instead for the especially avid fan who cares enough about it.

I will say that it is always visually impressive (although I didn't think 3D was used to any great effect), but that's simply not enough any more. I sincerely hope there won't be another addition to this franchise. They've squeezed enough out of it.","4"
"sheldor-31-414451","Scott delivers","1 June 2012","Ridley Scott is back in the Sc-fi genre and he really hasn't lost his edge. Prometheus completely fulfilled my expectations and more.The movie started and from the first 30 seconds I was gripped. I didn't check my watch once for the running time or to see how long was left. I was truly gripped to the screen.

as soon as the the film starts its really story building on story building on story. This movie really doesn't have a lull at any point. I am a huge fan of the Alien franchise but I went in to this film unbiased and I wanted to give this film a fair review. As soon as the film starts, it couldn't be further away from an Alien movie, but that's not necessarily a bad thing. I found the plot to be truly gripping and I couldn't wait for the next scene to unfold. This is easily the best film I have seen so far this year and I felt it did have a unique feel to it. The actors were very well chosen apart from perhaps Guy Pearce. I felt his character could have had more screen time and his story could have been more rounded. At times the film was creepy but this is definitely not a horror movie. It has the perfect blend of sci-fi, action and a tiny bit of horror and gore but it's not overly done and it works well with the tone of the movie. The 3D aspect works incredibly well. At times I felt like this wasn't a 3D movie and then something subtle in the depth of the screen would catch my eye and I think this is where 3D works best.

Prometheus is a fantastic movie and yes I do wish the connection to the first Alien movie was a little more prominent but there is enough here to really answer a lot of questions and open up new ones.","9"
"senor_spielbergo123","No, Ridley","17 May 2017","The premise of this movie was intriguing for good science fiction and I was really in the mood for something similar to 'Contact' maybe, although I'm aware it's supposed to be a prequel to Alien. SPOILERS AHEAD! The characters are idiots - including the two ""scientists"". ""Don't touch anything."" ""Oops."" And I thought 'Arrival' had to face problems as a sci-fi flick... Towards the half of Prometheus they find out where life came from and act like children compared to what any person working in their scientific field would do. Apart from that they were really flat characters. I don't care about anyone that far into the movie. The only good character was Fassbender's android. And you know there could always be something going on with the androids in the Aliens movies. And the foreseeable happens: The android helps to defrost Weyland, who wants to meet the alien because he's dying and is looking for eternal life. Then some unpredictable things happen - because the plot is a mess and the whole third act is completely rushed in pacing. I didn't even care about it being a part of the Alien franchise, I consider it a standalone sci-fi movie. But sadly, a disappointing one.",NA
"nicodimus22","Pretty, but unbearably stupid.","19 July 2012","It's pretty obvious that whoever wrote this script lacks the scientific knowledge of the average 12-year old. That's a pretty major problem with a SCIENCE fiction story. Unfortunately, the FICTION part of Prometheus is even worse than the science. Characters with very little development, maddeningly stupid dialogue and wildly inconsistent and questionable actions leave the excellent visuals as the only enjoyable part of this film. I am astounded that the studio allowed this film to be released in this state. It's a mess from start to finish.

"jacabiya","Still an awful script","13 December 2014","Just re-watched this film, but now on cable TV with full blast sound instead of a DVD version with poor sound, and the sound makes a big difference: now I could get lost in the production and effects and pay less attention to the silly script. This time I confirmed the film is addressed strictly to the mindless, so there's no need for me to revisit this film anymore. I join all the criticism regarding the script. Some comments: the scene with the alien driver had some power and potential, but why was he so mad and remained so mad, who knows. The old man at first I thought was Rutger Hauer, and I thought to myself, nice touch, Ridley Scott: later I find out it was Guy Pearce and my question, as many have asked, is why? The reason must be in order to sell the film in Australia. Charlize Theron's character served no purpose whatsoever and then was killed for no reason. I guess I'll be curious to see the sequel, but my expectation will not be high.","1"
"hindsightrecording","Oh dear...","3 June 2012","I can see a lot of people buzzing about Prometheus... This saddens me even more than having to see all the simpering approval which went hand in hand with the release of Inception. It is a film without direction or heart, characters or soul. There is no majesty in its scope or wonderment in its mysteries, because it cannot see what is flatly in front of it and cannot perceive that it has asked no question of worth. It's plot can be crippled with but a mere utterance of truth and its characters motivations flail away in the pits of pointless parody as they dance in the service of Hollywood sensationalism leaving only hollow, tattered impressions of fay humanity in their wake.

Let's speak plainly... It's not clever, before anyone comes storming along saying that ""I didn't understand"" then can stop right there because there's nothing in this film which could be considered complex, subtle or intricate. The fact that the whole film centres around a series of archaeological finds which not only make no sense in the context of history (What ancient complex civilisation capable of basic linguistics and cave paintings were living on the island of Skye 35 thousands years ago? And what were they doing about the ice sheet?) but it doesn't even make any sense in the context of the film, just because you leave some biological material lying around doesn't mean people are going to be speaking your language and painting pictures of your local star charts.

Honestly I won't go into picking apart the plot any more, because that would spoil the film completely for anyone attempting to watch it and would take an age. I can stick the boot in to the characters though, although I have to ask, what characters? It's always a bad sign when your most human character isn't human, like day of the dead where the most sympathetic character by far was the zombie they keep locked up to experiment on. Michael Fassbender is incredibly watchable as the ships synthetic and for a while you're kind of along for the ride to see what he's about and what he's getting at; but like everything in this film there's no payoff for your interest as it transpires that there was no motivation for any of his action save advancing and tangling the plot. The two archaeologists, who are just so goddamn pretty that it makes you want to be sick in a bucket at the fact that Hollywood just won't allow you to look at normal people, and are essentially your primary protagonists, do, say and offer nothing of worth or value and their lack of appropriate behaviour in the face of grand discovery is truly astounding.

Bah, my word count is getting on so I'll rap this up quick. The crew are terrible, not even Idris Elba was any good and I'm a big fan; the whole idea that on a purpose built vessel of discovery intent on finding alien life you would have a skeleton crew of misfits, mercenaries and nothings who aren't really that interested and scantly know anything about the jobs they purport to do is quite frankly ludicrous and indeed that was when the warning lights started to flash. Looking for a former glory just a little too hard were you Ridley?

Oh and a last complaint but the most bizarre; there's a melodic hook, it features in almost every quiet, supposedly emotional scene and accounts for about 30% of the films score in total. Well... It's from Star Wars... I'm not being funny, it's actually from Star Wars. Maybe there's a note or two that's a semi tone different and maybe it's in a different key, but I challenge any person familiar with Star Wars not to make the connection when listening to it. The effect this has on the film is massive and awful. There's a scene for Idris, in which he is trying to make an impassioned speech, it's serious and is supposed to have wide reaching connotation for the rest of the film and you can see him manfully trying to deliver his not very good lines in as convincing a fashion as possible under the crushing yolk of oppression which is the awful American accent he's been asked to perform and bam! Star Wars in your ear, and the scene is dead.

Very, very pretty film with lots of lovely visual effects, set design, creature work etc. It makes me feel incredibly sorry for all the artists who worked to make this film, all their hard work be used for the purposes of trite, passionless guff.","4"
"theinhabitant","Perhaps Ridly Scott is not here to make friends; maybe he's just here to make money.","12 November 2012","At the time of this writing, Prometheus has a 7.3 rating after over 200,000 votes. I am in absolute shock over this fact. This means hundreds of thousands of people would had to have given this movie a pretty good rating. I understand when a movie first comes out, a bunch of phony IMDb users instantly jump in with some 10-star ratings to try to boost the movie's score, so of course we have to wait at least a few months to see where the score settles before we can take it seriously. Perhaps these people giving the phony ratings and reviews are the folks involved with the film-making and their friends and relatives? Or perhaps they're paid? I don't know. But either way, it would only account for maybe a couple thousand ratings at best. Right? Not hundreds of thousands. I've gotta say, I'm a little bit angry at whoever is responsible for artificially boosting this film's rating, for tricking me into watching this horribly unintelligent POS.

How can this awful movie have a 7.3 rating? I've dug seven pages deep into the reviews and didn't find any positive ones. How far would I have to dig before finding any positive ones? ARE there any positive ones? Just what is going on here!? How did this film get a 7.3 rating? Robots? Are cleverly written robots creating accounts from various proxy servers and navigating through IMDb's interface well enough to rate this movie? Anyway, I've wasted enough time describing my shock and confusion about the rating. Here's my review: This film is like Battlefield Earth, but with good special effects and cinematography. Don't get me wrong; it's far better than Battlefield Earth - just for the CGI and cinematography alone. But the plot and writing are just as stupid. Seriously.

At first I just furrowed my brow a bit and mumbled some minor complaints as the first few nonsensical parts came up: ""Is this guy supposed to be somehow seeing this lady's dream? I can't tell. Is this blurry scene that was edited together like a corny flashback in a bad B-movie supposed to be a dream? What's going on?"" ""Why is that one guy so hostile and talking about how he's 'not here to make friends' because he's apparently 'just here to make money'? What? Don't these astronauts know each other? Shouldn't they be somewhat professional?"" But I was still expecting a good film at that point. After all, this is the Alien prequel, directed by Ridley Scott.

But before long, I was no longer just furrowing my brow in confusion; I was yelling at the screen as I watched a supposed scientist decide to remove his helmet in an alien atmosphere: ""Why would you take your helmet off??!!! Are you kidding me??!! YOU'RE ON AN ALIEN PLANET YOU IDIOT!!!"" Then...get this....I kid you not: The other scientists - scientists that are presumably respected enough in their fields to be selected to travel across the universe on a super-important mission, and who were just acting distraught at the idea that their idiot colleague was about to take his helmet off - decide to take their helmets off too! Apparently all these scientists decided it would be okay because nothing bad happened to the first idiot after TWO SECONDS of having his helmet off. What?!!!!! From there it just got worse. Idiots dipping their gloveless fingers into bubbling, organic, alien goo (that had maggots wiggling around in it for no reason)... an idiot trying to get cuddly with a threatening-looking cobra/lizard thing (the same idiot that up until that point was scared to death of the place and jumping out of his skin every time he heard a peep or saw a shadow)...I could go on forever... The countless, blatantly-obvious plot-holes, contradictions, and the constant, extremely-unrealistic, idiotic behavior of the characters make this one a very difficult one to sit through.

Seriously. This movie is really bad. Seriously. I'm going to pretend this never happened. There are only two Alien movies.","2"

"lewisbs","What were the writers thinking?!","4 June 2012","Okay so I was pumped to see this movie, like everyone else and initially went along with the story of searching for our makers etc, even if it was a little cheesy.

But once everyone on the ship wakes up and we meet the characters it starts going down hill and continues to do so from then onwards. I found myself saying 'are you serious!!' every 5 mins or so from this point onwards.

I was going to write a full on review but there are too many issues to write about so I thought save my time and yours I'll just highlight a few....

When some of the crew die from attacks by weird alien creatures, no one actually cares or bats an eyelid.


A probe senses alien life every now and again, this apparently must be a glitch, therefore no further investigation is required.


A crew member is burnt alive, but then comes back to life as a crazed super human thing, killing many of the crew. Let's in turn kill this thing, not question it's existence and never mention it again.


-A crew member manages to extract an alien from her stomach, she leaves the alien in a semi locked room then, covered in blood and carrying a severe post operation wound, enters a room full of people. Queue no questions about what's happened to her and if she is okay. She fails to mention that she has just removed an alien form her body and it is on the ship. She is also completely unsurprised that the billionaire who funded the mission, who is supposedly dead is, in fact, aboard the ship.

Charlize Theron is the daughter of the billionaire, I think this was meant to be a big twist in the movie. So pointless was this scene. Shocker.


I promise you these scenes and many more are peppered throughout the film.

Finally, if you make it this far, the ending is horrifically tacked on so as to explain the link to the other alien films and to leave it open for a sequel.....Please no. I beg you.","4"
"ptmetsch","An Epic masterpiece written by a 4 year old...","9 June 2012","Let me open with this: I went into this movie with such overwhelming optimism that it bordered on subjectivity and bias. I wanted to love this film, and I had the expectations that I would. Yet, here I sit.

The disappointment has actually taken a physical toll on my body. I loathed it. Not from an 'Alien' lover's perspective, but from the perspective of a true fan of cinema; one who appreciates a well-paced and thoughtfully written film. 'Prometheus' fails to deliver in these regards. My expectations of overwhelming suspense, sheer terror, and marvel which stemmed from the magical movie trailers were shattered by clunky and juvenile (optimists would say 'over ambitious') scriptwriting.

To start, we are introduced to the run-of-the-mill cast of two-dimensional characters. The blindly ambitious leaders, the corporate type, the apathetic expendables who exist solely to collect their pay, and the overly-analytic David, a robot crew member played genuinely well by Michael Fassbender. The feeling I got from watching these characters, and their interactions with one another, was that of sheer apathy. The motivations for their actions were silly for the most part, if they even existed at all, and they rarely interacted with each other on an intellectual level.

Next we have the script, which is so polluted by attempts at mind blowing that we as an audience forget that there was, at one point, a reason for undergoing the mission: not only discovering life outside of our solar system, but the very life forms responsible for our existence. At what is supposed to be a pivotal point in the film, the corpse of a non-Alien-alien is discovered, analyzed, and found to share human DNA, thus essentially proving that we were created by these beings. This moment, one which would be marvelous and poignant to a normal person, is brushed aside and moved on from within a matter of minutes. In another scene, Elizabeth Shaw must remove the unwanted alien fetus inside her (via Cesarian) using a state-of-the-art and highly ludicrous surgeon machine. Once the gruesome surgery is performed, the hideous being is extracted, and Shaw is stitched up and back on her way; never mentioning the atrocity again. The thought going through my head during these points was: ""How am I supposed to feel awe or horror if the characters I'm watching - the very people experiencing these moments - are so unwilling to react appropriately?""

The sheer lack of fluidity in the script is what kills the film for me. Here, we are presented with the wonderful notion of discovering life, the life of our creators, and having them turn their backs on and annihilate us for a reason that could be picked from the 1000s of our society's flaws. Instead the 2 hours that Prometheus drags are cluttered with cool ideas that don't last long enough to actually be cool. We're not left with enough time for tension to build or emotions to flourish. Instead, we are presented with an idea, given enough time to say ""Oh cool"", and then forced to move on.","2"
"thedarksteps","Did any of you actually watch the movie?","8 June 2012","I just watched a midnight showing of this movie and I thought it was great. However, I've been reading numerous reviews where people are completely getting lost on the content and context of the movie.

Some of you keep asking some of the same questions which were all addressed had you actually been paying attention. One that keeps appearing throughout many reviews is: How is it that the planet is so big and the place they choose to land has the ""temple""? First off, they called it a pyramid not a temple. Second, David said that the planet was a military installation and that the pyramid was basically a hangar. Most military installations have multiple hangars, also David said there were other ships. You people were either sleeping or went into the movie with a preconceived notion that this was going to be an action movie like the last 3 alien movies.

Another question that seems to be recurring is: If the Jockeys wanted to kill us, why would she go to their home world to talk to them? If you listen to the inflection in her voice, talking is not what she has in mind. She means to expose them to the organism they created to wipe out not only humankind, but presumably any of their other creations on several other worlds that are referenced on the star map that David is standing in the middle of.

How can David work their technology so easily? David has studied many other languages of Earth, as a synthetic he has the processing capabilities of a computer of the era, and using linguistic skills as well as knowledge of human language, deduces that if they created us then they also created our language(s). Which would mean there would be some degree of understanding if he were to successfully make a few educated guesses. Seriously, do you people even know how science works? Why was Weyland implying that he is dead but in fact is on board without the crew's knowledge and why? Weyland was hoping that Shaw's theory of the ""Engineers"" was accurate and they did in fact exist. If that were the case, he hoped that because they were so advanced that they must also be civilized and would possibly prolong his life and reverse the effects of aging. Weyland was also in contact with David even while being in cryo-stasis, constantly being updated by David and adding new directives to David's ultimate purpose on the mission. Which is a repetitive story device in all the alien movies; secure the organism within one of the crew members and freeze it for the trip home.

How did David know she was pregnant with an alien fetus? Because it was his intent to have her impregnated by exposing her boyfriend to the organism. It would work through his system, get into his ""change purse"" and when he made a deposit in her ""vault"" she would then carry the organism.

This movie was really good, if you happened to be paying attention and didn't go in wanting to see a heart pounding, cliché action movie. You either need to see it again or read the book adaptation, because most of you are posing questions about the movie that would be obvious to a high school student.","9"
"trippyjim","Nothing New Here","13 June 2012","This movie was an abominable letdown. Suffice it to say that it offered nothing new over the 1979 version, aside from the idea that mankind was spawned by aliens (which is not a spoiler because it was included in the trailer). This idea is very popular right now (see, e.g., the History channel, as well as the South Park spoof of it). I think Hollywood is counting on the fact that U.S. audiences are getting dumber...and it might have a point there, as evidenced by the high ratings this movie got. I gave it 2 stars out of 10 because it was a waste of my time and money. In the future, if you see big names and a summer release, stay away–it's a time-tested Hollywood recipe for a piece of s**t wrapped in a shiny package. Shame.","2"
"JoshtheArrogant","Exactly what the doctor ordered","8 June 2012","Ridley Scott's grim return to the sci-fi genre is one of the most marvelous comebacks a director has ever pulled off. Prometheus has reinvigorated the space flick like no other movie since the immortal 2001: A Space Odyssey.

This is a Scott film in every sense of the term. The landscapes are picturesque, the set design is magnificent to the simplest detail, and the visual effects are cutting-edge. It has that great Ridley Scott pacing, too. Few movies in Hollywood today have the courage to make an audience wait for the action, but Sir Ridley always has and the payoff is truly awe-inspiring here.

The score by Marc Streitenfield is amazingly incorporated. It gives each dramatic scene an added intensity. One of the highlights of the film is the editing, though. There is seldom a scene that feels misplaced, and the arrangement creates a layering that builds the suspense until the breaking point. This deserves to win the Best Film Editing Oscar this year, not to mention Sound Editing.

I am not familiar with Noomi Rapace's work, but she gives a strong performance here as Elizabeth Shaw. I think Sigourney Weaver would be proud to know that the role was aptly reprised. The casting was even superior to the original cast of Alien. David, I'm proud to say, is the greatest android of the entire franchise. Scott has finally given some life to the character, and is no longer trying to deal with morality. The other crew members also make the movie more suspenseful and sometimes funny.

Prometheus has instantly established itself as one of the all-time great science fiction films. It is all around a near perfect resurrection of the franchise, and in my opinion Scott's second great masterpiece, next to Blade Runner. Some may not immediately fall for it, as it is quite shockingly graphic and colossal in scope, but without a doubt, Prometheus is the best of the year so far and exceptionally worth seeing. If you're looking for a movie that fulfills the sci-fi/horror/thriller tag like never before, look nowhere else.","10"
"jackstarr777","Entertaining but just a little disappointing","2 June 2012","It's unfair to give Prometheus a bad rating simply because it does not live up to the first two films in the Alien series, but I don't think anyone was expecting it to anyway. Sure, the script feels a bit botched and things could have been done much better, but it sure could have been much worse.

Prometheus is far better seen on the big screen, in 3D. The effect does not distract but rather deepens the picture and is well worth the extra money. The visual design is breathtaking and flawless, and is the film's best quality.

The only real problem is the script. If the director would have had that polished up, we'd probably have a five-star film on our hands. But, characters feel a little flat, dialogue isn't top-notch and suspense isn't there most of the time, but other than the writing, nothing needs improving. Picture is flawless, performances are fair, music is brilliant and the visual effects are some of the best I've ever seen.

I guess it would have been hard to get some proper suspense and scares going, and for the most part the film falls flat in that area. However, when it is scary, it is REALLY scary. A few times in the cinema I found my heart racing and in one particular scene I almost jumped out of my seat.

The ideas behind the film are interesting, and not focused on or spoon-fed to the audience (a very good thing). But the ending doesn't feel entirely satisfying, though it is thought-provoking.

In the end, it's an idea that could have been a stunning and almost flawless film, like Alien and Aliens. But through being dragged behind by poor writing, it doesn't feel all too satisfying and maybe a little silly. But some stunning scenes make up for all that, and it's certainly much, much better than Alien 3 and Resurrection.

A good film, not fantastic, but certainly a very enjoyable watch.","8"
"Vartiainen","Ultimately somewhat disappointing","11 August 2012","I was too hyped up walking into this movie, I freely admit that. The idea of Ridley Scott returning back to his beloved Alien franchise set my expectations too high and I walked out feeling let down and disappointed. Which annoys me, because as a standalone film this one isn't too bad, really. The imagery, the tone, the atmosphere, the mood, some of the main characters... these all work very well. The very first minute of this film is amazing, with sweeping landscapes and haunting music. But then we get introduced to our main plot and my interest basically died.

Why, you may ask? Because it's the goddamned Alien and Aliens all over again! We have somewhat meek, but internally strong female lead, we have an unexplored alien planet with a spooky atmosphere, we have a ship with a grim future ahead of it, we have a crew full of personalities, we have an android, et cetera, et cetera... And all of those things would have been just fine in a standalone film. But when you realize that this movie is tied to the Alien franchise, you instantly start comparing the movies and that is the sole fact that kills this movie. It's nothing new, nothing extraordinary or exciting. It's just a director recycling his old ideas and giving them a new coat of paint. Once I realized this fact about ten minutes into the film, I could instantly tell just how the movie was going to go along. And I was right, spot on even.

And yet, it's not a bad film. It's disappointing, yes, but it's still enjoyable to watch. Sure you're expecting a bit more, but you can still appreciate it as a prequel or a tie-in as it does answer some of our questions and gives us new insight into the franchise. In addition, the cast is pretty solid (special mention to Michael Fassbender, who's brilliant in his role as David), the score is very good, the imagery keeps impressing and the plot, while nothing new, is at least solid and watchable.

Though on the other hand there are some minor plot holes, the supporting characters are not developed properly and I really didn't like Charlize Theron's take on her role. It lacked spunk, in my honest opinion.

Would I recommend this to Alien fans? Yes, even with all things considered. It is a solid movie and decent tie-in to the franchise. Just don't expect too much beforehand and you'll be fine.","5"
"fionagreen1","Alienating","1 June 2012","In an effort to avoid disappointment (being a fan of the Alien mythology), I took my seat in the cinema with as open a mind as possible, expecting nothing at all.

Even the day after the late-night viewing, I'm still unsure of exactly how I feel about Prometheus, a very unique position for me regarding movies.

Perhaps the equal amount of positives and negatives I've taken from the film have left me in a state of shoulder-shrugging, a view seemingly at odds with the majority of polar opinions on IMDb.

As has been stated almost universally, the visuals and effects are of the high-tier calibre expected from the director who wowed audiences with Alien and Bladerunner (vastly overrated in my humble opinion).

I also concede that the plot was very loosely threaded and subject to random offshoots which ended without resolution, and themes that were vague and unexplored.

The pandering to religious audiences in having the two main scientists carrying crosses (Holloways tattoo is the other one) is insulting to science, a medium where factual answers are sought, in opposition to the hallelujah corner, who blindly buy into words on a book, written by goat-herders who believed that sneezing released demons.

I find it incredible that in this era of knowledge, people still ask such self-centred, obliviously naive questions such as 'why are we here'? Surely an understanding of DNA reveals the answer, despite this answer being so stark and brutal that billions of humans would rather invent self-pleasing fairy tales to avoid the truth.

We're here because our DNA constructed us, and our purpose is to survive, selfishly, at all costs. End of story.

Even though Rapace's character finds, not god, but alien creators (viable, since DNA is involved), she still searches blindly for something there is (God), not just a complete absence of evidence for, but also absolutely no rational inclination to believe in. How ignorant.

Anyway, I digress.

The acting was as expected for a movie carrying a handful of well-known faces, surrounded by mere cannon-fodder, with Fassbender's android providing much of the magnetism, despite some all-too human emotions and some strange behavioural decisions, such as the drink-droplet.

What I found utterly unconvincing was the blasé reaction from the other characters to the multiple deaths occurring around them, along with some of the inexplicable decisions a few of them made.

Spoilers: The awakened Space Jokey/Engineer's reaction to his discoverers was also a little 'unexpected' to say the least, but then if we're correct in believing that they're out to end our evolution, it may be unsurprising.

So many questions, so few answers. Was the initial Engineer who 'sparked' life on Earth acting in accordance with his species, or as an individual? Why did these beings stop visiting us? Are the Engineers' set on destroying us due to our parasitic and destructive nature? Why did Scott bother with the hastily, unexplored element of mortality, introduced by such a pointless character as the old man? Where did the chest-busters that killed the Engineers vanish to? Where was the intermittent reading of life coming from? Where was the Engineer who was discovered at the seat of the ship in Alien? Why is Rapace's character searching, when we all know that the faithful (so named for a reason) are content NOT to search, but to simply ACCEPT? As my wife has commented, this movie has more holes in it than swiss cheese.

That said, there were occasional scenes that were impressive, including the Med-lab abortion, but for such moments, there were a dozen unexplained ones, such as the paranoid Fifield seeking his own way back to the ship, highly unlikely behaviour for someone who is clearly spooked, or his bizarre return as a crazed zombie, induced by the oily substance.

So, in a nutshell, it was slightly confusing, with some juvenile attempts at philosophical depth, and a smattering of unlikely behavioural patterns, despite a fairly grand visual feast.

Back to the drawing board Ridley. And please don't follow this one up with an even more religious offering, for in this age the shadows in which a traditional God can survive are shrinking, and rightly so. Actual knowledge is far more rewarding than personal desires and fantasies.

A decent effort at a sci-fi epic, but it joins the ranks as an unfitting addition to the Alien mythos.","5"
"Geoff-394-413483","Ridley NOT","11 June 2012","This film is scoring 7.8? I just can't understand how thats possible, my wife and I went to see this film last week and it is truly awful.

Some of the antics of the so called ""scientific team"" beggar belief and can only be considered contrivances.

To say these days that the effects are good is not enough, any movie with a budget like this is bound to have good effects, they should not be an excuse for credible characters and proper story.

A ""robot"" who runs the ship on a long deep space mission (while the crew is in stasis) and is on his own secretive mission...(even having his head ripped off, drooling a white substance while still talking)...to bring home an incubated alien tissue; an alien that hatches from an egg-like urn, and attaches itself to the hosts face, with the Alien-esque teeth and the snake like impregnation into the host's mouth....which as in AVP, impregnates one of the super-aliens in the end (and when its ""born"" oddly enough resembles one of Ridley Scott's original Aliens).

Watch it with the bare knowledge that it is set in the Alien universe we have come to love, and you will really enjoy it. As far as raw science fiction goes, this blows Avatar and anything else remotely sci-fi made in the last 5 years, out the water. So few directors can get this right, and Ridley Scott proves he is still the master at making engrossing and re-watchable sci-fi movies.","10"

I watched this not knowing anything about who directed or the connections with the previous Alien movies. I heard it was mega sick and so I purposely avoided anything that revealed anything about it. From the intro shot I knew this wasn't going to be any ordinary movie.

Now I admit there is some hardcore cheesy aspects of this film. But c'mon, you gotta go with the flow. Remember, this is a movie, not a documentary on anthropology.

"rosprichard","Oh how we laughed....","11 June 2012","Which is not what you expect when you see a Ridley Scott Alien adventure. Its not just the barely developed characters, risible dialog and implausible plot that leaves you with raised eyebrows and eventually laughing out loud. Like any truly disappointing movie, Prometheus combines real potential in the early scenes with a profound failure to deliver. David the android's obsession with Laurence of Arabia is wonderfully twisted. Charlize Theron's character could have been a fabulously dark conflicted suit, and the core idea that both the Alien and humanity evolved from the same superhuman stock was interesting. But from the moment our team emerges from their slimy sleep pods, it is apparent that no one bothered to imbue any one of them with anything like intelligence or emotional depth. Echo's of the earlier Aliens films just highlight how far this one falls short. I cared more about the cat in Aliens than any one of these incongruent dudes.","2"

So a group full of scientist inside of a spaceship on a planet in a different galaxy should have been informed of this as well.

Secondly, Michael Fassbender should not be blamed for this role. His performance was good! Considering the writing was weak and the story had more messages about religion than the 700 club on a Sunday morning. As well as Idris Elba for being the only character with an actual story arc.

Thirdly, speaking of religion, if you are going to force it down our throats at least cast Kirk Cameron so we know what we are in store for. Then we know not to see go and waste our time.

fourthly, before you mess with a franchise that you helped create at least take the time to watch the movie that started it, and see what that movie had going for it (i.e. less is more, atmosphere, tension, (and most importantly) character development).

Fifthly, instead of killing not one, not two, BUT FOUR characters in some sort of martyred attempt to bring down the alien ship, why not stop and think ""hey?"" why don't we try out those cannons?""

I could continue to dissect the plot, but this movie has bored me to sleep and It's time for bed.

"vaisaghdilip","First it was boring ,re watched then it was interesting","16 July 2017","Prequels: a film category exuding potential – the putty is there to be molded, but with whose questionable capacity? (2007's Hannibal Rising is almost taking up too much of this word count to even mention. Ugh.) In our case, Ridley Scott returned to the helm and constructed a horror odyssey, impressive in its scale and energy, in the universe of the Aliens series, but removed from its original story (for now let's just overlook 2017's Alien: Covenant).

Scott's Alien (1977, first in the series) is an obvious classic and still slickly stunning, so maybe you didn't see Prometheus because, like, why would he mess with that? Or worse, you did see it, but endured the company of a snobby franchise fanboy whose criticisms pummeled into your own psyche, skewing your perception of what is, in reality, sci-fi horror gold.

So watch it, or re-watch it, but this time really drink in all of those lustrous special effects, meditate a bit on those worthy themes, and maybe even make notes because if you're ever going to have to perform an alien abortion on yourself this may serve as your only reference.",NA
"mickchillage","All grandeur, no substance and pushing the boundaries of suspension of disbelief","9 June 2012","From the very opening sequence I knew something was wrong with the ""Prometheus"" storyline.

What if in the original ""Alien"" you were shown the warrior at The very beginning? In Prometheus there's a missed opportunity for a much better reveal of the space jockey later in the movie.

If the movie is about a quest to discover who created us or where we come from etc, it leaves the audience with no mystery from the outset. The audience should be going on the ride with the characters in the movie.

The opening sequence raises some serious questions.

We see the humanoid who clearly likes pumping iron in his spare time somehow spreading its DNA into a stream somewhere on earth thousands, if not millions of years ago, which suggests its by design to create a life form on earth similar to themselves?

We are then taken into the near future where a group of scientist/archaeologists find a cave drawing of our ancestors communicating with the same alien life forms, which also gives them the location of an alien port somewhere in deep space.

This suggests that the humanoids have been travelling back and forth to earth to keep an eye on human progress. So why would they give earthlings a map of how to find them if they could already travel through space themselves? And why did they create another race on another planet? And then when the other race do finally develop the technology to travel through space to find them they are extremely hostile towards them?

Here's a few key moments in ""Prometheus"" that are pointless or defy logic:

If the humanoid life forms that created the face huggers and Warriors are so intelligent surely they could have devised a better way of containing/controlling them?

The awful comic relief with the two unrealistic guys left behind in the alien craft only for one of them to appear later as some sort of crazed killing zombie? The holographic recording of the space jockey's trying to escape along with the alien head being briefly re-animated only to explode like a shot watermelon, these scenes were clearly just added to give a bit of spectacle during the slower moving parts of the movie.

The sub plot of the main protagonist ""Elizabeth"" a rather second rate Ripley and her inability to have children, only later to be secretly impregnated with some new form of face hugger, was a feeble attempt of giving the scene an emotional edge, and for her to have a good reason use that auto operational device that was introduced earlier.

How the android ""David"" can somehow decipher the alien language? He's a computer/machine, machines only work from what information humans have inputed. Up to this point the only communication humans had with the alien life forms where thousands of years ago, which at this point the English language or any language wasn't even developed?

The ageing and clearly ill Weyland hidden on board the ship with a team of experts, the two years in hypersleep almost killed the clearly healthy and young crew at the beginning? plus surely in reality he would not risk going out there until he got news that it was safe to do so, conveniently he is really old so he has nothing to lose I guess?

The wakening up of the humanoid after thousands of years of hypersleep and his immediate bursts from the cryo chamber in an energetic and aggressive rage, still with his muscular physique? I know he may be a little cranky after waking up an all but it takes me at least five minutes before I have the energy to take a pee never mind bursting into full on combat after sleeping for thousands of years.

The crew of ""Prometheus"" happily flying their ship into the Alien craft to stop it from heading to earth, absolutely no emotion or reality of any kind in that scene. Again why if the alien created us would it want to return to earth to destroy us? Then again he had witnessed how soulless and annoying we had all become ; )

The pointless battle between the new octopus face hugger and the space jockey and then the even more pointless chest buster scene, come on!! We all know the purpose of the face hugger.

Why did the android character ""David"" try to kill ""Elizabeth"" earlier and then decide to help her at the end? And the two of them flying off in the Alien craft? What the hell is she going to live on? Anyway Logic would say, lets fly this thing back to earth and warn everyone not to go anywhere near these creeps and get the Weyland corp to spend trillions on defending earth from this new found alien threat, not flying off with no weapons, supplies, recovering from a major operation and nothing but a talking head for Christ sake.

So I feel that ""Prometheus"" is just another reason for Hollywood to cash in on its past glories, knowing that there is a hunger for something new and exiting in the Alien series which this clearly failed to deliver, fortunately Ridley Scott's direction is the only thing that keeps you Stimulated for the duration.

Overall ""Prometheus"" fails with its poor script, massive plot holes and obvious plot devices,lack of tension, poor pacing/editing, its pointless need to add grandiose special effect sequences, along with its poorly developed characters and often cringe inducing dialogue, oh! and its rather generic music score.

Ultimately all this leaves me wondering how can a team of so called creative writers, producers and a class A director sit around a room and all decide that these are great ideas?","1"
"debbie-mittleman","Can't believe people liked this movie","12 October 2012","I was SO bored and SO disappointed. What a waste of a Friday evening. Nothing new in this movie that you haven't seen in Alien, and the Alien series was so much better. Where Alien was fresh and sometimes humorous, this movie was nothing but cliché with some painfully acted scenes that I suppose were expected to pass for ""drama."" If you have a shopping list to complete, you can do it during the movie, and don't look for any satisfaction at the end. I'm amazed this movie got such good ratings. What a waste of time. It was so bad. I suggest Charlize Theron not do any more Ridley Scott movies. Her character was one-dimensional and silly. The ending of the movie certainly set it up for a sequel (much like Alien) but please, Ridley, spare us. As much as you might want to re-create your Alien empire, you've failed with this. I'd rather get stabbed in the eye than watch a sequel to this movie.","1"
"steagle","Too many sci-fi nerd critics out there; Prometheus is a solid movie.","9 June 2012","I'll start by saying that sure, Prometheus can be criticized for some over-the-top, Hollywood gaffs - Elizabeth's instant c-section recovery, the Geologist Zombie Attack, the complete willingness of the Prometheus flight crew to suicide bomb a gigantic alien ship, and the often silly and seemingly random decisions people make throughout the story. Sure, all of those things are there, and if your brain is set to ""compare-this-to-classic-scifi-movies"" mode, then you'll have plenty to complain about on the IMDb forums. But for those of you who do not consider yourselves self-appointed professional critics, and will allow your imagination to run wild with this film, then I think you're in for a treat.

The most important concept in this film, to me, is the evolution of the alien DNA. We first see it in the form of a black ooze in the underground temple. After David infects Holloway with it, and Holloway has sex with Shaw, it takes on the form of a weird tentacle creature (the mixture of the original genetic material with human DNA). Then at the end, the tentacle creature DNA merges with the superhuman DNA, creating a more human-like alien. This journey from genetic ooze to what looks a lot like the creatures from the original Alien shows us that this alien DNA is so adaptive, changes so quickly, and mimics its host bodies. These are all new concepts that weren't even hinted at in the original Aliens movies.

Another interesting concept here is shown in the opening scene of the movie. A superhuman is ""dropped off"" from his spacecraft onto what we can only assume is Earth. He drinks a liquid that is contaminated with the same genetic mutation that is uncovered later in the movie on the alien planet. As he decomposes and falls into the waterfall, I'm left with the suspicion that this was an early attempt by the superhumans to infect earth with this genetic virus. Obviously it failed, which is why I think they started stockpiling thousands of canisters of the stuff to launch against Earth.

For as many interesting concepts are presented, more questions are raised than answered. Why do the superhumans want to destroy Earth? David, somehow intimately knowledgeable about these people, suggests that ""Sometimes to create, one must destroy."" So, they weren't happy with our species and wanted to try again? Possible, but no indication is given either way. Another unanswered question, of course, is what is the origin of the alien DNA? Obviously, alien creatures hunted the superhumans in the temple, as seen by the holographic flashback that David triggered near the beginning. Did aliens exist independently of the superhuman race, or was it created by them? Either way, we know that the superhumans planned to use that alien DNA as a weapon of mass destruction, but we still have no clue where it originally came from. This movie actually begs its own prequel, since nothing is really revealed about our ancestors' real history.

Ultimately, for all its flaws - which are spelled out in great detail on this site - I think Prometheus is a solid, interesting, and beautiful sci-fi film that will age well. Right now, it's so fresh, and all the comparisons to the original Aliens movies are running rampant. But give it some time and come back to it in 10 or 20 years, and I guarantee you that this will be considered a much more involved and thought provoking sci-fi than it is now. Your mileage my vary, but at least give it a shot, if nothing else for the visceral experience and a look into the pre-Alien world.","8"

There's nothing to fault in the areas where Scott is famous for excelling - cinematography, lighting, production design, the overall look and 'feel' of the worlds he's created. It's magnificent to watch. The problem comes when you start to engage the spongy thing *behind* your eyes, because the script is garbage.

It became clear that the writer (Lost's Damon Lindelof) wasn't paying attention very early on, when a character says the ship's journey took (paraphrasing) ""Two years, three months, five days, thirty-six hours."" Did we change to metric time in the future? Don't you mean ""six days, twelve hours""? And from that point on, it becomes clear that nobody cared about the story making sense.

You'd think that the people hired for a trillion-dollar mission would be the best of the best, but instead we get: an archaeologist who becomes almost suicidally depressed when he finds out that the aliens are long dead (if he wanted to meet other cultures when they were alive, maybe he should have become an anthropologist); a biologist who interprets a snake-like creature hissing, rearing up and baring its fangs as a sign of friendship; a guy in charge of mapping the site who gets lost (despite having a PDA on his arm showing the map!); a captain who abandons his post and leaves two of his charges alone in a hostile environment while he goes and has sex with his boss; and a supposedly deeply Christian person who somehow reconciles the Bible with ""God is a space alien who wants us to come visit his home planet!"" based on nothing more than ambiguous cave paintings. Add to that scientists who don't realise that just because air is breathable doesn't mean it's safe to do so (and then make a point of sniffing alien corpses and ignoring quarantine procedures), pilots who accept kamikaze suicide with a bored shrug, and someone who can only run in a straight line across an open plain even with a giant bagel rolling after her, and there is only one conclusion: these people are morons.

Because all the characters are stupid, inconsistent and/or cardboard, it's impossible to care about them. (Ironically, the only interesting character is a robot.) And if you don't care about them, why should you care about anything they experience? Not that it matters, because nothing they do experience makes sense. Take the black goo: it variously breaks down living tissue into dust within moments, turns worms into giant snakes, mutates people into contortionist zombies, makes tendrils pop out of people's eyes, impregnates women with squids and causes fully-grown not-quite-Xenomorphs to burst from ""alien"" (well, 100% human according to their DNA, despite their being blue, ten feet tall and having totally black eyes) bodies. It's not a mystery to blow the audience's mind; it's just a random MacGuffin to provide another squicky scene.

And that's the film's problem. It claims to be (and may even think it is) profound and mysterious and deep with mythic resonance, when it's really schlock with ideas above its station. It's one hour and 63 minutes of gorgeous disappointment.","5"
"Natheer","Magic Lost","22 July 2013","Ridley Scott committed a crime by going back to a masterpiece film of his own to kill its magic, there is absolutely no need to explain Alien, ambiguity is an essential part of the magic of Alien. I was shocked when i saw the reference to David Lean's Lawrence of Arabia in the film, i imagined what could happen to a magnificent classic like that if they tried to make a sequel depending on modern visual effects. Peter Weyland character is also a reference of a great classic, 2001: A Space Odyssey. except for David (Michael Fassbender) casting is a major weakens in the film. one thing i wanted to say about CGI, the modern SCI films feels like a video game, you cant differentiate between the two, compare the feeling between the 1979 Alien and Prometheus and you will get the idea.","5"
"aleph999","So bad it is even funny","2 March 2013","Was this really directed by Ridley Scott, the same guy who gave us Blade Runner (arguably one of the best 10 movies of all time), The Duellists (an underrated gem), Alien? There are three possible answers: (a) it wasn't him and he only lent his name to sell this junk; (b) it was him, but he didn't direct those previous movies; or (c) it was him, but he is just playing an epic prank on us to see how gullible and stupid we have become.

Nothing in this movie makes any sense. Dozens of plot holes and inconsistencies have been pointed out in other reviews, but I have a few more to add. The planet has no oxygen, but the crew carry WWII flamethrowers and things actually catch fire. The ultra-expensive and mysoginistic (it won't operate women) surgery machine pretends to apply anesthesy for a major surgery but the patient feels the pain all the same (and she keeps wearing the underclothes she had been wearing all along; can't have a naked woman here, can we?). The alien has the same DNA as humans despite being twice as tall. The alien breathes oxygen, but after the crash he seems to forget this and goes after the woman without a helmet.

After a while, it all gets so absurd that it becomes funny. And please, please, since 2001 (made in 1968, for God's sake) any SF movie worth its salt refrains from making spaceships roar and rumble. No air = no sound. How complicated can this be?","1"
"princessmee","What the...?","5 September 2012","So first of all, I've never seen the other Alien films, maybe that would have made a difference, but most people have told me it doesn't. Secondly, I loved LOST, so I'm not exactly against movies or shows that bring up weird questions and leave some of them unanswered.

The problem I had with Prometheus is not that it leaves questions unanswered, but that I could not relate to any of the characters, because I could not understand why they were doing the things they did.

For instance, David was supposed to be emotionless, but then he appeared to have feelings for Shaw, but then when she weirdly became pregnant with an evil alien creature (due to David feeding a bit of Alien goo to Shaw's boyfriend), he wanted to leave her that way instead of removing it..?

And then there was the biologist that was inexplicably terrified of the dead alien (so terrified he would go back to the ship with one other guy instead of sticking with the group) but wants to hug the live snake-like alien. He died. What a SHOCKER!

Really, none of the scientists acted like scientists at all. The weirdest character, for me, was Vickers. There was supposed to be some tension between her and Shaw, I suppose because she was upset her dad was spending all this money to find out the origin of human life. So of course, she decided to come along.

All along I had the idea that she was a selfish character who was looking out for her own interests. I also thought that they were building toward a big moment for her character, that she would be important, somehow. But no. Near the end of the film the pilot does a kamikaze to stop the aliens from reaching earth and she is told she can her eject her survival pod thing and it will give her some extra time. If her character was consistent, she would have taken this chance, but no, she ejects and crashes to the ground so she can run around with a spaceship tumbling towards her.

Shaw was also on the ground, and I thought it would be the climax of the tension between them, that something significant was going to happen- and then- and THEN- Vickers gets crushed like a bug.

Really? And when she died I was just mildly annoyed to find out her character was pointless. I didn't really care. Not once did I feel sad when a character died during this film (And I tend to cry very easily during sad parts of films), which says pretty much all you need to know about the characters. I didn't love them or even hate them, I was just mildly bewildered and then they died. (Except for Shaw and David's head, who go off to continue the mission, and presumably, we're supposed to wonder what happened to them, but I found I didn't really care about that either)","1"
"estebangonzalez10","One of the Best Science Fiction films I've seen in a while","17 June 2012","¨How far would you go to get your answers?¨ Prometheus is one of the best movies of the year and in my opinion one of the best science fiction films I've seen in a very long time. The visuals were incredible, the characters interesting (very strong performances from Michael Fassbender and Noomi Rapace), and the suspense was very intense. I was at the edge of my seat during most of the film and was really impressed with the movie overall. I had seen the trailer and didn't really expect much, since I've never seen the Alien films and had heard this was an Alien prequel. However, despite not seeing Alien I have to say that the film works on its own independently. I do want to go back and watch those films now because Ridley Scott did such a great job with this movie. Scott became a household name in 1979 when he directed the first Alien film which became an instant cult classic and followed it up with another great science fiction movie, Blade Runner. Since then his movies have been either hit or miss, with some great titles like Thelma and Louise, Matchstick Men, and Gladiator, and others not as good. He has directed several different genres, but there is no doubt that when it comes to science fiction he brings out the best. His latest film, Robin Hood, wasn't received very well, although I did enjoy it quite a bit, but not nearly as much as I did Prometheus. The script for this movie was written by Jon Spaihts and Damon Lindelof (the writer of my favorite TV series, Lost), and for many it was the weakest part of the film, but I did enjoy some of the dialogue and the philosophy behind it considering this is a science fiction film.

The movie takes place in the year 2089 when two archeologists, Elizabeth Shaw (Noomi Rapace) and Charlie Holloway (Logan Marshall-Green), make an important discovery in a cave somewhere in Scotland. They find ancient hieroglyphics similar to others they've found in different unconnected regions of the world from different eras and times. They automatically assume that this has to be a sign that we were created by some sort of a higher being, which they call ¨Engineers¨. The hieroglyphics consist of men signaling towards five stars that are exactly in the same position, which scientists later discover to be in a very distant galaxy with a solar system similar to our own. Elizabeth and Charlie convince a wealthy man named Peter Weyland (Guy Pearce) to finance a trip to this planet in order to search for answers about their existence. A crew of 17 members all financed by the Weyland Company travel to this distant planet on a spacecraft named Prometheus. They are put into hyper sleep during the voyage which takes more than two years, while a human like android named David (Michael Fassbender) makes sure everything is running smoothly. Once they reach their destination, David wakes everyone up. The captain of the ship is Janek (Idris Elba) and they all follow orders from Meredith Vickers (Charlize Theron) who sends the exploration crew out to find any sign of life outside and commands them not to speak to anyone until they return to the ship. The film slowly builds the suspense and tension from this point on as they end up finding something very different from what they were searching for.

There are plenty of scares and thrills in Prometheus and the tension is very well constructed, unlike recent horror films where you have hardly any build up to the story. Many people complain about the script, but I thought it was really well developed with interesting characters and situations. Michael Fassbender gives perhaps the best performance of the film with a very intriguing character who you never know whether you can trust him or not. His performance is among the best I've seen this year. Noomi Rapace also gives a very strong performance as the strong female lead role. She proved she can play these difficult roles before (from the Swedish Millennium trilogy) and she is someone to keep an eye on. Idris Elba had some small scenes, but he is always great. Charlize Theron gives a very good performance as the sort of cold and distant Vickers. You never know whether she's human or an android because of her distant nature, and there is even a joke about it in the movie. The rest of the cast was alright, but never up to par with Fassbender and Rapace. Some of the scientists do act rather immaturely, but I guess that is always a must in science fiction horror films. You always have to have those annoying characters which you don't really care for or mind having them killed off. Perhaps I enjoyed this film more than others since I haven't seen the Alien films and didn't have my expectations as high as them. I will definitely go see those movies now, and I wouldn't have a problem watching this film all over again.

As I'm watching this film, I'm seeing a crew on board a medium sized vessel that is going out to visit a mysterious planet which has funky parasites that like to go into people's stomachs. Also, on this crew there is a robot helper, a Black ship captain, and even a potential strong-minded woman like Ripley. I'm saying to myself; ""This all looks all too familiar and too much like 'Alien'"". I understand Scott directed that one as well and directors tend to have a lot of similar material among their films, but this was getting ridiculous.

I won't mention what happens, but save your money and cross this off your summer movie list. The plot is quite confusing, the characters are as dumb as mud and the lead-woman protagonist is suicidal in stupidity as she confronts the enemy head on. It gets so annoying that you find it hard to even root for anyone to survive.

"rsk-9","Simply brilliant. Stanislav Lem's ""phylosophic sci-fi"" style at it's best","5 June 2012","The sci-fi movie of the decade IMO. Multi-layered tasty plot glowing with philosophic questions such as ""robotic ""nature"" versus human nature"", ""who are we to our creators and what are their plans for us?"", ""whether all creatures want their parents die and what should parents do if so?"" as well as not so obvious questions like ""why the catastrophe on the pyramid took place around 2000 years ago"".

And it is only abstract intellectual core - on the other side we have flawlessly written & directed epic sci-fi story, with deeply emotional themes of heroism, sacrifice and glory of human nature. The only thing that confused me was alien-like creature in the ""epilogue"" (that was not needed at all to my point of view)

Nevertheless, new cult sci-fi movie emerges.

"fgh_fr_wh_fr3","Just Breathtaking...","9 June 2012","For non-ALIEN and ALIEN fans alike. This movie is absolutely stunning. Whether it is the visuals, the story, or the character performances, this movie will GRIP you and never let go until its run time is finished. Let me start with the visuals. I haven't seen such good practical work in a film for many years. The film-making industry being so heavily influenced by CGI, it's understandable. But there's always a fine line between silly practical and bad CG. Yes, it's a thin line but Ridley Scott has managed to land Prometheus right on that line because it has practical work rivaling that of ALIEN and CG that makes you wonder if it really is CG.

The cast in my opinion did an outstanding job in making their characters distinguishable from one another. Noomi Rapace should receive an Oscar nomination for her performance. Rarely do we ever see someone expressing true fear and terror in a way that doesn't make the actor/actress look silly, and this is one of those occasions. I would really describe her as a more feminine Ellen Ripley. But not at all does she steal from Ripley's character. After the movie is over, You'll always know her as Elizabeth Shaw. The rest of the cast did pretty well, namely Michael Fassbender, who plays an amazing android as David. He seems even more ambitious and inquisitive than Ash was in the original ALIEN, but in a more innocent way. Charlize Theron was pretty good, but she lacked any dialog that would make her as memorable as the rest of the cast. She still played out her role in the story well enough to give it some embellishment.

Okay, as for the story, it would be like trying to explain calculus to a fourth grader. Just go see it! And as for the people who are saying ""Come into the movie without expectations, and you'll enjoy the movie more"", yeah, ignore them. If you're coming into this movie expecting to see some form of ALIEN as I did, you will be most pleased. The only way this movie isn't a DIRECT prequel to ALIEN is the fact that there's room for a sequel to Prometheus. There's MANY questions answered in this movie regarding the metamorphosis of the ALIEN but there's also many left unanswered regarding some more or less prominent topics of the film. But I guess that's what the most likely sequel will be for. And as for people who haven't seen the original ALIEN, this movie is pretty standalone, so whether or not you choose to watch ALIEN before this is entirely up to you. Not necessarily recommended.

"tennismenace","I was not disappointed","15 June 2012","I am not a fan of creatures stalking humans, so admittedly, Alien and Aliens were not my two favorite movies to behold. I sort of was forced to watch both shows because my lovely wife really wanted to watch them, and I try to be a good husband. Did I like the movies? Sort of. I know they were both great and technically flawless for what they were, but I still didn't like the stalking part.

Now that takes me to Prometheus. I liked this movie much more than previously named movies because it really wasn't about creatures stalking humans. Sure, we had a little of that, but for the most part, that was pretty insignificant. No, this movie was much deeper. This movie was about people following their curiosities and chasing their dreams. That's what made this movie so special for me. I guess you could say, I really liked the big picture of what this movie was portraying.

Now, I've read some negative things people have had to say about Prometheus, but for the most part, they seem to be finding fault with the little things or some of the details. That is their prerogative of course, but in my opinion, it is too narrow-minded. This movie is intelligently written, and in 3D, very visual. I could also mention how convincing the two main actors were (Shaw and David), but you probably already knew that. Obviously this movie won't be loved by all, but if you haven't figured it out, I'm one happy camper. Can't wait for the sequel to see why the Humanoids did change their minds.","9"

If at any point during the movie I could have ""felt"" anything for any of the characters, I would have rated it higher. I couldn't. Charlize Theron's character...felt nothing. As events unfolded and characters met their ends, all I thought was ""meh"". There was nobody I felt was a main character. Just a bunch of random people thrown together doing...something. I just like rocks, you don't even like rocks. How you manage to throw that into an alienish movie I have no idea.","3"

It's a bit of a shambles, unfortunately Alien nostalgia isn't enough to save this films credentials. It could be forgiven if the film hadn't been built up the way it had. The human element was missing, the gut feeling which the audience connects too, the mystery of movies to make one feel was not present.

Quite spectacular at times, a sort of the 'tree of life' meets Avatar, it certainly does not deserve another film and quite frankly Ridley would know this. Character connections are an issue, not only the connection between the actors own characters and the way they interact, but the connection with us. I'd suggest to see the film on 3D and at least get some kicks out of their hard work.

"RocketeerFlyer","Sadly Not as Original or as Daring as I had Hoped...However..","1 December 2012","Many were disappointed by this film...

Those like me expecting a huge story shift from the Alien Universe and asking the bigger questions about our (human) existence such as why we were brought into existence & just who or what created The Universe & why? (The Gods that Created the Universe as was rumoured) will sadly be disappointed.

It DOES give us answers as to who created us...It was The Engineers as seen in the film (Incredibly advanced & could be seen as Gods by many of The Human Race but creators of the Universe & Everything? well sadly not it would seem, THAT FILM HAS YET TO BE MADE)

It then looks like these highly intelligent Engineers created us & a biological weapon (Alien Black Goo) which then creates havoc with the Engineers themselves.

If you go into this film knowing it's an Alien prequel plain & simple then you'll enjoy this more, although be prepared for very little Alien action as this is a Discovery / Adventure film.

HERE ARE MY MAIN PROBLEMS...

Having seen the Blu-Ray deleted / cut scenes I'm amazed at some of the decisions Ridley and the Editors made for the Final Edit of this film.

Better & more Important scenes were left out!!!

1) The Start of the movie does NOT show the rest of the Engineers observing the Engineer drinking this black goo and then sacrificing himself...the Theatrical version ONLY shows him so you don't really know if he's sacrificing himself or not really.

2) The Fifield Attack...In the Theatrical version it's OK (shows him basically in human guise with a blood shot eye and a few minor changes) in the Blu-Ray version there is a STUNNING full on Fifield Alien Monster type attack which is genuinely unsettling.

3) When the crew awaken the one remaining Engineer on the planet in the Theatrical version he more or less attacks them without so much as a word said or listening to anything they are saying...It seems like an unprovoked attack which I just couldn't understand!!! Why would a so called intelligent life-form attack them? Well if you see the Blu-Ray cut scenes you'll understand a little more why...Weyland was liking himself to the Engineers (Creating David) and was asking them for more life.

So how does David (the Android) know there are other ships? If you remember he interacts with one of their computers, although he never actually gives this information out in the film but he clearly has taken in all the information available & probably more he's not yet give up.

Although this is a prequel it is NOT THE SAME PLANET as in Alien.

I WOULD URGE PEOPLE TO READ THE ""PROMETHEUS FAQ"" in which the Opening scene is BEST described & is a truly interesting read, it can be found here... http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1446714/faq#.2.1.40

And in many respects the above article is MORE INTERESTING THAN THE FILM ITSELF.

Why Scott (for whom I have a great deal of respect & time for) & the Writers & Editors couldn't incorporate more of these interesting ideas into the script & film I really don't know.

The Bigger ideas of 'HOW OUR UNIVERSE CAME INTO BEING' are sadly not explored here, this will be for another different Science Fiction Movie or maybe even an amazing Prometheus sequel.

Just how did our Universe come into being? if there was a Big Bang then there had to be something before it to create it, in which case time existed before our Universe was created & just Who or What created our Universe? did it occur by having two Universes come togeather? Some say our Universe along with possibly countless others came from a same singularity which when it gets too heavy deposits universes (just like raindrops from clouds)

OUR UNIVERSE is EXPANDING...but into WHAT? The so called 'DARK MATTER' seems to be the stuff we can't see that surrounds most of the space between planets and galaxies left over from the BIG BANG...BUT WHAT IS THIS STUFF WE ARE EXPANDING INTO?

IF THERE is a GOD then has it/he/she ALWAYS EXISTED? If so then that's something our tiny human minds would find difficult to comprehend. Something that has ALWAYS Existed! Think about that for a moment. How can that be? and if God or whatever entity (if it was an entity?) that created all of this was somehow created or born itself then what came before it/him or she?

MINDBENDING ISN'T IT?...Sorry gone a bit off topic there.

This is still a very well made and creditable movie in the Alien Universe (a prequel) & I like the fact that it's more of a Discovery / Adventure Film (has some similarities to 2001 & 2010 in some respects which is not a bad thing) although many won't like this but in the end it was just NOT Quiet AS ORIGINAL or as DARING as I hoped it could have been.

Now that I know this I'm sure I will enjoy this film far more in the future, it is a Film i think I shall appreciate even more over the coming years (although I still can't believe what they left out, a recut version of 'Prometheus' can be expected before the hoped for sequel)

Just hoping Ridley will be more Original & Daring in that sequel.

He might just be teasing us for the upcoming onslaught of answers & ideas to come...HOPE SO.

"TheSquiss","Almost a religious experience unveiling the cause & meaning of life","17 June 2012","Prometheus, Ridley Scott's twentieth feature (I'm not including the 'announced' Untitled Blade Runner Project, nor The Counselor, which is still in pre-production) as director takes him back to the world of his second, Alien. That said, it isn't an Alien prequel. In the words of Sir Ridley himself, ""If there was a sequel to this, which there might be if the film is successful, there'll be two more of these before you even get to Alien 1."" Got that? Prometheus is most emphatically not a prequel! However For those who know their onions, it acts primarily as the backstory to the space jockey, a skeletal, petrified creature that was revealed in Alien but, much to Scott's bemusement, was never revisited or explained by the directors who followed. After watching three sequels, which reduced in quality and impact with each release, and a few related aberrations, Scott decided to jolly well deal with it himself.

But it's more than even a backstory. Prometheus is almost a religious experience, or rather an esoteric journey through the cause and meaning of life. There's a great deal more to it than simply a trek across space to kill a few villainous aliens but that's not to say you'll need to be a Mensan to understand it, although I certainly feel the need and desire to see it at least once more to benefit fully.

As one would expect, it being an Alien film and a Scott feature, the sets are astoundingly intricate and beautiful. The camera pans may be slow but they are nowhere near gradual enough to take it all in. These sets and props are the very dark brother of Tim Burton's and even now H.R. Giger's influence is strongly evident in Arthur Max's production design. Prometheus begs repeated viewings for the aesthetics alone and one wonders how much more remarkable the original Alien would have been with a vast budget and the technology available to Scott now, although I sincerely hope he doesn't 'do a Lucas' and digitally enhance it for the sake of his wallet.

If the aura that surrounds the Alien franchise isn't enough to attract an audience, the cast should certainly add weight. If you haven't already, take a few minutes to view the two virals starring Guy Pearce as Peter Weyland and Michael Fassbender as David. They aren't imperative to an understanding of the film but they are superb introductions to the characters and the world they inhabit. Charlize Theron is on coldhearted bitch duty as Meredith and as controlled and compelling as ever. Cruel as it is to say so, though the comparison is inevitable, the Ripley role is filled by Noomi Rapace, as Elizabeth Shaw, showing further versatility and contrast from the roles she is currently best known in The Girl trilogy and Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows.

The supporting cast is ably rounded out by strong turns from Idris Elba, Rafe Spall and Sean Harris who further cements his status as the 'go to guy' for cynical arsewipes you wouldn't invite to a party but would be happy to stand behind in a battle.

The biggest star, beyond the design, is Sir Ridley. He's brought together a story, a world, a cast, an entity that gels and entices. My principal criticism is also one of the attractions: it doesn't satisfy completely. I left the cinema wanting more, needing to know more. Two sequels, providing Scott shoots them himself and with the same passion and detail, are a very attractive proposition indeed. I'm not sure I understood every aspect fully and I certainly wasn't able to absorb absolutely everything painted across the screen and so this week I'll return to Cineworld for a second immersion.

I'm not sure whether my cautious four stars are unfair and if my leaning towards a fifth is justified and, either way, like my cake of the month, one portions is not sufficient!

Addendum – 14 June 2012 The second portion has just been savoured. Prometheus remains a four star film; a very solid four star. It misses out on the fifth star, a mark of near perfection, because it could have been improved on. Without giving anything away, the prosthetic body part (I'm not going to be any more specific than that in case you haven't seen it yet) is obvious. It may only appear briefly but for those few seconds it is very obviously not real. With the rest of the CG on display, I'm not sure how or why Sir Ridley allowed that one through. More than that, though, there is some very clunky dialogue written for idiots and performed without belief.

However, those moments are thankfully brief and the overall film is just shy of excellent. For me it improved with a second viewing in much the same way as my tureen of red lentil soup matures with each glug of Bordeaux and reheating experience. But I need to see it again. I need to see it in my own cinema, with a HUGE screen and the facility to pause it frequently to admire the beauty of the photography, the magnificence of the sets and the vast, exciting, intricately detailed canvas upon which Scott has painted an epic. It may not be remembered or received in the same manner and affection as his original Alien, but it is substantially more complete and utterly exquisite.","8"
"Xenokhiin","Spectacular","23 November 2014","A really good prehistory of the Alien series. The Movie reveals some ambiguities from Alien (including how the Xenomorphs have emerged).

There is not much to say about the story.

On the planet LV-223 thy found creatures inside of a mountain that are the predecessors of the later Xenomorphs and the Horror begins.

What bothers me is just something that the technique more modern is than those from Alien, after all, its a prehistory.

"Eric_Cubed","Awful, just awful","26 July 2015","This film was watchable, but it is awful, just awful, because of the massive, unrepairable and unforgivable bland and plastic grand scheme of the thing. And the stupidity, the awful, awful stupidity. In the first Alien, we are awed by the script's homage to the importance of quarantine and strict adherence to the rules and regulations of contagion protocols. Not so with Prometheus. In fact, once inside the Alien dwelling, all involved decide to take off their breathing apparatuses on a whim, and then a bit later, talk to an alien with the cooing love of a dog owner that repays their kindness by devouring them proper. There is no character development at all, the kind we loved from Alien (think of the banter between Yaphet Kotto and Harry Dean Stanton), Aliens (Ripley and Newt and Hicks, all the marines), Alien 3 (the worst of the series by far, but still awesome), Alien Resurrection (Ron Perlman and Winona). In Prometheus, we don't even get the barest sense of any kind of celluloid chemistry, just one-dimensional, puppet, soulless characters with wooden lines and robotic acting. This was the glory of the Alien series: the instantaneous and highly believable chemistry between the actors, due to a great script and great direction. After ""Chappie"" I'm afraid, very afraid of Alien 5. And as for Prometheus 2? There better be some aliens in it!!!!!!","1"

Not that the original Alien excelled in originality but, at least, it was believable (context, characters, technology); moreover, it was such a viewing experience, for the time, that it should have deterred any further use of the franchise.

Unless I read in on wikipedia, that the directors were trying to somehow link it to Aliens, i wouldn't have any idea why they have included it in the movie. I looked it up on the wikipedia to make some sense of the movie, just trying to justify the time I spent watching this movie.

"richardcant","Very disappointing","1 June 2012","From watching the trailers I was really looking forward to seeing Prometheus and now feel very disappointed - to the extent that I felt compelled to add my first ever review on here just to cathartically share my disappointment with others.

The plot, scripting and dialogue is incredibly poor. The acting isn't great, with only Michael Fassbender coming out well from this, though to be fair to the rest of the cast they were given precious little to work with. The story lacked coherence, the action lacked tension, the science lacked rigour, reason and plausibility, the characters lacked.. well character and again plausibility... etc.

In it's favour there were some pretty visuals at the beginning... and that's about it I was actually relieved when something ""scary"" happened as I couldn't have cared less for the characters and there was no tension or sense of dread so the overall effect was to give some respite from the creeping boredom and hopefully kill off one of the annoying characters.

Seriously Ridley, if this is all you've got then please just retire and stop screwing with my memories of the good films you made. Still not sure how the guy who gave us Alien trample over that great film and give us this tepid tripe.","2"
"rodriguescosta","The worst film I have seen in recent times.","21 June 2012","This is one of the worst films I have seen in recent times. Do not hold a candle to first Alien. It's just a sci-fi movie claims to be a mystic film, dominated by the ridiculous idea of looking for an origin, an answer to why we exist. Any attempt to fill this why, of course, results in a failure, fueled by the philosophy (again, The Gods Were Astronauts) that we are creations of a superior alien race and that somewhere in space would be the answer. Screenwriters: read Georges Bataille before attempting to make a film like this. It's sad to see a great director like Scott get lost in the midst of a story so naive, in which the characters are poorly developed, engulfed by tons of special effects, except for David, the android, by far the best character in the movie. However, a good character is not enough to save the movie. Why Ridley not spend his talent adapting works such as ""The Man in the High Castle"", ""Ubik"", ""Stars: my destination"" and ""Memoirs Found in a Bathtub"" for the cinema? These books need you, Ridley. Please read them and make great movies with them, not movies like ""Prometheus"".","3"

"steve49er","Enjoyable high quality 3D","10 May 2014","Not a fan of most Science Fiction movies, I found this one very well done. I saw it for two basic reasons, it starred Charize Theron and it was done in 3D. As to Charlize, the film makers wasted her talent. The role she was given was completely unnecessary and had no affect on the movie. I suppose they hired her in order to place her name in the credits. As to the 3D, it was quite good. Not a movie that used the technology for the effects to scare, it gave tremendous depth and added much to a movie done in darker toned colors. As this prequel is to have a follow up, I'm afraid it will be one that I won't watch. I doubt if Scott will spend the money to use 3D again as he will probably draw his audience with the subject matter which he's used much too often. In this film, fortunately, he kept away from those creatures until the final scenes.","9"
"anotherdamnedthing","By Scott, It's Undewhelming...Again!","7 June 2012","It certainly looks the business, all beautifully composed sleek shiny surfaces and rugged epic landscapes. Unfortunately Prometheus is dull and flat in terms script and of direction, as the majority of Scott's films are. That's not to say he can't deliver, he can, but there are more passable Ridley Scott films than visionary ones - to be fair, most directors never once deliver a film that changes the cinematic landscape while RS can lay claim to at least two, even if they were a chunk of time ago.

Prometheus is set in the same universe as Alien but it's not a direct prequel. If the Alien franchise is about the alien, in all its variations, and how humans tried to deal with it - badly - then Prometheus is about us humans. All the talk about the alien is a sideshow, it's not central to the film, and arguably the film might have been a lot more interesting if it didn't feel the need to deal with the creature.

But it does. And not in a satisfying way.

Instead of being one thing or the other, the film stumbles about and falls flat on its face. It asks the big searching questions about who we are during the first half, and in the second half it decides they don't really matter when all you're doing is trying to survive. Which is what happens when you potter off into the vast unknown in search of something with nothing but belief to defend yourself.

Alien was wound tight in terms of its minimalism, a handful of actors confined to a small place faced with a dangerous alien. Aliens took it up a notch and swapped hidden terrors for relentless battle action. Both films were strung out on tension, with the humans under siege and in danger of being wiped out.

The problem for Prometheus is that it's not tight enough to have the elegant simplicity of Alien, nor relentless enough to pull you along in a rush of excitement like Aliens. The characters and dialogue are mostly inept and shallow, there's simply too many people who have no purpose other than to be bland, mumble something inane and die. Not one character is as memorable as the crew of Alien or Aliens.

Fassbender's David is fine (Bishop was better), Rapace's Shaw is fine (Ripley was better), Theron's Vickers is fine (Burke was better), Elba's Janeck is fine (Dallas was better), and that's the problem: everything's okay up to a point, a bit above average in terms of surface gloss and celebrity heads, but with nothing that really stands out as being clever or memorable (aside from the youtube virals that preceded it). Even the few 'gory' bits are uninspired and lackluster and CGI meh - herself was completely comfortable with what was served up and she gets tense watching Harry Potter.

That it's that safe (being not in the least bit scary/thrilling) and that dumb (with a plot that leaks like a sieve when any logic is thrown at it) is hugely disappointing. That's a big problem for a franchise that once traded on thrills and spills.

6/10 is being generous.","6"

"PWNYCNY","Immensely important cinematic work of art.","12 June 2012","As much as I wanted to dismiss this movie as just some more sfx fluff, I cannot because it would not be true. This is an excellent movie which has a strong story and an excellent cast that does a great job in portraying their respective characters. This movie succeeds in keeping the audience's attention and raises some interesting questions regarding the origins of humanity. The movie's story, although science fiction, is plausible. Other planets exist in the universe and if we ever visit one of those planets, who knows what will be found? The introduction of some dangerous and bizarre life forms adds immeasurably to the story's strength, but the the best part of the movie is the performance by Michael Fassbender who plays a sinister but fascinating robot. His performance is exceptional. There is nonstop action and excitement as humans grapple with all kinds of dangers as they attempt to expand the frontiers of knowledge. The brilliance of this movie is equaled only by the immensity of the production itself. This movie is a monumental effort which cleverly combines all facets of movie-making into one supreme work of art that attempts to go way beyond the commonplace and humdrum and into areas that not only stimul8 the senses but challenge the intellect. Science fiction need not be just a bunch of flashy special effects and scary creatures. This movie injects the element of science into the story; it's more than just an updated rehash of Godzilla or Rodan. The chaos in the movie is more than just some haphazard acting-out by enraged extraterrestrials. Instead, the movie is suggesting something much deeper, more profound and infinitely more sublime. It is reaching for answers to questions that have puzzled humanity since the dawn of time. From whence did we come and to what are we going? The chemistry between the actors becomes apparent in scene after scene as fear and passion combine to produce some of the most intense dramatic scenes in the history of the sci-fi genre. The female leads are beautiful; the male leads appropriately manly and the alien creatures delightfully scary. This is a prequel to a movie that was made thirty years ago, yet there is no need to have watched the original to appreciate this contemporary story. No effort is spared to give the audience the thrills and chills that are the mark of gr8 movie-making. Hollywood deserves accolades for having produced such a wonderful movie. Charlene Theron once again proves that she is one of the premier actresses in cinema today, and Guy Pearce's rendition of an elderly man is absolutely fabulous; it's even better than Brad Pitt's rendition in Benjamin Button. 1 can only marvel at all the talent displayed in this movie; everything suggests creativity at a level that is breathtaking. One can respond with amazement at the incredible vistas of another part of the universe light years away from earth depicted in this movie. Who are the precursors of the humans? Watch this movie to find out the answer.","10"
"Foxbot","Brilliant original sci-fi Film, Nothing like Alien","8 June 2012","I just got out of the theater from seeing Prometheus in 3D. I must say I have had very high expectations of this film since I first caught wind of it. The original Alien film is by far my favorite movie of all time, it's original and brilliantly directed. The perfect blend of sci-fi and horror is exactly the type of movies love.

The idea behind Prometheus is that Ridley Scott did not want to trespass on his original masterpiece from 1979, Alien. Prometheus is a prequel yes, however it is very original and is o so careful about not overstepping it's boundaries into the Alien film series. It is extremely well done and well written with solid acting and amazing special effects. Those who are not true fans or do not know Ridley will not understand why he was so careful with this film. Of his 30+ directed movies, this is only his third sci-fi film. The others being the original Alien 1979 and Blade Runner 1982 (also, he is currently working on a new Blade Runner project).

Prometheus does start off a little slow, simply to build the tension for the remainder of the film. The cast was perfectly chosen and each character has a strong, solid personality. The special effects are quite natural and realistic looking, they did an amazing job. The last 45 minutes of the movie are very intense and it is almost too wild for your mind to keep up with. The sets and models are huge and very detailed and each shot is naturally filmed which glues your eyes to the screen.

Those who are expecting a new film just like Alien may be disappointed due to the fact that this is an entirely new story built in as a early prequel to Alien. I also could see them making a sequel to Prometheus, which would be another prequel to Alien.

For true fans, Prometheus will not disappoint. It is new, fresh and is the untold story of one of the best scI-fi films of all time. Prometheus is less horror and more of a solid sci-fi film, don't get me wrong, there are plenty of scary moments and parts which will make you jump, but it seems like it had less of a focus on the horror aspect. This is one of those movies which is very deep on many levels and you must contemplate the movie after you watch it. There is a link to religion, mostly scientology, and basic human beliefs and interactions. It was very well done, well written and brilliantly filmed. I highly recommend this film and I honestly cannot wait to see it again. By far the best movie I have seen all year.","9"
"mlaudisa","A missed opportunity for what should have been the iconic sci-fi of the decade","16 June 2012","This is a mess of a movie that uses grand visuals to make up for poor characters and incoherent story telling. It has the theological ambition of 2001, but lacks its technical perfection and absolute believability; it sets us up for another Alien-style horror, but can't keep us interested, let alone scared. Its characters are cartoonish and stereotypical, paper thin. For science fiction fans, there isn't a lot of science. For horror fans, there isn't a lot of suspense. Characters who are purported to be scientists are just not believable in the least. In typical fashion, when they announce not to touch anything, they quickly proceed to touch everything, only to later predictably regret it. The corporate stiff who's there to watch over her billion+ investment is completely uninterested in the mission, and I'm not sure what her purpose on the ship is supposed to be other than being a good looking, nasty control-freak. The captain acts like some bored truck driver dude who just wants to get laid. The android is the only redeeming feature, but that's just not enough to save this mess. Many of the scenes in the 2nd half of the movie have been done before, and the whole thing smacks of just a setup for the next movie. There is no depth, no tension, no story, no pathos to this movie: it's a lot of eye candy, but we have seen a lot of this stuff before, and little seems truly original. This was an opportunity for the next iconic science fiction movie of the decade, and it misses badly. Goes to show that no matter the quality of the effects, the grandeur of the vision, or the money spent on actors and sets, without a great story it's just another forgettable McMovie, empty calories. Shame on you, Mr. Scott, you know better.","4"
"jorshansky","Ridiculous","10 June 2012","My very first words were when I came out of the movie theater, ""Ridley Scott is a jackass"". My son said something similar but slightly more colorful, and for the sake of decency I am not going to repeat it. Buy you get the gist of it. We both didn't like the movie.

Was that too harsh of a critique? Perhaps. But you see, both my son and I were very angry because we both loved Blade Runner for being so thought provoking, and we also loved Alien for being so incredibly suspenseful. Prometheus could have been like those movies. It could have been so much more than it was. But no, just like Gladiator, Ridley Scott had to make yet another corny predictable and not very suspenseful flick.

Now, I have to give credit where credit is due. Visually, Prometheus was a stunning piece of work. It was stylish, perfectly paced, and with beautiful graphics, cool technology, and non-intrusive 3D. Even acting was good, although none of the characters (except for the robot) were well developed.

But when it comes to the content of the movie, it is a total dud. Questions are asked and either not answered, or answered, but hastily, like captain explaining the whole alien situation in less than 30 seconds. People who only minutes ago were terrified at being inside the alien ship now see the snake like alien creature and instead of running away from it screaming in horror they try to pet the critter as if it is some cute and cuddly little kitten. And that ending, oh, that stupid ending with the last surviving character signing off in exactly the same way as Ripley did in the first Alien movie. What a cliché.

I normally try not to critique people's work because I understand that everyone needs to earn a living or maybe just try to stay active in the artistic community. I believe that this world has plenty of room for both the artist and the hack. But I still get very angry when I see someone who was able to give us such blockbusters as Blade Runner and Alien, come up with pretentious 200 million dollar crap like Gladiator or Prometheus.

It's a hack work, a sell off, a music video, an eye candy, beautiful and artistic, but only good enough for 3 minutes of viewing.

I will watch Prometheus again when it comes out on cable and I will try to see if maybe I had missed something. But for now, I am very disappointed.

"accountcrapper","Craft and Style but no Substance","8 June 2012","The movie is a good blockbuster. I did enjoy the movie. I saw it in 3D on a 70FT screen and it really does have a mood. It's all there - the bio goo, the Geiger backdrop, robots in the uncanny valley. As much as I enjoy escapism and the cinema of sensation there are 3 major flaws that show themselves at least every 3 or 4 minutes destroying any ability to lose yourself in the world Ridley has created.

The first is a visual flaw. Some of the shots were clearly there for the 3D experience but too many of them exist outside the reality of the story and you are shown a shot that has no relevance to anything other than the technique of 3D. This highlights the technical fabrication of cinema and so destroys the illusion of reality. You know you are watching a technique and it is so clumsy and ill fitting to the story that it breaks the spell. Still as an experiment in 3D I can forgive this and some of the 3D is stunning.

The second flaw is the countless and seemingly endless plot holes or parts that are just weakly scripted. Again they are so frequent they destroy the reality and illusion of the film. They really are outrageously bad in parts. You think OK it is Hollywood just eat your popcorn and keep watching but you expect more and are given less and so you are let down.

The final and fatal flaw is in the characterization. The characterization is patchy and haphazard - with some characters seeming to exist in different films types. You are not sure who you are supposed to root for as there is no strong lead and as a result you do not care about any of them meaning there can never be any tension no matter how loud and staccato the music gets or how gory a scene becomes. You just do not care. If there is no lead you should then fall back on a great ensemble but again the characters do not gel. They never come together as a team. They are not believable as humans or as characters. This is not a reflection on the acting but rather the characterization and script development.

I enjoyed the film, the visuals, the experience of 3D, the extension of the Alien universe - I just wish it was a better story with more believable characters. The fact that one of the 3 flaws I noted shows itself at least every 3 or 4 minutes really makes it difficult to let the film carry you away to it's world. Too much technique not enough heart.","7"
"neil-476","Yes of course it's a prequel","8 June 2012","I must state at the start that this review contains spoilers. That is because of the absurd claim in the early days of this movie that it is not a prequel to Ridley Scott's 1979 movie Alien. Of course it's a prequel - it sets up the scene where the Nostromo exploratory party discover the ""sky pilot"" in the alien ship, for a start off. To say it's not a prequel is ridiculous.

This movie starts with a very striking and mysterious scene following which it switches to scientist Noomie Rapace who, it turns out, has discovered a clue to the secret of where human beings originally came from, which leads mega-rich (and dying) Guy Pearce to fund a mission to the point in space indicated by the clue. The crew of 17 includes Rapace and her bloke, Charlize Theron in charge, and Michael Fassbender as the android assistant of Pearce's character.

I was disappointed in Alien back in 1979. After all the hype, I found the first hour slow and boring and the second hour a standard monster in haunted house / last man standing yarn in a spaceship setting. Prometheus, I am glad to see, while referencing many of the moments in Alien which were fan favourites, is a much more consistently entertaining ride, and very much its own thing rather than just a reprise. The visuals are terrific, there is a fair amount of gory and revolting stuff, and it's quite a good story (albeit the philosophical issues are ditched eventually in favour of blowing sh*t up). Some surprises are revealed along the way.

It's not perfect. There are elements of character set up which are never used, and there is at least one misplaced laugh moment, like the one in the original when the Muppet baby alien skitters across the floor, taking all the steam out of the otherwise shocking chestburster sequence. If I just say ""staples"" and say that everyone in the cinema burst out laughing... And - big spoiler coming up - after setting up the sky pilot, who was it in the lifeboat grappling with Noomie Rapace's hitcher, and how did the sky pilot's chest burster happen? Or was that a different craft (it was established that there were others)? And how did the android know that? Perhaps not all questions were answered after all.

But this was a good, entertaining, horror oriented science fiction movie.

There were times when the 3D was stunning but, overall, it wasn't essential.

I am adding these comments after a second viewing. It is clear on second viewing that the Engineer spacecraft seen in this film is NOT the same one seen in Alien: to that extent, there is no direct link between the films.

The music and eye candy are terrific.

And the film is full to overflowing with illogicalities, inconsistencies, matters unexplained which need explaining, and downright errors (nearly all of which have been covered in other reviews, although I can't recall anything mentioning the disembodied head gurgling despite having no lungs with which to propel a gurgle upwards). It is as if the filmmakers have devoted so much effort to imparting Significance, Art, and Meaningful Subtext to the piece that no-one had any time to go over the script for fundamental c*ck-ups. How come the storm blows away the scooter and not Shaw? Is she heavier than a piece of machinery?

The more I think about this film, the more it annoys me.","8"
"SonOfSalem","Beautiful visuals almost wasted on uninspiring writing and poor characterization","14 June 2012","If you are visually orientated and /or a fan of Ridley Scott, or Micheal Fassbender go see it now. Go. If however you like a bit more kick from your drug of choice, you might end up leaving the cinema with no more than a slight buzz..

Personally, I found the writing and structuring to be pretty bad. It feels like a rushed lukewarm patchwork of a plot, held together by largely disinterested actors. And I don't blame them. Micheal Fassbender does indeed stand out, and I am a big fan of his. His portrayal of the tragic Bobby Sands was both moving and visceral, and I always get a strong sense of professionalism from him; a kind of controlled efficiency that may or may not have helped land him the part of David.

Idris Elba, another excellent actor, capable of deep intensity, who has had two seasons of the British detective TV show Luther under his belt, completely wasted and unchallenged by his cookie cutter role as captain Janek, bewilderingly sporting a fake American drawl that took with it, the last chance for his character having any kind of possibility for the expression of depth, facilitated by his tough East London accent.

I thought Noomi Rapace was very good and stood out, but nothing like her form in The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo trilogy. When she is more comfortable with English speaking roles, I think her confidence and self expression will make her shine once more.

The characterization as mentioned above, sometimes slapped logic, feasibility and believability right in the nut-sack almost from the get go. I just felt very little for them and it barley changed for me all the way through the movie. So why am I so hard on this? It is just a movie right? It's because I don't like snake oil salesmen; they are far too numerous in my opinion and I certainly don't approve of one of my favorite directors working in their employ. Prometheus has been touted to be something it very much is not, what with the hyped deep philosophical nature of its subject matter, mass marketing, like Guy Pierce doing the Ted Talk, and clever trailer manipulation, (* but all movies do ""the pitch""*) yet it fails to even come close to living up to said hype.

Instead, what we get is stilted dialogue dressed in all these metaphorical/pseudo intellectual fortune cookie snippets of wisdom and weak introspection tacked onto weird episodic structuring that sometimes, folds back on itself rather unnecessarily lending a feeling of repetition that keeps reemerging during the movie,(remind you of ""Lost"" anyone?).

And then there is the science...

In conclusion, If you are a fan of hard sci-fi from the likes of Ian. M. Banks or Isaac Asimov, Sagan or Clark you may be more critical and less forgiving than most. My rant about the writing is fuelled by my love of this hard sci-fi that unfortunately, I thought this was going to be. So it's probably my fault.

"etheesdad","very average sci fi","24 September 2012","I was looking forward to seeing Prometheus, being a big fan of Ridley Scott and, particularly of the Alien series.

The production values of this film are superb (big budget, fantastic special effects). If thats what you are looking for, you won't be disappointed.

The thing that really frustrated me is that Prometneus is like a remake of the first Alien movie. I won't get into plot spoilers, but the parallels are consistent throughout the film, and so much of the earlier film's content is 'borrowed' here, its difficult to watch this as a film in its own right.

Not sure why it was so derivative. The basic story line (creation myths, the question of where humanity came from and why we exist) lends itself to all sorts of interesting possibilities that the sci-fi format would have been ideal to explore.

The main intention seems to have been to explore the origins of 'Alien', which in-and-of-itself, also, could have made for very interesting viewing. Pairing this with the creation question leaves enormous scope for developing fresh ideas and some interesting cinematic experience.

What has been done here is, though, to have taken some of the core content from Alien, and to deliver it to a new generation of cinema-goers. Its been 30+ years since it was made. I think the writers were banking on the majority of the audience having not seen the original - there is so much content reproduced here its hard to understand it differently.

My suggestion if you haven't seen this film, is to watch without looking for anything new.

So much is replicated here that the end result is quite banal, and will disappoint viewers looking for interesting or fresh content.

As a formulaic sci-fi romp though, its a couple of hours of reasonable escapism.","5"
"urkus","Much more than I expected","1 September 2012","I'm a big fan of the Alien series. My favorite, of course, is the first one. Then the second, then third and finally the fourth one, which I think it's the worst one (6 out of 10). So I went to the cinema without any expectations, prepared to watch a bad movie. Credits started, and I was first impressed by the music, then the visuals with all of those rocky mountains and gray colored landscapes, were absorbing. Finally, that strange ""creature"" appeared. A bit shocking beginning I must say. Good start.

Then the screenplay goes into a bit stupidity talking about the paintings found on a cove in the Scottish island of Skye. (Great location, I must say). I started to get a little bit upset, but only 5 minutes later the sequence of the robot David inside the spaceship ""Prometheus"" let me trust in the movie.

The arrival to the planet and the new mysteries that where hiding there, were a very good reason to sit for two hours watching this entertainment.

Ridley SCOTT directed his best movie ever (a bit better than ""Blade Runner"" I think) in 1979. He took us inside this claustrophobic Spaceship named ""Nostromo"" and play with the audience for 2 hours. That strange planet, those killed extraterrestrials from an unknown origin and finally all of those eggs, containing the Alien. Great work of art; 10 out of 10!! I wasn't expecting here even to get a 5 out of 10, but surprisingly I found it a really interesting and exciting movie, with non-stop action, some scary moments and nice acting.

The only things that I didn't like where some details in the plot, like those prehistoric paintings, the appearance of that ""ultra-old"" Peter WEYLAND (¿?¿?¿?) or the relation between the two geologists. The characters are typical from these type of movie, some of them like the captain of the ship that reminds me about Yaphet KOTTO's character in ""Alien"". Sigourney WEAVER is like Charlize THERON in some way, and Noomi RAPACE in another. Michael FASSBENDER is not even next to Ian HOLMS character, but he is a nice actor and does a fine job. Those are some similarities that I can find with the original film ""Alien"".

Talking about the visuals I must say that they are excellent. The ""silicone"" extraterrestrial, the transformation of Charlie HOLLOWAY (one of my favorite moments), the final sequence with the alien spaceship falling down (great moment, great H.R. GIGER design), the final presentation of the Alien (I supposed that it is a Queen Alien...)the cinematography... so I think that this is a movie that you must watch on theaters.

"tobiasbelliard","Retarded Film","2 December 2012","Few words: This is one of the most incoherent pieces of filmmaking I have ever seen, with the laziest execution of writing, the most ambitious special effects (which are the only good thing about the film), and a visual masturbation from Ridley Scott, trying to feed us mystery and ""answers"" to the great questions of the universe. A failed attempt that only works on minds drugged by their love to the ""Alien"" series or people who don't really think much. Riddley Scott was trying to make an epic space horror film, touching on deep subjects of human nature. Acting is good, it's amazing that they were able to say the lines that most of the time make no sense, either the actors trusted that Riddley Scott wasn't retarded or they really just wanted to get paid and go home. Did no one on the set ever say: ""Mr, Scott, I respect you but this script makes absolutely no sense and we are being extremely retarded and incoherent""",NA

"claszdsburrogato","Prometheus (2012) Reviving the franchise","11 September 2023","After the second film in the Alien franchise, fans were ""presented"" with mediocre and bad films. Launching a prequel to this franchise didn't seem like such a good idea, but the result was positive. This film is not perfect nor is it great, but it has some fun moments and visually it is better than the previous ones. You don't need to watch any other film to understand this story, in fact the relationships with the original story are almost nil. The big problem is in the writing of the story and characters, which end up taking away some points from the film. The entire look is wonderful, it is beautiful to see the scenes on this planet, however, everything that is developed in the meantime ends up being boring and uninteresting. Some dialogues are forced to create a relationship between characters that are not interesting. It could be a much better film if more investment was made in the script, but it is still the third best in the franchise (Which doesn't mean much given the history of previous productions).","6"
"TD_Diamond","Pity... Could have been brilliant","2 January 2020","What the hell happened here? As soon as the first scientist takes their helmet off early on in the movie, breaking what even most lay-people would understand as a breach of standard protocol, this movie is done because it makes the rest of the plot implausible and the characters questionable. Similar events after this sees the viewer beggaring belief as to the child-like stupidity of the screenplay. The viewer then has to sit through exactly what they didn't come for - the line that when crossed sees sci-fi become ludicrous, almost unwatchable, cheapish nonsense. I fell asleep in the first half hour. I've since watched it on the small screen and can't help but think that with a few edits and tidy-ups on the screenplay this movie would be worth the watch. Instead it relies heavily on the value of sub-plots, which actually are integrated quite well into the main story, and blisteringly good CGI trickery. Knock yourself out...","3"
"lmalone25","So pretty but no substance","16 June 2012","Overall just an average movie. It was beautiful and I was entertained at times however the script was so bad that I was frustrated and annoyed. I feel like Scott sold us short. He thought by pulling out all the bells and whistles visually, the viewers would be too dumb to notice the lack of character development and how the characters' action were completely ignorant and unbelievable. I could go on and on with examples of that but others have already done so. I blame Lindelof for ruining yet another script (he ruined the Lost series) and I blame Scott for letting him do it. I really thought Scott would show Alien the respect it deserved since it is what put him on the map. Instead he p!$$3d on it.","4"

"ElessarAndurilS","Good prequel to Alien franchise","5 September 2014","I like Prometheus because it stands on its own as a good Science Fiction Movie while serving as a pseudo prequel to the Aliens movies it is independent enough to be an independent story but has enough hooks to make one pickup on things that are definite ties to the Alien story and then some that are ambiguous ties. Those unknown elements are what makes me like the writing the most as it makes me want a series of these movies to more closely tie the story to the origin of the Engineers, purpose in creating the species at the heart of alien and give us that historical link to a more current history that distant future portrayed in both this movie and then Alien. There were questions, this movie served to fill in some but add even more, more tangible ones while at the same time being entertaining all in and of itself. So a great combination of entertainment standing alone with a awakened interest in the links to ourselves, aliens, robotics. and the whole interest so covert bot obvious in Alena franchise. I hear there will be another and am interested if the path of chasing the ""Engineers"" is followed or the development of the Alien and their purpose, and hopefully both. Though I fear chasing the Engineer path will lead to disappointment as it leads to infinite complexity and God. Yet I enjoyed Prometheus more on subsequent viewings than I did the first as subtle points I missed were caught. I hope future movies are still good stand alone stories while further revealing answers and now sowing more questions for the sake of making more movies. There is obviously a tie between our own creation and that of the alien species, or at least tie in our history. It will be fun to watch!!!","8"
"elianateixeira19","What i expected!","8 June 2012","The Prometheus was exactly what i expected. A set of answers. My expectations we're not an action movie with intense terror or evil, but a search of issues that i've always kept along the Alien saga. However, a set of responses, but also new issues with the touch of suspicion for movie sequel. Apart from the flaws of the casting (apart from the Elba, Fassbender and Harris that should have been more used), the fact of not knowing if I do not like Shaw or i like Rippley too much, and too many cut scenes that should have appeared (come on DVD, i see them all), my opinion after this film is as follows: if you not an Alien fan, do not see Prometheus, it makes no sense. If you are an fan, remember that this is no battle to overcome the first Alien, because it is impossible to overcome a masterpiece. And if you see, get answers, delight with the set, ask for Ridley Scott to bring a second Prometheus with the errors corrected, and more sets even more spectacular, and then go see the first Alien because masterpieces are to be reviewed whenever possible and never forget. And quoting David: How far would you go to get your answers?","8"
"Richie-67-485852","I am PRO-Prometheus","9 June 2012","It entertained me is the first thing I want to point out. Then, it got right to the movie point and continued forward movement until the action doubled and then tripled. I have questions, but nothing that stops me from exploring and searching for answers and if no ready answers come, I am okay with that too. You see good sci-fi does that to you and every sci-fi fan knows this. It makes you think and for people who don't like to think, it is annoying. Now, as to what is going on, these beings have advanced to the point where they can seed life forms, planets and...? But no one knows the outcome of the seeding until after the results come in. Don't we cross breed and seed all the time coming up with strange combinations and even things that have immunity to bacteria? I believe that they landed on some planet in the beginning (earth?) and wanted to see how they would react in an earth environment after drinking the goo. The earth was so ready to give birth to an overwhelming amount of species that the goo in the engineer imploded. I don't think he planned his suicide. Now, when the goo interacts with humans, it does different things as we saw. When it is transfered from sperm to egg, it does even more different things as well. I believe these intelligent creatures realized and discovered that the fatal mixing involving humans and goo leads to a creature that eventually threatens the engineers to a possible extinction. One does over take an engineer successfully and the results is a form of Alien which we come to know as one heck of a deadly creature. I don't believe those can be contained or controlled. This would explain why the engineer who woke up started killing off everyone. He knew a successful infection with these humans would produce a deadly mutation and eventually infect their own race. Thus he started killing off the humans eliminating the problem in the very moment and then activating the original mission to go back to earth and destroy the rest of the planet. Going back to kill off everyone on earth now makes sense. The engineers originally planned to wipe out earth earlier, but a fatal accident took place as the holographs depict. The whole planet is a potential threat if the goo is ingested. One can easily understand why the engineers experimented with this stuff away from home too. You don't get a second chance and the stuff has so many outcomes too. That is what this movie proved when humans played with it. If they did this on earth, it would be disastrous. As to the making of this movie; When someone puts up the money, they call the shots. Even Theron's character says that in the movie. Consequently if I made the movie, it would be done as I see it and flack for me would follow. Same for anyone. So what we are left with is to just enjoy someones version of this story. Ridley Scott can deliver a movie and he did just that. Bravo. Remember, I started out by saying that it was entertaining. Money well spent too. I do recommend IMAX for speakers and picture quality. Why not treat yourself? The 3D is just okay and some scenes take advantage of it. A couple of times I took my glasses off and enjoyed the film no problem. BTW...I disagree with the survivors not going back to earth. They now have an Engineers ship and can always go anywhere they want. First, get home and duplicate the ship and its technology too. Then, go wherever you want. I will insert a thought here. The surviving woman knows that goo mixed with sperm can kill these engineers. Her traveling to their planet is the equivalent of them traveling to ours. Everyone is at risk. But, that story belongs in the next move. That being said, wherever they end up going and doing has got to be worth the price of a ticket. Don't you see? Take one mystery. Add a space ship to it. Add the possibility of life elsewhere and we are off to a decent story again. The formula works so well. What is out there? What does it look like? Why? There is no end when you use this formula. The 1950's sci-fi movies milked it and so did Star Trek, Star Wars etc....Strongly recommend popcorn, candy, fruit, snacks, something tasty to drink and suspend all beliefs for the 2 hours please....","8"

People complaining ""It doesn't answer questions"" don't understand the movie. The search for the creator and answers to the meaning of life ARE CHARACTER MOTIVATIONS not questions the movie is promising to answer. I also disagree the plot is thin or unbelievable. It is as believable as Alien or more so. The movie was satisfying to me from beginning to end, which is all you can ever ask from any work. Lastly it is definitely a prequel to Alien and IMO Scott is going down the Lucas road and I think we are going to see several more installments in the way of Alien prequels from the PROMETHEUS jump off point. I recommend seeing this movie, and I'm so glad I saw it in the theater. Don't go with preconceived notions or demands and just watch it for what it is and my bet is you'll be glad you went!","8"

Really like the first 1/2 of the movie and not really like most of the action sequences except the medipod and what happened to the 2 left behinds. And nice the entire story is not a direct link to original Alien and can span else where. (like the announced Prometheus 2) Plot, tech, and protocol holes aside (this is a given for all sci-fi), the writing even some of the action sequences feels like the whole thing is still in 3/4 ""draft mode"". For example, the ending action sequence with the Engineer feels better paced in the extended scene.

The storyline is again too point to point to my taste, and ""everyone"" has an agenda OR has a body-counter slasher dying scene to take up time and character space. It didn't dwell like Alien of Blade Runner where it meandered and took long breaths. Would have like to linger more on processes of discovery, taking time on the planet, slowly finding out more intricacies, like the genetics, some secret meaning behind the technology...etc But I guess that would be no action, and have to eliminate the Guy Pierce character.

Albeit the last sequence when the jokey machine gets going it was pretty good. On the other hand when the large C shape ship crashed ..it was really lucking it didn't kill both of the tiny humans on the ground ????

Is it that they fear if pace is too slow it will drive away younger audience and lessen the pie to divide ? Counter example of pace would be Drive, which to me played much to the pace of Alien.

"g-young77","Mostly disappointing... Mostly.","12 June 2012","I had hoped that Ridley Scott's ""Prometheus"" would inject some classic Sci-Fi competence into a genre that has largely forgotten how to tell a story, but it mostly didn't. Mostly.

""Prometheus"" is visually impressive; the set design, camera work, lighting, and visual/special effects are all great to look at. The premise is intriguing, and the diverse cast of characters could've taken the story in any number of directions. The direction it chose though, is a scattershot of sequences chosen for their visual impressiveness rather than any kind of character development, plot cohesion, or logic.

Characters routinely possess knowledge gained seemingly through clairvoyance, or act contrarily to previously stated motivations. I often found myself wondering, 'if they're trying to achieve this, then why are they doing that?' Or, 'how do they know what the other guy is planning to do?' Or 'why sprint 100 yards from danger when safety clearly lies a few steps to the left?' The answer of course, is that these are all reasons to insert CGI-driven action scenes which wouldn't have otherwise been necessary.

In the end I didn't care who lived or died, or won or lost - and none of the characters seemed to care either. As others have noted, it seems as if a solid hour of footage that would've filled the numerous plot holes was left on the cutting-room floor.","3"
"derekmgb","Nice Face Shame About the Plot","16 June 2012","When we enter a Movie Theatre we buy into the collective suspension of disbelief required to enjoy a film not least because we've just parted with some 'hard earned' for a seat and overpriced popcorn/drink etc.

However in doing so we trust the director to treat us with respect and intelligence by taking care of all the details, both visual and narrative, to build a convincing and immersive experience and if this is done really well we forget we are watching flickering images and believe we have an all-seeing eye into another world. Two fantastic examples in the Sci-fi genre would be Alien and Blade Runner, the latter actually attaining the level of Art in my humble opinion, never mind a damn good sci-fi pic.

The thing is, these two movies were based on stories not written by Ridley Scott, unlike Prometheus, which was cooked up by the director aided by some colleagues... and here lies the problem.

An author, whose sole aim is to create a story/idea and develop it, of course, through the medium of the written word, would spend months - years even - perfecting the plot and characters whereas a film director is essentially a visual artist. You follow my drift.

Ridley is a great director and the visual scope of Prometheus displays his talent... but he ain't a writer and the Hollywood goons that pulled him down this path make movies with dollar signs in their otherwise blank eyes.

I'm thinking a build up to the mission with a nod to CONTACT and a journey with a wink to 2001 etc etc.

""Plan 9 from Outer Space ""compared to ""Prometheus"" is gold, a masterpiece.

The dialog in this atrocity is mindboggling moronic.

Characters behave like teenagers in those slasher films where dumb-and-dumber is the modus operandi. And all of them are embarrassingly annoying cretins.

Professional scientists behaving like brain-dead imbeciles from the very beginning of the film. For instance, the ""biologist"" playing with the snake-like creature as if it was a puppy is beyond belief....and one must assume that these half-witted clowns were supposedly chosen for this mission because of their skills.

People do things that make no sense at all: The head scene. The flirting scene (Idris and Charlize). The messroom scene with the abrasive geologist. The sex-love scene between the ""archeologists""...etc.

The pseudo-philosophy in Prometheus is at the level of preschoolers who haven't been potty-trained.

The only positive are the visuals, but this is not enough to carry the story for too long.

"squeezebox","The most expensive low budget Alien rip off ever made","12 October 2012","Prometheus is the most expensive low budget Alien rip-off ever made. It's nothing more than Galaxy of Terror or Forbidden World, only with 100 times their budget. I found this movie to be an entertaining piece of blood-drenched schlock disguised as a science fiction epic.

While it has been promoted to some extent as a prequel to Alien, it never seems to be that, if only because the technology on display is far and away more advanced than what is available in the first four Alien movies. It seems just as likely to me that the movie is actually a sequel, taking place decades after the events of the original ""quadrilogy."" Regardless, my feeling is that Ridley Scott wanted to make another Alien-like movie and did not want to be accused of ripping himself off, therefore added a few ambiguous nods to the original movie to make this at the very least a companion piece to the Alien series.

While there are plenty of the metaphysical ideas introduced in Alien 3 and Alien Resurrection floating around, and while the movie tackles some heavy philosophical themes regarding our origins (not a particularly original concept), it's obvious that Scott's intention is to create a gory freak show, with enough slime, blood, mayhem and creepy crawlies for a dozen horror movies.

That may sound like a criticism, but it isn't. Prometheus is a rich, fast-paced and intriguing thriller and is as entertaining, intense and scary as any other horror movie I've seen in recent years. It just isn't as deep as it's makers would have you believe.","7"
"richard_heys-757-149700","A Good Watch","5 August 2013","Now then this is the first review I will be putting up for a film and the reason I am even writing this review is due to all the negative reviews that appeared under here for so long it actually put me off watching it until last night and not going to the cinema to watch it.

I actually made a IMDb account to write this review as it certainly does not deserve ""one star"" or three stars as many reviewers have given it people seem to be so quick to bash this movie based on there knowledge of how the universe should work e.g.

*Spoiler* One of the characters removes his helmet rather quickly after finding out the air was breathable a few reviews immediately bashed this with ""he doesn't have a clue as to foreign bodies in the air!"" seriously, they make it seem like he does it and everyone is okay with it, no everyone was telling him not to do it, but he went ahead anyway almost like a leap of faith which is the continuous theme throughout this movie.

The characters were decent and interesting enough not a huge amount of development on them but yet again this is another point people dwell on, go back to the original Alien movie and tell me how much development was in there.

The acting was good again people bash in the reactions of the characters *Spoiler* the man with the cobra thing in front of him just earlier freaks out and wants to head back to the ship but when confronted by the cobra puts his hand near it several times he even says the line ""its mesmerised"" so he thinks the cobra is safe to go near plus with his suit he probably thinks it is safe to go near it. Honestly when this scene came up I didn't even think about it as being ""implausable"" he was not acting out of character he was a biologist, not only that, the whole scene with the cobra was a nod at the first alien movie when they first encounter the face hugger, its ability to squeeze tightly when its threatened to be removed, acid for blood etc.

The writing was good also, nothing spectacular but not bad writing either as everyone again is so quick to bash seriously again go back to the original Alien and tell me how good the writing really is in that movie, even in Aliens one of my all time favourites which has so many memorable lines the writing was good the writing in this was good but not amazing.

This film is not a bad film as its made out to be and because all these reviews on here I went ahead and chose not to watch it and I wish I did watch it sooner, the cast is interesting and has important characters but again go back to the first alien how many characters were memorable and that amount goes down fast, the acting is good as previously mentioned maybe one or two overreactions, the same happens in the first alien movie. The special effects are very nice as are the practical effects its nice to see in a modern film an attempt to use these practical animatronics as often as possible. The film is suppose to be an origin story of the space jockey and in that I believe this film succeeds and throws a good twist in there whilst doing so and showing what the Aliens were to begin with consider the cobra a MK1 version of the facehugger and the large squid at the end, a MK2 version. The film also has its own agendas which is to deal with creationism in a strange way it almost takes what creationists take with the god idea of ""meeting our maker"" and makes it not a god but a human who is using humanity almost as an experiment.

Thats my final point people saying ""why did they create us and now why are they getting rid of us?"" seriously they make it seem like that isn't raised in the movie, it is, not only that its left to the audience to decide why, could it just be an experiment?

This film is certainly not without its flaws however one of the main ones I realised was the Prometheus ship itself *Spoiler* when crashing into the Engineers ship you saw wreckage bouncing around everywhere and also the people that the Engineer killed surely when in the original Alien and even in Aliens these would be found in those movies some remnants would be there? not a problem to me however its a movie I enjoyed it for what it was a origin story of the space jockey and the aliens reason for existing, a biological weapon good idea.","8"

I must state that I have watched all the Alien movies and I LOVE them. I expected a proper Alien prequel with this one, but this movie has too many differences, and lacks, to be anything near an Alien prequel! It's not even worth watching if you have an expectancy like I had. If you decide to watch it, enjoy it for what it in reality is; NOT an alien prequel, but perhaps a alien prequel in a different dimension. Or a ripoff of what the real prequel should have been like. In my head it does not deserve the credit it, for whatever reason, has received.","1"
"erolsabadosh","Ambitous yet muddled prequel fails to deliver","9 June 2012","Riddled with plot holes and sorely lacking in suspense this Alien prequel from the director who started the franchise with writer Dan O'Bannon back in 1979 shamelessly exploits the original mythology for what is ultimately a highly flawed and frustrating to watch sci-fi thriller.

Taking the mystery of the previously unexplained creature discovered by the crew of the Nostromo, piloted by the charismatic and now legendary character Ripley, prior to their exposure to the famous Xenomorph that picks them off one by one, Prometheus creates a back-story for this bizarre entity, once dubbed the Space-Jockey and now referred to as an Engineer. Set 100 years before the original Alien took place, Noomi Rapace steps into the central protagonist role this time around as Dr Shaw, a scientist who believes that the answer to the meaning of human life lies with these advanced beings after discovering ancient cave drawings referring to a distant galaxy where the Engineers seem to have travelled from to visit Earth millions of years ago. Cue a lengthy mission statement from Charlize Theron as Meredith Vickers, an employee of the fictional Weyland Yutani corporation that is spearheading and funding the mission, the true reason for which is revealed later, and Weyland himself, oddly played by Guy Pearce in aged prosthetics and make-up. Much time is spent between the crew bickering and debating ethics and morality and the should they/shouldn't they nature of the expedition and once the film picks up interest it's lost yet again due to more banal theologizing and philosophising which comes across as a failed attempt to inject deeper meaning into what is a rather simple plot that doesn't really beg to be dwelt on.

Prometheus suffers from a disjointed and muddled narrative that crams so many different potential threads into 124 minutes but never fully follows through with any of them, apart from perhaps the existential quandary facing multiple characters that arises and is summed up with one line of dialogue that fittingly surmises the film itself; ""there is nothing"". As if to distract us from the banality of the characters and script Scott goes to town on the visuals with some truly breathtaking imagery, the only trouble is that the initial awe is hardly replenished due to the fact that the whole thing is set in one general location with only the crew's ship, the Engineer's structure and the planet surface as sets, and whereas Alien used the confines of the industrial ship to claustrophobic effect Scott here tries constantly to mine as much grandeur from these locations that it becomes tedious.

To demystify the mystique which lent Alien so much atmosphere and boosted its terrifying impact I would argue that there should be a worthy reason to do so and at no point in Prometheus did I feel that the weight of the story and concept was fully realized. In fact most of the major occurrences in the film come and go so quickly and often inconsequentially that you start to feel as if you are watching a show reel of high tech special effects sequences with no narrative continuity. Alien kept you on the edge of your seat due to what you didn't see, and the power of the imagination was provoked to startling effect, whereas with Prometheus Scott shines the brightest light he can find onto the story and shows us too much of the locations, creatures and dwells heavily on the concepts and ideas raised while eschewing emotion, suspense, horror and feeling.

You could argue that this is a standalone film and that it should be judged on its own merit but even so it still boils down to being a spectacle-driven film conceived as something more intellectual that fails to reach its own ambition. To not compare it to previous Alien films is impossible due to the fact that it borrows so heavily and directly from each one. Human-alien pregnancy, hybrid mutations, chest-bursting, rape subtext, androids and of course the alien itself, I don't criticize them for taking some of the best elements from the past and revisiting and revising them but unfortunately the new creatures in this film aren't scary at all and the characters are so unlikeable that the sense of threat is heavily diminished, the other elements are wasted apart from Michael Fassbender as the android David who is at least one saving grace. One of the most inspired scenes that hearkens back to the underrated and brilliantly dark Alien 3 involves an alien pregnancy and the removal of a gestating alien from one of the human characters but unfortunately there is such little build up to this that it lessens the impact of what could have been a much more tense and unnerving situation and then it's forgotten so quickly that you feel slightly cheated, which becomes a pattern throughout.

As mentioned Fassbender is one of the film's best aspects, but Theron and Idris Elba also do a great job considering the shoddy material they're given and the bizarre and incongruous character motivation, which you will no doubt be questioning at every narrative turn. Noomi Rapace seems oddly cast as Prometheus' Ripley-esque protagonist, lacking the humanity that would have perhaps made her more likable. The minor characters are appallingly written and really detract from the otherwise serious tone and atmosphere.

Those hoping to find direct links to Alien will be disappointed and most likely angry. The planet which is visited in Prometheus is LV-233, not LV-426 which is the planet that the crew's nightmare begins on in Alien. Instead of tying things up nicely the film raises more questions than it answers and ends in such a way that demands a sequel to actually finish the story, but if it's going to be as confused and ineffective as this than it's one sequel I can definitely do without.","6"

It lack every element that I expect from a sci-fi / suspense movie.

In one sentence, not worth watching if you are like me, who love exercising judgement as you are one of those characters in the movie, and try making sense out of the story / information that you are being presented by the movie-makers when sitting there in the cinema.

It just does not add up, does not make much sense. You would be hugely disappointed if you expect a story with few plot-holes, with likable characters well depicted.

"KalosSkopeo","2093 Darwin Award Finalists","15 October 2012","*SPOILER ALERT*

This film puts forward a creationist/intelligent design point of view, yet its characters are all contenders for the 2093 Darwin Awards. Let's take a look at a few of them:

1) CHARLIE HALLOWAY was a reckless archaeologist who lacked both foresight and compunction over exposing LV 426, himself, his wife, and the crew to contamination when he first entered a totally foreign environment in a galaxy far, far away and impulsively removed his helmet simply because the air seemed breathable! He also overlooked the shifty android, whom he had earlier insulted, plopping its finger into his drink just before handing it to him and just after asking him a suspiciously-toned question that should have given him pause before chugging it.

2) FIFIELD was a misanthropic, virtually sociopathic geologist who somehow passed an interview and psych eval to be picked to go on a trillion-dollar expedition. Despite being an expert in mapping, he quickly got lost and wound up a barbecued zombie!

3) MILLBURN was a biologist who freaked out when he saw the fossilized remains of a Space Jockey, yet was oddly eager to pet a menacing-looking snake creature, which he tried to coax with baby talk. Despite its threatening, don't-mess-with-me behavior, Millburn continued to try to pat it on the head and ended up dead--but not before he got some Deep Throat action from the li'l critter.

4) CAP'N JANEK and his co-pilots were happy-go-lucky guys who seemingly had a good outlook on life, yet they jumped on the chance to do a kamikaze mission based on the gross presumption of the film's plucky heroine, Elizabeth Shaw, who by her own admission believes out of choice rather than evidence--apologetics and science be damned!

I'm giving this a generous 5/10 for the visuals and for Ridley Scott's nod to two of my favorite directors--Stanley Kubrick and David Lean.","5"
"BrokenBad737","A Big House with Nothing in it...","14 June 2012","When this film was first announced, the hype was both overwhelming and expected.

The original ""Alien"" is considered a benchmark not just for horror genre but for cinema as a whole.

We were treated to a different, yet excellent, vision of the story with James Cameron's ""Aliens"" in 86' and a couple of sub-par (but passable) entries in 92' in 97' from Fincher and Jeunet (two directors who had a slow start, but quickly came into their own).

When the Alien vs. Predator films surfaced, it seemed all was lost for what is considered one of the most horrific and iconic movie monsters in history.

But a glimmer of hope appeared as it was announced that Ridley Scott stepping back into the director's chair after over 30 years and prepared to bring the series back to its roots.

I thought this film was going to be something special.

But alas...

""I was wrong. We were so wrong"" - Elizabeth Shaw (Prometheus)

---

It seems a bit unfair to judge this film as a ""prequel"" to the original 1979 film when Scott himself has stated numerous times that while the film will take place in the same universe as the original film, they are not meant to be seen as directly connected.

Well... that is all well and good I suppose, but when you are dealing with one of cinema's most beloved genre films, it is a ballsy move to say you are not really going to deal with it.

Scott was true to his word. The film's plot does not have much to do with the events of the original film. The origin of the ""space jockey"" race is revealed and the creation of the alien race is explained, but neither of these do anything to enhance or give new insight to the rest of the films of the series (in fact, the final scene raises questions since it reveals that the Aliens already had strains of human DNA, while Alien Resurrection seems to say differently.)

I feel that inclusion of the Alien canon was interesting, but done more as a marketing ploy.

But I digress... putting the other films in the series aside, what you have is a beautiful, yet hollow film.

THE GOOD:

The opening images of Earth are beautiful and the climax with the destruction of Prometheus is awe-inspiring.

Like all great science fiction films, the themes transcend the generic and deal with the inception of humanity and the afterlife. The opening scene shows how humanity began and ends with our creators on a mission to destroy us. Why they gave up on humanity is not explained, but many hints are given through vocal and visual clues indicating they saw the destruction that humans have caused (death of Jesus Christ, abortion, war, etc.)

The performances were adequate with the standouts being Rapace, Fassbender and Pearce (in a great limited role). The rest of the cast were merely on par.

THE BAD:

I feel this film is a great lesson for our times when digital effects are beginning to take over our cinema screens: no matter how beautiful a film is, without a center, you have nothing.

The biggest problem was the character development. None of the characters had any sort of arc or any development whatsoever. Most of the characters are red shirts whose names you will forget the moment they are killed, but even the leads are left hanging.

The two leads, Holloway and Shaw, are as plain as can be. Both are established as dedicated archaeologists, but their motivations seldom surpass basic human curiosity. There is a brief flashback of Shaw's father (also an archaeologist) giving some insight as to why she herself became one. Shaw's father is revealed to have died of Ebola and she herself is learned to be infertile.

Unfortunately, both of these facts are completely pointless as they lead nowhere. Nothing about Shaw stands out. We have no rooting interest for her. She is basically a no one.

Holloway is even worse, coming off as a colossal dick most of the time so when he croaks, no one really gives a damn.

There is a lot of attention given to David: questions being raised of his own humanity, whether or not he feels emotion, his love for T.E. Lawrence. But once again, none of these little tidbits materialize into anything that let's us care for any of the characters.

The familiar faces of Janek and Vickers are even worse, being terribly underwritten considering the talents portraying them.

With little character development, the entire plot falls apart. There is no sort of drive or goal that Shaw or the characters are searching for. This part does not have to be difficult. In the original film, the goal was simply to escape the ship before the entire crew was killed. Simple as that. Why it was so hard for the screenwriters to add something so simple to this film is beyond me.

Some may argue the extinction of the entire human race is stakes enough to build tension, but the problem is... the characters don't even care about their home planet. None of them are shown to have any connections on Earth and seeing as they lost two years of their life in order to travel to the distant planet, it seems they don't have much to keep them sticking around.

The notable exception is Guy Pearce's character who's quest for immortality was the only interesting part of the film.

"john-70-690278","Alien by any other name.","18 October 2015","While the original 'Alien' was a ground breaker, this weak imitation simply mixes many facets of that film, and its sequels, into a new, but hardly original, storyline. it's confused and disjointed, and much of it is highly implausible, even by the standards of Sci-Fi. The acting is formulaic and the majority of the characterisations lack depth and believability. There are the spectacular special effects common in similar films but the failure of supposedly intelligent and trained astronauts to behave in a sane and sensible way strains credibility. It has its exciting moments and will appeal to a modern, younger audience, but, in truth, it's not particularly good and doesn't really compare with the original.","6"
"scott-gregg111","This film should be mandatory viewing in all film schools","18 June 2012","This is a great example of bad editing. I have read a lot of the reviews here and I agree with most of them. But its not the script that is the problem. It is clearly the lack of editing prowess. This film was undoubtedly much longer and was hacked down to allow for more theater play. Chopping a film for view-time happens to all films we see. The original Alien had something like 4 hours of footage that was reduced, with total mastery by Terry Rawlings, down to its theater run time. I have seen directors cuts from most of Scott's films and they are bad. Scott seems to overshoot and expect somehow to be saved by his editors. This time he f'd up bad. His editors obliterated plot, character development, and pacing. What is being shown in theaters now is basically a two hour movie trailer for the next film????? Perhaps a directors cut will contain the whole bit. If you are a fan of Scott's Alien and Bladerunner you are really a fan of Terry Rawlings. A good editor makes a film look like more while showing less. A bad editor can take the best story and turn it into nonsense. - Not that Prometheus was the best story.","6"
"NikTesla","Disappointing","6 June 2012","I was looking forward to this movie.

I was, to some extent, disappointed. The movie at time seemed disjointed and lacking in flow. Another issue was that the parts of the plot were projected well in advance, rendering items that should have been ""wow"" or ""interesting"" became ""yep, saw that coming a mile off"".

By and large the acting was decent, although sometimes I felt that Noomi Rapace was giving a mixed performance. Plus it was obvious right from the start that David was an android.

Visually the movie is great. Ridley Scott avoided the habit that some directors have in a 3D movie of having lots of this come at the viewer for no apparent reason other than to scream ""THIS IS 3D"" as if we did not already know this.

One thing that struck me is that Ridley, at times, seemed to me making too much of an effort to make it obvious the movie was not a direct prequel of that most excellent of movies, Alien. This caused the storyline to sometimes lurch and trip on it's own feet.

A few times I lost that ""this is plausible"" feeling. An example is when they find the ""vases"". They are stepping in the fluid on the floor yet nothing happens. However, at one point on of the characters falls over, with his helmet landing in the fluid, instantly causing it to melt.

One disappointing error was one of the characters saying that mature does not do straight lines. Immediately my mind went to the rocks in the high desert such as the Nazca desert which travel across the desert, leaving shallow, straight trenches behind them","7"

The question that keeps running in my mind is how on earth does this movie score a 7.2 on this website? Anyone that even voted a 7 has to have zero sense or was paid to pump it up. Clearly its a horrible movie and deserves at best a 4 if your counting the CGI work being the major factor in your vote. Even actors that are normally very good were terrible in this flic. I gave it a 3 and that was being generous.

Personally I can watch a movie with pretty dodgy writing and actually enjoy it because I tend to over look a lot of things but seriously this is the worst writing I have ever seen. Lindelof and Spaihts should be imprisoned.

The only thing sadder than this movie is that fact that it could have been really great. The root ideas and theme if written good, with good direction instead of something that defies all logic and physics would have been outstanding.

"ThomasDrufke","Visually Stunning","19 May 2017","Ridley Scott's return to the Alien franchise was a divisive one. Prometheus is a fascinating and sometimes thrilling addition to the series, albeit with an imperfect way of going about it.

I feel like Scott really wanted to make a science fiction film with exploration at the center of it, and throw in some Alien terror and action to create a blockbuster-y feel. To me, the parts of Prometheus that work the most are when the film is trying to build mythology around the mysterious ""Engineers"" and their possible relation to the creation of humans and/or Xenomorphs. Of course, the film rarely makes all of the answers to these questions accessible without analysis, but it interests me far more than another film hanging onto the scares of a two-mouthed creature.

The film assembles quite the ensemble, including Noomi Rapace, Michael Fassbender, Charlize Theron, Guy Pearce, Sean Harris, Kate Dickie, Benedict Wong, and Idris Elba. Every Alien film's strength seems to always lie with its cast, but perhaps this was the best ensemble of any of the films to date. However, besides Rapace and Fassbender, most of the casts' characters aren't fleshed out enough. In other Alien- related films you made not need as much character development because the film isn't built around its cast, but this film feels more character centric and slower paced than others, hence needed some more work.

That's not to say this film doesn't have some great character work. Rapace has a particular scene lying on a medical bed that is some of the best acting this entire series has offered, but I think this film works far better when the vision stays in Ridley Scott's court of directing. His direction and the cinematography is absolutely astounding. This film could easily hold a class as to how to properly shoot cinematography. It's 5 years old and I'm not sure I have seen a science fiction film look more hauntingly real than Prometheus. It's one of those films that you have to admire because of how much work and effort was put into making this Scott's vision from the start.

I think the biggest problem people have with Prometheus (even more so than failing to answer all questions) is that it tries to be too many different types of film at once. I know that all of the Alien films pride themselves on chaos, but at least the narratives never strayed too far away. Prometheus' narrative can be a jumbled mess, especially in the third act, and I think that prevents it from coming close to the early franchise's roots. But there's also a lot to love with a little bit of greatest hits moments from the entire Alien series. Hopefully Scott can really bring everything full circle with Alien: Covenant.

"Howlin Wolf","Honour thy father...","6 July 2012","(Sitting here now having seen it, it feels like the very act of even talking about Prometheus constitutes a spoiler, because so much of the pleasure I gained from the film came from thinking about the ideas behind it. I've tried not to deliberately reveal specific details, but I've checked the 'spoiler' box, just in case! It's actually better if you go in knowing nothing, and trying not to let Ridley Scott's past sci-fi experience influence you)

I thought it was excellent (although from the looks of things on the message board, that doesn't appear to be a view that's unanimously endorsed!)

It's really hard to say a lot about it without spoiling it... I thought the visuals were astonishing (I saw it in 3D, which enhances the experience) and I really liked the philosophy it opened up (however much they might have been holding details back for a continuation of the theme)

The two main criticisms appear to be that there isn't much character depth, and also, not as much out and out alien action as people were expecting. To counter those perceived weaknesses, I would say that the story very purposefully sets up its human elements as an enormously distant third priority, behind two more powerful agents... and that whilst there definitely is a greater scope beyond simply alien battles, if you're interested in the series then there's a link to where the xenomorphs were generated, and what their function could possibly be interpreted as...

"rumbleinthejungle","Want to love it but can't","20 October 2012","It's so tricky to do something in the same spirit of a much loved franchise that was conceived over 30 years ago. The Star Wars and Predator movies showed that there is potential to cheapen the original films if you go the wrong way with it and the only film from recent years that I can recall having done right by it's original version was the recent prequel to The Thing. Although Prometheus is not really a prequel as such, fans of the original Alien films will still be mindful that this film is set in the same universe and Scott pays direct tribute to the first 2 films on more than one occasion here. Alas, Prometheus falls very short when it comes to establishing the brooding atmosphere and timeless vision of the future that the first films did. There are a few problems here not the least of which is the clunky writing, tacky musical score and paper thin characters that seem to be merely cannon fodder, not to mention conflicting filmic allusions to the origin of the famous Xenomorph creature. I understand that Scott changed his mind halfway through filming about the thrust of the story and it shows in that there are far too many loose ends left unresolved and some glaring contradictions in the plot; one such contradiction being that the 'Engineers' would already seem to know of the Xenomorph species (Holloway spots a mural depicting what looks to be a Queen Alien on a chamber wall) but at the film's end we're shown an early version of the creature that looks similar but different to the Geiger design. The film reminded me of Predators in the way that it was so enamored with the legacy of it's predecessors it forgot to do anything interesting or, in this case, coherent with it's own story. Couple that with the fact that, despite some of the gorgeous visuals, the actions of the characters and their dialogue consistently make this film feel cheap. The infamous scene where one character (supposedly an elite Biologist) attempts to make friends with a potentially dangerous alien organism (we can see the scare coming a mile away) feels like something you'd see on a late night, direct to video B Horror film. What a shame.","5"

I had extremely high hopes and expectations for this film, as it's Ridley Scott's first return to sci-fi in 30 years. I wasn't disappointed in the slightest.

Fans of the original Alien and its mysteries will love this film. It attempts to answer some of the questions the first film posed 33 years ago, but asks a lot of new ones. Many reviewers find these questions to be quite aggravating, but I like to think of these questions preserving the sense of mystery the original had.

Many people complain about the acting or script. So, while not brilliant, it's a minor negative point. None of the actors are bad, most of them just average. But, Fassbender(David) and Rapace(Shaw) stand out above the rest.

This film, matches, if not exceeds, the original disturbing nature of Alien. So, this film is not for the weary. Prometheus is complete fanfare to fans of the original, and for those who have been interested in the origins of the giant fossilized pilot aboard the derelict spacecraft. Excellent cinematography, and captivating visual effects, to be expected.

Prometheus may not be the most coherent film ever made, but it's an absolute edge -of- your-seat thrill ride, with plenty of nods to the original film, a few great performances, and obviously breathtaking cinematography and visuals. If you're a fan of Science Fiction and Scott's original Alien, you won't be disappointed, I can guarantee you that.","7"
"gwcohn-2","Horrible waste of time","19 November 2012","This is another example of special effects taking precedence over plot.

The plot is basically man discovers that ancient civilizations have a common denominator. They all seem to point to the same star system.

Scientists travel to that star system and find the aliens responsible for breeding man along with some other hostile creatures.

From there the plot goes downhill.

The aliens want to destroy man and they need to destroy the aliens.

There is no reason given for the aliens wanting to destroy man but I could think of a few, especially the creators of this mess! :-)

The surviving lady scientist wants to find the God that created man since God didn't create man so she fly's off in search of God.

I can think of dozens of much more entertaining alien flicks than this garbled mess. Unless you just enjoy dark scenes and special effects, Don't waste your money.","1"
"mister-green7","Contact (the Aliens remix)","9 August 2012","yes this movie reminds me abit of Contact starring Jodie Foster (except Contact is better) and had I known that Damon Lindelof of LOST had written this, I would not have seen it. Period. Yes, too many unanswered questions folks. But ohh, this would open up discussions right? Nah screw that, I have better things to do than to waste my time on Prometheus forums. I will look forward to the sequel, as Prometheus is made in such a way that it simply DEMANDS a sequel (clever writers). I mean, it did suckered in a lot of LOST fans, eh? But anyways, the Aliens mythology is much more interesting, so am not too disappointed in Prometheus 1. Go see it if you are a fan of ALIENS and want to feel LOST.","5"
"TroyeEvans","What It Lacks in Plot, It Compensates in Suspense and Philosophical Depth","6 June 2012","It would be hard to compare this to Scott's introduction of the Alien species, but if I have to, I would say it lacks the kind of horror that Alien brought and its suspense falls flat, though not by much.

What it manages to do more than the first installment is that it adds a layer of philosophical, constantly in pursuit of the origins of mankind, and ultimately mortality. The visuals no doubt outmatched the original, thanks to modern technology, but the effects seem to be behind similarly foreign planets settings like Avatar.

The suspense is maintained since the arrival at the planet of our makers, and most would expect countless answers flooding in as the plot unfolds. That is not really the case. In fact, there are questions left unanswered. One thing is for sure, it is an enjoyment, though not the same kind when you are watching the original, and it seems to promise a sequel, which I will gladly watch should it come.","7"
"sburke34","Ridley Scott has failed to deliver!!","24 June 2012","I Was really looking forward to this film, however i was so disappointed with it.

It failed to deliver on so many levels, i felt it was sooooo slow at the start it seemed to take ages to get to the main point of the film and when it finally did it all seemed a bit rushed to hurry up and get to the end.

The trailer they are showing for it really is the best parts coz nothing else is really worth watching or writing about.

Even now as i'm writing this review i'm struggling what to write about it,,,,, mainly because there is nothing to write!!

I'm a massive fan of the Alien films and of Ridley Scott but don't think i'll be in a hurry to watch this again anytime soon!

Might be time to give up on trying to jump on the bandwagon and not do a prequel like the rest (even though Charlize Theron keeps saying in interviews it's not a prequel) it sooo is a prequel!!","5"
"alianentertainment","What is wrong with the viewers?","13 September 2012","What is wrong with all of you. How could you have ever enjoyed it. The only good thing about this movie was Charlize Theron, and not because of acting- because she is hot. AND that is ALL.

I also did not check the score before watching, and i figured it would be like 3 - 3.5 7.5, incredible.

But its not your fault that you liked it. Hollywood has screwed up this thing called making movies. People don't care about anything else but explosions and unbelievable escapes from falling spaceships.

"botrytis","Don't be afraid about the new beginning...","8 June 2012","Those, who think this movie is 100% about a story-lineup to the Alien franchise, I have to say they're wrong. This is about the Prometheus mythology, about beginning of the creation, this is a new thing.

For the start I'm gonna tell that even me wasn't that amused last night when we had finished watching the movie in the cinema, but not even disappointed. It was just a feeling that I was expecting something more which is more connected to my expectation after re-watching those marvelous trailers again and again. But those who were enraged as an outcome, and demanded -as a symbol- their money back, who have time for hating this movie, you'd better spent it to think, reconsider what actually this production was about.

After few minutes, I had started to feel some absence. I missed the movie. Somekind of Inception happened there, I was feeling that atmosphere, that tone what the motion picture represented during those 2 hours. Afterwards, finally I have started to think about the story, the background, and doing it still, and yet here I am, the next phases are going to be about the process about this cogitation.

***-Spoiler Alert- ( recommended for those, who saw the movie, and want to consider about what have had they seen.)***

*- Today I have just realized that that scene at the beginning, where we saw an 'Engineer' melting himself, that location was the Earth, and |he sacrificed himself to create the biological life on our Planet additionally the Earth-like human civilization (Earth-like 'coz they are 'Human' too, but prehistoric, and maybe not from here)*

*- Many from the audience are complaining about that this movie is about not God created us, they did. Not exactly, they are human too, and who created them then? This is about they created a new human form, which is us, more sensitive, with more feelings, which during the movie we actually realize they don't have. On the other hand, this is about the prom. myth. assimilation.*

*- The 'Engineer' species are possibly the one where from our Prometheus mythology come from. Maybe he was among them, and he stole the 'Fire' from the God(s), and they created us. Afterwards they punished him hard. I reckon that one of the key parts is when our members meet theirs. We can't know what he things:

*-What was their duty? To bring the 'Fire' to Earth. Why? To create (again), but firstly to destroy us. Why? How should I know... possibly they expected something else despite us.*

*- He was hibernated with that knowing that when he arrives, he's gonna be on Earth. (one possible explanation to the happenings)*

*- He (as a member of our 'Gods', Creators, Engineers) meets the same situation known from the mythology. (other possible explanation to the happenings)*

*- At the end, where the main female character has a conversation with the 'clone of the human', she demands to lead her to the 'Engineers', but possibly to the creators of the engineers. Because she believes that there is more then this, and of course, someone had to create the prehistoric human kind too...***

There are so many questions what actually need to be answered, but we have to be creative, and hard-working to make researches of the background stories. The 'Engineer' (Ridley Scott) created a beautiful Motion Picture, and he presents this to us, we can be creators too, let us create our story fed with the facts, and fictions. We may not get what we wanted, but let the movie show what the creator wanted to show to us.

With these statements I'm gonna say, - during thinking about the movie still - I liked the idea, it is a new thing with some ordinary implementations, with many many creatures, outstanding acting, and mysterious story background. Maybe you won't be happy with my exploration, don't be shy, share yours with us. And for those, who are still hating the movie, give it another try, chance, spare your time with cogitation...

"michi-16","Plot holes as big as the sun","8 August 2012","I just saw the film in the cinema and was torn apart between the spectacular special effects, the very intense sound effects and the believable world on the one hand and the plot/lame actors on the other hand. Man, I just started to shake my head during the middle of the film. Doesn't anybody preview such films before money is spent? Let's start with the beginning (Spoiler ahead):

>Why using/wasting so much time with the android David wandering around, playing basketball, watching films when you could actually tell a story instead?

>Then comes in the blond tough girl Meredith Vickers. Her role in the film? Judging from the first scenes, she will be a tough girl to fight and she will have the part of the aggressor. She is overly stiff and straight. But hey, this is a film, judge again, this all doesn't count because none of this will happen, she is only in bad acting mode. Has some issues with her farther, but this is only a side note and not evaluated further.

>Next the old guy, the financier of the whole trip. Obviously the actor playing the character is young and wearing a mask and make up to look him old. Your thought could be, ""he will rejuvenate"". But guess again, he just dies, and this very quickly at the end. No surprise that he is on the ship too. What this storyline does for the film? Nothing. Why didn't they use actual an old actor for this part instead? No clue.

>The android on this ship seems to have a plan. Which plan is not explained. He knows the language of the aliens and touches everything that isn't fixed. Where he learned that language? Not told. You see that he is learning languages, but I can learn french and can't speak Arab...Nobody seems to care that he activates this and that, doors and holograms without checking with the others or without an order. Just doing his thing there. He is also the one doing an fatal ""experiment"" or should we call it plain murder (Weyland). Why does he do it? What motives does he have? No explanation is given.

>One of the crew members, who had to stay in the alien structure and got killed by an organism comes back as a zombie. Why he still lives, as everybody saw he is dead, is not told? Nobody seams to ask that question either, instead everybody shoots him. Good solution anyway, because he seems to have super strength now. At this point some questions should be asked amongst the crew, but no time for that, the next spectacle is around the corner..

>The heroine is infested with an alien by deceased friend/lover Weyland and the android wants her tugged away in cryo sleep for ""her own safety"". Why he does that, who knows, the story is not giving us any clues. Perhaps some kind of secret agenda? After placing her on a table to be prepped for cryo sleep she attacks the ones prepping her and runs to the automatic operation unit. Nobody seems to follow her. Even after the event this obviously isn't a big deal, since in that universe everybody gets a beating once in a while.....She tries to get the fast growing alien inside her out of her body and afterwards doesn't even bother to warn the others, that the androids behavior seems a little odd, since he has wanted to get her out of the way before. Instead, at the end of the film she forgives him and has a little chit chat with him. Another subplot that doesn't work.

>As for the others: Nobody seems to have some relationship on that ship not even a professional one. The motivations for the actions: unknown or barely told. Pale and lame. The descision to nuke the alien ship comes out of the blue since no one seems to have any interest in others or the earth because of missing background stories. Seldom you see such a crap on film. Man this is even frustrating to write.

>Continuation error: The alien in the seat, you see in Alien 1 is there. It is kind of a suit that folds around the alien life form, when it tries to start the ship to earth. But somebody has to explain the director how the crew in Alien 1 can find the alien suit when the alien which the suit folds around is not in that seat anymore at the end, because it went after Mrs Shaw to kill it in the life boat where it gets killed by the grown alien which was operated out of the belly of the heroine. So actually there is nothing to fold around. And the hole in that suit is evenly not explained...Perhaps the Alien 1 ship is another one, with another alien...

>No hint or explanation what the grey or black substance is, no explanation what the recordings do, oh man, this is crap......

Summary: The two stars go for the exceptional special effects and the sound.","2"
"stuart_flint1976","The search for our beginning is..hopefully the end of this franchise.","4 June 2012","The hype surrounding this film was perhaps understandable. Aside of what must go down as one of the slickest – albeit spoiler ridden - viral marketing campaigns ever undertaken, this represented Ridley Scott much anticipated return to the genre he helped define. Throw in a cast of established actors (Fassbender, Theron, Elba), enigmatic emerging talent (Rapace) and set the story in a scary but familiar universe, what could possibly go wrong?

Unfortunately, the answer is quite a lot.

The film, like so many big budget science fiction films has a beautiful glossy appearance. The visual effects, the sets, costumes, cinematography, they really are all striking and in places they are simply brilliant. It also has lofty ambitions too, attempting to ask deep and meaningful philosophical questions about the origins of life on earth, mankind's place in the universe and our relationship with our creators, and creations.

However, once you scratch beneath the surface it quickly becomes apparent that this thin veneer covers a multitude of problems which are so fundamental that they destroy the film from within.

Firstly the plot. It's a patchwork of different ideas which seem to have been assembled expressly with the purpose of make a film lasting around two hours. Yes there are various sub-plots tagged in, but at no point was I convinced that there really was one really strong idea and story about the engineers which genuinely needed to be told. It's far from the ""ground breaking mythology"" we were promised.

This wouldn't be such a huge problem if the different sections were similar in tone, and joined together as neatly and effectively as Shaw's stomach post operation, but they are not. After the Prometheus lands, the tone set during the first 45 minutes, suddenly lurches into the kind of brainless set piece AvP stupidity that Scott suggested he was reclaiming the franchise from.

The characters though - they are good, right?

Well with the exception of David (Fassbender) I'm afraid to say not. There are lots of them, far too many in fact, and as a consequence none of them are properly developed, even the protagonist Shaw. This makes it difficult to build up tension or sustain threat when events take a turn for the worst.

While some of these are just your basic cannon fodder, even the more significant characters are just so horribly written that it's impossible to feel any empathy. They all share remarkably similar traits. They act illogically, and without regard for the job they have been hired to do. They make poor decisions; they have motivations which are not clear, they speak in clichés and they possess an ESP like ability to predict future events. The characters are in fact so unconvincing and driven by the plot that massive traumatic events like death, invasive surgery and discovery of intelligent life seemingly pass with barely a flicker of emotion, and have little effect on the characters.

Finally, the creatures. Like the plot and characters these just fail to deliver. The scenes with the exception of Shaw's much talked about medipod adventure just don't terrify in the way in which they would need to and many of the ideas have been done far better by those less capable than Scott.

It's almost like Scott is battling for originality in a genre which he created, and it ends up looking like a copy of a copy of a copy of a copy of Alien.

The poor end sequence in which we see the emergence of some form of early Alien, is a strange, unsatisfying and unnecessary link. It's also perhaps the clearest sign that, despite the claim this film was unrelated to Alien and represented a new distinct mythology, there wasn't sufficient confidence in the films ideas to truly let it stand on its own merit.

""The king has his reign, and then he dies"".

The question is why he has to die so publicly and in doing so, detract from what was, and will remain his very best work?","3"

Hey! If your first venture doesn't make money add loads of plot holes so you will be forced to spend money and see the the next part and so forth and so on. another thing i don't understand is why are people calling this an 'Alien' prequel as it has little and nothing to do with any of the Alien quadrology...OK maybe a little segment in the end that i wont mention in case you haven't already seen this film, needless to say it's the only smidgen of Alien evidence that i caught anyways.

"willdearborn-387-588541","Scott ruins his own creation...","3 June 2012","I'm really outraged and just for the sake of expressing it, I'm writing this review. There may be some spoilers and probable mistakes in my grammar since I'm not a native speaker. Sorry.

** SPOILERS AHEAD

Where to start? First of all, Alien movies are sci-fi/horror movies. Right? It seems that Scott had forgotten this very fact that he himself established in the first movie. There is no tension, no action, nothing. You can see the outcome half an hour earlier.

Also, there are plot holes size of what, Nebraska? What was the motive of Engineers?

How can two different species (engineers and humans) share the same DNA? They are giants for gods sake.

Are all the crew of Prometheus complete idiots? You are landing on a planet that can support life, but you don't use any kind of decontamination or a security protocol except some puny flamethrowers. (I got it, it's a nod to Alien but in Alien,it was a makeshift weapon)

There is a turbocharged c-section and the patient endures it with only local anesthetics and in 2 minutes she's up and going and we were saying AvP movies were silly.

Captain has two men stranded in an alien ship, there is a indication of something very wrong, something alive other than the men stranded, he dismisses the problem as a hardware glitch and just goes to sleep with Theron.

Characters (?) are just cardboard figures. They just run around, speak and behave foolishly and die.

List goes on and on and on. This is a wreck of a script, and Mr.Scott is officially guilty for getting this movie out in its current form. It seems that TV is the medium now for intelligent scripts and at least there are shows that has some respect for viewers intelligence. Because this film has none. Nobody should have played some stupid ""Lost"" tricks on us Alien fans. I should have known when I saw the name Lindelof on the writing credits.

One star for the magnificent visuals and one star for the exceptional acting by always reliable Fassbender and Theron.

"saramgia","Ridiculous","19 February 2018","Great visual and sound effects. Mockable writing and story. The spaceship itself predates the original ""Alien"" film but is more advanced than the Nostromo and more luxurious than the Titanic. The characters operate on the basis that ""the Engineers"" created human beings from themselves as a bio-weapon, and pretend to establish this premise as a fact upon discovering our DNA is identical. The movie doesn't really establish it as a fact or provide a good basis for the hypothesis. The audience is just expected to accept as ""facts"" things that don't make sense even within the context of the story--like the alien egg and drone in the Solaco. Given that as the basis, the Engineers created humankind as a biological weapon, lost control of their project, developed the ""alien"" monster, and lost control of that project. The behavior of the undeveloped characters in ""Prometheus"" is inexplicably stupid and random. Doctors and researchers have no caution in an unknown, alien environment; no concern for microbes, contagion, unknown life forms; robot David intentionally poisons Dr. Charlie for no apparent reason; Dr. Elizabeth is vigorously active immediately following major abdominal surgery that completely severed her muscles in her core and went into her endometrial cavity. The crew heroically converts story to a suicide mission and goes out with bad lines. The audience knows the scene, not because it goes in this movie, but because we've seen it in so many other movies, we've got the facial expressions, gestures, and lines memorized. The worst thing about this installation is the introduction of the inexplicably melodramatic, emotional android that is carried into the next installation, ""Covenant,"" and ruins that film, too.","1"
"c-ellis-404-542033","Needed a better editor..","23 June 2012","This film really disappointed me. I am a huge Ridley Scott fan so that made it worse. I think it needed a better editor to tighten up some scenes that were s-l-o-w because that drags the film down. It got to the point where I started thinking, why are we seeing this? This diatribe is boring and irrelevant, can we get back to the story? It would be like listening to my mother share what should be a 2 minute story but taking 15 minutes to do so. Good story buried in a long and boring dialogue. The CGI is awesome and the tech ideas are cool as would be expected these days. But that isn't enough to make me want to see this a second time.","2"
"theprecursor","Prometheus, Sci-Fi and Why You Can't Have Stupid Characters","6 June 2012","I saw Prometheus last night. It was decent, but I have a few gripes which I will voice here.

Okay, so I can forgive characters for being unintelligent and doing stupid things that lead to their deaths in horror films, but in sci-fis, you generally expect the characters to have a few more smarts about them. For one thing, in a sci-fi, the characters will usually be something along the lines of scientists, doctors, biologists, academics, etc., because why would we send Mr Joe Blow into space? What I'm saying is that characters in sci-fi films need to act more intelligently than their horror movie counterparts, so when they do stupid things like take off their helmets in an alien environment or try and pat the alien cobra or open the doors to the ship when a dead crew member has mysteriously shown up again right outside, the audience will be very unimpressed. Why is it that these film-makers are afraid of having characters act rationally? I mean, why would the guy who just ran away from the scary alien corpse want to suddenly get all friendly with an alien snake? For a cool death? That can't be it, because he could have had a cool death anyway, if the writers had tried a little harder.

Another thing sci-fi characters need are good motives. No, you can't be on this ship just because you like flying ships. They could have just built more Davids, because he seemed to be able to fly the ship, go fearlessly exploring and do the biopsies all by himself. Good characters need convincing﻿ motives and reasons for why they are there. The Christian undertones in Prometheus are also a little disconcerting. Look what ""choosing to believe"" gets you. A ship full of dead people. I feel that Prometheus also promotes creation rather than evolution. In fact, human evolution is completely disregarded in the plot of this film, though we do see the very fast evolution of the alien species. Hmm.

Another thing I was bothered by are all the elements of the plot that don't quite make sense. It seems like there's an hour of missing footage out there that could explain all of this. Maybe we'll see a director's cut? First of all, why would the Engineers create or start human life on Earth, then give these early Earthlings a map, not of the home planet, but of what is basically the Engineers' military base with a biological weapon big enough to wipe out Earth? Did they want us to come and seek out our own demise? Seems pretty strange to me. If they're unhappy with what they created, then why create a more evil race of beings to wipe us out? It's like having a rat problem and then getting a bunch of cats to get rid of the rats, and ending up with a cat problem.

Also, why would Mr Weyland want to keep his identity secret on a mission that HE funded? Couldn't he have just made better choices about who he picked for his team so he wouldn't have to remain secretive? I don't know. Am I missing something here? I feel like this was maybe meant to be an ""OH MY GOD HE WAS ON THE SHIP THE ENTIRE TIME"" moment, but it wasn't.

I'm being pretty harsh, but I think that's fair. It's Ridley Scott. He made Alien. So why can't he give us another good sci-fi? Then again, maybe that's unfair. I'm sure it's hard to have everything you make be compared to one of your earlier and extremely successful projects. Also, who knows what really goes on behind the scenes, what directors are forced to do and forced to put their name to. Despite everything I've just said, this isn't a bad film. The first 40 minutes are excellent. It's just let down by poor plot and character writing.","7"
"noangelfan-36-988964","Mind blowing!","13 June 2012","I am going to keep this review, being my first, short but informative about the film without giving anything important away. To start off, i really cannot understand the vast amount of hate for this film. I watched this film last night. There will be good reviews and there will be bad reviews but ultimately until you have seen the film yourself, you cannot know whether it is a good film or not. Anyway, onto the film. Having only recently watched the first two alien movies, i have not been a long time fan and was not too excited about this film. This film is absolutely visually stunning and the cgi is out of this world, a few scenes in this movie literally made my mouth drop wide open, i was glued to the screen throughout. There have been a lot of complaints about the storyline not being related enough to the original alien film(s). If you are a long time alien fan and are expecting a scary horror with plenty of gore and aliens, look elsewhere. This film is a very intriguing one with a very inventive storyline, whether it is a prequel, a sequel or a stand alone movie, it is an absolutely amazing and immersive experience! There are a few twists in the storyline which make it more interesting and the running time is 2 hours in which the story really progresses with not one dull moment. In my personal opinion, this exceeds the level of avatar and takes the place of my favourite science fiction film of all time. The roles are played brilliantly by the leads and are very convincing. The 3d does not do much for the film and there is only one scene where the 3d really gets you involved so if you can see it in 2d you may as well, to save a few quid. This is the most fun i've had at the cinema in years, when you get so immersed in a film you forget where you are, you know it's done it's job right! I'm now just looking forward to my second viewing this weekend!","10"
"jai-midwinter-385-697021","So many questions.","2 June 2012","From the very start this movie is very ambiguous, and will be provoking thought for a long time or until the sequel arrives. When one of the ""Engineers"" is seen to drink something which ends its life, he then falls in a waterfall only to start human life? Is he some sort of rogue, the good guy? What's his story? Are his fellow engineers out to destroy what he has done by creating the Xenomorphs and sending them to Earth? Anyway that's just the beginning.

After that you get a beautiful movie with plenty of jaw dropping vistas and sets, the stone head being very memorable.

The acting is first class, particularly from the main cast. Theron is sexy yet menacing, Fassbender plays a synthetic with ease and Rapace doesn't try to be Ripley, she just plays a very gentle human character.

The only problem this movie has (which some people just can't get away from) is its links with the other Alien movies. Those links are extremely loose at this stage of the franchise; by the third film they should be much tighter. I just wish part two and three where coming in the next few months.

If you want blood, guts, guns and space Marines, then watch AvP or play Gears of War. If want to see something beautiful and intelligent, this is for you.

Thank you Sir Ridley Scott I look forward to seeing your movie again (hopefully at IMAX) and its sequels.","9"
"fowlerprowler82","Don't read the top reviews","12 October 2012","Honestly, I've never seen such a ridiculous amount of bad reviews for a film that doesn't deserve it. A common problem seems to be the character's flaws. It's a bloody sci if film. Exactly how much fun do you think this would be if they were NASA trained scientists? They'd run a light year at the first sight of danger and at least impose instant lockdowns. What kind of story would that make? Plus, these character flaws are evident in all the previous/following Alien films. It's the mistakes that are made which cause the story. I'm not saying this film is flawless, it's really no patch on the first 2 Alien films, but it's a very good sci fi film directed by one of the finest out there. Plus Scott has said numerous times that this shouldn't be treated as a direct prequel.

You can't really fault the acting (Fassbender is immense) and the visual aspects are very impressive. I won't give away much of the plot, my phone's stupid keypad is doing my head in, but please don't be put off by the overly critical reviews. These are clearly fanboys wanting the best film ever made. 1/10 is frankly an insult. I really hope the rumours of a further prequel are true, the story definitely needs it.

So, basically, not as good as the first 2, but well worth a watch. Just don't put your 'this has to be better than the originals' head on, because it isn't. That would have to be one hell of a film.","7"
"Cinemadharma","Not supposed to be your mama's Alien, and in that alone, they succeeded.","12 June 2012","I fully appreciate the scope of what this film was trying to achieve. They were going for epic human exploration rife with deep symbolism and meaning. Questioning the origin and meaning of life, the existence of a creator, science vs faith -- This was not supposed to be your mama's Alien, and in that and perhaps that alone, they succeeded.

But despite their effort towards well-thought out intelligence and some beautiful moving pictures, ultimately the film suffers from some horribly written dialogue, pointless characters, completely illogical character choices, and gaping plot/story issues -- and makes me scared shitless at the possibility of Ridley Scott going anywhere near Blade Runner again, which he full intends to do.

But if you like mindless,plot less,atmosphereless big graphic wastes of time you may enjoy it. It was more like part of the AVP franchise than anything else and may even be worse. I think Guy piece was supposed to be an old man or something its hard to tell...he was like a piece of wood(I normally like GP). I did'nt notice any characters in the film apart from the cyborg who seems to have been switched on random mode. The whole film is mostly just quick cliché surprises that are mainly about graphics and nothing else with some cocky/stupid remarks added just to make it more silly. Also the biologist seems to be missing that gene that we all have that alerts us to things that are unknown/dangerous.

Instead of any sort of slight communication or even a word from the weird pumped up wrestler alien he/it just clunks everyone in the face and moves on about his business-great.

This film is full of stupidity, and mistakes as to it relating to the first Alien film-it may as well be not related, it has the same alien ship in it but thats it.","3"
"ViewerSouth","High-minded concept abdicated","11 June 2012","The concept of this film and that is was supposed to 'stand alone' was something of interest to me in going to the cinema to watch what can only be described as a trite, expensive, plot hole riddled prequel shamelessly tied to the later /earlier films that were so popular. The beginning was the best part, and offered the most promise, though the character development, writing, and series of numerous seemingly rushed sequences which unfolded were painstakingly disappointing from a director of the caliber of Blade Runner, Gladiator, Alien and others. The movie seemed to go down hill for me by introducing familiar characters and 'cousins' of those characters in very forced ways when Scott could held the viewer in more suspense and more fully explored the progenitor race(sorry, trying not to use spoiler material), though it seems that may happen if there is a sequel. That being said, as he rapidly, awkwardly forced those characters into screenshots there is not much more that can be offered about that species that has not already been shown in previous installments of the series. As I left the theatre I could anguish over the lost potential of this potentially, yet failed piece of 'smart' sci-fi which is most definitely not 'stand alone'.","2"
"brad_the_metalhead","Incredible!","27 June 2012","I can't express enough how incredible this film is. The special effects are top notch, the acting is phenomenal, the story is extremely creative, it has its suspenseful moments, and it is absolutely beautiful to look at.

The story shows a great level of creativity, it is Ridley Scott at his best. The film is about a group of scientists going to an alien planet on a quest to find out about the creation of man. I personally loved that idea, and while you are watching the film it actually makes you think how we were engineered. It really puts your mind to work, and pretty much any movie that can do that is a great film in my eyes.

Another element that makes this movie so amazing is the special effects. The effects in this movie are very well done, this movie shows that there should be no excuses for bad special effects in movies anymore. Another reason why the effects make the film work is because the movie is so beautiful to look at, the scenery in this film is fantastic, especially during the opening scene. I could not help but say: ""Wow, that is absolutely beautiful."" Trust me the special effects in this film will not disappoint. Especially during the scene where a storm roles in on the planet that they are on, the storm is really wild to look at and it keeps your eyes glued to the screen.

Also, the acting in this film is at its best. Noomi Rapace really proved herself in this film. She did a phenomenal performance, I think she is an incredible actress, she has so much talent and always puts on an entertaining performance. Also, Charlize Theron almost plays a villain, not really a villain but almost like a very mean boss. I personally loved that idea and she really pulled it off. I could go on all day about all the other actors in the film, but its better if you just watch the movie, because the acting is phenomenal.

This film is also very intense. There are a few moments where you might catch yourself clenching your fist with your heart pounding. It happened to me. The sequences where they come in contact with the alien species is very intense and wild. Some of the creatures are kind of frightening and very cool to look at. I'm not going to go into two much details about the creatures because I don't want to spoil anything, but all I can say is that you won't be disappointed.

I don't know how anyone can hate this film, it is by far the greatest movie I have seen in years. Do not listen to the negativity about this film, this is a must see. Don't miss out, this film really delivers.","10"
"sonnm1","A question or two answered, more opened.","7 June 2012","It's interesting reading other reviews and how venomous some are. OK, I agree with some points, one why was Charlize Theron in the movie? Anyone could have played her role and yes there are some stretches of the imagination, walking after abdominal surgery and so on.

One thing frequently mentioned is the stupidity of these aliens creating us then wanting to destroy us. It's not entirely clear that they actually created us, or should I say the engineers found, did it. The only clue is the spacecraft depicted at the very beginning of the movie, it's not the same as the one we later see. Who was the character who drank the DNA and died giving life to humanity? If that's what the scene is.

That's the myth of Prometheus, who stole fire from the god Zeus and gave it to the mortals, in this case the engineer who stole this material, didn't know what it does (maybe) and brought forth humanity . . . an accident. To me he looked like he escaped from the ship or was left there to die. It's clear the alien engineers are aware of us due to many visitations documented by ancient cultures during different time periods. At least for now, that's my take on why they would want to destroy us, they didn't actually create us, it was an accident and now we are a threat.

I enjoyed the movie and wonder how it links to Alien, at least we know how Weyland industries is aware of, maybe not an organism but the biotechnology found in these ships and why they send the Nostromo to investigate a seemingly random transmission. I doubt the crashed ship in this movie is the same as in Alien, otherwise who put the Spacejockey into his seat and helmet.

There are three more ships left and I suspect we're coming back to LV223 in a sequel. As I said more questions than answers. As for character development, really? Is that why we went to see this movie? Yes, it could have been better but as a few people mentioned I'm sure Ridley had to cut the movie down . . . I hope so. It felt rushed in places, like something was cut here and there. We'll see.

One last thing, look out for the soundtrack nod to the original Jerry Goldsmith Alien score during the Weyland hologram message in the mission briefing scene.","9"
"alexander-ivanchev","Probably OK... on a DVD","6 August 2012","I must see the movie was a let down. Let's ignore the big names behind it - it starts great, it starts with promise. Up to the moment the first casualties start happening. From that moment on the movie becomes an incredible bundle of illogical, senseless and outright grotesque clichés. Probably OK if you're stoned and watch the movie on cruise control, but don't you dare ask questions such as 'why is this robot trying to kill them'? What the (hilarious) abortion scene really necessary? What higher purpose did it serve? Why is the good doctor hoping she'll get any answers to her questions on the aliens' home world given past experiences? And of course, hey, let's save Earth and crash the evil alien ship while cracking jokes - this never gets old, does it? That and the obvious tools in the box - let's introduce this life pod and medical chair just in case someone needs to be spoon-fed as to their later purpose as key plot elements. Seriously. One would expect this kind of arrogant approach to the viewer from Uwe Ball, not Ridley Scott. Cast did OK with some exceptions of exceptionally poor performance which should have been re-shot, period.

Okay, let's end the rant here and try to find the good... hmmm... the movie's idea is fresh it starts well and I love Charlize Theron, she's just gorgeous. OK, I sidetrack. It's a good sci- fi/horror survival movie, but nothing special - I certainly enjoyed Event Horizon way more. A good rental, but not something I'd recommend seeing on the big screen. Unless you're okay with just going forward with the flow, clichéd as it might be.","5"

Me and my wife are possibly the biggest Alien/Ridley Scott fans and we both absolutely, without hesitation HATE Prometheus. It is a poorly directed mess of a film that tarnishes a fiction that has spanned over 30 years. He has made a film that did not require the 'DNA' of the Alien series. He has placed 2 dimensional characters into a world that simply doesn't excite or bring anything of worth. Any questions you had regarding any of the mysteries established in the series are answered within 10 minutes of the film starting and leaves no further worthwhile intrigue in their place. I have no idea why this film is being highly reviewed... I wouldn't even consider it a solid sci-fi. predictable, obvious, unexciting, over explained with no character of its own.

It's a film that demands your patience, tests your intelligence and challenges your preconceived ideas of the ""Alien"" universe.

It does what great sci fi does, it asks the big questions, and, via a coupling with Alien and Aliens, draws a sprawling, visually sumptuous, arresting spectacle.

"phantasy_star-392-838289","Captivating and Stunning!","8 June 2012","Some people are too caught up in criticizing the film to a ridiculous extent and end up giving it a 1 out of 10, which is absolutely insane. Actually, anything below ""7"" is grossly unjustified. Meanwhile these same people end up giving lousy films like Chernobyl Diaries and Battleship much, much better scores?? These people are just utterly retarded and have absolutely no scarcely detectable amount of ability or talent to discern and recognize a work of brilliance when they see it. They are really abusing their privilege of leaving reviews, which are anything but fair and reasonable.

Prometheus is brilliant. The visual effects and concepts are stunning, breath-taking and ingenious. The storyline is intriguing, thrilling and leaves you at the edge of your seat. The characters are engaging and fascinating.

This is definitely my top favorite of the entire Alien ""franchise"". The story is big, and I appreciate that the film does not try to jam all the answers in one go, but instead opens the door to further possibilities, and the continuation of the theme.

Those who are not familiar with the Alien films, may not apprise and empathize the full scope of all the nuances in the film. However, if you can appreciate an extremely high quality film with a captivating and suspenseful storyline, you will surely enjoy Prometheus. This is truly the best film I've seen since Avatar, and it ranks right up there with it.","10"
"jaimemedina-36288","Without a doubt the dumbest sci-fi flick in a long time.","4 March 2021","The film is simply a tragedy. In attempting to be the erstwhile progenitor of the classic franchise (whose last few installments were pretty bad), Prometheus succeeds only in disappointing you from the get go.

It begins rather strangely if somewhat intriguingly. It seems contrived but your willing to go along with the muscle bound albino dude taking a swig of some gene altering concoction because, you say to yourself, there's good stuff coming that's going to validate this otherwise silly beginning. Don't hold your breath.

The small band of scientists and general morons that have signed on to this mission behave so ridiculously that you don't believe for a second in any part of the story. Fassbender is excellent as the obligatory bad synthetic but never really engages with the rest of the cast so the potential for tension never materializes.

Theron isn't bad either but her character is so harsh and dim witted (as is evidenced by her inability to run in a perpendicular direction from the rolling donut) that she's not missed in the slightest by the time she is squished like a bug.

Everyone else dies for varying degrees of stupidity. And by the end Repace trots off with Fassbenders head in a sack. What?

All of the money and tech at Scott's disposal and this is the best they could do? It's a tragedy wrapped in a comedy inside of a farce. Mainly it's a waste.","3"
"jesse-hitzroth","Prometheus is sort of a let down.","9 June 2012","I had such high hopes for this movie since i first heard about it and i finally saw it and........I was let down. The script is awful, simply put. There are some plot holes and even worse questions that never get answered. This movie really does not have all that much to do with the 'Alien' films until the ending. It seems like a complete cop out. My main problem i just all the questions left unanswered and the brief reasoning behind some of the explanations are just soooo......well stupid. Now don't get me wrong the movie is not god-awful by any means. I did enjoy it, but it's just the script is so bad. I was wondering why Ridley Scott did not write the script. Instead some Hack from Lost wrote it. Go figure a TV show where nothing is explained and once again translate that over to film. Prometheus is one hell of a good looking film in fact one of the best looking films I have seen. I hate 3d but they really did a great job with it. The direction and cinematography is beautifully done. Overall i think most fans will be let down. maybe next time let someone competent write the script.","7"
"Riddle_Of_Steel","Watch the EXTRAS and DELETED SCENES","15 June 2012","There are still stupid parts to this movie-- i.e. running away from a rolling tire in a straight line, and these do not fix all of them, so much as to help to ""grease the wheels"" and ease the delivery of them.

I had to watch Prometheus twice to appreciate it. I wanted to choke Ridley Scott out the first time I saw it, but fell in love with it the second time when I watched it with no expectations.

You have to accept that these days, nobody will pay $160 million to make a movie that only a handful of hard core sci-fi buffs will go see and appreciate.

He made it clear this movie is only LOOSELY CONNECTED to Alien. It takes place in the same universe, but is its own genre, its own mood, its own story to tell. He may never connect the two story lines, the way Battle for Endor exists in the same universe as Star Wars but does not intersect plotwise.

The DELETED SCENES and WEYLAND FILES fill in a lot of gaps:

============================ >>>>1) VICKERS IS AN ANDROID ==============

She was quick to please at the suggestion she was an android. In the deleted scenes, she has an extended conversation with Peter-- and talks about how she was once attracted to him and found respect in his face, but now...he's an old crone. The ""father"" comment was not a poor rendition of even poorer George Lucasism, rather, a below the belt jab at Peter. She was pointing out that he created her as a plaything, but is actually a pedophile as he is technically her father.

Ridley likes to toy with the concept of androids having immature emotional responses due to a lack of a past set of memories. Her jealousy of David is also evidence, as Peter trusts him mo0re with intellectual matters.

======================= >>>>2) LV-426 vs LV-223 =======================

In the WEYLAND FILES, Peter specifies in his notes that they are actually receiving a weak signal from nearby LV-426, but only David knows this as well.

From the start, he knows the real bio-weapons prize awaits on LV-426, while he is taking ""the doctors"" (whom he views as naive fools) to LV-223 to find some technology they can sink their hooks into to extend his life.

========================== >>>>3) THE GOO IS A WEAPON ==================

The goo is a mutagen that turns the victim into a parasite and brings about the Xeno-form.

If you watch the deleted scenes, the Engineers know about the Xenomorph-- besides the wall shrine of a xeno in the goo storage room, Fifield and Milton find a shedded xeno skin on the floor in the pyramid. Also, all the dead Engineers in the body pile had familiar ""exploded from inside"" apertures on them.

========== >>>>4) HOW DID THE SQUID GET SO BIG? ========================

This was a major problem for me. Not only how did it get bigger, but didn't anyone else notice a wriggling thing in the auto-doc?

In the extended Vickers/Peter scene, she mentions that if he goes down to the planet, he will die, and that he should hear ""that thing squealing in the room next door"".

They found Shaw's ""baby"" and were probably studying it, keeping it alive, and feeding it. Or it got loose and ate the people studying it.

Either way, Weyland's people knew about it and had it in their possession prior to us meeting it again later.

============================ >>>>5) RETARD PETTING SNAKES ==============

This one is not a justification, but it helped make Milton's foolhardy attempts at petting a worm seem less abrupt.

There was a deleted scene where he finds some of those little worm things in the soil and has an emotional upheaval over finding the first non-unicellular extra-terrestrial life.

These ones were stupid and docile, and allowed him to hold them in his hand and pet them. After being exposed to the goo, they changed a bit in their demeanor.

======================= >>>>RELAX ======================================

...And watch the movie again. You might find yourself liking it the second time around.

All the music that I love most now-- I hated when I first heard it. It was a good movie, but did not spell things out for the audience.

Also, I think 20th Century Fox had more to do with it than Ridley Scott. They pushed for PG-13 rating from the start, and if you watch the deleted scenes, it is clear they add more edge to the movie and it they tried to make it more kid-friendly.","8"

Alluding to a fantastic tale of human origin, alluding to questions that we have always been looking for answers to. With such high expectations I entered the theater to witness what I said to my friends would be a phenomenon. I was so wrong. This is just another alien movie minus the chills and the thrills. The premise of the movie is good and the opening scene promises so much but the second half goes south from there. Some questions that will be left unanswered are.. What is David's motivation for doing what he does? that question is alluded to vaguely in the beginning of the movie; he is learning all sorts of new languages and watching old Hollywood movies. Maybe he got influenced by all the movies he watched. I dunno, it felt stupid to me. Why were they not carrying weapons with them when they went to free the Engineer. How could they assume that he would not be hostile given the fact that he was found aboard a ship carrying weapons of mass destruction, especially those meant to destroy humans. Wasn't that bloody evident? What would you do if a mysterious snake like creature were to appear out of a pool of dark murky liquid, surely not try to play around with it. You would run screaming and urinating in your pants. How the hell did Guy Pearce's, Mr. Weyland think the engineers would reinvigorate him? And last but not the least why did the Engineers want to kill us? Is it because of our BO? or were they part of a terrorist outfit. Did we step on their toes by mistake in their dreams? were they angry because they knew that puny miss Noomi would be the only survivor in the end and that the end would be a dud. So many questions, no answers. Wait for the sequel - Prometheus 2.

"kluseba","A good average science-fiction movie that doesn't come close to the Alien films","22 July 2014","""Prometheus"" is a prequel to the revolutionary ""Alien"" movies and explains how the bleak creature created by surrealist designer, painter and sculptor H.R. Giger came to life. In addition to this, the film introduces us to the creators of mankind who were eventually planning to extinguish their own creation but failed to do so. You might want to know that the ending of this film has a cliffhanger and leads to a possible second part of this prequel where we could find out why the creators of mankind wanted to destroy their own work and where the new-born Alien creature could evolve to what it might become one day.

To be honest, ""Prometheus"" doesn't come close to the atmosphere of the first two Alien movies and is maybe on the same level as the fourth Alien movie and slightly better than the rather disappointing third film. There are several reasons why this new movie is only a good average movie at best.

First of all, all actors apart of the talented Noomi Rapace are really weak and exchangeable. This might also be due to an unimaginative script. As viewers, one doesn't really care enough about the fate of the different characters to get an emotional connection to the film and to really get into it. The original movies were much more convincing from that point of view.

This leads me to the second biggest flaw. The story of the movie is predictable and has been used in a similar way many times before. I don't mean the obvious creation of the Alien but the evolution of the different characters and a very predictable twist in the last third of the film. The script really feels as if a young science-fiction fan borrowed bits and pieces from famous genre films and put them together to a new half-hearted movie.

Obviously, the movie also has its strengths and you might already guess what they are. First of all, the special effects are obviously very well done. The universe, the more or less deserted planet and the strange cave system on it are very beautiful to watch. The different humanoid creatures as well as the new Alien should also please to fans of the old movies.

The action sequences of this film are nothing extraordinary but very well done. Especially the last third of the movie sets a higher pace and we get to see many mysterious technical holograms, a couple of gripping fighting scenes and obviously a few earthquakes, explosions and storms here and there. After the slow and almost dull pace of the first two thirds of the film, the last part is probably worth the wait.

As I told before, the movie doesn't quite catch up the original movies but it includes at least a couple of atmospheric settings and scenes. These moments especially happen in the bleak cave system on the planet and involve aggressive humanoid aliens and the Alien prototype. These scenes don't come close to the horror of the original but they build up some kind of tension at least. If the movie had included more of these horror moments, it would have been much more gripping.

As it is now, ""Prometheus"" is a good average science-fiction movie that convinces with a strong main actress, great special effects and a vivid last third. I recommend you to experience this movie without comparing it to the Alien movies because you will probably end up being disappointed if you do so. In addition to this, you should only watch this movie if you are ready to watch more sequels of this prequel. In my book, it was a solid movie to watch once but in comparison to the Alien series, I wouldn't necessarily watch this movie again. I must also admit that I wouldn't watch a Sequel to this film or a fifth Alien movie either. Enough is enough and one should leave this great series untouched instead of harming its reputation with more exchangeable scripts.","6"
"Theo Robertson","A Film So Aeasthetically Pleasing The Flaws Don't Matter","27 March 2015","Ridley Scott is one of those auteurs who has a reputation for attention to detail . Everything he does revolves around a visual level so much so that he sometimes forsakes narrative . It's not necessarily a crime and whatever you think about his prolific body of work he often makes beautiful looking films replete with great technical merits . PROMETHEUS probably sums up the Scott style perfectly

In the late 21st Century The Weyland Company finance a multi-national team to find the origins of mankind . A simple premise and while possibly doesn't develop the story to its full potential you're left with the feeling that he doesn't need to . PROMETHEUS was Oscar nominated for its special effects but to be honest it also deserved an armful of other nods for cinematography , editing , production design and make-up . This is an absolutely gorgeous film to look at and watching it on a cinema screen or at the very least on a wide screen TV is more of an experience than a film . There's not a lot happening story wise but this is doesn't matter in the slightest when everything is this good looking . It's also refreshing to see actors playing scientists who give the impression that they're in awe at the beauty of science . They're taking part in the greatest scientific discovery in the history of mankind and they give the impression they're at a landmark in human development

After this slow burning beautiful first half the film then realises what it really is - a prequel to the ALIEN franchise and here the film unravels to an extent . It's by no means dreadful but the pacing is all over the place as characters runaround trying to stay alive , things happen with little explanation and set-pieces involving spectacle then starts taking precedence over everything else which is something of a pity since I was enjoying the moody , atmospheric and mysterious first half . Perhaps worst of all the audience are then left with the headline that we'll be getting a sequel down the pipeline somewhere . On top of this I've recently learned we're also getting yet another ALIEN sequel ! Are we really crying out for that ? As it stands PROMETHEUS is an uneven film that's mostly enjoyable but one had hoped for a self contained movie with a more ambiguous ending","7"

One thing I do not understand that,who on earth gave 7.3 stars to this god awful film!! The plot is there; starts out beautifully but ends up in a disaster.One cannot help but think why the studio didn't give this to Jim Cameron to direct, at least he wouldn't do the mistakes that Ridley has done. Being the sucker I am, I went out and bought the newly released DVD knowing that Ridley was always moaning about the studios interference on his films and cutting out scenes, that he would make a Directors Cut of it.Result; no he didn't ,its the same old crap. It looks like there will be a sequel,Prometeus II, our Miss Shaw ( the hopping,jumping jack rabbit with staples on her stomach ) has taken off with the so called engineers spaceship with Davids head as her guide are most probably going to pay the engineers planet a visit. So I beg you,Ridley,here is a chance if you are the director (hope you are not) to at least come up with a decent plot.","1"
"MUFCOK","A mess of a movie which started strongly but quickly turned sour.","23 July 2015","The movie experience for me was split into two parts, beginning and end. I was entertained throughout the first half, it kept my attention and I felt immersed into the film. A sense of mystery was kept; when they arrived onto the island clues were discovered and questions were unanswered, it felt like the movie was heading into a direction that I liked. At around half way through Prometheus, the film took a massive nose dive. It spiralled out of control into a complete mess, question after question was asked and no answers were forthcoming. The action scenes were acceptable however the long, dull and confusing dialogue scenes were too often.

Characters acted with complete stupidity, performing actions which left you laughing at how senseless they were. I found myself not caring for a single character in this movie which is a shame because for me that is a bare minimum that I expect from a film that delves into emotional based dialogue and characters feelings.

The only positive which remained throughout was the faultless visuals. The shots on the island, along the desert landscape and deep into the dark caves were very impressive. There was a certain scene with a sandstorm, where the crew were fleeing from it and it looked especially remarkable.

I was unaware that Prometheus was related to The Alien franchise when viewing this and having not seen those movies I can't comment on its resemblance to those, but from reading other people reviews I believe that it is quite insulting.

Overall, I enjoyed the first half of Prometheus; It started strongly and maintained some tension. Sadly the tension lead to nothing and all the questions which are asked in the first half were far from answered in the second half. Very disappointing.

I will say though that the film could have been cut down less and have had things explained a little better. Not for me but for the whiners.

When we look at the making of the film, we see that their goal was to give answers to the unexplained things of the first. What is also a quality in a film, because it gives the viewer something to question. The problem is that they have put these unresolved questions on the table and have randomly arranged the answers, which gives this fuzzy scenario and makes it indigestible. They focused on giving answers instead of creating an original, engaging story that makes us tickle with the characters. Result: a soulless and harmless film with which one can always theorize and explain the semi-proven infos. But this is only the mind walking its way in a labyrinth. A good film transports us, raises us and feeds us, including a thriller. This film encloses us in a wriggle whose answer is without interest. The goal being ambitious: the origins of life. But at no time did I feel the slightest chill on this subject. A tortuous story and irrational characters prevent any involvement.

This contrasts so much with the immense qualities of Alien the 8th passenger, a scenario that has passed through many hands and which in its time was innovative, that makes it dizzy.","2"
"archer4hire","A very mysterious movie. But not in a very good way.","13 April 2013","I absolutely love the first two Alien(s) movies, and at least like all of the rest, in a popcorn kind of way. This one is enjoyable in many ways, but I can see why many people got so worked up hating it. It's got flaws.

Good points: Very cool special effects. Some of the same buildup of creepiness that you felt in Alien/Aliens. Good to get the backstory on the Weyland corporation.

Bad points: Characters do things that make absolutely no sense. The last time I saw space explorers test the air on an alien planet by taking a deep breath was in Galaxy Quest -- and that was a comedy. My 5-year old niece treats broccoli with more caution than these scientists show in handling oozing alien substances. And the way they go around an alien-built complex randomly pushing buttons and opening containers made me laugh. What could go wrong?

My biggest issue with this movie, however, was that there is no real protagonist. The main characters are not particularly smart, gutsy, appealing or virtuous. There's a Hicks-like character who appears near the end, but where's the Ripley-equivalent character? The main character, a bit of a helpless scientist, manages to live to the end of the movie, but seems to do so mostly by blind luck. She's literally a bystander in what I assume were meant to be some key scenes near the end.

For that matter, there's hardly even a villain. Most of the bad guys aren't so much sinister as just kind of small-mindedly violent, including the big albino aliens. It felt like they made the movie with whatever aliens showed up at the casting call.

All that being said, this was visually very interesting, and at the very least it made me curious about where the story will go. Please, please let it go somewhere coherent!",NA
"matej-trkanjec-133-920386","Curiosity killed the cat","1 July 2012","Alien, Gladiator, Blade Runner... are just some of the movies from the genius mind of Ridley Scott. He returns to his original genre(SF-horror) with this disturbing and earth shaking masterpiece. Since it is crucial that I do not disclose any information regarding the story, I will just say that it takes a lot of concentration to understand what is happening. Interestingly, the movie can be watched either as an Alien prequel or a completely new movie. Either way, one will not be disappointed. The subsidiarity of the alien franchise is present, but to completely see it one must be very concentrated on the background and extremely familiar with the original franchise. The main story is something that disturbs from the very start. If I would have to summarize it I would say: they kept digging, and they didn't like what they found. I was sitting in the cinema and as the movie progressed I was thinking - maybe some things should never be discovered. Maybe it is best not to know some things. As the last part of the movie starts (last 40 min) one will find himself on the edge of his seat. Pain, claustrophobia, screams, blood, and the thing that shocked the most - the music. Imagine an orchestra that simulates human screams. That is the sound of the movie's last 40 min. Such a powerful and fascinating nerve breaking ending (that was a bit too long and with a clichéd last scene) I haven't seen in a while. The acting was brilliant. Scott again gives so much power to the female characters that one falls in love with either Charlize or Noomi. In my case, I fell in love with both. Idris Elba also gave a powerful performance, but the best performance was given by Michael Fassbender. Cold, heartless, ruthless, soulless. He caught the essence of what his character should have been. The questions. The movie answers a lot of questions but it raises a bunch of others. Some of them were so powerful that a philosophical debate between me and my friends arose after the movie ended. Even though the movie has its flaws, even though it is predictable at times, and deals with issues that were a core of a bunch of other movies, it is an essential and so far the best movie of the year. It is not just a movie, it is a new age philosophy that questions everything - especially us and our need to know the answers even if the answers are not to our liking.","10"

"balder777","Ridley Scott at his best, underrated film.","14 June 2022","In this film, Ridley Scott mixes thought provoking science fiction with the classic gore body-horror sci-fi of his Alien film.

IMHO he succeeds though he misfires somewhat. The cast is amazing and full of stars (Charlize Theron, etc), but the strong protagonist (Noomi Rapace) is the highlight, she is just perfect (and it's a huge shame she does not appear in the sequel to this film).

The body-horror Alien moments are also top notch and horrifying.

Where does this misfire? As with the Alien Covenant sequel, it feels like Ridley Scott is trying to ask deep questions but the end result ends up half baked and feeling dumb. To avoid spoiling too much: We start with an interesting premise (the origin of humanity) and we end up with body-ripping Aliens and people who take pretty dumb actions.

But altogether, it's a nice effort that will be appreciated by all fans of the Alien franchise and of sci-fi horror in general.","7"
"rgkarim","So Many Unanswered Questions","9 June 2012","Science fiction and horror, two genres that when mixed together usually wind up in Scy Fy channel massacre that is predictable, cheesy, and often generally boring. Despite the sea of mediocrity though, some directors know how to make a scary science fiction movie, i.e. Alien and Predator. So when I saw Ridley Scott was making an attempt at the genre I couldn't help but think another winner was upon us. Was this movie, titled Prometheus, a worthy addition to great science fiction/horror genre? The answer for me is not really. To hear more about my thoughts please keep on reading.

If you've seen the trailers then you will see that Prometheus is tale about a group of human scientists and engineers who set sail for the stars after discovering an ancient map. The goal of their mission is to discover the origins of the human race. Upon arrival to the coordinates, the team discovers something much more sinister and terrifying than they ever imagined, something that if left unchecked could destroy the very foundation of human life. This is the tale of Prometheus.

To start this review off we should answer the question as to whether this movie lives up to the fear potential the trailers promised. Hate to say it, but it was not really that scary, and for me was more humorous than anything. Many of the jump at you scary scenes were predictable, which took away from the scare factor. The dark and dismal tunnels were actually well lit for a horror movie, and didn't hold many terrors within its shadowy walls, making the movie feel more like a spelunking adventure than anything else. What replaced the horror was instead a creepy and sometimes cringing atmosphere that at some points was very disturbing to see. The creatures within had more graphic and primitive kills, which the movie was happy to show every detail. A few scenes in the movie I felt took the graphicness too far again showing a lot of detail, and blood, to turn a lot of stomachs. There were also a few attempts to scare/creep out the audience that failed to be anything, but cheesy violent outbursts that were used to do nothing more than kill off crew members.

What other weaknesses can I pick out for this movie? I think the biggest weakness of them all was the lack of explanation for a lot of things in the movie. At various points in the movie, Scott and his team touched base on a variety of topics that had the potential to be interesting and shocking. However, this slight scratch of the surface was all that really happened. Instead of elaborating or explaining any origin to the various incidents that happened, they left the audience in the dark and left to piece out the information on their own. While some things can be somewhat figured out, there is a lot of uncertainty and vagueness that leaves the audience wanting more, which hints at a possible sequel. Perhaps what makes this lack of explanation even more disappointing is the potential the movie has as the crew prepares to disembark the ship. In a manner very similar to Aliens, the crew preps very familiar weapons and equipment for the unknowns of the barren world. However, rather than live up to that potential, Prometheus marginally uses these tools for anything and instead is filled with nothing more than screaming scientists. This brings me to my next point, a majority of this ""smart"" crew didn't make the best decisions and instead they felt more like airheaded teenagers in a slasher movie. The exceptions to the rule were the characters played by Michael Fassbender, Noomi Rapace, and Idris Elba who did good work portraying competent and noble characters. Fassbender in particular had the most diverse character of the crew, capturing the deceptive, curious nature to a letter, while still managing to add some comedy to the mix as well. Rapace's character did a little more crying than I expected, but she still managed to play a scientist who uses logic until pushed to the breaking point. Those wondering about Charlize Theron in this movie may be disappointed to learn that her character really doesn't have a big role to play in this movie, at least not a very deep role. Although she had the serious captain attitude down to the letter, Theron really didn't do much other than walk around the ship and scream for the crew not to do anything. On the occasion she actually did something, well it was okay, but they made her character pretty stupid at points.

Okay so other than some decent acting there are a few positive aspects to this film I wish to share as well. For one thing the team did a nice job with the visuals and settings to really paint an alien tomb that is somewhat freaky. Combine this with some well-fitting orchestra music and some well edited shots and you get some strong feelings of pride, curiosity, and some creepiness. A few of the creatures were even well designed to look real as opposed to looking like some digital blob that is obviously fake. Some of the dialog is fitting for the characters as well, as the writers used jargon and lingos that were accurate of a scientist/engineer.

Overall Prometheus is okay, though its vague information really leaves you wanting more by the end of the two hours. With very little horror and use of some of the Alien series props, this movie for me was not worth the wait. So my suggestion is to wait on this movie for Netflix or Redbox before giving it a try. My scores for the movie are the following: Action/Horror/Science Fiction: 6.5-7.0 Movie Overall: 5.5-6.0 So until next time my friends, keep enjoying the movies and check back soon for my next review.","6"
"umme4uke","Spoiler laden review for Alien fans","7 June 2012","Prometheus is an entertaining, adult Sci-Fi epic with some dark overtones. It is not a horror film crafted for scares. It's not a last stand of against the space bugs crowd pleaser. It is not a bleak, sombre portrayal of a heroine's death. Nor is it a gory, tongue in cheek space adventure on the perils of cloning. It is Science Fiction action for the thinking audience and, considering how diverse the group of films it is a part of is, how anyone can suggest it doesn't fit is beyond me.

I had a lot of information going into my first viewing of Prometheus and I enjoyed it way more than I thought I would. The 2hr run time flew by. I knew the plot and I still had fun. I was afraid I'd cringe at certain scenes and they ended up playing fine. The film is so dense with story and visual stimuli that you can easily be swept up in it.

It actually made me happy, when the film ended, that I'd seen a film that had been designed with adult science fiction fans in mind. It is beautifully refreshing alongside Transformers, Battleships and all the dumb super hero films that muscle opposition out of the cinema nowadays.

Noomi Rapace plays Shaw, a scientist of spiritual faith, whose backstory is revealed as the plot advances. The character is complex and well-acted, to a level I'm afraid many viewers will overlook. Her strength is on the inside, she is not aggressive or assertive in a standard movie heroin way. Her partner is Holloway, played by Logan Marshall Green. In contrast, he is aggressive and assertive, which ends up working against him and Shaw. Though this couple shares a similar dream – to meet our makers – their reasons for believing that our makers exist is different. Further, though this couple's dream and their discoveries act as a catalyst for the plot in the film, their actions do not drive the events.

Events in the film are driven by David, a synthetic human played by Michael Fassbender. David is by far the most engaging character in the film. Much like his and his father's source of inspiration – TE Lawrence – David is torn between covertly serving his creators and understanding the technology of his creator's creators.

Charlize Theron's character Vickers' icy exterior is played in contrast to Idris Elba's Janek, whose relaxed, boyish exterior hides a dominant, determined strength. I could buy it entirely when Janek sacrificed himself to save human kind. I could also buy that his flight crew would stand by him. He was that kind of guy, a likable Alpha male. His charms were enough to win Vickers over, a woman his flight crew were enamoured by, so it made perfect sense that they saw Janek as 'da man'.

Sean Harris' Fifield and Rafe Spall's Milburn humanise early scenes with humour, becoming more 'people' in a mentally overwhelming situation than attempting to do their jobs. This brings me to something I appreciated in the film, the actors play people and not a believer, scientist, doctor, geologist, biologist and so on. Were Spock and Bones engaging because they were a scientist and doctor or because they were characters that reacted to situations in their own way?

Main Characters aside, I'll move onto the story. You can't get more epic in scope than who made us and why are we here. It's also a question you can't really answer because that answer is likely going to be different for each individual. Prometheus does not answer the question, well not fully, anyway. It answers with ideas.

Who made us? Statuesque blue humanoids from space called the engineers. Do we see them explicitly make us? No. Is it implied? Heavily. Why did the engineers make us? It's not entirely clear, what is clear is that the planet they 'invited' us to became a weapons installation around 2000 years ago. Did they plan to destroy us? The implication is yes. Why didn't they? Something went wrong. What? The implication is their weapon got out of control. What is their weapon? The creature from Alien is definitely related to it, if not the ultimate form of it.

If this plot seems too obscure for you, you will likely be annoyed by Prometheus. But ask yourself, what did you really love about Alien? Did you ever know exactly what the creature was as Ridley presented it? No, you didn't, Cameron turned it into a bug with a life cycle. Where did that creature come from? An egg, on a ship, with another alien thing. That is all you ever knew.

After Prometheus you know that the other alien thing is humanoid and related to a race that likely made us. You also know that the humanoid thing may have made the alien to destroy our race. It's actually a fairly neat closure. Explains why the xenomorph is so anthropomorphic. Explains why the SJ had such sad humanoid eyes. Explains why Weyland corp was so interested in the life form as a weapon – it's the weapon that our gods made!

In some ways, Prometheus is closer to Alien than any other film in the franchise. In other ways, it is totally different. By itself, it is an intelligent Sci Fi adventure that is fun to watch.

Was some of it cut? Most likely. It seems some gore was trimmed for a PG rating it never achieved. This just makes me want the Blu-Ray more.

My rating for it increases the more I think about it. I'd give it 85% now and I can't wait to see it again to find out if that rating increases. One of the mates who saw it with me has already expressed they are keen for another viewing and, considering I have no doubt it is the best thing showing ATM, why the hell not?","5"
"mckenzie-boyle","Failing to Answer Any of The Questions It Asks","19 September 2020","There is a lot about this movie that requires a little bit more suspension of disbelief than your average sci-fi flick. From biologists who have zero interest in biology, to standard scientific and archeological practices being completely ignored by all of the scientists. Many of the actions and motivations of the characters don't seem to fit with who they are supposed to be, and the viewer is frequently left thinking, ""why would they do that?""

However, leaving aside the many and frequent breaks from immersion this film offers, the real problems are revealed to be deeper, and the biggest one becomes apparent: it had no real direction. From the get go, the plot seemed to meander around, absently playing with a few ideas that it never really fleshed out, and asking big questions it never actually answered. This lack of direction compounds as the film reaches its climax, and causes it to fall quite short. Moments that should have been impactful and emotional where instead tepid and unmoving. The issue, I believe, is that the plot was never fully fleshed out to begin with. They started with this vague analogy of Prometheus giving humanity fire, representing the 'engineers' creating mankind, and it never really evolves beyond that half-hearted metaphor. What we're left with is a movie thats not really about anything in the broader sense. The entire plot could be summed up with this: some people go to an alien world to find ancient aliens, they find one and it kills all of them except one, who then decides to go to the alien home world, the end. And reading that, you've essentially already seen Prometheus. Truly, the only important moments in the entire film were those last few, where Dr. Shaw makes that fateful decision. You almost didn't even need the rest of the movie.

Overall, it's a meandering, directionless mess of a movie that doesn't answer any of the questions it asks. But I suppose if you need something to kill a few hours, you could do worse.","4"
"Krome","Was it Bring Your Kids To Work Day at the studio?","6 June 2012","If The Archers on BBC Radio 4, billed as ""an everyday story of country folk"" has an Agricultural Consultant credited at the end of every episode, why couldn't the producers of this, a $130m movie, at least have asked a primary school Physics student if the science looked a bit dodgy? They'd probably have done it for a couple of Mars bars.

Surely the cheapest part of virtually every blockbuster is the script. A five-year-old could point out the holes in this one with one finger up their nose and half an eye on the Teletubbies.

Why can't film-makers, with a few notable exceptions like Duncan Jones, realise that the entire universe of a story falls apart without consistency and reason, at least within the ""laws"" of a particular movie? Presuming your entire audience are morons who just gape at the screen with mouths sagging open, constantly stuffing in over-priced popcorn to soak up the drool just pisses off the ones who have actually looked forward to your film, taken the time to schlep down to the cinema and hand over their hard-earned cash to the dead-eyed schlub on the till. OK, perhaps that's just in the Peckhamplex but alienating* the very section of your audience that actually gives a damn about your back catalogue will put them off paying to see anything else you make in the future.

Of course, getting in one of the Lost writers was probably a bit of a dozy idea from the start; not exactly somebody who can be trusted with taught plotting and management of story arc. Ridley, if you can't look after things properly any more then nobody else is going to trust you to look after their money. You could always go back to making Hovis adverts, as long as you get a responsible adult to help you with the tricky bits.

"jadepietro","For Sci-Fi: 10, For Scares: 3","12 June 2012","This film is recommended.

Originally, in Greek mythology, Prometheus was a deity who helped mankind and was later punished by Zeus for his actions. ( Perhaps some fava beans and a nice chianti might have sufficed. ) His quest for scientific knowledge had its own share of risks. In Ridley Scott's latest sci-fi epic, Prometheus, a "" prequel "" to his Alien film series, the director takes his own share of risks as he again goes into this genre, using his mythological DNA as his guide. This time Prometheus is the name of the spacecraft that transports a team of explorers as they go on a journey to find the origins of mankind after an archaeological discovery of artifacts spurs their interests. Instead, they find other hostile lifeforms and enough terror to easily fill two hours in this visually stunning spectacle.

Scott's eagerly awaited and totally over-hyped film has its share of limitations too. Unfortunately, his latest venture simply cannot avoid comparisons to his classic predecessors, Alien or its sequel, Aliens, which are well-deserved classic films of the sci-fi / horror genre. This film never rises to that level of superiority, mainly due to its underwritten characters lost in a formulaic script that seems too caught up in the sci-fi plot mechanics while underplaying the horror film strands. Prometheus is a heady experience, but it rarely allows its characters to emerge with any semblance to real people and the film is in dire need of more scary moments to build to a satisfying climax for its movie-going audience.

However, Prometheus is still worth the trip, if only for its sumptuous art direction by Arthur Max ( widely inspired by the works of H.R. Giger ), its eye-popping CGI, and a delightful performance by Michael Fassbender as David, an android with some HAL 9000 traits and a strong admiration and physical resemblance to a young Peter O'Toole. With atmospheric cinematography by Dariusz Wolski, tension-filled editing by Pietro Scalia, and wonderful use of 3-D holograms creating the illusion of depth of field projections, the film fascinates on a strictly visceral level.

The year is 2093. And surprise...we are not alone! Onboard the spacecraft are our feisty heroine, Elizabeth Shaw ( Noomi Rapace ), his boyfriend Charlie ( Logan Marshall-Green ), a no-nonsense captain named Janek ( Idris Elba ), a businesslike woman aptly named Meredith Vickers ( an underused Charlize Theron ), and the aforementioned David ( Fassbender ), plus other crew members whose sole purpose is to become the main entrée. Of course, these supposedly intelligent adventurers will make foolish and illogical decisions as they go quietly to their doom. We know that they will be systemically picked off, one-by-one, as they encounter these foreign enemies. That's part of the genre, I guess. But does it always have to be that way?

The script, by Jon Spaihts and Damon Lindelof ( of Lost fame ), is a bit of a muddle with its existential ideology, its faith vs. science arguments, and its heavy-handed motives of evil big business and capitalistic greed rearing its ugly head yet again. In fact, some of the characters' actions are never really sufficiently explained. The film tries to integrate these deeper issues with little success. After all, this film is suppose to be an action-packed sci-fi horror creature feature, isn't it? So why dress it up to be something more than it is? More separation of church and state-of-the-arts would have made an more satisfying film experience for its target audience of teenagers and sci-fi aficionados and kept the adrenaline rush at a feverish pace.

Still, there are plenty of thrills, if not genuine scares galore with the gore factor prominently in full view. ( It may not rival John Hurt's stomach popping scene in the original film, but there is one memorable moment that elicited enough squirms and audible groans from audience members, including myself. )

While Prometheus may not be the classic sci-fi fantasy film it strives to be, the film is undoubtedly a technical triumph for Scott and a fine example of stylish filmmaking from a cinematic master at work. GRADE: B

"laszlo-janszky","Too unrealistic","25 August 2013","As biochemical engineer I think this film is very very far from reality.

Just in the beginning the alien drinks the black fluid - their biological weapon - they show us magnified what happens on DNA scale; it cuts DNA into small fragments, but the black fluid is just a black fog with that magnification too... (So it does not consist of molecules like any other material.) After that the alien simply disintegrates, but it does not release any gas, its material just disappears...


In another scene the same black fluid forms multicellular organisms: snake like creatures from the soil which kill two scientists... (They could not decide whether it should cut or build DNA or what?) In that scene a small amount of the snake blood completely resolved a space suit - in a few seconds - which was sandstorm resistant in another scene ... (So fast and corrosive chemical reaction is simply not possible by that conditions.)


After that one drop of the black fluid makes zombie from another scientist and forms an octopus like creature in the uterus of a woman he had sex with... After that the woman had a very fast surgery in an automatic surgery chamber which took the octopus out of her. After that the woman can walk, run, jump easily like nothing would have happened... (Ask somebody who had a similar surgery...) After that the octopus grows rapidly, in a later scene it is bigger than a car, but it does not eat anything...


So by this film the authors did not know basic physical and chemical principles, for example: the principle of mass conservation... I love sci-fi, because it builds upon science, but this film is too far from reality, it's illogical like an LSD dream. If I turn off my brain I can watch it, and sometimes enjoy it, that's why I gave five points instead of one.","5"

If your a fan of Ridley Scott, watch this movie, if you like space and aliens, definitely make time to see this, and if you are into intense movies that are out of this world, this is a MUST see! It's been a while since I've seen a movie that had so many extreme and engrossing scenes as Prometheus. The acting is superb, special effects have never been better, and the story is one that is consuming in a dark and unknown way. This is not a horror movie, this is not a space war movie, it's a movie about explorers looking for answers. Prometheus has some really crazy moments that won't necessarily make you jump scared out of your seat, but will leave you in disbelief as to what you are witnessing. For a movie that is about finding answers, I can't say that at the end I was without some unanswered questions of my own but then again what movie answers all the questions in 2 hours. One of the only gripes I had was I would have liked to of seen more a build up of the characters and Wayland Corp before everyone is found on the ship Prometheus. All that aside, this is a great movie, so go see it!","8"
"Spondonman","I Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For","5 November 2012","Well, back to it again – there's no hope for humanity, as usual only luck can save us from this foreign object. This looks like being a series of prequels to Alien, now delivered digitally so absolutely no laughs for cinema audiences at animatronic dicks being pulled across dinner tables. It's impressive on TV, I would have been bowled over at the pictures – and left doubly depressed too.

This is a tale of a multi-trillion dollar spaceship being carelessly fitted out with a disparate set of lacksadaisical opaque people to find the potential creators of the human race. They find a planet where they expected it and instantly hit on a likely looking alien structure to investigate. It's an intersection of Forbidden Planet, Silent Running, Alien, and Mission To Mars, and at this stage I'm not sure which I prefer. I had to suspend belief in that people were still smoking in 2093, bozos were blithely marching into sinister dark and damp alien spaceship interiors without any cares, and that the Isle Of Skye was not an island made entirely of spent uranium and tarmac. It's hugely impressive and superficial at the same time, so much happens and it seems to say less than Alien did. Favorite bits: the glimpses of the olde film Lawrence Of Arabia with the late great actor Harry Fowler; if it hadn't been so nail-bitingly gruesome I could have laughed at the New Ripley speed abortion, and that she could still do all the acrobatics afterwards; the 3D mapping of the alien structure, although it reminded me of the Great Pyramid I had feared a Close Encounters remix; the Grecian marble-like creators; the  nod to the original robot decapitation; the eye-cutting cgi cartoonery creating a soulless world populated by soulless people; really being quite pleased that nearly all of the characterless characters had bitten the dust.

Hardly any of us know how to make a 5 minute film up to Melies standards, nevertheless most of us are film experts. Some of us only have opinions: this was a cold film which was very enjoyable and very forgettable.","7"
"engg-omer","A movie only few could like","24 January 2013","3/10 because of the CGI, and the first half an hour. It is all downhill from there with little thought put into it.

Scientists that don't act like scientists, a less than average dimwit would outsmart them. There is no purpose for any action, no motivation for the actors to behave or act in a certain manner.

The movie has no plot or too many plots ( i didn't get any of them!) , no character-buildup , no purpose, filled with movie moments from badly made horror movies.

I could only think of a movie like ""Skyline"" from 2010, which carried similar direction-less plot. Had a great trailer and nothing to offer movie-wise.

If you are expecting to view something that makes you think long after it ends, this could still be for you. You will have a million questions like 1. why would they do that? 2. why did this happen? 3. why didn't that happen? And if you have a group of friends that love tearing apart a bad movie, this would be a number one choice.","3"
"bicycular","A Visually Stunning but Ambitious Sci-Fi Odyssey","11 May 2023","Prometheus, directed by Ridley Scott, is a visually breathtaking science fiction film that attempts to explore profound existential questions within the framework of a prequel to the iconic Alien franchise. While it showcases Scott's exceptional eye for visuals and boasts a talented cast, the film's lofty ambitions sometimes overshadow its execution, leaving viewers with a mixed experience.

From the very first frame, Prometheus immerses audiences in a visually stunning world. The production design is awe-inspiring, with intricate spacecraft interiors, alien landscapes, and mesmerizing special effects. Scott's knack for creating atmospheric and immersive environments shines through, enveloping viewers in a sense of grandeur and wonder.

The film benefits from a strong ensemble cast, including Noomi Rapace, Michael Fassbender, and Charlize Theron. Rapace delivers a compelling performance as the determined and resourceful scientist Elizabeth Shaw, while Fassbender captivates as the enigmatic android David. Theron brings a cool and calculated presence to her role as a corporate representative. The performances anchor the film, adding depth to their respective characters and driving the narrative forward.

Prometheus attempts to delve into weighty themes such as the origin of life, the pursuit of knowledge, and humanity's relationship with its creators. It poses philosophical questions that are thought-provoking but sometimes feels muddled in their execution. The film's ambitious narrative ultimately struggles to strike a balance between exploration and delivering concrete answers, leaving certain plot points and character motivations frustratingly ambiguous.

While Prometheus succeeds in creating moments of tension and suspense, it also suffers from narrative inconsistencies and questionable character decisions. Some plot developments feel contrived, and character motivations can be murky or inconsistent. As a result, the story occasionally loses its momentum and fails to fully engage the audience, detracting from the overall experience.

Despite its narrative flaws, Prometheus remains a visually captivating film with standout moments of sci-fi horror. The film's visual effects and cinematography are exceptional, immersing viewers in an otherworldly and eerie atmosphere. The pulsating score, composed by Marc Streitenfeld, enhances the tension and adds to the film's sense of foreboding.

Prometheus serves as a visually ambitious attempt to expand the Alien universe and tackle profound questions about humanity's origins. While it falls short in delivering a cohesive and fully satisfying narrative, it remains an intriguing and visually impressive entry in the science fiction genre. For fans of Ridley Scott's atmospheric filmmaking and those willing to embrace its philosophical musings, Prometheus offers a visually stunning, albeit flawed, cinematic experience.","6"
"lanechaffin-964-63190","Garbage","25 June 2022","Somewhat intrigued by the synopsis and favorable reviews, we decided to watch this. Almost from the start however I was turned off. Why is it that so many movies like to show people throwing up? As the crew awakens and the barfing starts I had an inkling it wouldn't be long before I too would be throwing up. I watched until the c-section and then went to bed. My wife watched the rest of the movie and told me about it the next morning, her score also 2. Although the ending helps a little to salvage something, it still just isn't very satisfying.

I never could warm up to the actors and their roles. Noomi Rapace was okay, but she was basically unsupported. Yes the elements are here for an interesting movie, but it fails on several fronts. It's a movie with a start and an ending and garbage filler in between. Some good ideas and scenes are squandered for minimal gain. The clownish banter from the exploration crew to Prometheus is ridiculously out of place. This is not a comedy. And it isn't acted or written well enough to get away with that like John Carpenter's The Thing.","2"
"jdkraus","Dazzling, impressive, unique...it stands out as its own but it's not a classic","9 June 2012","I anticipated that ""Prometheus"" was going to be about the xenomorphs that we had seen in the Alien series. Yes, there is a tie in (for this is the prequel), yet ""Prometheus"" is not so much about the origin of the xenomorphs. Instead, this film's central plot is the search for the origin of human life. In a similar tradition to Ridley Scott's 1979 ""Alien"" a group of explorers land on an unknown planet. They search for answers and uncover a mystery that is terrifying and it leads to a race for survival.

""Prometheus"" is dazzling on the big screen with its awe inspiring special effects, exquisite set pieces, foreboding lighting, and graphic make up design. The story is interesting and it keeps the film going. We learn who our makers are; the movie clearly shows that life is no more than a genetic mutation. However, many questions are still unanswered and it leaves the audience anticipating a sequel. I will note that I have just re-watched the original ""Alien"" film and many dots are tied in now.

""Prometheus"" is really a completely different film from ""Alien"" in regards to theme and plot. Even so, I cannot help but compare the two of them. The success in Scott's 1979 film is the terror of the monster, the long moments of silence that suddenly burst into violence, and the strong character developments of Ripley, Dallas, and Parker. ""Prometheus"" relies more on its visual style and unique story. This movie simply lacks the fear that we saw more than 30 years ago. In addition, the characters are not given enough time to flesh out. When most of them die, we merely nod our heads, expecting the imminent carnage.

I am not saying the cast is bad. In fact, they are good. Michael Fassbender gives a terrific performance as the android David. Idris Elba is particularly amusing as the ship's captain and Charlize Theron plays a good, unbecoming overseer of the expedition project. Noomi Rapace is a decent actress and she is okay as the lead scientist Shaw. However, she does not deliver the intensity that I have seen in Sigourney Weaver.

Though ""Prometheus"" does not have the horror and characters Scott has been able to deliver in the past, this sci-fi adventure is still impressive. It hurts me that so many people in my theater scoffed at this movie. Then again, most of them were teenagers who do not understand that there are other sci-fi films that do not involve death rays and stuff getting blown up. This feature has left something for me to think aboutin a good way.","9"
"BigWhiskers","Disappointing and over-hyped","9 June 2012","The whole premise sounded exciting but it really is all about eye-candy and a few gross out scares. The story about where we came from and how it ties into the Alien franchise is one big overblown mess. From the discovery of ancient wall paintings to going to a planet that is similar in appearance and location as to the one in Alien. A group of space explorers including the founder of the Weyland group travel to a planet far out into space to find the meaning of our origins only to discover in horror that the beings they find are not benevolent and also carrying a cargo of bio-weapons gone crazy. The references to Alien are there especially the ending which serves as somewhat of a prequel to the original Alien. However the planet is not the same one that Ripley and her crew travel to in the first Alien movie hinting that these engineers had ships crash on other moons orbiting the same planet as the LV designations indicate.

The biggest problem is so many plot elements are not explained or explored enough - we find out that the engineers DNA is a match for ours and that they may have created us but why are they carrying these Alien type creatures , why is one of them still hibernating ,what caused them to crash , and are they coming back to destroy the human race or ? At the end of the movie the lone survivor issues a warning to others to stay away and that she is going off on another engineers ship to find out where they came from and then the Alien chestburster finale. We all know that Ripleys crew received a beacon from a planet that turned out to be a warning to stay away however it was not the planet in this movie so who left that warning beacon and it's quite obvious in the first movie that an engineer died from a chestburster so someone must have found that ship before Ripleys crew and left a warning - it wasn't the engineers as she was able to decipher it and also how does the android David know about the black containers on the engineers ship and seems to know about the life they contain? So many unanswered questions and so many jumpy scenes . I was disappointed 5/10","5"
"primevalsoup","Excellent film set in Alien universe, with a different emphasis","3 June 2012","I loved this film. It's a different beast to the other films sent in the Alien universe. Of all those that have been made before, it feels most like Alien 1, but the emphasis is not so much on terror, but on an interesting, sinister sci-fi mythology that concerns our origins and that of the Aliens. However, there is horror and violence and gore, which was all done well.

The film does leave questions unanswered - that's fine with me. I didn't know sequels were planned when I watched it and I thought it was great. However, I'm incredibly keen to see what the sequels have to offer.

I thought all the acting, action, cinematography etc was great.

I would give Alien 1 10* because it is the most terrifying film I've ever seen, and it's got a great sci-fi feel too. This film definitely has the great sci-fi feel, and it is disturbing and freaky in a good way. It is not aiming for the terrifying award, and though I'm not sure how to categorise the objective of this film, I suspect it will take sequels to realise whatever that is.

One could criticise the 'science' bits - some are rather dodgy. But what the heck, I didn't notice what little they detracted from the film.","9"

My sister never watches science fiction - when we first hit play on this, she wanted to turn it off. But it was compelling enough, visually and plot wise, to keep a viewer who had no prior interest in science fiction engaged.

"JackTLovesJackD","A sci-fi film that could have been brilliant but wasn't.","16 June 2012","Right, well right off the bat I have to address the huge media ""thing"" which surrounded this movie. Namely.. ""is it a prequel to Alien""? The answer. Yes.. yes it is. The ending has a creature that looks like an alien from the Alien series being ""born"". The end. Sadly this movie has none of the brilliance of Alien or Aliens. It is a movie seemingly designed for children who might sneak in. The dialogue is so clunky, so unbelievably direct in its exposition that it seems almost comical. As I was watching it I felt as if Ridely Scott had perhaps written an intelligent script and had the actors do takes using those lines but then a studio suit had asked him to use the RIDICULOUSLY CLUMSY OBVIOUS EXPLANATORY lines just in case. Then all those lines were used in the final film. I was really expecting this film to be great, and it sucked. Not on a visual level, the visuals were excellent, and not on a performance level because the central part played by Noomi Rapace was fantastic. She deserves an Oscar nod for this... but she also deserved a far better script. To be honest, and cynical to some degree, this film felt like it had been screwed around with and that there might be a much better film somewhere in the editing chambers... or perhaps the chambers of Ridley Scotts mind. I wish I could give this a higher score because I was really looking forward to this picture. But I have to give it a 6. Shame.","5"

I had very high expectations for this film, and it most definitely exceeded them. I don't have any idea why the hell anyone would say they didn't at least thoroughly enjoy this film. Great performances, especially from android Michael Fassbender, who constantly had me wincing at his antics. Did I mention the visual elements? Oh my god. Enough beautifully colored holographic displays to blow any science fiction fans mind. I don't want to say much more than just go out and see this because I don't want anything ruined for you potential viewers. Remember, Roeper gave it 5 stars if that means anything. Don't believe anyone who says this movie sucked, they are obviously very stupid and hard to please. This movie delivered in so many aspects. I am going to pay my money to see this film again. Maybe even a few more times, it was that good. I cannot wait for the sequels to come out.

"pecisk","That strange little living creature inside you - why ""Prometheus"" is better than Alien","1 June 2012","Now I grabbed your attention with this provocative title of my review, we can start.

First of all, why this movie is better than ""Alien"" - well, it's not because I'm dissing or ignoring cult bliss was original movie (and sequel from sci-fi action mastermind Cameroon), not at all. I'm saying this because it's totally different movie.

Bummer, isn't it? Unfortunately, FOX marketing had little choice than market is as Alien prequel, but if you are looking for better ""Alien""/""Aliens"", you are in for disappointment (and what quite a number of internet reviews indicates, you won't be alone in this). Because this movie, while it has very strong horror shocks (girls, you are totally warned for certain scene in this movie, be ready to close your eyes), is totally different beast - with ""brain"" I would say. It is very provocative, much provocative than current Darwinism versus Creationism discussion about our roots - from where we are and what's most importantly, where we are going. It doesn't assume anything, it let's story flow trough scenery and you. And yes, there are questions to be answered, but as any good movie, it rises quite a few itself. It's set in Alien universe, it has lot of common with original, but it goes in totally different direction.

What can and will rise confusion that it feels that something is missing - authors choose quite risky path intentionally not telling whole story (reason why people passionately love/hate movies constructed as flashback series). However, lot of things you will get after very long hours of thinking about this movie - like beauty and significance of the first scene. It is intelligent and enigmatic and can be frustrating as any of your friends-smartypants when they smile secretly and give you small doses of information while refusing to tell big picture in one big swoop.

In visual sense this movie is astonishing masterpiece - this is how space sci-fi should be made, guys (and it's cheaper than Green Lantern). Cinematography, music, sound and crushing performances from Michael Fassbender as droid David (I request an Oscar for this guy) and Noomi Rapace (NOT a Ripley, but with survival instincts and soul on her own) are things what makes this movie instant classic. What most important that waiting for another cinema grandmaster to do 3D has total payback here, Scott has done amazing things with it, first time I didn't want to throw up and run to 2D.

So in nutshell, even if you feel you'll will disappointed because of direction ""Prometheus"" took, go out and check it by yourself, because it's worth admission. Even if you won't like it, it will make you think.

p.s. one interesting thing - yesterday I thought my score will be 8, this morning 9, but now I'm ready to make it to the 10. All because of afterthoughts.","10"
"i_ianchev","Sci-fi goes undercover","6 July 2013","""Let the adventure begin"", says David as the ""Prometheus"" approaches an unknown planet. As our imagination approached the universe of the new sci-fi movie of Ridley Scott too. After watching it several times I finally approach reviewing it. There are so many opinions already, that the sea of information is overwhelming the universe created by Jon Spaihts and Damon Lindelof and its message to the viewers. I personally saw the movie at its premiere and was overwhelmed by the amount of creative power in it. Yes, maybe the plot was too questionable, taking in consideration the expectation of the Alien franchise fans. But did we really get a beautiful sci-fi movie with plot holes and some unfinished side characters and relations between them? Or after watching it several times and taking the time to consider all the possible explanations, we can get the enigmatic biblical and existential messages of the writers. Many sci-fi fans believe that this is far from the suspense and dramatic contradiction of the first Alien movie. And even compared to Scott's Blade runner this is a flat plot and unfinished character universe. But it is not. I tried to think of a way to convince you that this is a unique, ethical and philosophical piece of entertainment. And the best is the view of the believer. No matter what you believe in, you always try to doubt and research your own way into the vastness of...yourself? Yes, I am sure that the best way to dissect this movie is from within. The names of the characters, the topical and spacial focal points of this universe, the relations between the people involved in the mission of ""finding God"" - they all have some biblical origin. This is a movie about the origin of human faith and its endurance. Every person in the plot has his/her/its own way of testing the belief which holds the human mind together. For some it is the weight of money and power. For others its the scientific method of describing what created us humans. And for some, such as Elizabeth and Janek - it is truly the belief in some greater force. Only David is the neutral child which sees all words and actions without reasoning with death. The birth, the parenthood, the social structure of the crew - everything is perceived through the twisted microscope of fear. After all of the preparedness of the human intellect (even with the saintly David created by humans) the humans are not ready to face their fears without losing their humanity. It is not a logical action, but more emotional reaction which saves Earth from holocaust. And even if the Engineers were ready to destroy our species because of some horrible deed which we did 2000 years ago (guess what it is :)), are we ready to admit that we have done something to prove that it is not the right thing to be done? The main message of this film to me is that we are full of questions to which we don't know the answers, but if we find the courage within ourselves to dig deep enough we will find that the godly sparkle which makes us stand the test of time and continue to evolve further is always what to be human is. To be able to always make a choice to believe in something which may not be true, but still makes our lives meaningful and worthy.","9"
"stapledpuppet","Brilliant - Exactly what I hoped for and more!","3 June 2012","I think a lot of people are being very harsh with Prometheus - especially official critics. It's a subtle work of genius, with a lot of unanswered questions - and I think that sort of ""unknowing"" really gets on people's nerves. They want to know everything, have it spoon-fed to them, and not consider the answers to the film's questions themselves.

The film is excellent. I am a HUGE fan of the Alien and Aliens films, and I was really hoping this would follow on in terms of quality, suspense, acting, atmosphere and intrigue. In my honest opinion, it delivered. I felt the acting was brilliant, most notably Michael Fassbender performing so excellently as David 8, the android assistant on board Prometheus. Other actors faired well, delivering believable characters, but with not enough character development in some, but that can also add to the mystery!

Soundtrack was amazing. Camera work was amazing. Atmosphere was spectacular. Suspense was, too say the least, immense. (Can't believe people saying it's not suspenseful!)

So many different, interesting themes popped up - genetic engineering, space, the universe, humanities roots. I really think a lot of thought went into the back-story, and how it all tied together. The fact that not everything was explained just helps build the feeling of eternal strive for knowledge that we humans share, and Noomi Rapace and her partner shared.

My head is constantly reeling with new questions, and self conjured answers, and that's what, for me, makes a great film. I don't want to spoil too much. But I'd just like to say, before people criticize details such as ""walking around after performing a cesarean"" is implausible - remember this: it's Sci-Fi. You don't know what's available to them. Nothing's impossible in FICTION.

Just enter the cinema with an open mind. Enjoy it for what it is, not ""what it could have been."" It breaks a mold. It goes where nobody has dared gone before. Aliens creating humans, but in a film?! WOAH, too far fetched? No! It's science fiction at its best. Ridley Scott is a genius. -- I appreciate this is a bit rambly, but it's great, watch it and you won't be disappointed!","9"

"bonginamassacree","Had potential but blew it.","13 February 2013","Meh..., kinda lame. Too many inconsistencies and bogus ""science"". Not enough hard science fiction. For example, the alien who first disintegrates into the water of ancient Earth to kick-start life supposedly had identical DNA to modern humans. But what about the the other animals on earth? Since he dissolved into the primordial soup, should he not have been an identical match with fish and cats, too? The archaeological-astronomical connection is so pathetic that it is laughable. How would ancient people know about their creators who, rather than visiting them in flying machines, simply put their DNA in the water? The star pattern that is supposedly common to all the archaeological digs across thousands of years is identical, even though the positions of stars is constantly changing (albeit slowly). Then, the stars in that pattern are called a ""system"", even though every amateur astronomer knows that just because two stars may appear very close in the sky, it does not mean that they are actually close or part of the same ""system."". Space is three-dimensional, after all. Equally inept is the treatment of the topography of the alien planet. Unlikely as it may seem, the Prometheus lands practically on top of some pyramid-looking structure, even though there is no beacon that leads them to it. They begin to map the thing out using remote drones only to find out that it is actually horseshoe-shaped, which prompts one genius crew member to exclaim that it is a space ship (I guess because horseshoe-shaped space ships are common by 2090?) But then later in the movie the entire pyramid structure completely disappears and the terrain from which the alien spacecraft takes off looks like a featureless plain.

Moving on to the story, I could see that Ridley Scott wanted to create as interesting a crew for the Prometheus as he did for the Nostromo, or as likable as the marines in Aliens 2, but he failed miserably. About the only crew member that is relatively convincing is the android, David. The rest of them are rather boring. Attempts to give them some life by having them act eccentrically or being aggressive (for no reason) to other crew members, or sleeping around (again, for no reason) falls flat. For a bunch of scientists who go on a trillion-dollar 4-year (assuming round trip) expedition to another planet, they sure are a lot of misfits. They take their helmets off on an alien world, because the ""air was breathable"", completely ignorant of the possibility of alien microbes or other biological dangers, or of the fact that they could be infecting another planet with their bacteria. One is also never quite sure how many crew there are on the Prometheus. People come and go. We are made to think that only 3 of the crew were on board when the ship crashes into the aliens near the end of the movie, but what happened to all those other members of the crew that we did not see die earlier? They were not given the option to evacuate? Or did they die in scenes that have been cut? I could go on and on about the nonsensical plot, which seems more like bad cut & paste job of several pointless sub-plots. Why did the android want to preserve the alien creature inside the lead female character? Speaking of which, why did the implanted alien inside the girl start moving around and bulging out only after she found out that it was inside? Then, when we finally see it, it must be about 15 pounds. How did it fit inside the woman who did not look one day pregnant? Finally, there is the lame lead-in to the Alien movies. Rather then leave it up the the imagination, or make the connection subtle, they overdo it by actually showing the alien space ship resting exactly like it would be later found in Alien, but from like... all angles, in case some moron would not get it. Then, they actually show a creature hatching that looks unmistakably like a forerunner of the aliens from the other movies. Get it now? It's a prequel. Jeeeez.","4"

"kdude12","Good & provocative film despite the complaints that may be fodder for future discussion","15 June 2012","This is a compelling film that faced huge expectations that were probably not matched, but manges to deliver a compelling and engrossing experience. It is true that the film requires a certain suspension of disbelief, much like almost any other science fiction film, but also because there are a few flaws in the plotting, logic and characterizations. These flaws have seriously disgruntled some of the reviewers on IMDb and elsewhere and reduce the impact of the film. Despite those issues, I found the film to be gripping, provocative and visually fascinating. If you are a sci-fi fan, or a fan of the Alien series of films, there is really no question that this is an absolute must-see film.

There is some horrific material and some bizarre things happen, not all of them explained within the movie. This is both frustrating and entertaining, and the extent to which this pleases a viewer is a matter of personal taste. How much to you like being left with unresolved questions in a film?

The movie is not quite as suspenseful as Alien (which for many viewers was one of the most suspense filled movies of the last couple of decades), but it does deliver a continual does of mystery, suspense and awe the the fantastic scenery and environment.

This is not a film that truly provokes genuine philosophical or technical questions (which many viewer had hoped for), but it does raise some entertaining questions about the motives and basis for what's happening in the movie, and as such it pretty much begs for a sequel. Some of the motivation and story is also enriched by reflecting on the classic Greek myth of Prometheus and how it might relate to the story line.

Since watching the film I have vacillated between frustration, annoyance and satisfaction, but in retrospect it has provided more engagement and sustained entertainment than most films I have seen in the recent past, even though some of that engagement was due to hand-wringing about what seem like unrealistic choices.","10"
"mad_mandonna","Not quite the prequel Alien deserved, but then its not really Alien","1 June 2012","Well when Prometheus was announced some time ago I was more than a little excited, one because Alien is one of my all time favourite movies, and two Ridley Scott was directing. All these added together was more than enough to send my anticipation into a frenzy, then the first trailer came out. Oh my lord, that was it, I had to see this film at all costs.

Then something happened, another trailer was released, then another, then another. Then viral videos, then behind the scenes stuff, then more trailers. Then I kinda guessed the storyline and the outcome of the film, and now I've seen it, I was by and large correct. The marketing over load on this film, may have been overkill. Such a shame because the teaser trailer was so promising, but I did still go and watch it and I did still enjoy the film despite guessing the storyline.

Without giving too much away the film is set a few years before the original Alien film and explores the origin of mankind to the far reaches of space, but what they found may not be what they were expecting. One thing that did baffle me slightly was the technology used in the film, it made the future technology seem redundant, as the past seems far better equipped than the future, odd. But then this is both a positive and a negative, the positive being the film looks absolutely stunning, the set pieces are beautiful and detailed, the CGI is fabulous and photo realistic and virtually everything - down to the nearest speck of dust - looks good.

The cast is a nice mix, but character development is missing on most of the crew. The vast majority of them are totally forgettable, so you feel very little for them, something that is usually fatal in a ""horror"" film. But the main guys are great in their roles; Noomi Repace is well cast, though not a scratch on the Ellen Ripley character. Charlize Theron is fine in her cold commanding officer role, but is totally under utilised. But Michael Fassbender is on terrific form and completely steals the show, as the synthetic David.

Where my main issue with Prometheus lies is in its similarity with Alien, its more of remake than a prequel in a way. Thats not to say its exactly the same as Alien, but it feels oddly familiar and strangely lacking in originality despite trying its best to be original. The idea of the crew of Prometheus searching for mankind is very interesting, but in the end comes off as redundant and kinda lame. It tries to steer the film down a certain path, but it comes off more as ridiculous than ingenious. In the end you know what's going to happen which is another problem, and there is no real payoff at the end of the film. Not only that the film seriously lacks scares, the music is too loud and in your face. There is no gentle creeping and no silence to keep you on edge. The film therefore comes across more as a bad action film, than a good horror.

The trouble is Prometheus tried to distance itself from Alien and in doing so made itself less believable and predictable. But in a weird way I did like how they did it, could it have been better, hell yes, but did I ultimately enjoy the film, hell yes.

Prometheus isn't the masterpiece it set out to be. Its not as creepy and horrific as Alien and not as thrilling as Aliens, though it does have its own merits away from the franchise. If a sequel is made I won't be queueing round the block to see it, but I do want to come back for more. So despite a bit of mixed bag, I would still highly recommend Prometheus.","7"

Trying to write a decent review of a film, without just pointing out the obvious flaws, is difficult when talking about Prometheus.

The list begins with:

A plot that is unclear and possibly non existent

Random selection of supporting actors and actresses that are on the screen for just about enough time to catch the first syllable of their name

A script that I could have written, full of clichés and heroic one liners that could have been stolen from a teenage horror movie

Predictable and rather boring action

I could go on...but I think enough would be said with a simple sigh.

There was no need for this film to be shown in 3D either. The action scenes never give the impression you're about to have something thrown out of the cinema screen at you. I presume it was an after thought to compete with titles of a similar grade, possibly Piranha 3DD?

"loco_73","Not the beginning, but a beginning!","15 June 2012","Let me make this clear from the outset, ""Prometheus"" is not a direct prequel to ""Alien"" or the subsequent movies in that franchise. Ridley Scott's established creatures do have a role to play but it is more marginal, more on the fringes of this movie.

This is another visually arresting and well told tale from the mind and vision of legendary director Ridley Scott. This is NOT as I said a prequel per se, but rather an origins story of sort. It deals with larger questions than just the aliens themselves, questions of life, who we are, where do we come from, what is the point of our existence, are we alone in the Universe etc.

Though these are heady and quite fundamental questions, the movie does, in its own way, answer them to some degree. Even the fact that a movie even attempts to grapple with these existential questions these days, is a plus.

In what has been a rather underwhelming year for movies, so far, ""Promotheus"" stands alone, at least in my eyes, as one movie that I can call good, well done, with both style and substance.

Good cast, good direction, eye-popping visuals, good special effects amount to a solid sci-fi movie, or a good movie in general.

I am not going to stand here and brand ""Prometheus"" a masterpiece, or a perfect movie, because it isn't. But in the day and age of expecting movies to constantly disappoint and underwhelm with their mediocrity and lack of quality and vision, ""Promotheus"" at least has that, which is more than I can say for most other movies I've seen so far!","8"

However, the plot is thinner than graphene. The sacrifice scene, that hooks you at the start, is not even slightly explained as the film progresses, it is just abandoned back there in the beginning and left to rot in your mind. The characters are dumb and do inexplicable things. The android dude is like the joker in Batman Dark Knight - 'an agent of chaos' doing inexplicable and horrible things to his crew with no apparent motive. The gigantic alien engineer is dumb and does inexplicable things. The space craft pilots (as usual) inexplicably sacrifice themselves for the good of all mankind although there is no previous record of their character expressing any sort of ideology.

The visuals are good. The music is, well, pretty much non-existent. It has a sort of Close Encounters (i.e. pretentious) quality to it. I could make a more tuneful racket jumping up and down on a cornflakes box.

A film posturing as Alien with none of the depth offered by the original 2+4 (skipping 3) or the likes of Pitch Black. The reason Ridley Scott wants to pretend it is not a prequel to Alien is because he couldn't be bothered to make a good film.

Honestly, this film is not worth writing a review, but is so bad in its context, that I feel compelled to anyway. You needn't deny yourself watching it, if you just want to experience the visual elements - it is worth watching for the clean polished visuals and the 'hint' of intrigue, but just set your expectation-o-meter to its lowest possible value or you will kick yourself.

2 stars from me for pretending to be intriguing and for the visual aspects, but apart from that, this like Indiana Jones 4 will be erased from my memory and my life.","2"

Cast: Wonderful cast and they seem to fit into their roles amazingly, I had absolutely no idea that Guy Pearce was Weyland. The star of the show is undoubtedly Michael Fassbender.

Plot: This is where you will either like it or not, I did, but I thought there could have been just a bit more given in terms of the agenda of those ""Engineers"".

Effects: It's by no means an Avatar, it won't take your breath away when it comes to the special effects, but you don't go away thinking it's exactly a low budget movie either. So I'm in between on this.

Go watch it for yourself and make your own mind up. I know people who thoroughly enjoyed it and have a completely different taste in entertainment to me, and there's others I know who enjoy practically everything I do and yet hated Prometheus.

If you do go to watch it, you'll come out with me questions that need answering, than where actually answered in the movie.","8"
"johodefo","Astonishing animations with little story","15 August 2013","I'm giving it away right at the beginning: The animations and visual effects are astonishing. The story is played out weakly.

The topic of the creation and the creator(s) of human life is obviously deeply philosophic and one of the oldest and most enduring questions of all times. I dare to say that this has been abused as a very thin plot layer beneath the beautiful and mind-blowing pictures we see in this movie.

The characters are not developed, they are actually not even portrayed. We find very rare references to the intentions and motivations of a few of the main characters for joining this mission. We see a ridiculously insipid story of the childhood of Dr. Shaw, another character lets us know that his participation in the journey is only for money.

Story, plot, anyone? I am not talking about underlying intentions and interpretation, I am referring to the superficial action: It is confusing and seems disconnected. Examples? 1) Dr. Shaw learns that she is pregnant with an alien baby. She walks to a surgery machine, lets it remove the ""foreign matter"", then the machine stitches up her stomach, she kills the thing by suffocating it (I assume) and walks away. Apart from occasional groaning we see and learn nothing more about this. 2) On the planet which they are visiting, they see recorded holographic creatures running around in a cave. There is not a single expression of surprise, wonder or any emotion shown. Why this is, how this was triggered, no reflection, nothing.

I simply cannot believe this movie. It is so hollow that I almost felt an urge to watch ""Tree of life"" in order to redeem myself from this pseudo-philosophical experience.","4"

"nickmesafilms","Prometheus (2012) - Big Things Have Small Beginnings!","15 June 2012","It doesn't really matter debating whether ""Prometheus"" is a prequel to ""Alien"" or not, because whether it's a prequel or spin-off to the classic sci-fi thriller, it doesn't change the fact that ""Prometheus"" still shines all on it's own. This is one of the best movies of the year. ""Prometheus"" is a wonderfully entertaining, disgustingly grotesque, and incredibly well-made piece of filmmaking, brought to us by the one and only Ridley Scott. Set in the near future of the year 2093, a crew of space-craft explorers are sent to a distant planet, hoping to find the secrets of human existence, which then leads into a discovery that can immediately wipe out mankind. Director Ridley Scott beautifully directs this movie with such precision. He delivers a remarkable style to this movie, from the breathtaking visual effects, to the incredible landscapes. Ridley Scott is probably one of the most interesting directors in cinema history. I was easily blown away from this movie from start to finish. I see this movie develop by going into three possible stages. The first stage of this movie is an interesting scientific expedition, the second stage is a dark and creepy horror story, and the third and final stage is a flat-out thrilling and mind-blowing action flick. That's all you need to make this movie excellent. The incredible acting ensemble includes Noomi Rapace, the original ""Girl with the Dragon Tattoo"", as an archaeologist obsessed with finding the secrets of human life, along with her trusted boyfriend, played by Logan Marshall-Green. Charlize Theron and Idris Elba have their great moments for their respective performances, Theron as an employee that monitors the expedition, and Elba as the ship's captain. But the stand-out ""scene stealer"" performance, worthy of an Oscar-nomination, comes from Michael Fassbender as the android Dave. Excellent in every role he's cast in, Michael Fassbender literally blew me away, and he just shines up the screen. This is a performance worthy of a Best Supporting Actor Oscar nomination. ""Prometheus"" is filled with plenty of disgusting moments that will leave you speechless, and yet, it's portrayed in such a subtle way. Some moments will leave you disgusted, while others will just leave you totally on the edge of your seat. The visual effects are astonishing, the cinematography is down-right gorgeous, the 3-D is expertly handled, and the directing is just downright incredible. I can just go on and on, but I can just leave you with this simple thing to understand. ""Prometheus"" is so far one of the finest films of 2012. But what I love the most about this movie is that it will leave tons of questions for the audience to decide. We need more movies that can test the minds of an audience, and try to find the answers themselves. matter if you're either a fan of the ""Alien"" films, a fan of sci-fi gems in general, or even a fan of film, ""Prometheus"" is a movie that everybody will enjoy. This is an epic, intense, heart-racing, mind-blowing, and excellent piece of filmmaking. ""Prometheus"", in my review, ""A mind-blowing adventure. Exciting and remarkable"".","10"
"tailsofthewind","Dr. Elizabeth Shaw tripped a genocide.","17 January 2020","Both Lt. Ellen Ripley and Dr. Elizabeth Shaw were written as protagonists and heroes by their writers, but they both actually tripped genocides.

Female heroes wronged by their writers...

Ripley was celebrated by movie fans for going toe-to-toe with company man Carter Burke, who wanted to sneak two Alien embryos past quarantine by smuggling them in Ripley's and another character's body while they were in hibernation. Burke was then going to kill the rest of the crew by sabotaging their hibernation units on the trip home. Ripley swore to him she was going to tell the company everything he tried to do, and make sure that they nailed him, ""right to the wall!""

The reality is, Carter Burke is actually the hero of the story who would have prevented a genocide. He is the one who sent the family (Newt's) out to investigate, and they are the ones that found the spaceship. The spaceship that was filled with hundreds, if not thousands of eggs, and if this hadn't happened this way (as seen in the movie, with the unfortunate number of a few hundred people), the station/colony would have continued to grow in size, with hundreds or thousands more of the human colonists...

And, eventually, one day, someone would have found that spaceship, and those eggs, and those hundreds (or thousands) of humans would all be killed by the Aliens. That would have been the genocide, but Carter's greedy actions prevented this eventuality. Carter is the hero. Ripley, our supposed hero, is shouting-down the actual hero, threatening to nail him, ""Right to the wall!"" for his illegal actions which hadn't even happened yet (so far, he is an innocent man).

Once the company that was trying to terraform the planet found out about the Aliens and how they had killed a few hundred of their colonists, and that there's an Alien ship there with thousands more eggs, the company would have quarantined the whole planet and moved on.

(Although, why the original explorers BEFORE the terraformers didn't find the spaceship is beyond me. It's apparently really close to base. But, I have to let it go...)

- -


As for, Dr. Elizabeth Shaw, she is quite the hero of the story in movie ""Prometheus"". Sole survivor, except for an android, like Ripley. Tough, like Ripley. And, she tripped a genocide, just as Ripley had.

In a case of profound misjudgment, she chose to actually believe that the homicidal android she needed to fly her off the planet, would get her safely to her next destination.

She did this out of selfishness, ""I want to know where they came from.""

She should have stayed, and died, on the planet.

Not only was she stunningly unable to correct her errors but she probably wasn't even aware that the smiling David android we see in the next movie, ""Alien: Covenant"", flushed the gorgeous green planet below with death and doom causing genocide to its humanoids or, as the name we've come know them as, the Engineers. But it wasn't just the Engineers, David killed every single animal on the entire planet; untold ecological billions died and left landmines to kill any living thing that might visit the beautiful planet in the future.

And, he killed Shaw.

For such a smart protagonist, the writers sure made her bafflingly stupid. At the end of the movie, David has commandeered another spaceship filled with thousands of hibernating colonists, A VERY SMART FEMALE CAPTAIN, a new identity, fresh Alien eggs, and he's still wildly homicidal. That's still Dr. Shaw's fault. She, literally, put his head back on his body, got into an Alien ship with him and took off, when she should have just stayed and died on that planet.

Or, had better writers.

THESE FEMALE HEROES WERE WRONGED BY THEIR WRITERS!

"info-394-32726","Dismal and disappointing","11 June 2012","Utterly atrocious. The story is laughable, the character development is non-existent, the pseudo-science claptrap is intolerable. A hateful pastiche of the Alien films with other elements stolen from any recent sci fi you can think of. The dialogue is cringe-worthy in the extreme - just embarrassing. There is exposition delivered at every possible opportunity.

The plot is infuriating nonsense from the foundations up. Going against evolution and having humans made by a creator means you're starting off by wiping out our knowledge of science, which strangely won't appeal to many sci-fi fans! Yet if you're going down this route, don't use DNA matching with the engineers as evidence, as it quickly begs the question, what about the DNA similarities with our evolutionary cousins? The man who wrote this tosh is clearly an ignoramus - best start with a basic understanding of science if you plan to write sci-fi! I left the cinema feeling extremely disappointed and just plain angry that I wasted hours of my life watching such drivel. It makes me sick to see the great talents of the visual effects artists wasted - not to mention the gargantuan sums of money that it must have cost. I have lost all respect for Ridley Scott, and I hope this pile of offal fades quickly into the obscurity of failure and doesn't besmirch the incredible legacy of Alien and Aliens.","1"
"wroey","Disturbingly bad","20 September 2013","*spoilers*

Disturbing because so many people, including respected critics, seemed to approve of this nonsense.

Plenty of people have listed the countless scenes that make absolutely no sense ('scientists' behaving like children mainly). I mean walking around with no helmet in a foreign environment, prodding aliens to see what happens, nicking off for a random shag when for the first time, people are down in an alien environment (and probably need an eye kept on them), and then when they get killed by prodding an alien, amazingly the video is not reviewed so when they can't be contacted they just head down for a look-see. I mean come on are you serious? And at the end that rope and descender (which are the same in 90 years as they are now) appear out of nowhere.

However the main worry for me is that the premise that these aliens populated the earth goes against everything we know about evolution. This complete disregard for any logic is dismissed by a throwaway reference to Darwin but seriously, does anyone believe that these aliens just created people for no apparent reason and then seemed to want to destroy humans for, again, no reason. And these futuristic scientists believe in god and wear a crucifix?!

OK so I'll get off my evolution high horse and just repeat that the movie makes no sense and even Fasbender looked absolutely ridiculous as that alien character. How could Ridley Scott make such a piece of nonsense? Alien was brilliant but this is just an awful rehash.

PLEASE don't release Prometheus 2.

I am actually fuming that I wasted 1.5 hours of my life watching it.

But I am frankly horrified that even Rolling Stone mag rated it. Maybe we were created by aliens...ones with terrible taste and no logic whatsoever.

I'd give this 0/10 if that were possible. But at least it can have one point for having pretty neat effects but even that insults us all because it implies that this garbage cost a fortune.

This movie actually angered me. It makes 'Independence Day' (previous the biggest waste of money and over-hyped ****) look OK.","1"
"metaverse55","Prometheus - a wasted opportunity","16 June 2012","I had high hopes for this film. Why wouldn't I? Ridley Scotts direction, Noomi Rapace and Michael Fassbender heading the cast. An interesting theme and a big budget. Then I read the user reviews here on IMDb (I usually just read, this is my first review) and my hopes dropped dramatically. But not enough to try to keep an open mind when i saw the movie (which I did less than an hour ago) I'm not pleased to have to confirm some of the things said here.

There are many problems with this film. Here's what I think are the main ones ...

1. The script. Yes, I know this has been said before, and it's a bandwagon I didn't want to jump on to, but the script is flagrantly weaker than the films concept (and indeed, its actors) deserves.

Of all the ways to approach such an intriguing subject, how on earth did we end up with this, frankly, dull story? It feels like such a waste.

2. The characters. There were too many (some of them appear to serve no purpose at all) With a theme charged with so much potential, i can see no excuse for 'filler'.

Of the main characters, I was impressed with Noomi Rapaces performance, though she had little to work with. I have to give her credit for making of it what she could. Her character was unconvincing, but her acting wasn't.

Fassbender as David, well, he was superb. He nailed the creepy tone his character emanates with masterful precision. So good, in fact, that I can't really tell if his dialogue was as bland as the what the others were given. His delivery was just top-notch, and he was by far the most interesting character in the movie.

Chalize Theron .. I am quite surprised with her, i really didn't feel she was up to scratch here. Her character was generic to the point of being soporific, but quite honestly, I didn't care too much for her acting either. It wasn't a BAD performance, just not nearly as good as I know she's capable of.

Other characters aren't really worth a mention. They're fodder, nothing more.

3. The editing. Now, i've studied film at A-level, so i know a little about this, and I believe the script could have been partially saved with decent editing. Unfortunately, we seem to jump around from situation to situation, and the transitions do nothing to help the script at all. The pacing is off, and i was disorientated more than once. As to how much we can blame the script, or the editing, that's up for debate, but i do get the feeling a directors cut would up my opinion of the film a notch or two.

4. The overall angle. The film was sort of doomed from the get-go, because of the direction it was taken in. It is dealing with HUGE, fascinating concepts, but chooses cliché over exploration at every opportunity. I suppose it's execution has something to do with accessibility, but if ever there was a film that needed the right balance of intellectualism and entertainment, this is it. Because it can't decide which way to go, it falls short of both.

It isn't all bad though. The special effects are nothing short of spectacular. And like I said, Noomi and Michael did well in their respective roles. There are a few moments between them that were interesting, where their characters could have bounced off each other to explore the films themes. But alas, i was reluctantly pushed into the next scene, trying not facepalm myself.

Many things are left unanswered in Prometheus. While i can appreciate that this is probably for the benefit of a sequel, it did little to make me care. I will watch the sequel, but my hopes won't be half as high this time around.

I wanted to like it, i really did, but the sense of wasted opportunity is so strong that can't give this film more than a 4/10. To give this some perspective, I would rate the Avengers a 6 and Alien an 8.5.

Having said all this, I'm a firm believer that everyone should decide for themselves, and while I can't recommend you pay cinema prices to see it, a DVD rental is probably worth it.

"pendennis","What a waste of great cinematography!","7 November 2013","I didn't see this movie in its theatrical release. Instead, I waited until it came to cable, and I watched it on our new flat screen LCD TV.

I expected a great deal of suspense in the Prometheus just touching down on LV223. Instead, it looked like an amalgamation of scenes cut together, without much thought toward creating suspense.

After landing, the exploration party immediately jumps into their exploration suits, without much, if any data with the exception of atmospheric gas percentages. They then take off like the Oklahoma land rush, apparently with no thought to microbial contamination, or other dangers in landing on alien worlds.

As other reviewers have written, the lack of scientific discipline is absolutely appalling. Given the advancement from 2013, one would think that some really advanced protocols would have been developed. Instead, these folks act like Neanderthals in the way they gather samples, and barge into a literally unknown world.

David Fassbender is unbelievable as an android. He's concerned with his mimicry of Peter O'Toole. While he's spent time of the voyage in learning, he evidently left his scientific mind behind.

Noomi Rapace, for her scientific inquisitiveness, is completely overwhelmed by her religious bias, and desire to find out why a strong alien life form would want a weaker life form dead. Sorry, nobody signs up for a voluntary human sacrifice.

The rest of the cast, as has been mentioned, has no depth at all. The dialog is random, with one liners thrown in, in an attempt to bind the disjointed script together. The other characters would have been as memorable had they been cardboard cutouts. Hardly any transition, and the entire movie seems like a series of cut and paste functions.

In order to make Dr. Shaw the sole survivor, the deaths of the others are merely forced scenes to make the story come out the way Ridley Scott wanted. And Noomi Rapace is no Ridley.

The visual impact is rather stunning. At the start of the movie, the scenes are such that you really expect an epic movie. But, alas, no.

The first time I watched in on cable, I thought I missed something, but after several viewings, I've come to the conclusion, that the only thing I missed, was the time I could have spent doing something else.","3"
"cleanfun-1","Cool but ... The story was never told.","6 June 2012","The story raised several questions but never answered any. I enjoyed the movie but the reason I wanted to see it was to learn more about the aliens. That's where the story was and it was never told.

There seem to be several deliberate actions without any motive or explanation. For example, the robot infects one of the doctors with the wrong DNA but you don't know why.

The infected doctor turns rabid and smashes a colleague. Again, what's the point? Possible but not probable.

They finally wake the ""Engineer"" and ask him to heal Weyland, he looks at them pitifully and then suddenly rips the robot's head off and smashes Weyland with it? Meanwhile the woman is screaming and crying something about ""Why do you hate us?"" I mean really, STFU and wait your turn.

But there's more! The robot makes a deal with the woman. Save his head and he'll help her navigate one of the many other alien crafts home. But she doesn't want to go home, she wants to chart a course for the aliens' home! Great you think, blow them the hell away, right? Nope, she wants to go and ask the aliens more questions?

Usually in survival type films there is at least one character that you should develop some sort of sympathy with, but there just isn't such character in Prometheus. The thrill and suspense scenes become kind of awkward when you hope for the wrong guys to win. I do give it three stars because i didn't fall asleep or got annoyed enough to turn it off.

"ezr2061","Everyone is Misunderstanding this Film and is Arrogantly Proud of Their Ignorance","8 July 2013","Everyone who has found deep fault with Prometheus has completely misread the film. You see, so many people who are disappointed & disgusted with the film are simply oblivious to all the clues, hints, & instructions provided by Ridley on how to perceive his film. Mr. Scott offers clear & rational reasons for the often illogical, sometimes idiotic behavior of the film's characters, but these reasons are concealed, disguised or subtly implied; they are not blatantly stated. You must follow the dialog very, very precisely and you must also consider some other sources to fully appreciate the film's remarkably efficient & elegant & profound beauty. The belligerent naysayers will undoubtedly persist in their reckless declarations that Prometheus is a failure convinced that their own failure to decipher the film's mysteries is unquestionably a fault of the film itself and certainly not an indication of their own apparent intellectual limitations, right? Wrong!

The rabid detractors apparently have little if any patience for the sort of autonomous thought that is required to unravel this intricate cinematic knot that Ridley Scott has artfully, expertly, lovingly crafted for true fans of intelligent, worthwhile Science Fiction. Nearly every single alleged logical error that I've read about or have seen being meticulously enumerated by an agitated, self righteous Youtube chatter head is actually perfectly well explained either within the film itself or by various collateral sources, such as the original Alien film or even on the fake Weyland Corporation website. That's right, there exists an actual, real phony website on this same internet that you're now using that's directly associated with the film, and would you believe it, there's actually valuable information to be found there to assist you in your deductive pursuit of the film's truths! But, unfortunately for all the lazy, pampered, meta-intellectuals, even on the mock website the answers are not in plain sight or in simple English. No, you're required to do what is technically referred to as ""thinking for yourself"" - Intuitive thinking. Spontaneous thinking. Unassisted, full blown creative thinking. I know what you're thinking: ""How dare Ridley Scott expect me to think!!""

So there you have it in black and white: nearly everyone is WRONG about this film. There is contained within this seemingly inane monster flick a genuinely sensitive & intelligent & artful cinematic gem, but, alas, you must mentally work for it. And more importantly, there's a very good reason why Ridley is asking - no, demanding - that we all exert ourselves mentally in order to fully experience the buried treasures of his latest cinematic creation...

The individual elements of this film are all superior. The cinematography is absolutely spectacular and profoundly effective at conveying the complex, subtle and nebulous themes which the film explores. The CGI effects and backgrounds are superbly integrated into the texture of the live action, and the stunning vistas are draw droppingly exquisite, many of which are actual natural phenomenon. The acting is all above average, with Noomi Rapace delivering a genuinely compelling rendition of the strong but conflicted female lead, a signature Ridley Scott character. People may fault her curiously muddled accent, but hey, in the future everyone's accents will be mixed and mutated, won't they? Michael Fassbender as a highly sophisticated android is riveting. He expertly captures the essence of what is both enthralling and terrifying about the notion of manufactured humans. Idris Elba as the cynical, opportunistic but ultimately heroic captain of the vessel is perhaps the true heart and soul of the film. His nuanced & powerful performance anchors the action in a very credible psychological space. And even Charlize Theron's rather stiff, mannered performance serves the story well as her cold calculating character, ironically, is the personification of some very unattractive human qualities. And the Alien? Oh, he's positively awesome. The soundtrack at first felt oddly intrusive at key moments, especially during more gentle, quiet moments, but this of course is soon revealed to be another crafty, treacherous ploy by Ridley to temporarily throw us off the track, to intentionally detour us from the true path. There are plenty of little traps & tricks & blind alleys that are easy to stumble into, and this seems to be what has happened to so many frustrated viewers. You all just haven't managed to find your way back out or bothered to seriously consider just why would Ridley - the creative mastermind of some of the most brilliant, genius science fiction films ever - bother to pull such seemingly inane stunts? Well, he has his reasons, and if you make the cerebral effort to discover them you'll find that they're very good, well justified, brilliant reasons.

...Good people of Earth, you have got to start thinking just a little bit deeper and a bit more humanely if we are going to have even a scrap of a shred of a hope of working our way out from under the rapidly accumulating colossal mountain of challenges facing humankind; challenges which are threatening to annihilate civilization as we know it. The mounting threats are approaching the critical point of no return at an ever accelerating rate - a grim, miserable fate hurtling towards us at an alarming velocity, so much more swiftly than just about anyone's ever dared imagine. If we continue to tolerate the faulty, fractured, incomplete, lazy, sh*tty type of thinking such as that exhibited by the overly confident, self righteous, tedious, and mistaken haters of Prometheus, well, we are all very soon going to wake up dead. Or worse...","10"

For this reason I was waiting this movie confident that it will be at least ""very good"". But I was wrong! Despite the quality of actors, imaging, effects and so on, the movie is very poor, without any new idea or originality, without the talent of such a great director, without what Mr Ridley Scott usually did in all his previous movies. I think that the target of this movie is purely making money taking advantage of important and well known people, starting from the director name: this is really deceiving people that have appreciated them for their genius and professionalism.

"rajinder001","Waste of time","17 June 2012","Prometheus is a badly written and badly directed movie. Science fiction could be interesting, but it is a C-grade flick, with big actors like Charlize Theron, who has hardly any significant role.

Characters are shallow. Events funny, but improbable. Effects are not even 10% compared to other 3D movies like Avtar.

A woman just deduce that the aliens are gonna destroy earth, and appeals to the ship commander to stop him. The commander decides in a moment with his two member team to go and commit suicide to save humanity. Funny. Unrealistic. Stupid movie.

"orourkec-292-269155","So far so good","19 November 2014","Ridley Scott creates here a groundbreaking mythology with excellent visual effects, some perfectly creepy and mysterious stuff and a dark, gloomy and labyrinth-like setting which is effective. Prometheus is better in SF genre than Alien (directed by Ridley Scott as well in case you don't know that). Moreover I think that horror, SF and bleak poetry as featured in Prometheus and Alien go very well together as these three genres together combine into a seamless hole. All of the things I've talked about since the very beginning of my review until here are proofs that Prometheus is original in its genre and that because of that it should be considered as exceptional SF filmmaking and the mother of all SF movies. In addition I thought that the godlike beings in Prometheus were strikingly well designed and believable. Oh, but what was also good was the very first scene of the film. It's amazing because the action taking place in the very first scene of the film is not understood, even though any of us can easily guess what was going on there (it was purposely meant to be this way I think and I think that some people might have misunderstood it and therefore taken it as a flaw), and that scene was a smart start to the film. Why was it a smart start? Well, I'm explaining the reason for this in the next sentences to follow. It's funny because not only do you not know for sure what is going on in the very first scene of the movie but you're also wondering whether that scene really does take place on Earth as you view it or if it takes place on another somewhat similar looking planet because the screen suddenly starts showing someone who looks like a human being who just came down from a spaceship that briefly appears in the sky above him but obviously is not one. And also the action that takes place in this first scene also makes you unsure of what on earth is going on there. Some or all of us can easily guess what is possibly going on, or maybe at least easily guess it out after having seen the whole picture. I think it was well thought out to make the film start this way because it allows to get the audience mixed up and maybe or probably as a result give them the irresistible desire to continue along with the story and to try to get answers regarding what was going on at the beginning of the film. It gives in to mystery and I like that whole idea I've talked about. Furthermore, Prometheus has a surprising twist coming near the end of the film and a few truly scary and memorable scenes, one of which was particularly and so absolutely horrible that I got traumatized and couldn't bare to look at it! I'm glad the movie made me experience that. What I do agree with the audience is that yes Prometheus unfortunately isn't a great film and could have been a much better motion picture. The movie also may not answer all of its big questions plus it isn't always clear what is going on with the film but you still have to keep in mind that Scott's genius in imaginative SF filmmaking redeems this film and that's already a big thing. Scott is my SF hero director and I think he should be really proud of his work in Prometheus. My rating is 7.1/10","7"
"allisterwhitehead","Truly dreadful","24 September 2013","It's always sad when a true great of the film industry is reduced to utter nonsense but in the case of Ridley Scott and Prometheus , this is definitely the case. Like an aging singer who doesn't have the same range anymore, it doesn't matter how many great musicians you have around you, you can't polish a turd! i always felt that preluding a film like Alien was a good idea but this is just a remake with no underlying purpose beyond commercial appeal. In other words, Ridley has completely lost it. He doesn't know it but he's probably surrounded by yes people and money men who tell themselves hopefully "" It'll workout once the editing and special effects are done "". Even the ship interior is designed to look like the Nostromo , which I have to say, felt really boring , not nostalgic. Nothing happens! No sense of the impending doom we saw executed in Alien so brilliantly. This is a real Turkey of the highest order.","1"

"tracy-staedter","A Complex Question Gets Lame, Unintelligent Treatment","11 June 2012","What is the origin of human life? It's a comples question. But that doesn't mean a movie trying to address it has to be confusing. Confusing does not equal depth.

The movie is simply bad. Some good CGI, but overall, bad plot, bad character development, bad story line. Here are some examples: The archaeologists Elizabeth Shaw (Noomi Rapace) and her boyfriend Charlie Holloway (Logan Marshall-Green) discover a star map among the remnants of several otherwise unconnected ancient cultures. They interpret that map as an invitation. How is it an invitation? We don't know. No one explains. I could give them that, but then they make another unbelievable leap by interpreting that the large people depicted in the ancient star maps are not only aliens, but ""the Engineers"" of humans Huh? How did they arrive at that conclusion by looking at ancient star maps? The Weyland company pays a trillion dollars to fund the scientific expedition and yet they have no security backup. No one would invest that much money in a multi-year project without security. It's ridiculous.

As soon as they arrive, by chance, to the location of the alien structure, they immediately investigate with only 6 hours of daylight left. In that time, they decide that all of the engineers are dead and no one is left. HUH? Did they not notice the umpteen other alien structures? Did they check those out? Look inside? Send probes? No. But nonetheless, Charlie Holloway is thrown into deep depression and begins drinking heavily because the engineers are dead. In six hours, this multi-year project has been rendered a failure.

The android David ""spikes"" Charlie's champagne with a drop of fluid that contains alien DNA. By the next morning, Charlie is begins to mutate in a very similar way as the Engineer alien did in the opening credits. Except when the Engineer alien drinks the DNA potion, he disintegrates, falls into a river and spawns life for that planet. Charlie, however, obtains superhuman strength. Even after Vickers uses a flamethrower on him, somehow Charlie comes back to life. When he does, he goes on a rampage and kills a bunch of people. Okay, but what does this have to do with the plot? Nothing. Charlie is killed again. He serves no threat to anyone but himself. The movie goes on. What was the point of this scene? Near the end of the movie, we learn that Meredith Vickers (Charlize Theron) is Peter Weyland's daughter. They have a contentious, bitter relationship and Weyland favors the android David like a son. What does this character dynamic have to do with anything that happens in the movie? This contention does not move the story forward in any way, shape, or manner. We see a little rivalry between Vickers and David, but not much and what we see has no influence on the overall story. Again, what is the point? The scientists don't act like scientists. The biologist ""flirts"" with the snake-like alien like he's a child. No professionalism at all. Elizabeth Shaw, despite being a renowned archaeologist ""believes"" in the engineers. It's like she completely discounts data. This could actually be an interesting character development: A scientist who has an internal conflict between what the evidence says and what a belief system might purport could be worth exploring in the narrative. But it is not explored. It's glossed over and only touched upon when convenient.

And even Shaw asks, ""Who made the engineers?"" Good question and the fact that it's not even explored by anyone in the movie reduces the film's theme, which is about the origin of life. Are we supposed to feel awe that Shaw is simply asking the questions? How about getting at some of these deep questions? How about a hint? When the disabled Engineer ship crashes to the planet and begins rolling (ala Raiders of the Lost Ark) toward the fleeing Shaw and Vickers, are we supposed to feel anxious when they run in the direct path of the tumbling ship? Here's an idea: run perpendicular. Is this supposed to be a suspenseful scene? Lame.

Lastly, we have no hint at why the so-called Engineers developed the aliens in order to destroy humans. Why did they need to go to such lengthy measures to destroy Earthlings? These are the same questions Shaw is asking and the ones that ultimately drive her back into space to seek out the Engineers. But at this point, the whole story is so convoluted and dissatisfying that I don't really care to follow her.

This movie is a huge disappointment from someone like Scott who did such a great job with Aliens and BladeRunner. It wasn't scary, it wasn't deep, it didn't have a thread, the character development was lame and the plot riddled with holes.","2"
"quarterwavevertical","Makes ""Plan 9 From Outer Space"" Look Like ""2001"" Or ""Blade Runner""","23 July 2018","Against my better judgement, I watched this cinematic train wreck on cable TV last night. Ouch!

For one thing, there's very little material that's original. It has ancient astronauts (""Stargate""), contamination by alien lifeforms (""Andromeda Strain""), hostile extra-terrestrials (""The Thing From Another World""), an expedition gone wrong (""Aliens""), squabbling crew members (""Alien""), giant spaceships that crash spectacularly (""Independence Day""), and a mysterious benefactor (""Contact"").

Worse yet, the plot is a complete mess and the characters poorly written, and I stopped caring about this movie around the mid-point. It relies too heavily on fancy computer graphics but a story, one which actually made sense, was, somehow, missing.

The only reason I continued watching it (while I happened to be doing something else at the time) was to say that I saw it to the end. I would have switched it off after, say, half an hour, but, then, I wouldn't have seen how terrible a movie this was.

The greatest disappointment about this is that it was directed by Ridley Scott, someone who made good movies at one time (e. g., ""Blade Runner"" and ""Blackhawk Down""). I thought his ""Robin Hood"", made just a few years earlier, was a clunker, but this flick is worse than either of those.

If you like good science fiction, give this disaster a wide berth. There are lots of better SF films out there, some of which I mentioned earlier, that are better and more entertaining.","1"
"spahop","Don't get your hopes up","2 June 2012","This movie was a huge disappointment. I knew it wasn't going to be an Alien movie as first planned, yet I still expected a nail-biting action/suspense movie in outer space: expectations failed. This is a visually strong movie about the existence of mankind. Nothing more, unfortunately a lot less: cheap plot tricks, soap-opera like revelations, no character depth or motivation and some very incoherent actions.

As both an Alien- as an horror fan I enjoyed AvP a lot more. That says a lot. For SF I would say Star Trek did a better justice to the genre. I'm very glad this movie doesn't use the Alien title nor that Sigourney played a guest role because it would be a shame on the particular franchise that started it all.","4"
"Maladjusted_1","Good visuals and a strong Fassbender performance make 'Prometheus' spasmodically enjoyable.","21 June 2015","'Prometheus', the anticipated prequel to the 'Alien' franchise, follows a team of archaeologists and scientists on an interstellar investigation into the origins of man. The film is graced by great visual effects, and the cast, in my opinion, is generally better than the ensemble of the later 'Alien' films. Idris Elba and Charlize Theron handled their roles well, but I think that the true star of 'Prometheus' was Michael Fassbender. His approach to the 'Lawrence of Arabia'-loving android, David, was fantastic. I'd also commend one particular scene, which I guess I'm not spoiling by labelling it ""the surgery scene"". It's my favourite scene from the 'Alien' franchise since the famous John Hurt one. Look out for this scene; it's very well-constructed. I think that the positives more or less end here, however. The ""all hell breaks loose"" moments in 'Prometheus' generally aren't as captivating or nearly as original as they were in the earlier films. Furthermore, generally good suspense is consistently followed by disappointing delivery. The desire to capitalise on the strong visuals seemed to compromise the story in places, for instance in the scene which had many viewers asking, ""why didn't they run sideways?"" I'm also quite critical of the character of Dr Charlie Holloway, as his portrayal really didn't convey intellect or expertise, as one would expect; he seems to fit in more with the convicts of 'Alien 3'. I was also particularly disappointed by the first ""big encounter""; its delivery, again, failed to mirror the earlier, far more atmospheric films. Overall, there were some enjoyable moments of 'Prometheus', but without Fassbender's performance it would have been interminable.","6"
"HorrorMad43","Breathtaking and profound","6 June 2012","Please, do yourself a favour and ignore all of the haters regarding this movie. If you want a smash em up, loud and noisy action sci fi such as Aliens, this movie probably isn't for you. Don't get me wrong, you get a fair taste of that, but that isn't what this is about. This is a profound movie that asks questions about who we are, why are we here and who made us. It also tackles the human pursuit of finding our makers. The storyline involving David the droid needs special attention. This movie asks you to think and demands that you listen. You will need patience and the ability to concentrate. Oh, and after the credits start to roll and you still tell me this isn't a prequel or related to Alien, you need to have a serious hard look at yourself. This movie is in every way a prequel to/in same universe as Alien. In time, once the hype is over (and that's why this movie suffers so much, the hype has been massive, this will go down as one of Ridley Scotts finest moments and one of the best Sci Fi movies ever made.","10"
"elioolei222","nothing to enjoy besides funny scenes and ""funny"" scenes","21 January 2013","Just finished the movie. I didn't watch a trailer or a review of anykind just saw the rating at IMDb and it was what? 7.2 ,unbelievable because a movie like this hardly makes a 6 in IMDb because over seven are good movies. ln the beginning I thought : What am I gonna watch ? ln the end l was like : What did l just saw ? Sometimes movies leave you with a good question but this one is not like them.

This movie does not have any plot holes because it does not have a plot. Sometimes in movie characters do things that do not feel natural for their type or things that are not in their personality here characters do these things or actions just because they can and that are contradictial with their last actions . This movie could have avoided some stupid scenes or tweak them a little but what the hell we are not gonna do that scene again even if it is completely stupid we are on a hurry. Examples : A machine operates a girl in her abs, after the procedure she gets some staples and is ready for the next scene. At least give her some glue with super growth muscle tissues or something, it is just plain stupid like that . Or the other scene where the ship is falling and these girls don't run aside the ship so it does not fall in their head but run along it . Just put some rocks around so it becomes hard for them to get away from the ship or else, but no we are gonna find the most stupid, irrational and illogical thing and we are gonna go with that.

Maybe someone needed some money and thought let's make a fast-food movie with great look, awful taste that everybody buys and does not want to buy again.

l am not gonna talk about acting or emotions in this movie because directing and the plot ruins everything.

I am sorry but l can't find something good about this movie besides three things : catchy title , catchy idea and good starting scene. When you think about the idea of this movie that 1,alienas created life2,or why we are here on earth.

lt is interesting but it can't go on and advance and make a good story out of it . It is only a question and is a stupid to make a movie like this because you gave the question to the audience ""why are we here"" ,and than you don't do anything related to it besides wandering in a stupid planet.k

If you think about it it is a sure way to fail because firstly you can't answer it no one can, and secondly you can't deflect it to something else .

Lastly about the ending. It leaves the idea that there will be a second movie as stupid as this one ore maybe more if they aim higher. Yeah ,If your gun does not shot at all aim as high as you want. What is their aim ? something more stupid. Redley Scott is like , we made a stupid movie how about making a sequel let's go to another planet and try to talk to these creatures we have only a character left so it won't cost too much .","3"

So from that point, we all were blown away with the fantastic movie scenery right from the start, and to the vary end – picking up to a Prometheus 2 (we all really hope it will come) PLEASE Ridley Scott! We had the choice of seeing it in 3D or 2D, but as we all feel that 3D is way to over-exaggerated, we went for the ""good-old"" 2D version (thank god for that!!!!) and though this little review is more ""generel"" i just wanna say that Prometheus got us all excited, thinking and wondering with new questions, trying to fit all the pieces from the old story to the ""new"" story, and we all definitely need to see this great movie again!

"amk80","Had to see it twice before I could really decide how I felt. Incredible movie.","10 June 2012","I have been anticipating this movie for several years. There were a hundred ideas in my head of what could be in the film. Obviously a two-hour movie can only deal with a handful. Also, even though I knew that I shouldn't expect Alien all over again, it was my only point of reference and so I did expect an Alien-ish movie to some degree.

Then I went to a midnight screening. I saw it in 3D on a fairly small, older screen. When Prometheus was not Alien and turned out to be something else entirely, I kind of had a knee-jerk reaction and was left dumbstruck. There was so much going on it was difficult for me to wrap my head around on the first viewing. I knew there were heavy themes and mysteries left unsolved at the end, but then again that is the hallmark of good science fiction.

I saw it a again tonight. This time I splurged on XD 3D(A huge screen with a great sound system), but much more importantly this time I went in expecting Prometheus, not Alien. HOLY MOLY what a difference that made. I actively searched for all the things some people have been complaining about on here, but on close inspection all of the supposed problems with continuity and editing melted away and the characters became more likable and understandable. I also payed close attention to subtleties in an attempt to unravel some of the mysteries, and while some things are left purposefully vague, I have some solid, satisfying theories now. This time I was left awestruck rather than dumbstruck. I can honestly say that the second viewing was one of the best theatrical experiences of my life.

"plasticanimalz","I Heard This Was Confusing? What Part Weren't You Paying Attention To?","19 June 2012","One guy on here gave a 1-star for a review then listed about 10 things in the movie he had a problem with, half of which did not even happen during the movie and most of his other problems with it he's trying to sound smart but they don't even make sense. If you are unable to keep up with a movie don't complain about it. Go watch something else where things blow up and you don't have to think. I can't even imagine what the audience of today would say if 'Silence of the Lambs' came out in this time. No one would have the attention span to keep up or be able to figure out what is going on. I mean, some of the comments on here are so far off from what was going on in the movie it sounds like they were watching a different movie. This wasn't rocket science here it just left a little up to the imagination but it wasn't that hard to figure out what was going on.

I heard it was confusing so went with that expectation and with intention of watching and listening closely. All it was was a good old fashioned science fiction movie like they used to make before George Lucas started putting talking CGI aliens in his films and it all went to hell. Science fiction movies used to be about thinking not just about CGI aliens and things blowing up. In fact, if they released 'Alien' today people would probably be complaining about it being boring, not scary, and nothing happening - everyone is so used to being spoon fed and big budgets to cover up lack of story and imagination.

The only problem I had was the ending did not have quite the impact the first two films did. It was fine but not awesome. There was tension and moments where I felt nervous but this was really not an Aliens film. It was sort of the film that came before Aliens which was the birth of the creature. I would definitely classify the first two films as horror, where this one was more on the sci-fi side and lesser on the horror.

One of my favorite movies is 'Contact' and people either loved it or hated it. People who hated it was because they expected aliens to be all over the place and needed that for the pay off. People who loved it loved that it didn't show aliens all over the place because it was really about this woman's journey and her obsession and really did not have that much to do with aliens, and liked letting your imagination wander. That's how I feel about this film, 'Prometheus.' There are people in the world who like to read books because they like to use their imagination...then there are people that do not and want to be spoon fed in the theater or watch some muscle dude punch out some other guy or watch something big explode. How disappointing it must have been for you all that the explosions in 'Prometheus' weren't bigger.","8"
"filmman74-105-220568","A smart sci-fi has arrived.","9 June 2012","Ridley Scott has taken the director's seat again and this time thrusts us back into the universe which 'Alien' exists. This time it's set 100 or so years before the first Alien movie. I don't feel this is a direct prequel to the Alien franchise but a launching point for a set of movies leading up to the prequel. You will definitely see the similarities in Prometheus that link it back to the Alien universe but it's not quite there yet.

This film has been getting a lot of hate and flack by the movie community. A lot saying it's visually stunning but flat, looks great but terrible story. I think this may be due to the fact that some people were expecting one type of movie but ended up getting something totally different. Don't go into this movie expecting an all out Alien movie, you won't get that here. This is a set-up movie of what is to come. I was a little reserved about seeing it, even though I've been waiting a long time to, because of the bad press it has been getting. I never let reviews sway me from seeing a movie, but it's hard to put down big money on something that could be a total waste of time.

First off, the film is visually appealing. Absolutely beautiful. Scott knows how to make a movie look good, and this spares no expense in the visual department. H.R. Giger was brought back on to make some designs for the 'cave' the scientists find themselves exploring. The story, it's a slow burn, taking it's time to develop. We are thrust into the exploration of the planet quickly, but the story never feels rushed. I love how things are left up to us to interpret and talk about and think about what is going on. Pay attention to the screen, you will pick up things that will link the story together. I feel the story is wonderfully crafted and leaves you with questions and some of the answers are interpretive. This is smart SCI-FI, something we don't get enough of any more.

Archaeologist Elizabeth Shaw, played wonderfully by Noomi Rapace, an amazing Swedish actress, best known for her role as Lizbeth from The Millennium Trilogy, better know as The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo trilogy, and her partner Charlie Holloway(Logan Marshall-Green) find a series of cave paintings from different civilizations. Each painting has one defining feature that links them all together, a large humanoid pointing to a series of planets. They take this as an invitation to come and find them. These beings get labeled the 'Engineers'

Shaw persuades the Weyland corporation to fund an expedition to this planet system to seek out these engineers because they make hold the secret to life itself. They are trying to find out if us, the human race, were made by this race. They soon find out after landing on the planet and doing some exploration that the engineers do exist but they may have had a more sinister plan for us.

Along for the ride is an android named David(Michael Fassbender). Fassbender plays David perfectly. He is really top notch, as he normally is. Over the years I've really taken to Fassbender and I couldn't picture anyone playing David but him. Even though David is an android, there are times where you feel that you might not be able to trust him. He's always learning but being android he is void of a soul and feelings and sometimes his experiments don't always have the best intentions for others around him. My favorite line in the movie comes from David...""Big things come from small beginnings."" That line resonates through the whole picture and I also feel that it fits because I think this is the small beginning to the larger franchise we have come to know as Alien franchise.

Charlize Theron is back and plays Meredith Vickers, the working head of Weyland corporation. She is a cold calculating leader and at times only seems to be there for her own agenda. Theron straps on the 'bitch' shoes again and fills them nicely. She's not a likable character but at times it may seem that she might have a heart in her somewhere, no matter how small.

Marc Streitenfeld has been brought on board for the score of the movie. He does a great job in providing a fitting score, bringing you deeper into this universe. A lot of the story is not told in dialogue or scenes but shown on screen so pay attention. You will pick up on things just by observations alone.

I think this is one of Ridley Scott's best work and is a fine addition to the Alien mythos and universe. It is a stepping stone to something much larger. It is setting up the universe beautifully and I think when the other sequels come out everything will get tied perfectly together with a big red bow. This movie leaves a lot of questions unanswered but I think that is the point. I feel those questions will get answered in time with the other films. What I love with open ends like this is that it makes you think and talk after the film is done of what could be and what is coming next. Like I said before this is smart sci-fi at it's best, and in the world of big escapist blockbusters, it's good to see that smartly made movies like 'Prometheus' are still getting made.

I have nothing but admiration for this movie and I praise Ridley Scott and everyone involved for taking the chance and making this movie. Definitely a must see and a must see in the theatres. I know I will be seeing this movie multiple times, it definitely is a story that benefits from multiple viewings.","10"

Problems with prometheus!! There were many gaping plot holes. The movie lacked a clear direction/goal, and rather than have the pieces of the jigsaw puzzle fit nicely together, it just meandered. The main players lacked presence and were never fully formed. The premise and theme is nothing new in Hollywood, its like a mash up of Alien, 2001, and Mission to Mars. The whole thing just didn't add up for me.

1. They're wearing under wear during hibernation 2. They got to the very spot with a built up structure just as they arrived. Perhaps they'd sent satellites in advance to map the terrain.

3. Helmets also protect from possible germs. Removing you helmet on another class M world is a big no no! 4. Why was the objective of the entire mission so nebulous? 5. Why send in humans if the cyborg could have gone alone outside the ship.

6. Why bring in the geologist? 7. Droids could have first searched for life forms.

8. They tell the others not to touch anything but having their mask off they have contaminated everything.

9. They should have been able to detect sand storm before it arrived. Even if somewhat sudden.

10. Why is no one scared of cross contamination? 11. Why are they shocked there's a human like head under the helmet. Wasn't there a big fat face on the cave wall? 12. Why be scared of cross contamination only after the head is about to blow up? 13. Two guys left in a scary cave, there is no emergency contingency in case they encounter hostile life forms. They are not prepared or trained in arms.

14. There is no remote cctc coverage to record what happened to the first two guys who died. But they have automatic self propelled remote censors traipsing through the tunnels.

15. The high tech aliens can only boast of grainy super low def 3D footage.

16. I had a c section!! No one runs around after a c section. No one!!!! 17. There was not a single medical doctor on board? Really!! And the medi pod scene itself was in-credible.........

"NousPax-1","2093 A Creation Odyssey","12 June 2012","Having read through a few hundred of the reviews on this it would seem prudent to state up front my misgivings. While I agree with some of the statements about the writing and others about the stupidity, I must say that this is still magnificently spellbinding! Have not felt this great of ""mystery excitement"" since 2001 A Space Odyssey in late 60's. Some parts were not clear to me, but the overall theme was enthralling. It was actually insulting to see ""Alien"" horror in this as it is so cerebral the horror seemed out of place. One bit of stupidity on the biologist's part is unforgivable. When the biologist is attempting to ""pet"" the embryo-Suppositor you feel like giving a Darwin award when he gets thrashed. I thought the holographs were interesting but a little annoying. One would think that beings capable of creating WMD Aliens would make clear playbacks, not ghostly outlines. This movie was cool beyond belief!","10"
"surdude","Dishonest","7 April 2013","I share the disgust of other reviewers concerning the lack of logic, poor writing, and plot sequences that are introduced and subsequently left to dangle with no resolution throughout this tragically horrible movie. I haven't read any reviews however that take Ridley Scott to task for his denial that this mishmash of stolen ideas is a prequel to the Alien series.

I believe it was a disingenuous marketing ploy by him and the studio to portray this garbage as groundbreaking and stand alone science fiction. The only fiction here was the pretense that this story would be something original, which turned out to be the biggest disappointment of all. I believe the aim was merely to fill the seats and thus the coffers with yet another poorly conceived CGI blockbuster.

The only shred of originality offered was in the beginning, which promised revelations of the origins of mankind; a concept that was sadly never developed. The rest of the film was a mixture of hastily combined ideas stolen from other, more honest endeavors from Stanley Kubrick and even Ridley himself.

I watched the movie on cable again last night, hoping I had missed something that would tie it all together. Unfortunately, there was no redemptive value in a second look. The ""science"" is laughable, especially considering what is widely known today. In the movie Alien, the morphing of the creature made some sort of sense, with the tentacled octopus-like creature springing from the egg, inserting itself into the host and finally emerging through the chest of its hapless victim as a somewhat recognizable version of the adult to come. Not so with this movie, which had you hoping the abortion would work so you wouldn't have to witness yet another lapse of judgment by the writers. I don't know where the idea of the squid came from, or the thinly disguised ripoff of the alien emerging from the space jockey, but they were clearly too close to the original, while pathetically plagiaristic in their lame attempt to distance themselves from it.

I mourn the ability of the studios to foster true innovative story telling rather than flashy tripe such as Prometheus that promises much and delivers little.","1"

Gradually, the ancestors showed extreme curiosity and supreme respect for the universe. Eventually, they developed a ""look up"" attitude, but they could not touch the space. After a lot of meditation and baptism, the ancestors began to be convinced of the ""creator"" image. Like a person hidden in a corner of the world. So, the ancestors went through the sea day by day, going through all kinds of dangers, just to find our creator at the end of the sky and the end of the sea.

"TwoQFourB","Prometheus: The Hands Of Fate","6 June 2012","Just recently I watched Manos: The Hands Of Fate for the first time. It was everything I'd been led to believe it was and more: diabolical directing, dreadful music, appalling acting and a script so incomprehensible it would make a paper on quantum chromodynamics seem simple by comparison.

Then last night (being a huge fan of Alien and a big consumer of science fiction) I decided to watch Prometheus.

What can be the connection between the acknowledged worst film ever made and the latest Ridley Scott blockbuster? Well, more than you might think...

Firstly, the good stuff. Prometheus looks amazing. Really. It's great. Ridley Scott does a grand job of wowing with the effects, and I particularly like the visual continuity with the original look of the Nostromo, it works. The whole film has a huge cinematic scope and sucks you willingly into its believable world.

But then... oh dear. What did you do Ridley? You let a script slip into existence that rivals Manos for incomprehensibility. To demonstrate how confusing this film is, here is a basic summary of my thought processes as I watched the film: ""Why? Why this? Why that? Why did that character do that? Why did they let that happen? Why is that how it works? Why did it explode? What does that actually do? Don't do that, that's stupid! And REALLY don't do that! Oh, you did, I can't see how that would work though. And why does THAT work like that? Hang on, does that even matter? That bit should be in Star Wars shouldn't it? Why? No, don't run that way! But, why?"" Coincidentally, these are exactly the same thought processes I went through whilst watching Manos.

I can take a bit of mystery, a bit of unresolved intrigue, but when things just do not make any kind of sense I feel cheated. And this film made me feel cheated. It *could* have been a great backstory to the original Alien film, but instead it's a mumbo-jumbo piece of nonsense filled with mind-bogglingly stupid characters (none of which I cared about) and lots of pretentious drivel about origins. Honestly, it makes Star Trek V look like a masterpiece. And, without giving too much away, look out for a ludicrous death scene towards the end that I'm sure was pinched from A Fish Called Wanda.

All the great effects and direction in the world mean nothing if the basic script isn't up to scratch. And this is a disaster.

My advice: go watch Alien and appreciate a truly brilliant film instead.","1"
"kailomonkey","Mostly Enjoyable","10 June 2012","Not that long, compared to alien which is much longer. Visually brilliant and the characters weren't introduced in a way that annoyed me like many recent action movies. Eventually things focus on a particular person and I didn't like their acting then and the script was terrible after that wherever there was script, but luckily it wasn't like that for most of the movie so I think it was an enjoyable experience. It was a bit like it could have been the sort of awful cliché scripting that I absolutely hate, but they cut it all out and only left bits of it near the end; leaving the rest to be enjoyed.

That said, don't expect too much. It's pretty much a re-enactment of several alien staples with the idea of giving us an in-the-beginning look at how the aliens from alien came to exist, in a pretty unnecessarily dramatic chain of events.

"BeGerman","Perfect Movie","12 August 2012","Big Scree - Big Cinema. This is the kind of movie mad for movie theaters.

The movie is nearer 2001 and the perfect antithesis of dump and stupid summer cinema.

A coherent screenplay and dialogues contains no records of ""bats dialogues"". outstanding screenplay. A film still goes on after the credits.

Noomi Rapace - innocent / Michael Fassbender - ingenious / Charlize Theron - present / Idris Elba - perfect / Guy Pearce - eyecatcher / Logan / Marshall-Green - unexpected / Sean Harris - significant / Patrick Wilson - pregnant

Since Avatar and Thor 3D was not used so well. Too bad we didn't have IMAX 3D in Germany.

Just the opening sequence on the Prometheus. To quote yourself perfectly, without repeating it self. Mr. Scott and his team in top form in another sequence, which I don't want to reveal here. For the on how have seen i just say ""MedPod"".

There is no more to add. Consistent. Perfect.

Hope that the longer version will be watching at Cinema and not only presenting on the silver disc.","9"

I'm not a big fan of science fiction this could be why (however my partner is and he also agreed that this film was a complete let down) I just found this movie to have a lot of talking to begin with... and for the first half of the film nothing really happens. It picks up towards the end and I did wake up and it was bearable but I left the movie just feeling like I didn't experience anything worth while.

It's just typical and nothing really sets this film apart so I don't really get why such a big fuss over this movie? Seen better!","3"
"rynocoleman","what the.....","5 July 2012","I've read several reviews of this movie, but had to stop. They all remind me what a disappointment this movie was. Not only was it not entertaining, it totally disregards the legacy of the original Alien. This is strange since Ridley Scott made both movies. The most annoying plot blunder in my opinion is that in the original Alien movie, the humanoid alien is in the driver seat of the spaceship. In Prometheus, he is killed on Shaw's ship?? Did Ridley Scott think people wouldn't notice or not remember??

The ending of the movie was just weird. And there is no explanation for all the weirdness.","3"

1.when they arrived the planet, how da hack they directly went to the exact point of the ""ship building"" (since they've found it accidentally)

2. after the ""self-surgery"", Dr. shaw was pretty much in pain but suddenly she became a Rambo! (was it adrenalin, or what?!)

3. how many kinds/forms of aliens did they have? there were the octopus- like, snake-like, a gigantic one.. they should have related all these kinds at some point.

"koschi-400-604412","Not impressed","19 June 2012","Warning! This Review contains a number of Spoilers.

One of the problems this movie has is probably that everybody seeing it has quite high expectations that the movie can't fulfill. But even if you forget about Alien what's left is not even a good SciFi Movie on it's own. There are too many inconsistencies and it never manages to build up any tension. Visually it's beautifully shot, but i can also look at a pretty picture, at least it would not bore me with an incoherent storyline. I've no idea why this had to be in 3D though. It doesn't add any depth to the picture nor does it draw you into the movie.

I don't want to give too much away, but just a few things that really bothered me. 1st of all they sort of give the space jockey a back story. But then again this poses more unanswered questions. Why was the cargo of the original space jockey so different from the one shown in Prometheus? In Alien it were organic eggs containing living organisms ready to hatch. This suggested that the space jockey himself was an explorer who just happened to load the wrong cargo. Then here it is some gooey stuff that apparently creates life or something. So here they engineered stuff that supposedly created the species that was carried in the space ship from Alien? Then again here we have a military facility on a remote planet that seems to be abandoned for thousands of years. Was the original space jockey also heading for earth trying to destroy all life? Because this seems to be the sole purpose of this species. But then why are there many other space ships on this planet when apparently one of them is enough to destroy life on earth?

What also baffled me was the scene in the surgical chamber. There's one person knocking down medical staff then running around with a stapled wound on her abdomen and nobody seems to care. I don't even want to go into why she's still able to walk. But what was the purpose of this scene when it doesn't seem to affect or interest anybody? OK, it prepared for the far fetched ending, but at this point it all was so ludicrous already i wouldn't have wondered if there was a gigantic squid just popping out of nowhere.

Then what purpose did the Holo recordings have? What did the engineers record? Everything that was going on on this ship? Only exciting moments? The best of dying crew members? And David just happened to manage to play the relevant parts of what has been recorded. That makes sense.

I could go on an on because this movie was just full of stupidity. Compared to this Avatar was a masterpiece in story telling. I'd expected more from Ridley Scott.","3"
"HulaBoy75","A highly polished turd. Shame.","1 June 2012","Watched the midnight showing last night. Slept on it.  Realised that the beginning scene is one of the space jockeys on pre life Earth.  No explanation as to why he drinks a canister of the stuff though.  Perhaps decides he's had enough.  His and the alien manufactured bio weapon DNA goes into the water and human life is eventually created.  They obviously want to destroy life on earth as humans therefore are alien bio-mechanical creatures with the evil strain of the alien stuff in the cans.  That's why man wants to destroy himself.  They've been coming back all these years to check and now we're at a point that we can travel to other planets and they don't like that.  That's what I think.  The whole movies plot line hinges on Idris Elba (who never leaves the ship) saying ""It's a munitions dump far from their own planet"" to vaguely explain partly what the balls is happening. Poor.  Guy Pearce has no business being in the film either. Why not use a REAL OAP?! Bad makeup and no real spark from any of the actors.  Poor script and messy plot.  Wait for the DVD.","4"
"danielsmith1431","Short review","1 June 2012","So I managed to get to see this last night. No spoilers in here but my little take on it.

The film was great, not brilliant but great. If you have seen the Alien films then you are in for a little treat as it has the same feel as the originals used to. Little easter eggs and various references link the connection to the previous films.

As I said no spoilers so I wont go into one of my favourite moments in the film but other users may have read it else where. The story line in Prometheus isn't ground breaking in terms of plot and predictability but it certainly does impress when it needs to. The visuals are beautifully created and gives a sense of disaster and a sense of suspense when Prometheus lands.

Overall I would say if you are a sci-fi fan then you will more than likely enjoy this film. People who haven't seen Aliens/Predator may struggle to enjoy the story but the visuals certainly pull this one out of the bag for me.","8"
"Bigideas_Baggins","The idiot mission","19 April 2021","I know I will not be the first to do this, but it is pretty interesting to compare the crew of the Prometheus with that of the Nostromo from the first Alien movie. I guess we would have to start with the fact that the Nostromo crew would not be expected to have any skills applicable to the situation they found themselves in - after all, they are a cargo crew. Even so, once they are taken out of cryosleep to investigate something they are not suited for their decisions mostly make sense given they are still human beings with a brain. The fact that they lose, and gradually get killed, is mostly due to Ash and his hidden (company) agenda.

Here, though, you would expect the crew to be specifically chosen as experts for this first contact/scientific exploration mission. But they seem to be selected more on their lack of IQ rather than anything else. Let's start off with the two guys who are scared by some alien bodies (uhh, really, what did you expect to encounter here?) and get lost in their solo trip back to the ship. Now that in itself is somewhat believable - despite the 3D map they made, you could say they panicked. But what is far more baffling is the extremely careless attitude of the other characters. So two members of your 17 people crew panic in an extremely unique and overwhelming situation. Does it seem normal to just let them wander back, never check in with them so you only find out they are missing by the time you get back? After that, you don't even keep in constant contact with them???

Oh, and why didn't they keep constant contact? Because two characters decided to have it off, out of nowhere. It is literally Charlize Theron being distant and giving the cold shoulder all through the movie, and then just in the next sentence be like ""ok, let's do it"". I literally felt the movie was trolling me at this point.

These are only a few examples of the extremely stupid actions all the characters take constantly. Other things I could have talked about are taking off the helmets, petting the cute alien (when a few hours before the character was scared out of his mind by a long dead body), just opening all doors when a presumed dead guy turns up out of nowhere, and being crushed by a slowly rolling donut. Then we also have things that are just completely unbelievable, like Shaw running around happily a few minutes after cutting herself open to remove an alien squid. Oh, and none of the other characters seem to care about what just happened to her either. And just why was the medical capsule, owned by Charlize Theron, configured for men only? Not only did that not make any sense, it also did not affect the movie in any way, because Shaw just managed to do the procedure anyway, and in no time.

Speaking of the aliens, not much is making sense here either. Now, I'm not saying I wanted it to be exactly the same as in the earlier movies. That would have made sense from a continuity point of view, but I'd be willing to accept that the aliens evolved after the events of Prometheus into what we saw in Alien. Having said that, what we had in Alien was pretty logical, meaning the cycle from egg to facehugger to chestburster/full grown alien. We even found out in Aliens were the eggs were coming from, we can assume it to be like ants where a small number of them are queens.

Now, let's see what we have in Prometheus. We have the jars of goo; it seems that on men, a small amount of goo turns them in some sort of mindless zombies (and I'm being pretty generous here in saying that the small drop of goo that the guy had in his drink had the same effect as what happened to the guy that fell face first into the goo), but if a women gets infected with it via intercourse it grows into a squid of some kind. That squid can then grow several sizes without food, and implant a person somehow, resulting in an alien (but not ""the"" alien). Then we also have the cute snake like things that have to fit into all this somehow. It's almost impossible to make any sense out of this, certainly when compared to the clear cycle in the original movies.

With all these issues, there's not much left to enjoy the movie for, apart from, as always, the visuals, which were pretty great. I can't say much about the acting since all characters were such one dimensional idiots that the actors could not do much with them. I guess the music was ok, though I did not particularly notice it. Finally, I'm not sure what to make of the religious - philosophical aspects concerning the origin of our species. For me I think the movies worked better without this, but it's at least a somewhat original premise rather than telling us a Nostromo like situation already happened way before the first movie.

Bonus! Some of the actors' quotes, listed on this movie's wikipedia page, are absolutely hilarious, and I guess mean that they kinda forgot the movie they were making as soon as filming was wrapped. Like:

Charlize Theron ""slowly sheds her suit"" (slowly as in all of a sudden gives in to a guy's lust for her)

Idris Elba, ""the crew is his responsibility"" (like when he does not care in the slightest when two of them are lost in the complex, and seems to find it funny)

Logan Marshal Green ""is the scientist, is the skeptic, as opposed to Rapace who is the believer"" (like when he removes his helmet within seconds of having the air analyzed as breathable)

Disclaimer, that I maybe should end all my reviews with: I am not offended if you still like the movie, I am just explaining why I do not, trying to use objective statements as much as possible; I do not want everything to be the same as (in this case) Alien(s), but I do want it to make sense; and I do not dislike everything at the slightest plot hole or other issue (famous example: the magically appearing cliff in the Jurassic Park T-rex scene - I still like that movie). And yes, I guess the point where the amount of issues becomes too much to enjoy the movie, is subjective.","3"
"wilsonstuart-32346","A patchwork of steadily fraying idea","16 September 2018","As a long time fan of the Aliens franchise (yes, even the maligned parts 3 and 4), I looked forward to Prometheus's release with a great expectation - and whilst I'm not going to say I was disappointed, I was left fairly perplexed and underwhelmed.

The film starts with a promising expedition on the Isle of Skye, which soon takes a detour to the far depths of outer space to trace the origins of an ancient civilization - a civilization which may have visited Earth, but perhaps had some input in humankind's development...

What follows is an impressively special effects (and coincidence) laden exploration of a long dead world, with irrational and unpredictable behaviour from hardened mercenaries and experienced crew; security and quarantine protocols breached or rigidly adhered to when plot demands; blind hysterics at the first sight of old bones, jubilation when the same character (!) encounters a live and hostile alien; the high tech survey team gets lost mapping the spacecraft for no real reason; guns left lying around; and a supposedly rational scientist whose behaviour frankly defies any sort of credibility.

The problem with Prometheus is that doesn't know if it's a deep, philosphical space opera in the manner of 2001, or a gritty action thriller like, well, Aliens; and like a lot reboots that tries to please new fans, as well as appeal to established ones, Prometheus fails on both counts with a script that feels simultaneously underdeveloped and overwritten.

Praise goes to Noomi Rapace, Idris Elba and Michael Fassbender (especially Fassbender) for credible performances that keep the lopsided mess afloat. Those who criticise Charlize Theron for a phoned in performance (likewise Guy Pearce in a nothing cameo) have some justification, but they may also want to reflect that her character is only a reflection of a deeply flawed concept whose lofty ideals have simply not been given time to adequately gel.","5"
"ariasn1","The best Sci-Fi horror movie in 20 years.","19 July 2012","The past two decades have brought many extraordinary pieces of cinema to the world. But as technology builds and becomes more prominent, filmmakers seem less interested in creating an intellectual and pulling film. Rather today we have movies with little to no story and TONS of explosions. Science Fiction seems to be the biggest offended of this.

Rant aside, I sincerely believe that Prometheus is the movie that truly bridges the generation gap of Story Telling vs. Special Effects. The movie has everything from a dynamic storyline, to interesting characters, to fantastic music and superb special effects.

Prometheus (to me) is an amalgamation of the first two Alien movies. It combines Scott's original sense of suspense with Cameron's fast paced, in your face action. Immediately contradicting myself, I do believe the main issue with most people is that when they watch(ed) Prometheus, they were expecting Alien 5.

It's not, It was not meant to be!

The movie is not perfect, hence the 8/10 rating. But I do whole heartedly believe that the movie deserves a solid 8 based purely on the fact that it kept me interested the whole way through, and I didn't leave feeling more stupid than I already did going in!","8"
"ubruktnavn","Horrible script, predictable plot development, flat characters","1 June 2012","Alien is one of my favorite movies of all time, which is why I had my hopes up for Ridley Scott's next masterpiece. Right, I have to get this off my chest. Prometheus is the most anti-climactic and disappointing movie I've ever watched..

In the opening scenes, Fassbender sets a perfect tone for a deep and psychologically intelligent movie, then Noomi Rapace enters the screen and it all goes down hill from there. My first thought when the cast initially started interacting was that the characters are horribly shallow and uninspiring.

Rapace's character is attempted murdered by everyone, but survives even after having her intestines decimated, and yet never enacts revenge. The entire crew of the ship suddenly commits collective suicide, without ever having expressed emotions of any kind. The scenes with Rapace are predictable, and her love scene even involves a red rose to point out to the audience that: ""hey everyone, they're in love!"" Any suspense is ruined by random and silly decisions by the main characters, and pointlessly violent or gory outcomes.

Finally, are we seriously expected to be interested in the childish philosophical insinuations this movie tacks on? There are some attempts to flirt with philosophical concepts like immortality and creation, without ever actually making a point or even representing them in a artistic or meaningful way. Stylistically, Ridley Scott did a decent job, but remember to add the names Damon Lindelof and Jon Spaihts to your blacklist. Prometheus was ruined by their CHILDISH and inept writing. Prometheus is The Matrix on stilts.","2"
"anupviswanath","Where's the Ridley touch???","8 June 2012","I had not expected much as from the trailer itself I got it as stereotype alien sci fi movie visuals. Some said its the prequel to all alien movies even before it came into the big screen. I had not raised my hopes too high as sci fi movies are now turning out to be old pizza molded in new cast. The movie was too boring with too much focus on unnecessary talks and dramatization. Even I predicted to my friends that only 1 survivor will remain when the story is near to the end and voila so it was, but only difference being last survivor going to find creators of these creatures to get answer for her questions. The pretty lame thing was when they hit the alien spacecraft with human made spacecraft it crashes and the thing comes to kill last survivor,when he could have taken off again with same vehicle as shown in the last. I hope Ridley makes better versions of alien in the future. Last but least it reminded me and my friends a lot of Mass effect and Assassins creed game here and there(visually as well as logically(creators and flashing o old guys from the past as hologram)).For the time being Alien remains top of all the alien series. Hope American movies stop making 1 last survivor thing from movies and for a change keep 2 humans at least.","5"
"geoflix5","The Directors Cut is Already Available!!","15 June 2012","I suspect that Ridley Scott had a few misgivings about the theatrical release version of Prometheus. I stumbled across what I'm sure must be his Director's Cut version, where he has dealt with some of the more obvious shortcomings that seemed to have found their way into the film through the various departments...casting, writing, dialog coaching, continuity, scientific authentication, editing, etc. I think I found what Scott will offer as an improved version with: Cleaned-up dialog. Judicious and disciplined edits of unnecessary scenes. Some clarifying back story. Amplified sound. Expanded epilogue. Better closeups. He removed a few unnecessary characters, plot devices, clichés and subplots, and in doing so, has provided us with a tighter, focused effort that I think will make his fans eagerly await his next film.

"seansaddress","Prometheus Review","10 June 2012","Prometheus was a great movie for what it is worth. It did the job in a beautiful way and for that I believe it deserves an eight out of ten or even higher.

People will always point out the flaws in a movie and Prometheus is not exempt. The only major issue for people that cannot simply enjoy a movie without picking it apart is the risky behavior of the crew. For example, they took their helmets off on a foreign planet without much thought. I do agree that this behavior is not what a very professional scientific exploration party would do but this does not mean that the movie is unrealistic just that this specific crew might not have been too professional. Prometheus tells the story of an unsuccessful mission to a dangerous planet. Mistakes were made by the people and that is just another aspect of the story not a flaw in the plot line. Another error that I myself had an issue with is the surgery that a main character performs on herself. She basically performs a C-section on herself then gets up and walks away. This is not realistic by today's standards. The only possible reason for this speedy recovery would be advancement in medical technology. None of the flaws I saw within this movie greatly effected its quality in my opinion.

Prometheus is a very good movie for various reasons. The effects are beautiful and the content provides for a good time. Prometheus is a work of art that we all can enjoy. The performances of several of the actors should be rewarded. Michael Fassbender and Noomi Rapace both gave great, memorable performances. If you have not seen Prometheus I would recommend it.","9"
"mdbourke-282-899973","I enjoyed most of it...but....","10 June 2012","Good afternoon from Sydney Australia, the weather is as bleak as the original Alien, but I shall press on. Despite the hype, and conjecture I was looking forward to being taken back to the world of my youth. Alien took the light out of science fiction, and created a wonderfully Gothic vision.... Prometheus, brought that light back into what should be a dark space. Much has been said of the script, the screenwriters, the director etc.. I shall only speak of the movie itself. Flawed it was, character development was weak. The Android premise was recycled from the original Alien, and although Michael Fassbinder was wonderful as Peter O Toole, it was ""Meh"". The most talked about scene (which you all know) relied to heavily on CGI, in fact most of the movies more 'squeamish' moments were. Lets not even draw comparisons to the ""battle"" at the end of the movie between our ancestor and the slug...i.e DREAMCATCHER... Did I feel a sense of dread?? No... Did I buy the premise?? Sadly NO.Was it worth the $35.00 for Imax 3D..Well, considering the most exciting aspect of my 3D experience was the IMAX 3D promo, NO...It had elemental beauty, but all in all..I was somewhat disappointed. Maybe if this is 1 of 3, Mr Scott, can find what made the original such a success. I guess he is in a happy space in his life, therefore we get a watered down vision of our ancestors...What a shame Dan O Bannon passed away he would have been great to write the next story/script. In space no one can hear you scream....They almost heard me scream at Imax Darling Harbour...","4"
"g-bodyl","One of the Better Sci-Fi Movies In Recent Years!","5 January 2014","Prometheus, the long-awaited prequel set in the Alien/Aliens universe, is one of the best sci-fi films of the past few years. Ridley Scott, who directed 1979's Alien, returns to make a film of the same stature: a brilliant, tense film that has a very forbidding atmosphere. The dark, bleak visuals tells us what we need to know about the story. The special effects are very good and they enhance the story. Speaking of which, the story is very captivating and it makes us care what is going to happen next.

Scott's film is set in the year 2093 and a discovery has been made about a civilization existing many light-years away from Earth. It's believed that this discovery may hold the key to existence of the human race. So financed by the Weyland Corporation, a group of people set out to find this civilization.....and this is where discovery turns to survival.

The acting is really good. Noomi Rapace may not be like Signourey Weaver's Ripley, but she still does pretty good in my opinion. Michael Fassbender as the android delivers a very compelling performance. Charlize Theron plays your typical company person, but does it very well. Guy Pearce makes a surprising few appearances and does it well.

Overall, this is an excellent, bleak sci-fi film that will please fans of the Alien films. This was one of the most anticipated films of 2012 and it delivers for the most part. There are twists and turns that comes during the most unexpected times and the ending will leave you with your mouth hanging wide open. A satisfying conclusion is what I think. This is a very good film and one of Ridley Scott's best directorial efforts. I rate this film 9/10.","9"
"Sinking_Lure","An abomination of a movie","2 June 2012","Where to start? Well this is movie is so bad I felt compelled to join IMDb just to write this review. It is an abomination of a movie rather than an awesome movie about abominable aliens. The only saving grace is Michael Fassbender's character David the 'droid.

The story is so ill conceived and slow paced it is not long before all this dull cave trekking becomes monotonous. This is just another movie that does a disservice to the alien franchise. It's a mish-mash of avatar, the sanctum and a botched attempt at recreating the tension of the first alien movie.

SPOILER ALERT!...Not that I'm actually spoiling anything great but the highlight of the movie for me was the unintentional humour of the space jockey and David smiling at each other while the space jockey thing pats him on the head before decapitating him.

The studios and execs need to stop all this bs meddling and let the real film makers do their job. It seems like all good franchises are eventually butchered, Star Wars, Indiana Jones, Jurassic Park, Terminator etc. If the Alien franchise had not already been butchered well now it truly has been. The plot is just laughable, as are the alien tie ins. Character development is horrific. Disregard most positive reviews which are likely studio plants.

Take home message from this review: Avoid like the plague and pretend like this movie never existed. Two thumbs down.","2"

"shmsmisc","Disappointed - A Crashing Bore","15 June 2013","Spoilers within***

I heard there were mixed reviews when the film was released so decided to leave it till the DVD came out. I purposely did not read the reviews because I love Sci-Fi and decided to give the film a go anyway.

However, what a bore it was. It looks beautiful but it is dull and worst of all - plain stupid and inconsistent. The characters are so irritating. I hated every single one of them. They all behaved so illogically it was unbelievable.

Scientists would take their helmets off on an alien planet? Ridiculous, if one is serious. Examine a strangely undecomposed alien head with no barrier (such as a suit with separate air supply) between them and it. Really? Stick electrodes in it! Why? Frankenstein's monster?

A character rants on that he's only there for the money!! Not sure if he and the other character that was with him were supposed to be like Parker and Brett from Alien. However, although Parker and Brett grumbled about money - they came across like real workers convinced management was doing them over. They were essentially decent people and you cared what happened to them. I didn't care about any character in Prometheus. Did I mention, I hated them all?

The two guys in Prometheus got scared seeing a dead alien - OK. They left and got lost - OK put it down to panic. They thought there was a life form in another part of the building so they went in the opposite direction - OK. The Captain doesn't care - weird! The guys choose to go into a scary room - why? They see a live alien that looks like a cross between a giant worm and an albino cobra - they want to pet it and cuddle it. Now COME ON!!!!! Was this meant to be like Jurassic Park? This alien looks neither cute nor harmless.

In Alien - the equivalent scene is more subtle. Kane is trying to understand what is happening. He is curious. Whereas in Prometheus, we get dumb scene after dumb scene.

Why does the android act the way he does? Is he under orders for every action he carries out? Does he have human feelings? Is he angry because the brain dead, drunken action man scientist called him boy? Why does he want to experiment on a human? Nobody knows. Whereas, although Ash in Alien was under orders, this unfolded slowly, there was subtlety there - he admired the alien. You felt Ash would have done what he did even if he was not under orders. His behaviour made sense.

When the Prometheus explorers first enter an alien room with an enormous bust that looks human, no one seems shocked. Ho hum.

Is this meant to be the first time humans land on another planet or encounter anything alien? Who knows, again.

Why is Weyland hiding?

What is the point of Charlize Theron's character?

What is the alien at the beginning of the film really doing? If he is putting his DNA into the primordial soup to create life and eventually humans, then why is there already a breathable atmosphere on earth and grass growing? Is he really trying to kill off existing life on earth? Who knows.

Why don't I feel sympathy for Shaw despite her 30 second back-story about her desire for children? Ho hum. The script and plot (what plot?) is more at fault than the actors.

There are too many unanswered questions to make this film enjoyable. Other people have highlighted the inconsistencies and plot holes and nonsensical actions by stupid characters - there are so many and so in your face that it makes the film jarring to watch.

If a film has a reasonable storyline and script, you just wouldn't notice these things at the time or you just wouldn't mind. Look at Star Trek over the years spouting scientific gobbledygook and changing Klingons....",NA
"thekilon","A Blade Runner in Alien's skin","10 June 2012","This movie left me with a sever feeling of Diassapointment when I exited the theater. Not about the movie but about the negative reviews it has been getting.

This movie is exactly like Blender Runner. Doomed to fail at the theater and to remain a classic when it is released in DVD and blue ray.

Why ? Well for the same exact reason why Blade Runner failed so much at the theater. It is not there to thrill you .... at all. Like Blade Runner, there is no climax, there is no big easy to digest meaning... its 100% atmosphere. Like Blade Runner its a movie dedicated to hardcore sci fi lovers. Those people who don't fall so easily for the old trusted Hollywood recipe, of blood , screams and to the edge of your seat horror / action / drama.

Because as much I always enjoyed and loved Alien movies, in the end what made them so successful at the box office was that ugly thing bursting out of your chest. No coincidence that the only not so action orientated alien movie was the first.

And to make things even worse this one does not even feature Aliens at all, except in the end where you get to see how they were created. Actually there is no monster, there is no horror, there is not even some serious action. You are not even sure in the end if the bad guys in the film are really bad guys. Exactly like Blade Runner.

This movie hit me in the face like a tsunami. Its not just that is Perfect visually, amazing graphics, great atmosphere. A true piece of art. But contrary to the reviews the acting is also great from everyone even the actors that get minimum amount of screen time. Sure its a sever disappointment that Ridley does not fall in the trap of naked scenes with Charlise , though the movie features a single sex scenes with other actors. The problem is there is nothing special in those characters, they are mere , ordinary , everyday human beings with the robot stealing all the special treatment. But then is this an accident ? Is it just a fail of the story ? Knowing the genius of Ridley Scot I will have to say a huge ""NO!"" ... its no coincidence that the robot is the one stealing the show , but then thats the point of the film. The point most reviewers don't get and do not want to get.

Sure the story has no big meaning behind to make you go ""Aaaaaahhhh"" ... but then is this really true ? I have to say it got me thinking in some of the philosophical questions, not the obvious ones but then ones that tend to fall through the cracks like ""what if one day we discover we are nothing special as a race ? how much that would matter for us ?"" which is pretty much the central theme of the movie.

The worst part of this movie is the trailer, I had to say it misled me into believing this was an action movie of some sort, and even though I knew beforehand there was no Alien in the movie, I expected to see some monster or some really nasty dude crashing spines and drinking blood. But alas, even though the movie features a lot of death , like Blade Runner, it uses those deaths for mere decorative purposes.

This movie , completely changed my mind. Yes Ridley is THE MAN to make the Blade Runner sequel , a real sequel, something as special as this movie , something going against the Hollywood trends and I can only express my admiration for this so pleasant surprise and his courage do make something so personal and so true to his roots.

Music wise nope the music was probably the most boring part of the film, it could have been much much better. But still that does not make me give Prometheus any less than 9/10. Its up there with Blade Runner, of course not of the same quality, but none the less its really, really, really close.

Saying all that, I have to warn anyone going to waste money on this believing this is an Alien movie .... it may explain the why and how ... it may be a prequel.... but for the all the above reasons THIS IS NOT an alien movie. And if you search for easy thrills, don't go to watch this movie , its not for you.","9"
"Cine_Virus","A typical, uninspired prequel, a lost opportunity to make history, but at he same time a great chance for.....","19 October 2012","There isn't much to say about this movie, since almost everything has been already written in many previous (some of them absolutely hilarious) reviews.

But nevertheless, it certainly does not worth any rating above 5.

...7.2??? For this?? While ""Alien"" and ""Aliens"" are rated with 8.5 each??? Come on people.. rate with your mind, not by your heart....people lose time and money here, so let's all be honest to them! This movie lacks script, lacks inspiration, lacks common scientific sense, lacks normal human behavior development, lacks actors, lacks all those qualitative characteristics that Alien's Universe had in plenty and, long time ago, in some theaters far far away, grabbed our minds..

This movie has plenty of excellent cgi with some of Ridley Scott's unique ambiance, but these of course aren't enough to make a good movie.

What a great example of losing chance to actually make history! But this movie (like others) certainly provides to the moderators of IMDb a great opportunity. And that is to categorize ratings by large age groups (eg up to 25 y.o. and over 25 y.o. or something like that).

In this way, someone would have a more objective look on the critics expressed here, and on the other hand, rating would certainly be more representative..

I see ratings of 8 and 9 stars for this ""masterpiece""...I guess these same reviewers must have rated ""Alien"" or ""Aliens"" with 15 stars or even 20...otherwise there is a huge gap in sense of measure here, isn't it?

I strongly recommend to anyone who wants to watch this film, to watch it at home. He will certainly earn money, and if he is lucky, he might fall asleep on his sofa before he sees a rolling spaceship chasing people.","2"
"yernelg","Ambitious But Not Satisfying","2 October 2012","i love the whole concept of ""understanding human origin""... i mean Contact was a personal classic and Mission to Mars was memorable. thus this film's beginning has got me all excited. But then as quickly as it ignites your curiosity, it dampens it quite fast with poorly conceived scenes and storytelling bits that serves nothing to keep the pace and excitement of the film. noomi rapace is nowhere as great as her character in Girl With Dragon Tattoo series and theron is just waiting to be great but held at just a so-so good. fastbender on the other hand got me interested enough to see how the end would look like.

for a ridley scott film, i certainly wished this did better to justify its publicity spending and budget size.","4"
"greytuol","Good, But Could Have Been So Much More!","2 June 2012","I had been looking forward to this movie for quite some time, so when my friend bought me tickets, i duly obliged and went to see the movie on opening night.

Prometheus. A good film that people should rightly go and see, however there are moments where it is lacking the intensity and jumpiness that you would associate with a style of film that Ridley that has the 'DNA' of the Alien movie.

A lot of people are comparing it to his 1979 ground breaker, which, I personally believe people to be wrong, the actors and the directors have got it right in that it is not a direct prequel and Ridley himself said that it isn't the same planet that is used in the Alien movie, and has said that if it performs well at the box office there are up to 2 more movies before it becomes a direct prequel franchise.

Noomi Rapace and Michael Fassbender are the stars of this film. Noomi is the scientific discoverer with a belief in science as well as religion looking to ask the right questions on the origins of humanity. Michael is genuinely intriguing as the emotionless and 'soulless' creation of Weyland industries, with a hidden agenda.

Overall though, the film is relatively good in 3D, however there are a few moments where the 3D becomes a little budget and blurs its way across the screen. Impressive sets and locations, But ideally for this film to be truly good for the viewer a touch up on the script here and there would have worked wonders. With this said, it is nice to know that originality can still be brought out in cinema rather than all the sequels and remakes that are diluting quality film making. Keep it up Ridley!","8"
"tarun-sharma389","All that build up.and for what?","21 June 2015","This movie had all previous hype and a release date of Prometheus 2 to make me pick this up for the weekend flick. To my surprise, this movie did even turn half as good as I was told.

The movie starts off well with a group of scientist on a space expedition looking for the makers of humanity called Engineers. The concept seems interesting and it also builds up for all the hype in the first hour of the movie but it fails to live up to all that as soon as it progresses from there, which would include a few stupid decisions and a few mindless conversations between the scientists, mind you!!

This is one of those movies which had a lot potential but was wasted by poor script and landing in neither intellectual spotlight nor giving its fans a good old scare of alien genre. Characters are shallow and you won't be hooting for their lives when they are in danger.

Looking forward to Prometheus 2 though, I really hope they pull something better than the first one. Space has a lot of possibilities.","5"
"Tregrehan4","The fantastic Mr Scott does it again !","8 June 2012","The biggest mystery surrounding Prometheus is not one of the many things that are answered or go unanswered in the movie. No, the biggest mystery are the negative reviews i've read.

Heres a movie trying its best to get thought provoking, adult themes back in the Summer season, to take something back for the adults. To accomplish , if the internet in general is any indication of opinion, the task of giving a viewing option to an adult weary of giant Robots, Wizards and ""funny"" Pirates.

Yet some reviewers seem to want to crush this intention before it has a chance to garner any momentum. I think the ""Engineers"" have us well figured out, (it'll make sense when you've seen the film).

OK, the movie. If you've not seen it, i'm not going to spoil it, so instead here come the adjectives: epic, intriguing, eerie, beautiful. The actors are all uniformly on top form, the script, if you are paying attention, explains and propels proceedings along at an appropriate pace.

The story will drop images and theories in you lap from time to time that may confuse, but when the film is over, these seemingly disparate elements, with a little discussion with your fellow viewers, will coalesce into a ""ah-haa"" moment.

This is where Prometheus really scores. I was sceptical of explanations to the questions i felt were best left ambiguous, but what Ridley and his team have done, is give you some answers and more questions. Your getting your cake and being allowed to eat it, heres your answers, but oh by the way, heres some more even larger questions to fuel endless debate between you and your friends on the way home.

This film is enormous in terms of physical scale and ideas, i've been twice already and will be going again, don't focus on Alien, control your expectations and this movie will take you unawares in the most entertaining way.","10"
"mustardman29","Overrated....unfortunately","12 June 2012","I am a huge fan of the first 2 Alien movies. They are my favorite movies of all time. I have seen both more times than I can remember.

This movie was NOTHING like those 2. I probably would have enjoyed it more if it wasn't hyped as being a prequel that is comparable to those 2. I think most of the reviewers are blinded by the fact it was done by Ridley Scott and they seem to believe he can do no wrong.

The movie was OK but (with the exception of the automated surgery scene) never really captured that totally unique experience of believable suspenseful scifi like the first 2.

I also thought some of the casting was off like Charlize Theron. Seemed to me she was just thrown in there because some movie executive somewhere said the movie needed an A list female character.

Being a prequel to Alien, they should have also made sure it was consistent with that. There is a huge inconsistency at the ending that doesn't fit with that. I can't go into more details without it being a spoiler.","6"
"pedrombreis","Stupidity at its best","12 June 2012","There seems to be people in the world thinking that by putting nonsense into a movie they will drive people to ask more questions and perhaps see a sequel in order to get answers to those questions.

Well the problem with that theory is that in order for a story to be well delivered, characters must have character and be believable. There is not a single character in Prometheus that is coherent; as a matter of fact there are some characters so unbelievably stupid that it is impossible for anyone to consider that a very rich person would hire them in one of the most important missions of mankind. We can argue that David is the most coherent one and by far the most believable, but still has its minor issues.

Once you become aware of these inconsistencies you simply do not believe in the characters and lose complete faith in the whole movie. In fact you will see the movie as just a money making mechanism. It is a shame, because there was a lot of good material here to create an excellent movie.

The only good thing about the movie is the visual pleasure, but that alone is not enough to consider it an average movie.","3"
"konstantinosx","Could be a masterpiece but it is not...","15 July 2012","The search for our creator(s) is an eternal agony for human race. Film tries to give an answer by introducing us those giant size ""mechanics"" that are mentioned in many human mythologies. Film is starting well (although some of Prometheus crew seem a little bit ridiculous) with an epic approach. Technically is very well made. Effects are of the first class and actors are quite convincing in their roles. What makes this film not a masterpiece is the unsuitable high pace and the immature idea of extraterrestrial monsters that are being used as a ""hi-tech"" weapon. I don't like the idea of a human female getting pregnant by an alien monster and I also don't like the idea of having a kind of abortion all alone and being almost ready to fight just after 10 minutes. Finally, a good plan and a technically nice film gets low rating because of many old fashioned and immature ideas.","6"

The only reason I didn't give this a ""1"" is because of the great effects. At most parts the whole cinema was laughing with embarrassment! It was a ridiculous story with a worse ending. I still can't believe that the greatness that is Ridley Scott would direct such scenes as a talking detached robot head!!

"Daryl_G_Morrissey","Ridley Scott's 'Prometheus' - A Review","7 June 2012","For a film that has been highly anticipated, for over 30 years, Prometheus doesn't quite live up to the hype. If you have never seen the original Alien, then this is an okay stand-alone movie, to fill that quiet rainy afternoon, but If you are a die-hard Alien fan, then I am sure you are going to be sorely disappointed. I am not entirely sure what Sir Ridley Scott was trying to achieve, or where he was trying to go, with the story, but I think that too many ideas led him away from what he was trying to do. The story itself seems to be 'borrowed' from other movies and there are many correlations to Stanley Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey. Unfortunately, this doesn't help the movie, as it is never clear which storyline the film is trying to follow. The cast of characters are varied and many, too many in fact. as many of the characters are superfluous to the story and serve no real purpose, apart from to draw your attention away from how bad the script is. There is a scene where one of the missing crewmen returns and attacks the crew of the Prometheus, which does nothing for the storyline, except to keep the viewers awake. The actors themselves seem to do little to help this, with Idris Elba almost sleepwalking through his role as Janek, the Captain of the Prometheus. Guy Pearce is almost unrecognisable under some serious prosthetics, as the elderly Peter Weyland, which he is probably thankful for. Charlize Theron plays one of the coldest characters in the movie, but she isn't given the dialogue to complete the character of Meredith Vickers, the daughter of Peter Weyland. Michael Fassbender, on the other hand, steals the show as David, the android created by Peter Weyland to ensure the completion of the mission. His performance is strong but subtle with an almost sinister side always close to the surface. It is this character that leads us through the majority of the story. The set design is impressive and is based on the work of H.R.Giger, as in the original. The scares, in the movie, are few and not that scary, as there is no real sense of terror or suspense. The ending is bound to upset a few of the 'die-hard' Alien fans, too, as it raises more questions than it answers, leaving me to wonder was this the first of two or more prequels to Alien. The soundtrack, by Marc Streitenfeld, struggles to keep your attention, except when samples from the original Alien movie are stitched into the new score, as if to remind you that you are watching an Alien movie. Which was quite helpful as, about halfway through the movie, all I could think about was Star Trek V: The Final Frontier. Of course, the CGI is excellent, as would be expected of a Ridley Scott Science Fiction movie, but even this can't save the film and, at 124 minutes, I couldn't wait for it to end.

All-in-all I would give this film 3/10.","3"

Sure there is a lot of great stuff visually and the 3D is excellent. Unfortunately the rest is very poor. Be it the re-cycled robot who is all to human, a space ship that is started by playing the flute or the fact that all of the scientist exclusively make bad decisions.

The actions of all the characters are not very credible and the driving chaos force of the easily insulted robot is just the cheapest plot device. Which is bad, as the overall plot is pretty much the thinnest possible premise / excuse for an origin story. If you will a lame two hour prelude to ridiculously lame origin ""punch line"".

The whole film feels forced and stiff. Very staged and wooden, there is no flow, no chemistry, no character to connect to. Without Ridley Scotts name on it would probably have much worse reviews. I cannot remember seeing a movie where I cared less about the outcome this year.","5"
"lagudafuad","A good movie to see with a bowl of popcorn at your side","8 June 2012","This was meant to be the fifth entry in the Alien franchise, but was later set as a standalone film. Prometheus is a fun filled, action packed sci-fi thriller that will keep you at the edge of your sit. As the movie unfolds from a gentle thrilling experience to a rampaging killing frenzy that boiled down to a survival race, you the viewer will be kept captivated longing to see what's next.

Scott planned to make a prequel to Alien which he did in 1979, but the idea was later set aside as Fox had done a crossover between Alien and Predator in 2004 titled Alien vs. Predator as this movie already showed the begin of Alien.

Fox still went ahead with Scott to make this movie, but it will be parallel to the Alien movie, Scott stated that ""while Alien was indeed the jumping-off point for this project, out of the creative process evolved a new, grand mythology and universe in which this original story takes place the ideas tackled in this film are unique, large and provocative."" The high note in Prometheus was Noomi Rapace, her acting and actions were well received by I the viewer, and the way she played the role of what I will call, the modern day Ripley was something to see. There were many intense scenes where I respected hey portrayal of the character. This is also a credit to the director as Scott was able to bring out the best in her so as to make her live up to the shadow casted by Sigourney Weaver as the female lead in an Alien world.

Set in the 21st Century, couple Elizabeth Shaw and Charlie Holloway discovers a star map among the remnants of several ancient Earth civilizations; they interpret it to be an invitation from humanity's forerunners. The couple with a crew went onboard the spaceship named ""Prometheus"" to follow the star map discovered.

This Led to a distant world and an advanced civilization, the crew seeks the origins of humanity, but instead discovers a threat that could cause the extinction of the human race.

Shooting began in 2010, and went on longer than planned, the movie shows Ridley Scott at his best with scenes and the story well depicted that all times you are not lost. The cast had a task on their hand, a task in which they lived up to. The cinematography and lighting are just exquisite and the sound is well suited to the movie itself, giving you an all round feel of what a good movie should be.

The movie had its twist and turns that made it more captivating and some you won't even expect.

Noomi Rapace is best known for her role as Lisbeth Salander in the Swedish/Danish film adaptations of the Millennium series: The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo (2009), The Girl Who Played with Fire and The Girl Who Kicked the Hornets' Nest. Also to watch out for is Michael Fassbender who plays David (an android) in this movie and was a key feature in the movie itself. Michael Fassbender also played Magneto in the superhero film X-Men: First Class (2011).

A well-cast, expertly directed and massive undertaking in the jaw-dropping visual effects and production design - to wit: a risky turn by Rapace as the anthropologist/true believer determined to get answers even at her own peril (and I do mean peril!); satin-smooth/scary-smart Fassbender as the synthetic David whose looks (and hidden agenda?) are modeled after Peter O'Toole's LAWRENCE OF ARABIA (!) ; and Arthur Max' amazing eye for details with expert cinematography by Dariusz Wolski and a doom-laden score by Marc Streitenfeld - is only hampered by a rather rote storyline by Jon Spaihts and Damon Lindelof - while touchstoning such echoes of its predecessors, Carpenter's THE THING, 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY and even in ATTACK OF THE 50 FOOT WOMAN (OK OK - Rapace's underwear costume at a key point that rivals the original's chest-bursting arrival out of John Hurt's cavity that truly gives new meaning to pregnant pause). Scott still has the eye for detail and epic scope that can only be rivaled by his legacy and that in itself is worthy of applause but perhaps too much wishful thinking that this would be of even weight.

"xiaoli7377","Ehhh","21 December 2022","""Prometheus"" tries to be cerebral about the origins of mankind but ends up also trying to tie in with the dark survival horror aspects associated with the ""Aliens"" franchise. And these two things don't really gel well here for me. It's got a whole lot of themes of creationism and Darwinism but a lot of the tropes border on the cliché and it's hard for me to pinpoint what the tone of the movie is supposed to be. Production is very good, I liked the special effects and the viewer is subjected to some pretty graphic and disturbing imagery. I didn't really feel like I knew any of the characters well and I just think it's a little messy. Had it been a standalone film it might have been a little better. The thought provoking ""what it means to be human"" stuff was already done much better in ""Blade Runner"", and the horror stuff was already done better in ""Alien."" It's a decent movie but not one that's all that great and tries to be too many things.","7"
"andrewgunwin","Utter science fiction brilliance.","2 June 2012","This has to be the best film I have ever been to the cinema to see.

Genuinely original : most of the time these days with modern films, you can pretty much work out the entire story within a few minutes of it starting, you genuinely can not do this with Prometheus, providing you don't probe the internet for spoilers, you will be in for a film where you really don't know what is going to happen.

Quite frightening : really, the horror is different and chilling.

Believable characters : Every Ridley Scott film is filled with characters that feel real, organic, not rigidly type-casted to fill time space in a script.

Entertaining for those with an intellect : Admittedly when I left the cinema there were people whom were voicing there negative opinions about the film, mainly because they couldn't understand it or were expecting something else, most films are dumbed down for ease of understanding, this is not, it has a philosophical depth to it which makes you think.

I do not believe in spoiling the surprise that awaits them, enjoy Prometheus for what it is , A genuinely original science fiction horror, Ridley Scott delivers a masterpiece that I will be purchasing on Blu-ray when it is released.","10"
"lesleyharris30","A Very Unnecessary Prequel,","26 August 2015","Prometheus is a decent movie with a reasonably well developed storyline and a talented cast. As a sci-fi film it definitely has some great scenes, it is beautifully directed by Ridley Scott, returning to the directors chair for an Alien film for the first time since the 1979 original, and certainly brings many interesting 3D characters to life, particularly Michael Fassbender, who may not be playing the most likable character, but there is always compelling characteristics to David that make him the most intriguing character and the one we always want to find more about. My biggest problem with this film is that it really dosen't feel like a prequel to Alien, there are very few references or mentions of anything that actually connect with the previous films, it all just feels very unnecessary, like we're following characters who only have a slight connection to the journey Ripley and her crew head off on in the first movie. I felt this film could have worked out so much better as its own film, going in to a prequel to Alien directed by Ridley Scott, I was expecting a psychological thriller, instead I got a dialogue based voyage that only gets exciting at about the last ten minutes, it would have worked out better if I didn't have these expectations and went in knowing this was a completely original idea, but even when these characters lives start to be put in real danger, I don't feel anything for them, and I certainly didn't have a sympathy or remorse for anyone that does die, the dynamics between this cast are nowhere near the same as the first Alien and because of that we don't feel the same type of sadness to see any of them killed. It's jam packed with flaws and unanswered questions, but If you're a fan of the Alien franchise you should definitely see what you think of it and Prometheus is definitely worth the watch for its talented cast and beautiful cinematography, watch it if you see it on television or Netflix, but don't go out of your way to see it.

"tomsview","Would you like some tongue with that?","14 December 2013","At time of writing, this is the 2,159th review for Ridley-Scott's ""Prometheus"", and I wanted to put a positive word in for this movie although I am aware that twice as many reviewers hated the film as loved it. If there is one common complaint amongst the disappointed fans it is that this prequel doesn't do justice to ""Alien"".

But I think it does for the most part. In fact, I feel that the things that let down ""Prometheus"" are also evident in ""Alien"". But of course, ""Alien"" was ground breaking in its overall design and special effects; it was always going to be a tough act to follow.

There are some brilliant ideas in ""Prometheus"", especially the opening where the humanoid creature disintegrates on the edge of the waterfall, allowing his DNA to flow into Earth's oceans, sparking life. It's a neat tie-in with the Prometheus of Greek Mythology, however, God, as most of us understand him, doesn't actually feature in the movie – maybe he'll get a cameo in ""Prometheus 2"".

After the opening sequence, the film leaps forward eons as a human crew traces the possible roots of our existence on a moon in a distant solar system. If anything creates the weak spots in ""Prometheus"" it's the interaction between some of the characters, which was also evident in ""Alien"" – both films lack humour.

Funny doesn't seem to be Ridley Scott's forte. Sure, combating face-hugging crustaceans, and drooling, double-mouthed reptilian creatures is no laughing matter, but in both movies there was at least one character where a lighter touch was attempted: Harry Dean Stanton's character in ""Alien"" and Sean Harris' outspoken Fifield in ""Prometheus"". The opportunity was there for a little wit amongst the gloom, instead, both characters are irritating. It's a relief when ""I love rocks"" Fifield is possessed by the aliens, and although he becomes more dangerous, he also becomes less annoying.

""Prometheus"" expands on the effects from ""Alien"". A self-administered caesarean birth replaces the chest-burster; David, the human-like android in ""Prometheus"", is more user-friendly than Ash from the earlier movie, and if ""Alien"" had one severed head, ""Prometheus"" has severed heads all over the place. And, we mustn't forget the alien tongue kiss, which gets a real workout in ""Prometheus"".

Although derivative to a degree, I think most fans would have been disappointed if these old friends didn't make an appearance in some way in the new movie.

One big theme that ""Prometheus"" brings forward from ""Alien"" is girl-power. Instead of just Sigourney Weaver's indestructible heroine, ""Prometheus"" presents two powerful females; Charlise Theron as the tightly-buttoned Meredith Vickers and Noomi Rapace as uber-resilient Elizabeth Shaw. In both movies, the males seem to be around simply as alien tongue-fodder.

It's easy to find inconsistencies in ""Prometheus"", but there is also much to admire. The special effects are awesome and Marc Streitenfeld provides a score with a powerful anthem that takes a different approach to Jerry Goldsmith's ominous score for ""Alien"". Anyway, I judge a movie by how much it catches my imagination and holds my attention – ""Prometheus"" ticks both boxes for me. I'm actually looking forward to ""Prometheus 2"".","7"
"huxleyb","Is it Our Beginning or Our End","1 June 2012","I must say I had high expectations for this, especially with all the hype and Virals/Trailers seen. I was not disappointed :).

So what to say about Prometheus. Yes it is prequel to Alien in the loosest sense, in that it is set in the same area of space. It starts off with information found about our so called creators on this planet via cave painting in Scotland of all places, which then leads them LV232(or something like that ;)) a planet a long way from Earth.

I don't want to give too much away. But as you may expect Alien life is encountered and not quite what was first thought. Are our creators also going to be our destroyers? You originally see the engineers (There title in this movie) briefly in the original alien movie (also known as Space Jockeys).

The acting in this movie is very good. Some have stated that not all the characters have enough information or build up about them. This may well be the case. But then in Alien was every character fleshed out before they died, No.

I thought Rapace was excellent in the lead role (Elizabeth Swan) as was Fassbender as David. As with most of these types of movies, don't expect many to survive.

For all the lovers of Aliens movies. There is a face hugger, but a lot different than you have seen before and H R Giger is involved, so you can guess the rest.

So does this match up to the original Alien Series. In my opinion it does. It may not be quite as good Alien and Aliens. But repeat viewing will be needed to fully appreciate this movie. It is amazingly shot and brilliantly directed as you may expect from Scott (Not counting Robin Hood).

It was definitely made to have a sequel. Which unless it doesn't make its money back surely has to be no brainer. I would say to anyone, go and watch it and it needs to be seen in the cinema at least once to appreciate it. I saw it in 3D and although not obtrusive as some 3D, I would not bother again, 2D is all that is needed. Enjoy","7"
"room102","Prometheus (2012)","20 June 2012","Saw the 3D version yesterday at the cinema and for objectivity's sake, I'm writing this review before reading any other review.

""Prometheus"" is the only movie I've watched at the cinema in 3D since ""Avatar"" and it only comes to show how brilliant ""Avatar"" was. ""Avatar""'s 3D technology wasn't only revolutionary, but it was used brilliantly in the 3D space of the movie, with constant camera moves on all axes and with flying objects. You really felt like you're flying. In addition, the entire environment was very ""3D"" - not just 2 or 3 planes (as in ""surface""), but multi-plane with trees and objects coming from every angle and great use of picture depth. In ""Prometheus"" you have nothing of that - the 3D technology is nothing more than ""nice"" and it adds almost nothing to the experience of watching the movie. Nobdody can come close to James Cameron's technical skills and ""Avatar"" stays a brilliant piece of technology achievement.

Now, the movie itself: Technical side was nice and the visual effects were very well handled. In terms of thrill I was quite disappointed: It was nothing as thrilling or exciting as any of the other ""Alien"" movies - I constantly waited for something ""big"" to happen and nothing really did. The very ending was rather good, but it doesn't make up for 2 hours of ""something is going to happen"" without any delivery.

As for the plot, it was weird and a bit mixed-up. I liked some of the ideas there, but basically it felt like a mash-potato that tries to tie things up and finish with what we saw in ""Alien"". It felt like the prequel to ""The Thing"" - it was interesting to watch, but it ignored some of the ideas of the original movie and even ruined some of the stuff we imagined in our mind. For example: The ""Space Jockey"" wasn't even a living thing, it was just a space-suit; The stress-call/warning signal wasn't made by aliens, but by humans; And the thing I have the biggest problem with: How come the ""Alien"" is born in eggs if it was actually created by fusing (twice) with human DNA?

Will there be a sequel to the prequel? Perhaps. Basically, the ending of this movie seems to tie the plot to the beginning of ""Alien"", so there's nothing more to add there. On the other hand, they conveniently left another plot open: The search for the ""Engineers"" and the reason for creating, then trying to destroy humanity on earth.

All in all, the movie was fun to watch, but it doesn't come close to the level of ""Alien"" and ""Aliens"". I recommend you watching the movie - 2D version is enough.

"ijameson","Nonsense","29 August 2020","Beautifully shot utter nonsense.

It also makes no logical sense. There was no point to this movie.","4"
"cadfile","Good if you have never seen an ""Alien"" film","9 December 2012","I finally watched Prometheus for the 2nd time the other night. It was actually my first time all the way through. The first time I stopped watching just as the cast started exploring the alien structure because I got bored. After watching the complete film from start to the end I can say that this is a decent movie if you have no prior knowledge of the ""Alien"" mythology.

There is a reason why director Ridley Scott tried to distance ""Prometheus"" from his previous film ""Alien"" because the films are completely different in tone and texture. ""Prometheus"" uses tons of CGI and epic story telling while ""Alien"" was murky, with practical effects, and a dose of mystery. Being a fan of the ""Alien"" series of films, I was disappointed with ""Prometheus"" because it was so different from the ""Alien"" style. I guess the tools and costumes looked too futuristic compared to the ""Alien"" films.

I might be more enthusiastic with the film had it been set on a different Earth like planet like it would be a different branch of the ""Alien"" story. As it is the story has basically the same beats as the original ""Alien"" story (finding an alien structure, one of the crew is killed, a member of the crew is impregnated with an alien creature, the android attempts to bring back a creature and goes rogue). Some of the plot holes (Elizabeth Shaw has major surgery with no recovery time) were a bit much to ignore but really wasn't a deal breaker for me.

If you have any knowledge of the ""Alien"" series then ""Prometheus"", in my mind, should be thought of as a reboot of the ""Alien"" story with better special effects. That why I liked the film overall even with the problems I mentioned and I would like to see a sequel if it gets made.","6"
"me_paustian","Strange Biology","22 June 2012","I was disappointed in the movie Prometheus, which may have been better as a philosophical story about aliens beings creating humanity without involving the Alien franchise. (Not as much of a money maker, perhaps.) Two movies were there; combining them did not given depth or clarity to the plot. Emendations to improve the script follow:

1) In the movie, large, luminously white humanoid beings created humans on earth with their own DNA. Anyone who's gotten a B in a high school biology class should know that i) we are 98% related to chimpanzees, and our evolution on earth is understood fairly well, and ii) if we belong to the same species as the luminous humanoid aliens, why do we look so different? So, THESE ALIENS COULD NOT HAVE MADE HOMO SAPIENS WITH THEIR OWN DNA. If we want an origins story, either these aliens should have began all life on earth (not believable even within this imaginary universe, since multicellular life began 1 billion years ago) or they just contributed/tweaked the genes that make human beings unique from the other great apes, such as those genes contributing to speech, brain size, etc. Can't the script writers consult with biologists to get their plot to make sense? Also, why can't these aliens just be the cool trunked reptile creatures that they appear at first to be, rather than revealing that their skin is external armor? The entertainment industry is way too anthropocentric.

2) Why did the humanoid aliens have to be the originators of the Aliens, and worse yet, accidental originators? The nasty H.R. Geiger Aliens could have evolved on a hostile planet and contacted a visiting party of the space-faring (reptile-trunked) humanoid aliens. Ridley Scott et al. were too intent on writing a twisted origins story involving human beings for their Aliens. IT DOESN'T MAKE ANY BLOODY SENSE FOR ALIENS TO COME INTO BEING SPONTANEOUSLY.

3) ""Prometheus"" is a Greco-Roman myth about a titan who stole fire from the gods to give to mankind, and his punishment lasted forever after. WHERE IS THIS PROMETHEUS IN THE PLOT??? Wait for the sequel, maybe? (The first alien humanoid shown, appearing to kill himself by consuming a biological weapon, may have been something like that tragic figure, but no information to that effect was given.)

4) What is the logic behind the android David's behavior? Presumably, he was programmed to be loyal and supportive to the company president who funded the mission, but he didn't really act to protect the president from the reawakened humanoid alien. For no particular reason, he infected the one scientist, and he helped Noomi Rapace to survive. The androids in both the Alien and Aliens movies behaved consistently, in the former to support the economic interests of the mining company and in the latter to aid the escape of humans from the colony. Android David should not have acted like an amalgam of the two.

Actually, not that much needs to be changed to make a better non-Alien movie. Large white humanoid aliens tweak early hominid DNA to make us the way we are, hang out with the incipient Homo sapiens who make cave paintings, and then decide that they should eliminate humans with a non-Alien biocide weapon. Tada, all good. Heck, they even could have adopted the already existing Aliens as a military weapon, which they could have been readying to deploy to earth.

I regret that the Aliens don't have a very different origin story. In my version, there are no humans at the beginning but strange races of alien space-travelers that pick up and accidentally disperse the pernicious Aliens from their brutal home planet. We could have some crazy fantastic sequences of planet-bound civilizations and space ships battling Alien infestations. That is what the people want.","6"
"steve_madak","Ridley Scott must be rusty","3 May 2014","I don't see how this has gotten such a high rating. I guess people see that Ridley Scott decided to direct again and we all just give him a pass?

Aside from production value this movie is horribly made. One of the hallmarks of a great director is their ability to make a story that makes sense. Or at least makes sense 99% of the time and that 1% you just let go because 99% is pretty damn good. With this movie there are so many plot questions its not even funny. From characters who appear out of nowhere to people running around like middle schoolers at a museum, when in fact they should be trained scientists. Also, the android who wants to poison some of his own crew,... for what? To take them back to earth? That's stolen from Alien. I could go on and on. This thing is a hot mess.

Why write a review now? I made an IMDb account for the sole purpose of writing this review because it seems over the last two years since this movie came out few have had the balls to call this pig out for the stinker it is. Sorry Ridley that you are so much of an icon nobody is going to tell you the truth. I imagine for some having the ability to leave one on the kitchen table and everybody gather around it and tell you it's a peach would be a turn on. I think you need some truth in your life.

"scifilucy","Left feeling robbed","3 October 2012","Bit late I know but i'm still annoyed about this film a few months later so felt the need to review.

I went to see it in 3D IMAX, fully expecting it to look amazing, and yeah, there were a couple of scenes when I did utter the word 'wow' and grabbed at the CG symbols floating a few inches in front of me but that was about it. Those couple of scenes did not in anyway make up for this train-wreck of a film. Hardly ever is a film so expected to be great thats its probably no shock it doesn't live up to expectation. all the characters where shallow and two dimensional. The only stand out performance was the wonderful Michael Fassbender who was really wasted.

Not once did I jump or hide behind my fingers. To say this is part of the Alien anthology is just a plain insult. the brilliance of Alien and Aliens (started to get a bit shabby after those two)was the wonderful Sigourney Weaver as the independent and strong yet basically normal woman pitted against a truly terrifying adversary who rises to the occasion where all others fail due to her brains and innate understanding of the Alien creature.

Prometheus lacks this most pivotal and basic need of any successful terror-type film - to feel the fear of the character, and to live the moments with them.

I couldn't have cared less what happened to any of the characters and the ridiculous slightly religious connotations of the creation of not just the aliens (you know what I mean) had me rolling my eyes and wishing to leave early.

I give this 4 just for Fassbender and the occasional effects, but I wouldn't even bother renting this film, wait until its free on TV.","4"

Some plots are so mind-blasting that I replayed it over and over in my head, and one incident comes right after another. The storyline itself was so interesting and un-cliché, that you have no idea how this movie will end. Best of all, the trailer didn't reveal much, so don't read any spoilers to spoil the fun!

A lot of negative reviews refers to unexplained behaviors and no character development. Hey, this is true to many other blockbuster movies, so I didn't find this a problem.

The story feels like it has been patched together from a serious of clichéd scenes but without a coherent thread.

I lost interest less than half-way through and have to admit that I surfed the internet during the rest of the movie as I was getting bored with the endless drivel.

I can't really think of much good to say about the movie. The special effects were (mostly) well done but in the same way that we have become used to in modern movies. The script was average. The story was confused, but not in an interesting way. The story telling was poor. It wasn't even scary.

This not one of those movies. The holes pile up so high that by the end of the movie you realize you really have no idea why anyone did anything they did, nor why anyone would spend hundreds of millions of dollars making such a piece of crap film. My girlfriend fell asleep in the first 15 minutes and when she woke up at the end she asked what happened and I honestly couldn't explain any of it because I didn't know myself.

"ltchavezjr","""Science"" Fiction Taking Leaps of Irrationality.","8 October 2023","As cliché as it may sound, I have to state that I don't write reviews because of the opportunity costs that are involved. However, the ample use of irrationality as a way to be stylistic, gives ground for pause in Prometheus. So I write this from a mathematician's (proof writing) point of view.

The initial premise of the film is that life on earth, including humans, had sourced alien DNA. Humans, via physical science findings along with archaeological/anthropological extrapolations, came to this conclusion.

Ok, interesting, let's see where this takes us.

In light of these initial findings, Peter Weyland comes up with the hypothesis that, ""If this black ooze (alien sourced DNA) has the ability to derive life, then surely it can prolong existing life"". So he bankrolls a mission to find it and for the respective application.

During this mission, we have all these scenes, too numerous to account for here, that engage in chosen irrationality. In other word if Option A is preferred to Option B, and Option B is the preferred to Option C, well let's throw caution to the wind and select Option C for old time's sake. So edgy!

This is what makes this film so problematic.

Yes, you can have a couple of characters that can be emotionally driven to the point of BSC, but to have most of the critical team members who are allegedly highly trained (supposedly highly paid), well vetted professionals, technicians, scientists, etc. Act like a bunch of incompetent fools, does not bode well and is unconvincing.

While this happening, David has to test the hypothesis whether or not the black ooze can prolong existing life and furthermore, can the resulting DNA mutations be transferred, So David initiates the experiment on Dr. Charlie Holloway and Dr. Elizabeth Shaw (unbeknown to them). Well, the mutated DNA does transfers, but it certainly does not prolong existing life.

Given these micro anecdotal findings and the accidental findings of how the crew got killed in the alien structure, David relays these findings along with the discovery of a live ""Engineer"" (Mala'kak) to Peter Weyland, Peter then has to reformulates his initial hypothesis and pivot to the new hypothesis that the only way to see if one can prolong existing life is to ask the source itself, the ""Engineer"".

This hypothesis goes south really quick, but it is understandable why it does.

What is implied through this discovery is that yes, the alien sourced DNA can help generate life, but life is also a product of its environment's elements (and the combinatoric randomness that comes with it). In other words, the human race is an evolutionary product of alien sourced DNA and elements of the Earth (i.e. Organic Chemistry). This is also true for the planet LV223 and the resulting vile creatures that inhabit it.

So the ""Engineers"" had this figured out and had a dual mission: the black ooze or the alien sourced DNA, can be weaponized and stockpiled, and also, they need to reengage with their field laboratories, i.e. Earth and other celestial systems/objects because they can potentially generate threats to the ""Engineers"". So when the ""Engineer"" is woken up, the ""Engineer"" see the projected threat, hears it, and proceeds to eliminate it, then go off to and destroy the threat's associated field laboratory, Earth.

This is where the ""story"" just becomes silly with its lather of irrationality.

Dr. Shaw convinces the ship's crew captain that the only way to save Earth is a Kamikaze mission directed at the ""Engineer's"" spacecraft and lo and behold it works! But here is the laughable part, Dr. Shaw has some self-serving revelation that she needs to confront the race of ""Engineers"" on why they created humans and want to destroy them, which contradicts and neutralizes the intent and outcome of the Kamikaze mission.

Furthermore, because if it took a Kamikaze mission to eliminate one ""Engineer"", how the hell is Dr. Shaw along with a dilapidated David going to confront a planet/system of ""Engineers"" (Mala'kaks)? A potential ""Engineers'"" capture of Dr. Shaw and David, along with the resulting information discovery, would guarantee the elimination of Earthlings and other laboratory systems because of the perceived threat they entail.

One response would be, is David engineering Dr. Shaw's demise on that ship?

OOOOhhh clever!

Here's the problem with that. There are way too many unknowns that could cause his failure and leading to her success of finding and interfacing the ""Engineers"".

First, David would have to deduce, going to the ""Engineers'"" planet/system would be a suicide mission that would result in the elimination of humans for reasons explained above.

Why introduce and entertain the risk of his potential malfunctioning, the probability of his blueprint to kill her or the sabotage her plan going wrong, resulting in her stated objective, being achieved, by assisting Dr. Shaw in meeting the ""Engineers'""?

However, if David's goal is to get revenge on humans and use the ""Engineer"" as a vector to do so, why alert Dr. Shaw to the ""Engineer's"" presence? So this is not a realistic or logical motive either.

Given that Dr. Shaw is emotionally driven, David would have greater success of eliminating such narcissism (disguised as humanistic hubris) and the resulting devastating outcome by convincing her of her heroism and for her to slowly self-sacrifice. This achieves satiation. But there is none to be had.

As for the movie production itself.

This film tries to mix the rigors of Star Trek, with the humanity of Star Wars and throws in irrationality as a proxy of being edgy, but it simply does not work.

Jon Spaihts tried to write something elegantly formal. Damon Lindelof tried to adapt Greek mythology and Shakespeare to the Cosmos with postmodern sensibilities, and the executive producers did their thing with explosions, sex scenes and big visuals. What you get is a Three-Way Mexican Standoff where the unsuspecting audience gets a salad of contempt and lead.

The styles are competing vs cooperating. And they definitely cooperate in movies such as Platoon, Empire Strikes Back, the Godfather, The Shining and Gummo.

With Prometheus, they could have the styles cooperating by having the characters competing, where the first act is the Social Scientists vs the STEM Scientists, then the Academics/Intellectuals vs the Capitalists and in the final act, it aggregates to humanity vs the ""Engineers"" and the ""edgy nouveau"" would be dual serving outcomes.

Instead, you get a clown show of buffoonery trying to sell the audience its irrational narrative as pseudointellectualism. It's not innovative, it's stupid and insulting. Then again what do I know? It raked in almost a half a billion dollars. So where does the commentary really reside?","1"
"slak96u","It must feel like your God abandoned you","6 April 2023","Prometheus follows a team of scientists, led by Dr. Elizabeth Shaw (played by Noomi Rapace), and an android named David (played by Michael Fassbender), who embark on a mission aboard the spaceship Prometheus to a distant moon in search of the Engineers, a race of extraterrestrial beings who may have created humanity. As the team explores the moon, they encounter mysterious and often terrifying discoveries that challenge their beliefs about the origins of life on Earth and the true intentions of the Engineers.

One of the strengths of Prometheus is its visual and technical aspects. Ridley Scott's direction is masterful, creating a visually stunning and immersive world that is both awe-inspiring and terrifying. The film's visual effects are top-notch, with breathtaking landscapes, intricate spacecraft, and horrifying creatures that add to the overall sense of wonder and unease.

The performances in Prometheus are also noteworthy. Noomi Rapace delivers a compelling performance as Dr. Elizabeth Shaw, a determined and resourceful scientist who becomes the film's protagonist. Michael Fassbender is captivating as the android David, portraying him with an uncanny mix of artificial intelligence and human-like mannerisms. Charlize Theron, Idris Elba, and Guy Pearce also deliver solid performances in their respective roles, adding depth to the ensemble cast.

One of the film's main strengths is its philosophical and existential themes. Prometheus delves into questions about the origins of life, the nature of creation, and the search for meaning and purpose. It explores the human desire to understand our place in the universe and the consequences of seeking answers to questions that may be beyond our comprehension. The film poses thought-provoking questions but leaves many of them unanswered, inviting audiences to ponder and interpret the film's meaning long after the credits roll.

However, Prometheus has been criticized for its plot and character development. The film's narrative can be complex and convoluted, with some plot points and character motivations left unexplained or inconsistent. Some viewers found the characters' actions and decisions to be illogical or inconsistent, which can be frustrating and detract from the overall story.

Despite its flaws, Prometheus is a visually stunning and intellectually challenging film that pushes the boundaries of the science fiction genre. It offers a unique blend of awe-inspiring visuals, philosophical themes, and horror elements, creating a thought-provoking viewing experience. While it may not be for everyone, those who appreciate visually ambitious and thought-provoking science fiction films will find much to ponder and discuss in Prometheus.","7"
"Medacakathareal","Mixed Reactions","9 June 2012","Immediately after viewing Ridley Scott's triumphant return to science fiction I found myself a divided house. On the one hand we have stunning visuals, some fantastic alien creatures, and a story that delves into deep themes about the creation and destruction of life. On the other hand however we have one-dimensional characters whose motivations are often dubious or whose actions are often inconsistent with aspects of their characters seen moments ago. We have a plot that wants to pretend it's all about seeking our creators, whoever or whatever they may be, which much also pay lip-service to Alien by having obligatory suspense and terror.

The film has been called related to Alien but not a prequel in and of itself, but this is just a clever marketing gimmick to skirt around the fact that the movie attempts to answer all the questions a fan of Alien might have about xenomorphs and what created them AND us, but then it falls short and answers none of them. The movie comes tantalizingly close to connecting the dots in a satisfactory way but then in the final act decides against bringing the story to an agreeable climax and instead opts to simply set up more sequels.

Presumably these sequels will also connect the dots further leading in to Alien. So while I enjoyed the film and absolutely love seeing Ridley play around in the visual sandbox that is the Alien universe again, I also feel very much cheated by the movie. It teases you with pseudo-explanations and leaves you filling in many of the blanks yourself while the dots it does connect with Alien only leave you with further questions. Had this movie only been tangentially related to Alien, but been a stand-alone story, it could have worked, but the movie instead seems to want to be half-prequel and half-original all while setting up for a sequel to the prequel. Honestly after feeling hoodwinked by this film I'm not sure I want to pay to see another two hour plus series of half-answers, when really deep down the xenomorphs themselves are more interesting than pseudo-philosophical musings on how and why they were created.

The movie is by no means bad, it has its flaws to be sure, but if the buzz so far is any indication I have a feeling it will be polarizing and leave many who had different expectations with a bad taste in their mouths. In the end it's hard to give it a rating on a scale of 1-10, parts of it are brilliant, stunning, and deep, other parts of it are shallow, pointless, and at times downright silly. Not bad, perhaps okay, but certainly not great.","6"
"michaelRokeefe","Searching for life on the outskirts of the universe.","2 December 2012","Ridley Scott directs this masterful Sci-Fi adventure. In 2089 archeologists Elizabeth Shaw(Noomi Rapace)and Charlie Holoway(Logan Marshall-Green)discover cave drawings in Scotland that feature an alignment of stars of which don't match any pattern in our solar system. The drawings are very similar to ones discovered in other archaeological digs from around the world. Shaw and Holoway are certain they are dealing with an invitation to unlock the mysteries of man's origins on Earth. The two archeologists join a moderate size crew of scientists and engineers on a high tech ship called Prometheus to journey where no man has gone before.Weyland Industries, owners of the Prometheus, send representative Meredith Vickers(Charlize Theron)to supervise the trek. After landing on a remote planet, artifacts are found that appear to contradict what our species has thought of its origins. More discoveries will actually prove that the very future of mankind as we know it is at stake. Very imaginative special effects. PROMETHEUS runs 124 minutes and it is hard to find a dull moment.

"Petethedongle","Hollywood Killed the Sci-Fi Star","6 June 2012","I blame those no good Hollywood fat cat studio execs, sitting on their over paid pen pushing asses, for the state of film making these days. Let's face it, if this film wasn't part of the Alien franchise and had nothing to do with Ridley Scott it would not have been made. And for good reason.

Prometheus sucked balls. And sucked balls big time! While it is not the worst movie I have ever seen, I expected far better than this. It seemed to have all the right ingredients, but some how they cooked up a turd sandwich. I can't believe the amount of people who have given it a good review solely based on the fact that it looked good. And it did look great. The CGI was awesome and the use of real sets for once was a refreshing change from the endless amount of films that are totally filmed in front of a blue/green screen these days.

I am a huge fan of Alien and Aliens. This film deserved to be so much better. So low was my opinion of this film I thought that surely I had missed some vital plot device that would make everything fit into place. If anyone could explain to me these few points I would consider changing my mind.

Through out all the major civilizations that have existed on earth there are these records of a distant solar system that they used to ""worship"" or something. Why and how? Why did they worship this? If the aliens created life on earth and then abandoned us to evolve as we have done, how do the Inca's, Mayan's and the Egyptians know of them unless there had been direct contact between the aliens and these cultures. This sounds like the shaky explainings of the AVP movies!

OK OK. So these cultures some how knew of this distant solar system. Why did the aliens tell them? This planet (LV 223) is a WMD processing/storage facility. Why do we need to know of this place. Surely their home world would have been more suitable to finger paint on your cave wall.

So the Prometheus lands next to the alien structure and the gung ho bunch of experts, the best money can buy, proceed to break every scientific protocol in the book and somehow seem to be surprised when it starts to go wrong. Why did David poison Charlie with the alien goo? Why would he do that? Without knowing the difference between this super genetic material and a puddle of Jelli Baff why would he spike his drink with it? What was he expecting to happen, and based on what knowledge? And the guy dies horribly. What did he learn or gain from that, that he couldn't have learned through proper scientific research. It makes no sense.

How did the captain figure out that the whole planet was a WMD factory? I assume there is a scene or 2 that was cut from the film and was replaced with this one line and called it ""plot development"".

Why was there an ""Engineer"" in stasis in the first place. Why did he go into hibernation 2000+ years ago after all his friends died? And why did he, upon waking immediately decide he must wipe out Earth? He didn't even read his emails or a newspaper to catch up on what had happened in the thousands of years he'd been asleep. He just woke up and decided that genocide was the first order of the day.

I feel if I was to start talking about the characters I would exceed the word limit. They are just poorly thought out faces who you do not grow to love or care about. Fassbender was awesome as David, but that's it. The scientist couple, Elizabeth and Charlie were just annoying. Surely they can't fool Sci-Fi fans with these 2 jokers pretending to be scientists. I was glad when Charlie died and the thing they pulled out of Elizabeth was like a generic movie monster that didn't seem to have much imagination put into it at all. Not that it was relevant to anything.

Overall I think that someone had a good idea for this film, but them some studio executive came along and said ""That sounds great. But what if."" And the result was a mish mash of ideas that collectively doesn't make much sense. Ridley Scott said himself that they edited it to be a certificate 15 as ""that can mean the difference of around $80M in box office takings"". So in the end I think art had to make concessions for what is really important, making money, right Ridley?

Sci-Fi is dead. Hollywood killed it. Can anyone name me a truly great Sci-Fi film released in the last 10 years? Depending if you count super hero movies as Sci-Fi, there are one or 2 at best.","3"
"deexsocalygal","Doesn't make anything clear.","8 October 2020","What good is it to have a movie that is so far fetched, unrealistic, unscientific, unbelievable unclear, & at the end concludes nothing?

"bent-mathiesen","Nice visual effects","11 May 2015","I love good visual effects, and this movie is full of them.

However, I am not fond of the classical setup, where an evil/self centered individual with lots of power, send people on a mission with no concern for their safety. These people always seem to destroy more than any alien force.

And this movie is like this. The initiator of the mission want to safe his life, have his own private robot to do his misplaced self centered egoism. We see that every day in the current world, and nothing seem to have changed in the year 2093.

But very nice visual effects. Actors play very well, though no deep thoughts to any of their doings is applied. It is typical 'alien' scare effects and actions - pretty much the whole movie after the initial landing. Bring you back to the original 'alien' movie.

I will not dwell into possible or impossible scenes. Just say they are very well made in term of visual effects.","7"
"dpc69","Vanity, vanity, all is vanity","26 December 2014","Ridley Scott made this movie...WHY? All kinds of visual sumptuousness and every cheap ""gotcha"" trick in the book. But all roads lead to nowhere. Couldn't he find any writers, real writers...instead of guys sitting around throwing around things like ""Hey, how about if she aborts the alien growing inside herself...huh?"" ""Oh, and we have to have a decapitated robot, right?"" To many of these scenes are ""how about"" questions that we don't care if they are ever answered. What about plot, motivations and yeah, real character development! I watched the protagoness run and run and run and get nowhere. It was like watching a headless chicken in a barnyard. That would be less painful than watching this pointless exercise in cinematography. Could the producers of this ponderous pile of pseudo-science fiction be as empty-headed as the characters of the drivel-fueled screenplay seem to imply? They behave dumber than dirt, touching everything in sight, walking around with their helmets off in an alien environment they know is infected with ""something"". No scientific protocol, no adherence to quarantine procedures and no real reason to do anything that they do. I mean without the ""don't touch that"", or ""don't open that door"" moment most or all suspense movies wouldn't have a reason for being, in this case there is no suspense. You KNOW they are going to touch that, open that door, drink that drink and, Oh yes, the alien will pop out. How many ways will it pop out and how many different creatures will it pop out of are the only questions. And once again, I stopped caring after the first one. I am a huge fan of the first ""Alien""! Great plot, fantastic editing, well-developed characters. How can the same name be at the top of the credits on both these movies? Most video games have better development than this horrible excuse for CGI effects. By the way, I really tried to give this movie a chance. Watched it 3 times to try to wring some saving grace out of it but came away as dissatisfied as having eaten a dry out-of-date bodega sandwich. You see, experience is not always a good thing!","2"
"nikdo77","Wow, can't stop thinking about this movie","7 June 2012","Just saw the movie Prometheus and I have to say: I am blown away! Ridley Scot is a very talented man to come up with a total new story. Well here and there you will find some familiarities with the alien concept, like the way how the alien forms impregnates their victims, but overall it's a new concept.

The actors were very well casted. I would have personally casted Charlize Theron as the main character rather than Noomi Rapace. Noomi doesn't come across as strong as Charlize. The robot reminded me off Data from Star Strek, but he showed more human characteristics, like deception, regret, etc.

I loved the special effects in this movie. There's a lot of blowing up going on, so you won't be bored for one bit. On the other hand the music is perfect. It's very unique and shilling at the some time. The 3D is also great.

The movie makes you think about our origins. Questions like Where are we form, who made us, will haunt through your head. The movie tries to explain this, but you will be surprised with the answer.

And for all of you Alien fans out there, well you are in for a treat.

Enjoy the movie!","9"
"Pozzible_Movie_Critic","Like sitting through a boring lecture","11 June 2012","Oh Prometheus, a movie that desperately wants to be something it is not. On the surface you are supposed to get the idea that Prometheus is a deep, philosophical analysis of man's search for meaning by discovering his origins. At its core the movie is a mixed bag of philosophy, monster mania and sci-fi mumbo jumbo. It is just all over the map and it doesn't wrap up anything to any satisfying conclusions. Sure, this was the intention of the movie makers, to leave open doors so people could come together and talk about them till the cows come home. If you want to leave the ultimate questions unanswered, fine, but when you bring up some other plot points and then just leave them hanging it pretty much destroys continuity. Don't get me wrong there are people who enjoy this kind of lazy, attention deficit film making. The ""look we don't know what happened inside that room (and we don't care)"", ""the filmmakers didn't hand us the entire story on the silver platter, (since they lacked imagination to make it interesting), isn't that cool?"" No, it's not! As you can tell it isn't my thing, some people liked that and for some people Prometheus is a masterpiece and anyone who dares to dislike this movie must not be smart. Read the message board for people like that. In the end, you want to make a movie with a message you have to remember to make it entertaining, which this movie lacked.

The movie was supposed to be a prequel to the ""Alien"" series, and then the director changed his mind. This kind of indecisiveness shows because there are times you get the idea we are totally connected and then we are getting the idea that it was something completely different. We start going down one corridor and then you realize as we head down another that we are in a totally different movie, not just a different corridor. There is supposed to be a director's cut already that is 2 hours and 27 minutes but what Prometheus needs is less, not more. It needs to cut out the stories that started and then were just forgotten about, it needs to decide if it wants to be a philosophical mumbo jumbo journey or a monster flick. It just needs better direction.","1"
"mergmapro","How does this get a high rating.","3 October 2012","I love SciFi, but this movie was a letdown and a cop out by Scott. Religious themes, romance and quick solutions after cartoonish action sequences. What a waste of money, and a waste of potential. Not quite as bad as The Day the Earth (as represented by America and a Fast Food Chain) Stood Still, but in the same league of wasted resources. If this cost even 120 Million, they would have been better off giving 1 million to 120 different directors and see what that produced. I appears to be painted with some type of a generic brush, like bad music which uses commonly available and overused samples to create a clone of a mediocre song. If there is a director's cut I'll give it another go, but if it's just the same edit with extra stuff put in for the fans then it will be mostly forgotten like the other trash rehashed by by a large corporation, remembered only as the film done to cash in on the former glory of an innovative movie that was Alien. Like the Alien vs Predator francheese (sic).","1"

A crew of explorers trying to discover the creation of life, travel to this uncertain planet in hoping to make an incredible discover, despite there differences, they should put aside. But will they make the discovery or will it be something else entirely?

The characters have such an awesome interplay, most of them are very well developed. Like Michael Fassbender has David the Android, who really steals most of the movie.

"zetazap8","""The trick...is not minding that it hurts...""","4 April 2015","""The trick,William Potter, is not minding that it hurts."" ~ quote from the movie, ""Lawrence of Arabia.""

This quote is played at the very beginning of the movie, when David the android is watching a TV device which is playing that scene from Lawrence of Arabia.

This movie is so bad, it HURTS to watch it! Apparently, this is Scott's ""sense of humor"" - to warn you ahead of time - and the trick to watching it is to not mind that it's so BAD.

And -what IS it with quotes from LoA, anyway??? As the ship is landing on the planet/moon that they're about to explore, David quotes AGAIN from it - ""There is nothing in the desert, and no man needs nothing"". Huh? Why? What does that have to do with ANYTHING?

What other reviewers have commented on is so spot on - the lack of development of the characters, nonsensical behavior by the characters, unanswered questions that leave you wondering, etc., such that you really don't give a hoot about their fate. There are so many scientific flaws, that it would make for a very long review.

Theron might as well be an android for all the depth of feeling that her character shows - she's not even a good..b-...witch! Ironically, Fassbender as an android exudes more passion and sense of purpose than most of the other characters.

It really is like a clichéd horror genre flick - set in space - you know the type - some rowdy teens stay in a cabin in the woods, and repeatedly Do The Most Stupid Thing...and are bumped off one by one.

And, what DOES the squid/octopus thing have to do with ANYTHING? It apparently is the precursor/Queen to the Alien, but...there are so many ""disconnects"" that it leaves you guessing.

One glaring flaw is when David is back on the ship with one of the cylinders containing the black goop - he unscrews the lid by turning it to the RIGHT. Whatever happened to ""Lefty Loosey, Righty Tighty""? At least in the US, something is unscrewed by turning it to the left.

Why do the ""Engineers"" want to kill humans? You'd think that after all the time and trouble that it has taken us to even get to the Moon, they'd be happy to see humans in 2093 landing on their planet! WTF?!

I watched it because it was on TV, and I was curious about it. Should have saved myself some time, and read some reviews first. This is one of those movies that teases you with a whiff of profundity - mankind has always looked to the stars and contemplated our origins - and then leaves you instead with just cynical existentialism.

Save your time and choose something else to watch.","1"

I recommend this to all sci-fi fans and for those that loved the original movies this is a must see. Overall, an extremely entertaining adventure that is well worth your time. The last scene gave me a chill. I loved it. The only complaint I have is that Charlize Theron's character seemed a little unnecessary.

The storyline itself can stand as a movie alone, but the background of the film is an actual prequel, The storyline is just not about how the human race started but also how the alien race started. Noomi Rapace does an awesome job as Elizabeth, which really remind me of Sigourney Weavers character Ridley, In alien.

Davids character who was played by Michael Fassbender on the other hand, did not do as well as i wanted him to do. His character was not written very well, i think that they may have rushed his character a little bit, his dialogue was bad and Michael Fassbender did not suit the part. His hair style was atrocious, and should just be left blonde or black, do not mix the colors, they do not go together well. Irdis Elba did a suburb Job in the film, and i think he was the best actor in this film besides Noomi Rapace.

The set is very Sci Fi Alien like and someone always has an hidden agenda but in fact nothing happens through out the movie. Most people next to me said at the end of the movie same thing.....and???The actors take their role seriously and give a good show.

A woman scientists fighting a slimy ""Thing"" ...We seen that all many years ago in the Alien sequence, So what new in Prometheus? Nothing. Nada! The only reason to see the movie is to enjoy some nice 3D effects. Yet that's in fact the only reason.

You have to have the scientists that don't want armed protection, you have to have the scientist who is going to risk everyone's life by trying to obtain a specimen, you have the android, you have the company who is willing to let everyone die for their own ends and you have the same type of dark atmosphere inside the alien areas. The movie has nice visuals, but the let-down is the characters. There is very little characterization and you really do not care about the members of the Prometheus. There were a few things, that left out, would have allowed the movie to mature into a nice discovery piece: the scientist given a drink with alien DNA that just happens to change him (where you stomach acids would have killed it), the same scientist just after drinking impregnates his girlfriend (no need to have the Alien growing inside someone again), the android who takes orders that would jeopardize humanity, and the rich individual who puts all the lives at risk for his own immortality.

I have always been a fan of Scott's, beginning with The Duelists. Blade Runner is my all time favourite movie. Gladiator is a masterpiece. Prometheus, though... I'm afraid Ridley Scott has lost his touch. The only credible character is Theron's, all the rest are a bunch of amateurs in this movie. The plot is so shallow, there are many parts that make no sense. How can a human possibly get that kind of abdominal ""self-surgery"" and then immediately stand and walk? The ""engineer"" who is still alive acts as a madman while he is supposed to be a superior being. So, what are all those black fluids in the vases? Some kind of biologic weapon? And the octopus? I mean, why would the ""superior beings"" want to infect humans with octopi when they can do it with a droplet of black fluid? The android is supposed to have ""no soul"" yet it is obviously plotting and being ironic all the time. And the alien at the end, where did that come from? He looks neither like the octopus nor like the aliens in the other movies. When I saw how Prometheus began I expected it to be a great movie; instead, it's a mess.","4"

"rafamg67-1","22 years of delay","30 September 2012","I was waiting long ago to watch this film and here are my impressions. The movie is full with great special effects I find great the atmosphere of the scenes. The technology is also good specially the alien ship and armor. Now the plot....well... since Alien and Blade Runner do not have anything to do with each other, I was expecting something similar with Prometheus. Unfortunately it didn't happen. The plot was very predictable borrowing lots of elements from other movies (including Alien and Blade Runner!). The characters were quite ""typical"" (the very same ones you find in any other 80s Sci-fi movie). If this movie could had come 22 years ago certainly it could have done a landmark...but this is not the case. Watch it and have your own opinion. In my personal view what makes a big difference between good and immortal artworks is, among other things, a plot that goes like roller coaster and you never know what is going to happen in the next minute. Im not really sure if I will be eager to watch the sequel.","3"
"falcata_claymore","Prometheus","8 June 2012","In 1979, Ridley Scott made what is, in my opinion, the greatest horror movie of all time, as well as one of the greatest science fiction movies of all time. But even in the hands of talented directors, the series went downhill after the first two masterful installments; the series never again reached those heights. Now, 33 years after that first classic, Ridley Scott takes back the helm to try to return to the franchise's glory days with Prometheus.

First off, I'm not going to go into detail about the plot, as I don't want to spoil the movie for anyone. The basic skeleton is that two scientists in the tail end of the 21st Century find a series of artifacts suggesting that mankind was visited by a race of people from a very distant star system, and that these people may have been our creators. And then crap gets real.

It's tough for any movie to live up to the hype and expectations heaped on Prometheus's lofty shoulders, and it's difficult to look past this hype and look at it as a standalone film (or as the ending would have you believe, a standalone franchise), which is what Scott clearly wanted it to be. While much of this film's imagery informs what is seen in it, this is not a direct prequel to Alien. This works very much in its favor. It's tough making new scares when the audience knows where everything is going, so making a world where the iconic facehuggers and Xenomorphs are in early, primitive stages alongside very different, more advanced creatures helps keep things interesting. Still, it's impossible to not to compare it to Alien. Don't do this too much; it will make Prometheus seem much more disappointing than it really is. I started off doing this, and it made my opinion of the first twenty minutes or so sink. Once I forgot that, and just sat back to enjoy the ride, I liked the movie. A lot.

There's a lot to recommend Prometheus. Unsurprisingly for a Ridley Scott film, the movie looks fantastic. It's worth shelling over your nine bucks just to marvel at the scenery. It's beautiful, mysterious, unsettling, and terrifying all at once. While Alien was small and claustrophobic, it's clear the Scott made this film to be an epic, and it takes great advantage of that scope. I chose not to watch it in 3D, as I think that 3D is a dumb gimmick made by greedy executives to drive up ticket prices that needs to hurry up and die for a second time. But like all good movies, Prometheus is still great in two dimensions. Good sets and cinematography are still good sets and cinematography regardless of whether they're flying at your face. The acting is very good all across the board, but the show is stolen by Michael Fassbender as the android David 8. He's marvelous, and needs recognition come Oscar night. Seriously; he's that good. Not to anger any Bishop fanboys out there, but he's the best android the franchise has had since Ian Holm. The special effects are also top notch, though there was a bit of an over reliance on CGI. Still, it's some fine CGI.

But it's not perfect. The script sometimes fails Scott and his cast, with pieces of clunky dialogue that didn't need to be there. Some of the characters aren't well defined enough, most notably Charlize Theron, who tries her best despite being given next to nothing to work with. And much as I love Guy Pearce as an actor, they should have actually cast an elderly actor as the ancient CEO of Weyland Enterprises. Pearce, as always, does a fine job, but he's undone by laughable CGI aging. I hate to break it to Hollywood, but special effects aren't that good yet. There other things that let me down or made me scratch my head, but due to spoilers I won't talk about them here.

It's not Alien, which was flawless, nor is it James Cameron's sequel, which was very nearly flawless. Prometheus is far from perfect, but there's still a lot to recommend it. It may not be Alien, but it's still good enough to be worthy of its proximity to it. There's very clear sequel bait at the end, and I eagerly await that next installment, hoping it answers the many questions that Prometheus left. Still, it gives the audience a lot to talk about. Grade: B+","6"
"arty_toaster","For those who have not seen Alien...","9 June 2012","Last minute decision to go to the theatre and the there was a toss up between MIB3 and Prometheus, initially wanting to go for comedy as sci- fi has been increasingly disappointing over the past year,(yes I realist MIB3 is also sci-fi ;)I was slightly peeved when it wasn't showing and the only option was Prom.

Emotions experienced: Laughter, crying, high levels of anxiety, fear and euphoria.

The story-line had some questionable parts but if you're willing to close that part of your brain and actually experience the film you will be freaking overjoyed.

LOVED it all, Noomi Rapace (Dr Shaw) and Michael Fassbender (David) were incredible.

If I were to compare it to a film I would say I Am Legend, in terms of plot and character development.

I believe it is the character development which was so right throughout the film, and made it all the more amazing.

Cannot wait for the sequel. P.S. for those claiming to be crushed with disappointment at the film because it was so highly anticipated, I may check it out now since it must be 10000/10.","10"
"druspatau","visually strong but unengaging","6 June 2012","i was really looking forward to prometheus. I'm sad to say i was disappointed. The film looked great. Visually very strong. I'm not sure the 3d added anything to the overall look of the film but when does it ever? My main problem was the incoherent plot and the lack of any decent characters bar Fassbenders sublime android impression. Without giving anything away the film left me cold. I consider myself a fairly intelligent adult and most of the film i was scratching my head. Michael Fassbender was great. The rest of the cast less so. Charlize Theron was OK. But with Theron you expect more than OK. As for the heroine Rapace seemed to vulnerable to suddenly become all gung ho and attempt to save the human race almost single handedly. Am going to watch it again to give it another chance but i fear my first impressions will be confirmed","6"
"neverteller33","All in all, just a movie","14 October 2012","What I believe to be the quintessential charm of the Alien series is the way it actually portrays human nature without seeming to do so. Yes, these were simply revolutionary monster films. But behind the whole horror theme, unanswerable, yet elegant questions are raised, without ever having to be uttered by any character. We simply take note of the situations and automatically ask ourselves: What if there really are aliens, but they're not the advanced demigods we hope they are? or Is humanity really that disgusting? and much more. These are philosophically valid questions that emerge subtly from what we see on the screen.

""The keen fan will recognize strands of Alien's DNA"". I personally thought that what Scott meant was exactly this feeling that I got from watching Alien: that unexpected ideas pop-up without someone putting them into words. It was not the case. All the questions are diligently posed in Prometheus. They are all answerable questions, so they don't frighten the viewer as much. Yet, the answers are not delivered. That is why, from a philosophical and mythological point of view, all this seems superficial, it feels as if someone is trying to trick me into thinking that the film is highly intelligent, when actually it just inherently begs for a sequel.

Disappointing as it is in this department, Prometheus is still a thrilling visual experience.

All in all, just a movie.","6"
"immanion","Prometheuszzzzzzzz","4 June 2012","Tragically, it seems to have more in common with Event Horizon than Alien. It has a plot so thin 80's Doctor Who would have thought twice about putting it out and a script so clunky and with such lumpen dialogue, I wonder whether the writers have actually finished high school. They certainly rely way too much on Chekov's Gun.

I had avoided all press and trailers so went in very no preconceptions and expecting nothing. Sadly, that's what I got. In abundance.

However, pretty it looked, and there were some aesthetically beautiful moments, it was vacuous nonsense. I mean, however stupid Alien:Resurrection was - and it really was - it was at least well paced and fun. This plods and offers nothing that we haven't seen in countless other lower budget movies - the aforementioned Event Horizon, The Thing, etc., and rather than creating a shocking moment of body horror, as John Hurt managed in the original, it tried too hard to create unease by many moments of half-arsed body horror, instead. It failed, with only one genuine moment of squirm that was casually tossed away a few minutes later.

Whereas there's an argument for Alien being a metaphor for male fear of penetration, pregnancy and birth, with Gigers design for the eggs and face huggers being disturbingly anatomical, transplanting that fear to a sterile female character simply seems crass. And most of the aliens, rather than looking like walking vaginas, this time are extremely phallic and exhibit violent acts of penetration. It's not subtle.

Having four writers was not a good thing when they all seem to be pulling in different directions. The Von Daniken angle being the most gobsmackingly awful. This, I think, is the crux. The plot, such as it was (land a ship, run up and down some corridors, get killed) had no real focus, it simply didn't know what it wanted to do or say. Nothing was explored to any kind of satisfactory conclusion and rather than be excited by the potential for an well signalled sequel, I just thought 'Who cares?""

Fassbender was probably the one redeeming feature, and how ironic that the one character that was meant to be cold, distant and aloof was also the most human. Marshall-Green could have been great had he not been despatched so early and Idris Elba was savagely underused. The problem is that everything was a plot device. Every character or piece of machinery that was introduced had one plot device/use. Ooh look, she lives in the life boat; golly it's an automated surgical unit; lawks a lummee, there's only one person who could do *that* sort of manoeuvre, I mean he's bloody told he can often enough..... GAH!

The addition of the 'finding god' plot was, again, lumpen and felt tacked on in order to give it some perceived gravitas and an attempt to TACKLE IMPORTANT ISSUES. All it did was make you want to punch the female lead. And giving someone Daddy Issues doesn't make them interesting, especially when you have such a lacklustre cast who simply can't pull it off.

Somehow, this movie, despite looking rather lovely, manages to diminish the entire franchise and make a nonsense of the established chronology/mythology. It makes you yearn for the original while it so thoughtfully pokes you in the ribs going ""eh, eh..this bit's in Alien you know"" Yeah, but its *better* in Alien; all it achieves is to point out and accentuate it's own inadequacies.

And don't get me started on the sub-Star Trek soundtrack.

Disappointing and genuinely awful.","2"
"drystyx","Stage play style with too many effects","12 September 2014","This is a mixed bag. It's obviously the events that precede the ALIEN movie, with loose ends purposely implanted to show that there is more before and after.

The acting and the characters are the strong point. Most of the characters are fairly likable and identifiable. This looks like pure stage drama in the script, which is good.

However, the weaknesses really weaken the movie. The first and chief weakness is the kowtowing to the geeks with too many stupid special effects that just clutter up the story, and look like they're there just so Beavis and Butthead can guffaw at the gore and the many excessive actions full of sound and fury, signifying nothing.

An apt quote, as there is a bit of King Lear in the drama. Not much, but a bit.

This is a common weakness of modern movies. This movie also contains the second most common weakness of modern movies. You really need closed captioning, because you can't understand what the actors are saying most of the time. It's mostly poor enunciation from modern actors. That said, the actors did a decent job of emoting.

It's watchable, and has a few good moments, and has a decent theatrical air. It's too bad it's cluttered up by poor modern film making.","7"
"xtian_durden","Not quite what I was expecting from a great director.","8 June 2012","The opening scene promises another visual greatness from the director that brought us ""Blade Runner"" and ""Alien,"" and yes it never failed in that area. After three decades, Ridley Scott's Prometheus served as a prequel to his classic ""Alien"" film.

It is filled with colorful stars including Noomi Rapace, whose talents were discovered by way of her role as Lisbeth Salander in the Millennium Trilogy. Here she is the equivalent of Ellen Ripley in the Alien Franchise, but maybe it's not right to compare them. She is joined by a robot just like Hal 9000, but you can say that he is ""more human than human,"" he is played brilliantly by Michael Fassbender in yet another unique role. The other cast includes Idris Elba, the captain of the Prometheus, that's the name of their spacecraft and obviously the title of the film, Charlize Theron in her villain-like role, she is employed by her father to monitor and to control the situation at every move, her father played by Guy Pearce in make-up, is the elderly founder of the corporation that funds the spacecraft and the one who sent them off to mission, to find the mysterious origin of humanity. The plot is pretty disappointing when you've arrived at the revelations.

The other characters played an inevitable role that requires them to be the casualty in a kind of film that needed a body count to develop the uprising of terror and deliver us to its climax. The story seems forced, and at times confusing. The script is poorly written, giving characters dry exchanges in their dialogue. Aside from Shaw (Rapace) and David (Fassbender), the other characters are just member of the crew waiting to be killed, and they act like one, and I didn't like it because it's predictable.

Prometheus didn't answer the questions it dared ask, but adds more questions, Ridley Scott at 74 is still searching for the answers in the world he created, or maybe he had found the answers but is expanding his thoughts before revealing it to us, I admire his brave mind, but maybe it's time to move on to a new idea. We expect in this prequel that our question may be finally answered, but we were wrong, some of it were answered, like what made the Alien exist, but generally I didn't like the answer, the story wasn't impressive for me, and I just think that it's better if it was left unanswered. The problems in the story development and the script prevented Ridley to give us a great sci-fi, though there are few scenes that caught my eye, including the scene where Shaw took out her baby alien. It's a fair sci-fi film, but it's disappointing coming from a great director, I expected so much more.","8"

"vailsy","better enjoyed if not viewed as a direct prequel to Alien","25 June 2012","Prometheus is not an Alien prequel and so does not explain everything in Alien, although it does reveal the larger back story to it

The most important difference is that Prometheus takes place on LV223, not LV426 of Alien/s (apparently these are in the same star system but orbit different suns) and so in Prometheus we are not seeing the craft filled with eggs and pilot from Alien, which confused me somewhat on first viewing. What happens is this..

At the start we see our creators spreading their genetic code, via the ingestion of a mysterious compound, to earth-like planets in the long distant past (This would have benefited from a longer sequence showing the humanoid actually being dropped off)

Fast forward to 2089 and archaeologists, including Shaw (Noomi Rapace) and her profoundly annoying boyfriend find cave drawings in Scotland showing a star system that we believe to be our origin planet (it appears our creators visited us again at some point, giving this info to multiple civilisations on earth). We jump, rather quickly, from the Isle of Skye to a huge space craft named Prometheus heading to this apparent origin planet with our archaeologists on board

They arrive and find pyramid-like structures with craft and dead pilots inside like those in Alien. But instead of eggs there are vials of goo (the primordial goo that presumably came before, or maybe after, the egg? and is probably the same thing the gene spreader ingested at the start of the film, or some more sinister derivative designed to do harm). These pilot humanoids, for reasons yet unknown, are about to undo the gene spreading activities that gave birth to mankind, probably this is because we did not turn out as intended (see next movie). Before they could blast off though something went wrong.. the primordial goo somehow escaped and wiped them out

etc..

With science fiction while the larger story can be quite fantastical it needs to be held together by believable character actions, and this is the glue that holds it together. In the case of Alien the glue was super glue, but in the case of Prometheus it is more like pritt stick

Silly things happen and their scientific expedition is like a badly supervised school trip

Eg., immediately after arriving at their destination about half the crew take a trip to one of the structures without analysing the atmosphere in detail like they do in Alien. Once they realise the air inside is breathable off come the helmets with no regard for safety against contaminants in the air? This disregard towards safety continues as they touch the black goo with their fingers, perform uncontained ancient head autopsies, sleep with goo, play with snake like creatures which clearly look dangerous and ready to bite, open doors to let contaminated zombie people in exorcist style spider positions back onto the ship etc (again completely unrealistic next to Alien where Ripley was not going to allow Brett back onto the ship at all). Also not one, but three people decide to perform a kamikaze manoeuvre on the say so of Shaw

there are good performances in the movie especially Fassbender and Rapace. some really nice visual effects and sound, especially the Prometheus movement and landing. The main score theme is ill fitting though and sounds like something out of Brokeback Mountain

there are some ridiculous scenes though like those described.. in Alien we can forgive the Nostromo crew being a bit stupid because they are a mining vessel sidetracked to deal with something they are not trained for, but here we have scientists playing with alien snakes and removing their helmets just because the air is breathable

overall though I enjoyed Prometheus, the plot is difficult to understand and I am sure the average non Alien fan would not have had a clue what was going on but I'm sure it will all be tied up in the sequel","8"
"AMar_rom","Could have been better","10 June 2012","I am disappointed on this one, although this is not a bad film.It is nice visually with an interesting plot to start with but the execution did not deliver. Perhaps the main problem of the film's director and producers was that they did not decide if they wanted a sci-fi film or a space-horror film. The movie tried to balance in between and simply it was not convincing in either front.

As it stands 'Prometheus' lacks the depiction of humanity's progression into the future (with its implications) that e.g. 'Gattaca' delivers us and also lacks the raw terror present in every scene in 'Alien' and 'Aliens'.

I only recommend this movie if you are a fan of Sci-fi and horror movies but do not set your expectations too high.",NA
"chris-williams-113-468296","One of the biggest disappointments ever","10 October 2014","I came to this film with the opinion that Alien and Blade Runner are two of the greatest Science Fiction films ever made.

What I'd really hoped for was that Scott could make this a hat trick. But I had heard bad things and if I'm honest I don't think the director has made a great film in a very long time. I'd waited a little while before seeing this and with the caveats already mentioned, I had tempered my expectations so that even something mediocre would have been enough to satisfy on some level.

What was actually delivered needed to be really poor to fall below expectation, but it managed to deliver in that respect. Let's get the positives out of the way - this is a visually stunning flick and the one thing that's never dipped in Scott's work is stunning cinematography - and that's coupled with great special effects (although of course this is not so unusual nor so original as in his earlier brace of pictures). The cast also - particularly given the material they have to work with - act with conviction and give competent performances given the limitations of the script.

And there's the rub: It looks like there's been some sort of grand committee discussion over what a prequel might be and what special effects might be employed to generate some of the shock value of the original film - as well as generating new ways to die at the hands or claws, or blood, or whatever, of our not so favourite xenomorphs.

Unfortunately it looks like they were loath to throw any of these tricks and surprises away in the service of a cohesive and consistent story.

This is a trait which afflicts the entire film, but to give one instance of dramatic implausibility - SPOILER ALERT - the pair who turn tail and run away from the main party on the strength of no more than feeling uneasy in the alien labyrinthine structure, then stop to interact with the 'cute' weird looking alien snake-like things. These are not apparently the same as immature gut-bursting aliens, nor the face huggers, but something inexplicably (literally) different. The result of this is however all too predictable.

In fact the only unpredictability the film has is its cavalier disregard of any sort of consistency with the biological patterns of the alien species well established by the original and its spin-off franchise. Much as I thought the many sequels lacked the atmosphere as well as the originality of the original in the sequence they did (mostly) succeed as strap yourself in actioners.

Prometheus serves us up with a breakfast to the lunch of Alien that would churn the stomach of even the most iron-constitutioned canine.

I hear a second helping is on the way - perhaps they'll just call that one Emetic.","2"
"jeremyvandress","Abort Mission","8 June 2012","Here's a quick synopsis of the Prometheus I was hoping for: Archaelogists in New Zealand discover an ancient artifact which turns out to be a compass that constantly points to its place of origin. Holloway and Shaw discover that it denotes the 4 quadrants of the universe. Meanwhile, mankind on Earth has endured increasingly large environmental struggles (lower atmospheric oxygen, higher temperatures resulting in contaminated water, increased famine, disease and war). Searching for answers, a crew is assembled aboard the USS Prometheus. En route to LV-233 they are ambushed by a force field that pulls the Prometheus into a deep cavern on the planet. David, the android is able to note that the force field is a safeguard for entry because of a strong asteroid belt and hostile ground conditions (low visibility, toxic air). He also claims that whatever is taking place inside the planet must be a large secret given the inhospitable surface conditions. The crew is able to determine that conditions inside the cavern are livable. Chance and Ravel, ship pilots, venture out and discover water and a large chamber with a weapon/telescopic device attached to a chair (the Space Jockey's chair). Coached by David, they uncover wall scroll hieroglyphics depicting strange creatures, battles as well as maps of the stars. Ravel accidentally activates the chair which lights up a digital display in the orbital chamber and shows that Earth is in crisis and is nearing extinction in its future. The activation by someone other than the Space Jockey causes the doors to close and a hallucinogenic gas to be emitted. The floor drops out and the two are ravaged by squid-like Aliens. Vickers then tries to run an evacuation but the ship is grounded due to the gravitational field. The rest of the crew now are trying to find a way off the planet. David discovers that the Space Jockey's (which aren't human) have abandoned the Planet and had primarily used it for weapons testing, since they have been in a battle with another alien race. Fear of the Space Jockey's return sparks the crew to begin to send out distress signals which are intercepted by an undisclosed alien race. Janek and David notice the compass begin to move erratically as from out of nowhere an advanced technology floating metal sphere bursts through the corridor of the Prometheus. Weyland, the billionaire behind the operation, grasps the compass fearing impending attack. The sphere unfolds into a screen of images and alien code. The android is able to decipher that the race plans to rescue the crew in exchange for the weapons technology on LV-233 and compass. It also is disclosed that the Space Jockey's have been testing their weapons on the Earth's atmosphere given the similarity in climate between humans and the Space Jockey's enemies. As the deal is being made, the Prometheus suddenly is lifted up by a force and out of the cavern. The Space Jockey ship (from Alien, Aliens) is landing. The Space Jockey takes Vickers hostage and unleashes a menacing Giger Alien on her in an epic terrifying scene. She is trapped in an alien web with a face-hugger attached to her face. As the battle between Space Jockey and the crew ensues, other alien ships arrive and decimate the space jockey ships. They eliminate the Giger aliens. (The Giger aliens have been trained by the Jockies to attack humans in return for alone time with the Alien Queen). The rescue alien's mother-ship opens and it is shown that the rescue species is Predator. Predator, in return for the crew helping them locate the Jockies weapons technology, they free the Prometheus from the gravitational forcefield. However, Weyland wants to keep the compass to show his colleagues his ultimate accomplishment and mastery of the universe. Predator spears Weyland to death. Predator then shows the crew that Earth's hostile and hot environment is attracting their race to want to eliminate Earth. Avoiding this, Shaw gives Predator the compass. Predator uses the space jockey seat to enclose the earth's atmosphere and return it to hospitable conditions. The end.","1"
"manendra-lodhi","Leave aside the disappointed ending.","24 September 2012","The film starts with a very promising plot which is sure to engage you. The performances are very good. Add to this, the beautiful cinematography and you will end up liking the film though it has a disappointing ending. The story is about finding the makers of human being. The idea itself is very appealing and it was handled nicely. The film is worth watching once.

PROS:

The starting few scenes were extremely fascinating and gave a good start to the film. Than the performances by the actors was also good. The story was mediocre but the idea and till middle it was amazing. The CGI was satisfactory. Good thing was that there was no foolishness shown on the part of people who are trapped in a situation like this.

CONS:

The only bad thing about the film was the disappointed ending. When you build up so much enthusiasm about the subject and in the end disappoint them with no answers than the audience is definitely going to feel bad. Looking forward to see all these answers in the possible sequel.

"diki24","Not good enough","10 June 2012","This film is beautifully shot and 3D is brilliant. Movie starts with the sprinkling of lot of characters into the mix giving you a hope of very interesting dynamics to come. Movie does a good job for the first hour where the build up is pretty good. however it just stops there. Most characters are left under-developed in the favor of concentrating more on the central subject of the film ie. ""Who are we and who created us"". But as the result it creates a hollow plot, where you don't feel for characters and the fundamental question starts to look unimportant. Frankly actors like Idris Alba and Charlize Theron are wasted. Even in the final moments, where characters are required to make the fundamental decisions, it fails to stir the right emotions in us. Leaving us with a feeling of sort of anti-climax and unfulfilled expectations. Most of the questions raised in the beginning are left unanswered, clearly suggesting that this will be a beginning of many more follow up films. I think that setting is large and premise if superb and that forthcoming films do a better job that this one. Prequels are harder because you have to build up a story which holds good in itself but also logically adds up, leading to the ending which is already a part of the film made earlier. Having said that i want to give an example of ""Rise of Planet of Apes"", which does such a great job of making not only an interesting film but also a perfect Prequel.

"libo_kicks_ass","skip to the last 20 seconds before the credits and you've learned the only thing that matters in this film","7 June 2012","I will mention when a spoiler is about to appear. Otherwise i will be loosely talking about moments within the film.

The start i very much enjoyed, it set the scene beautifully, there was that feeling the original alien films gave you, like the calm before the alien infested storm. You just kept waiting till they over turned that stone....then....the film kept going.....kept going.....then you realized that moment you crave in an aliens film will never come...Why? Because this is a prequel...

...and because this film took no time to let you know what was actually going on.

The ""very very ending"" is interesting. But to me thats all it was...interesting, not OMG THATS SO EXCITING!!! More like, hmmm, they put that in like it was supposed to make me jump in excitement and then run of to my pc and print fanboy scripts about that precise moments awesomeness. But no. The moment is essentially what the whole film is about...the problem : they left the whole film so vague and lacking in information that they could have had anything happen, absolutely anything, and it would have fitted in. The ending could have come about from at least 5 or 6 different reasons...there's just that many things they ""create"" in this film but don't follow on or expand upon that I wouldn't have been surprised if Ripley jumped out of a cryo tube at some point. ""You just gotta believe!"" echoes in my mind.

This to me is not good storytelling or directing, sure i want my scary films to be vague at first and to leave some work up to me . This adds to the fear factor, but this film never pinpoints what the actual threat is. You just keep floating from one threat to another, never really getting any face time with that specific threat to understand them or care that they existed in the first place. To top it of the only entertaining deaths in my mind were the first 2, the rest were essentially deaths from fighting rather than surprise.

By the end i felt like id watched the set up to several different movie starts with no satisfying conclusion on any, most things just got left where they were, no information being added. That would be after the 1 dramatic scene it will have had in the film before it moved on.

Here's the bit where i am gonna give away one thing, but its because I want to flame about this that i bring it up.

WIthin about 10 minutes, every person dies ""pretty much"", except for the hero. From the trailers you will already know there's a ship crash and explosion, that takes out 50% of the people left at this point (incredibly NOT exciting scene because it is just so sudden and rushed). The rest die in horrifically unenlightening ways like being crushed or hit over the head really hard. Now your probably thinking why is this a problem? Well its a problem because I just watched 1-2 hours of character building just to watch everyone die. THERE WAS NO RELEVANCE TO ANY OF THE CONVERSATIONS BETWEEN PEOPLE!!!!! There was no hidden message. There was no clarification on how the threats in the film really BECAME a threat. To top it off the hero flies of into the sunset in a ship that was made to crash just minutes ago, with a pointless speech about finding the truth. WHERES MY TRUTH!!!???

I literally just watched a 2 hour film for the last 20 seconds and some CGI. Thats why some people are so upset. Because they expected so much more from something like a prequel to alien. I was one of them...

SPOILER ALERT also, the black eyed alien was doing everything in its power to get out of there with his ship, he crashed it because prometheus crashed into him, so if his ship was in a good enough condition to fly : why did he get off the ship when the only threat had just blown itself up? He could easily have just flown away anyway and done what he intended. Its this kind of unexplained change in behaviour that aggravates me in films because it undermines everything i just watched.

It is simply unrealistic within the world they created and if i don't believe this sci-fi world is real then whats the point in getting emotionally invested in the film when they could just undo anything they've laid down as fact when it suits them. For example, how would you feel if one time somebody got attacked by an alien but it didn't bleed acid - simply because that character had to live to make the film work. you'd be angry. The same can be said for this moment i am talking about and a few others like it.

There's even all this talk about alien races creating and trying to kill humanity, but we got no answers to any of that, we just get to find out thats what they wanted to do. It's a pointless drop because nobody cares IF the answers not going to be coming in this movie. Its not like I'm looking to Prometheus to answer some unending question about god thats stuck in my mind.

but just have a look at some of the other reviews, the amount of plot holes is endless.","4"
"bowmanblue","90% brilliant - 10% let down","25 January 2015","Prometheus is breath-taking - its visuals are a treat and its direction is flawless (but then it's directed by Sir Ridley, so you should expect that).

It's about a team of astronauts that find evidence that a race of aliens have visited Earth thousands of years before mankind and left a map with which humans can follow them.

But, let's face it, no one cares about that.

What people want to know is 'Is it, or is it not a prequel to Alien?' The answer, is ambiguous at best.

Yes, it's obviously set in the same universe and it's a great film (like I say 90% brilliant). However, the let down occurs when you start applying it to Alien (and its successors). Those wanting a film that 'leads in' to Alien will be disappointed. Prometheus appears to want to be a film that starts its own franchise. Therefore, any direct link to Alien is still several films away.

Also, there are some very annoying questions that never get resolved in Prometheus. Now, I'm not going to describe them as 'plot holes' because, there are probably going to be sequels which will explain them. However, if no sequels arrive, or they just gloss over the questions Prometheus raises, then these oddities will be regarded as some major goofs.

Overall, Prometheus is great. My advice - ignore everything 'Alien-related' (for now) and enjoy it for what it is. Also, be prepared to be left with unanswered questions. If you can live with that, you should find it excellent.","7"
"djjimmisgr","Great Prequel!","21 December 2021","The movie gave new horizons to the whole alien saga giving background story for the origin of alien and humans. I didn't expect something like that to happen with this movie and it did it great being interesting the whole time. You will want to watch all the next movies afterwards again I am sure.","8"
"robsta23","Haven't Seen the Alien Movies, Still Know This Doesn't Live Up to Them","21 March 2015","This movie is filled with characters I don't really care for - besides David, who is a twisted cyborg - who come up with conclusions with little evidence. For example, after the opening of the film Noomi Rapace looks at cave drawings of a man and what appear to be UFO's, to which she just assumes ""I think they want us to come find them.""

Thus begins a journey for her and a full crew to ""meet their makers."" This corresponds with the opening of the film where what looks like a gray-skinned super human who drinks something which causes him to disintegrate, and once his matter is in the water it reforms into DNA, which is when we see the title ""Prometheus.""

Unnecessary aspects of this movie: Guy Pearce did not have to play an old man in crappy makeup - they could have just hired an older actor. There is dispute whether or not Charlize Theron's character is a robot, which she clearly isn't. Also, she's pretty much in the movie to be a b**** and to show her stupidity in not knowing how to run adjacent to a giant ship about to crush her instead of in a straight line which the circular ship follows.

So at one point they end up ""meeting their makers"" as they believe them to be, but what pisses me off is that the ""engineer"" simply rips David's head off of his body and attacks the others. Noomi Rapace wants to know why their makers hate them, and so do I, but if they are displeased, why follow their path into a sequel? Wouldn't they just want to kill humans like the one in this movie clearly did?

I can see why they avoided saying this was a prequel to Alien - it hardly deals with things I assume to come from those movies, but addresses it right before the credits. This could have been better if they decided to make a standalone film not connected to Alien AT ALL. There are actually plenty of ways this film could have been better.","3"
"richard-norburn","Great expectations, so little delivery !","11 June 2012","This is like one of those meals with all the best ingredients, but simply didn't turn out how it it should have. Oscar winners that barely have bit part line delivery. It was the most beautiful imagery setting ever. Charlilize Theron in spandex. too ! Really super women who after major surgery can run, jump ab sale, etc. Honestly, they forgot to pay the screen writers! Then to say the least they put in met Throw in Calamari on steroids and, I was disappointed. There's so many places that much budget and great actors could go ! Ridley did it right the first time, Cameron stood on his shoulders the second. This one - Oh dear.","6"
"botond-adam","God hates us all!","7 June 2012","God hates us all- this could be a much more appropriate title for this movie. If Mr. Scott could be so provocative with his over-hyped MEDIOCRE popcorn flick, let me be provocative at some degree as well: This movie is on the same level as AVP movies, except Prometheus has superior visuals.

There is no story telling, no character developing, no motivation for characters, no explanations, whatsoever. One liners like ""How this happened?"" or ""Why is this happening"" are the most common phrases in the movie and they will never be answered. You may think Ridley want us to figure out by our own, but he is not, THERE IS NOTHING TO FIGOURE OUT. He simply just put together a incoherent mess. The background is practically same as AVP1, which I'm sure Scott never watched. Ancient civilisations that have no connection, yet share the same symbols. Same like AVP. Just like the stupid characters, meaningless rushed carnage in the second half of the movie, etc.

The scientific ""stuff"" Ridley involved is just ridiculous for anybody over age 10. Same is true for the religion parts.

If you have seen Alien and Blade Runner this movie can show nothing new to you. Those two are far more superior, top-notched movies compared with popcorn flick Prometheus.

I watched it at the Premier with 5 of my friends. We all were growing up on Ridley's movies and Prometheus was a major disappointment for all of us. Considering that when the end credits appeared no single clap was heard, I thing we weren't the only ones.","5"
"luke_menges","Good for sci-fi fanatics, bad for anyone else.","16 June 2012","Let me first say that this film is perfect for all of you millions of sci-fi freaks; the special effects were right on and the creepy-crawly slimy alien scenes were just as intense as they should be. But if you are looking for ANY degree of believability in this film, you are looking in the wrong place.

I realize that this is a film with aliens bursting out of people's bodies on a regular basis and that you shouldn't take a lot of things seriously; but there were so many ""why would you DO THAT???"" moments that it pretty much ruined the movie for me.

It is said somewhere in the film that a trillion dollars was spent on the mission; they must have made severe budget cuts when it came to the quality of the crew because these people are about the dumbest group of individuals you can put on a ship.

For example, the way they handle themselves after returning from exploring a foreign planet for all of a couple hours...would they really be thinking about sex in that situation? Would they really get a full nights' sleep after finding hints of life?

Another thing that ruined it for me was Theron's role: you never exactly find out what she's doing on the ship. There's a pilot of the ship that acts as captain, and everyone else is either an engineer or geologist. I guess she's supposed to be the ""leader"" of the crew; but then why would the leader refuse to even set foot on the planet or go with everyone when they explore? Why would she just sit on the ship all day and cause trouble?

I can go on and on with this thing and bore you to death but I'll just leave it at that. Once again, if you love sci-fi movies and/or you keep up with the ""Alien"" series, go see it. You'll like it, and I'm not putting you down for it. The special effects are amazing. This film just wasn't believable enough for me.","4"
"zerph3","Loved it!","15 August 2012","Saw this film in IMAX 3D and it was just amazing! Out of all the film I love this one is very high up on the list, I haven't even seen Alien or any of the other Alien films but I understood all of it, found it very enjoyable to watch and thought the plot to it was very good, hopefully the sequel to this 'Paradise' will be even better and I have no doubts on that because if they make this film because they want to surprise us the fans and not just make some money then it should be very good, I also thought the actors in this were good but my favourite guy in this is definitely David, his character played by Michael Fassbender was very entertaining and they choose the right actor for it too, the way he was so calm with everything he actually made me think he was a android. Anyway, definitely worth a watch, not sure if it's not in cinema's anymore but if not pre- order it and if you can, pre-order it in blu-ray! Worth it.","10"
"DubhDoo","An impressive return to sci-fi for Mr. Scott","16 June 2012","I went into 'Prometheus' having seen 'Alien' twice and half of 'Aliens'. I had seen many of Scott's other films, and was eager to see how his return to the genre he shook up 33 years ago. The opening sequence is truly marvelous and grandiose, in contrast to 'Alien'. It must be noted that while Prometheus is set in the 'Alien' universe, it is an entirely different beast. 'Alien' was all about claustrophobia, verging on horror, whereas 'Prometheus' is a bigger film, with characters (sometimes overly, to clunky effect) discussing the bigger picture. 'Alien' had a subtle, minimal score, whereas this film presents us with a full-blown orchestra. Yet, despite the contrasts, I thoroughly enjoyed it.

Much of that was down to the performances of Noomi Rapace and Michael Fassbender. My first time to see Rapace, (watching the Millennium Trilogy this weekend), I was highly impressed; Fassbender ,naturally, was brilliant as David. A subtle, near flawless performance, which deserves all the praise it's getting.

It is grisly and graphic, probably more than so than 'Alien', however in my opinion this manages to benefit the film, provoking a visceral reaction. Yes, there are questions left dangling, but isn't it better that a film leaves us pondering instead of spoon-feeding us the answers? One minor gripe I had with it was why Guy Pierce (in my opinion, a criminally underrated actor) played Peter Weyland, who had little screen-time. I imagine they could have got an actually elderly actor. But that can be ignored, as the film was great. I understand why many were disappointed, but thought it was excellent.

It is serious sci-fi, in my opinion, the best type of sci-fi. I would prefer 'Prometheus' or 'Alien' over 'Star Wars' any day. All in all, this is a very enjoyable film and a very assured return to form for Ridley Scott which just about lives up to the hype.","5"
"GoreWhoreAust","Now that the storm has past, enjoy Prometheus for the amazing film that it is.","17 June 2013","I'm writing this a year after the theatrical release of Prometheus, a film that was preceded by, and ultimately fell victim to, a manic level of hype and expectation. A prequel, or as it turned out, not-so-distant-cousin to Ridley Scott's landmark sci-fi horror masterpiece ALIEN, Prometheus was an audacious endeavor from the get-go. Bestowed with the impossible task of living up to its for-bearer who over more than 30 years spawned three official sequels, two bastard spin offs (those AVP abortions) near countless comic book iterations, and influenced filmmakers, designers and pop culture in general. Prometheus also saw the return of Scott to the genre he helped define in cinematic terms so how could it ever completely satisfy such a sprawling legacy? Scott and 20th Century Fox did successfully maintained a high level of secrecy throughout production with Scott cleverly saying on numerous occasions that his new film stemmed from the 'DNA of Alien'. At the time we had no idea what he meant. After a long period of silence an aggressive marketing campaign kicked in. The posters and trailers were fantastic and awe inspiring, spawning endless viral videos and images online all the while maintaining the mystery. Was Prometheus actually an Alien prequel after all? How did all these pieces fit together with the aforementioned 30 year legacy? A year on from the release of Prometheus some are still asking these and countless other questions. What seemingly all could agree on was that visually, Scott had again crafted a film of sweeping majesty. From the opening frame Prometheus is splendor to behold. Unanimous praise was also given to Michael Fassbender for his portrayal of the android David. Where the film found its greatest criticism was in the script. Many legitimate film reviewers and thousands of online postings decried a myriad of so-called 'plot holes', unresolved ideas and just plain stupidity in the behavior of characters. The finger became squarely pointed at Damon Lindelof who had already upset fan boys with his writing of the conclusion to the TV series LOST. The online crucifixion of Lindelof was brutal and completely unfair. Lindelof was one of only two writers on the project, very little for a studio film when many summer blockbusters have upwards of ten writers and they're just the ones who actually get credited. The one constant and the man literally steering the (space) ship was Ridley Scott. If anyone should have been in the firing line it should have been him but for whatever reason the director was given a pass and Lindelof became the scapegoat for everyone's apparent disappointment in the film. I, like many, was so excited in the lead up to Prometheus to finally have a new entry in the world of ALIEN. I liked the film immediately but agreed with some of the criticism. There were certainly parts of the film I didn't understand and a few character motivations seemed very odd. What I really liked however was the film's ominous sense of dread and by its end, a sense of almost complete futility. I could see that this was an unusual and bold 'Hollywood' movie. Despite the negativity that surrounded the film, it created such intense debate online the likes of which I hadn't really ever seen. I don't think anyone has ever debated the meaning of a Transformers or Fast And Furious film but with Prometheus the criticizing and theorizing went on for months. I saw the film a second time in cinemas and got a lot more out of it, subtitle hints and lines of dialog I had missed the first time brought more sense to the film and its characters. I wouldn't say I found any 'answers' upon second viewing but I wasn't really looking for any. In fact I enjoyed and respected the film's ambiguity even more. As a reaction to what many claimed was a film full of frustratingly unanswered questions, Fox's marketing campaign around the Prometheus DVD / Blu-ray release promised that 'Questions would be answered'. The truth was both yes and no. In my opinion, Scott's only crime with Prometheus was his appeasing of the studio and modern movie audiences by cutting down the film to the 2 hour make and increasing the pace by omitting a host of integral scenes. Considering how bold Scott's choices were in other areas concerning Prometheus it's a shame he caved in on duration and pacing. Never have I seen a collection of deleted and alternate scenes that were SO integral to the overall film. Every questionable character motivation in Prometheus is put the rest in these AMAZING deleted scenes. We get a far greater understanding of Charlize Theron's Vickers and Idris Elba's Captain Janek. We get a massively better understanding of the motivations of Guy Pearce's Peter Weyland. And most importantly, the scene that bugged me the most where Fifield and Millburn behave so strangely toward an obviously dangerous snake alien now made sense due to a preceding delete scene. With these delete scenes in mind I watched the entire film again for a third time and completely fell in love with it. This wasn't because the 'big questions' had been answered, quite the opposite, I actually had even more questions because now I felt I really understood the characters and could see the film operating on an entirely new level. I'm looking forward to a Prometheus sequel, whenever that may come, not for answers but for more questions. The most enjoyable and addictive part of the journey so far in the world of Prometheus is examining the questions it has thrown up, looking for signs and clues as to what it may mean and coming to your own conclusions whether they be the filmmakers intention or not. Sadly too few films elicit such a long lasting debate as to its meaning and merit, forgotten as the house light rise and we return to mundane normality.","9"
"justin-fencsak","Alien Covenant is better than this movie...","22 May 2017","Nearly 5 years ago, Ridley Scott returned to the world that he created with Prometheus, a movie that looks great in 3d but suffers from slow moving scenes and less horror. The casting is pretty good not to mention the VFX, the score, and the suspense.

The Story was very well told and the imagery was jaw dropping. Some of the best special effects I've seen. It really keeps you on the edge of your seat because this is the kind of movie that you just don't know what's going to happen next. A couple of things though, I just don't see us being that scientifically advanced in the year 2093. I know it's only 2016...and that's 77 years away, but...nope. Not going to happen. Another thing I rarely see in sci-fi movies is religion. It's in this movie...won't say how. I'm not a spoiler...but yeah. It is. Scientists believe in the big bang theory and the other side believes in the BIG guy. God. Discuss amongst your group. ANYWAY, really good movie.

"naiasf13","Unbelievable shock!","20 March 2013","I do have a list of worse films ever. I have a top ten that I did not think I could easily find a new film to top them all. But life is like that and I did find one. And it is made by a director whom I love for his work and whose scifi movies I propose to all people who want to get in touch with this genre as classics.

I will not start by explaining how bad the movie is. I have read here reviews that do strive to accomplish that but I am afraid, detailed as they are they still lack: the truth is even worse.

The script is so bad that I could not believe my eyes at what I was watching. If I did not know that it was a Scott movie I would think it was a farce based on a Scott movie. I will just say that there is no explanation, justification or the glimpse of basic human reason in ANY of the scenes and you also have a robot that partakes into the madness.Who does what to whom and why why why???

I will not get into the aesthetics of the movie. It is like describing the packaging of a cell phone that can not even place a phone call. So what?

I have one advise: If you love Ridley Scott do NOT see this, it will mar your love. If you do not now him yet( if this is possible!) do NOT see this: watch Alien and Bladerunner and that's enough.

As for me I will try to heal from the shock!!!","1"
"imperator-ming","They should have known better","27 October 2012","I give this movie a ""3"" because watching it wasn't a complete waste of time, but other than that it is a bad movie. The reasons for that were pointed out by many of the other reviewers. Even those who gave the movie a good rating 8 to 10 were insightful enough to mention the movie's abundance of plot holes and out-of-character behavior, but they gave it a good rating anyways, reasoning that one should not expect too much from a movie like that. On the other side of the spectrum there a people giving it a ""1"", also clearly an overreaction. I'm so confused!

Anyway, looking at the names of the director and his writers, I can only conclude that with their experience they should have known better. They should have allowed for a little bit of self criticism to settle in half way into the story development and go back and reconstruct some of the elements once more from scratch, and it would have resulted in a movie at least worth a fair rating of 6 to 7.

And now to round it up with a little bit of controversy, here's why I think that there hasn't been an original plan to do a ""Prometheus Part 2"". But before I do lets insert a

SPOILER ALERT

I believe that the writers didn't originally aim for a part 2 because all the questions have actually been answered in this movie.

The movie is named ""Prometheus"" after the alien that appears in the first scene. He is the ""god"" that came down to give birth to humanity (rather accidentally it seems) and is punished for it. Judging from the can of worms he eats (for whatever reason), humanity is just one more experiment of biological warfare going out of control. But unlike the all the other experiments humanity actually manages to develop things like space travel, artificial beings, and so on, so the ""human experiment"" turns out far more dangerous than even the most devious Alien(TM). No wonder the Creators hate humans so much.

A neat idea, but it doesn't make up for all the other crappy ones.","3"
"purplefoxgaming","An absolutely wonderful film, packed full of action and excitement","6 June 2012","I personally went to see this movie in iMAX 3D and it was spectacular. The bass really kicked in when the Prometheus first landed on the planet, the whole cinema was shaking. So if you haven't seen this film already I would really recommend that you see it at the iMAX, as it is really worth paying that little bit extra, providing you live near an iMAX theater of course.

I don't really understand why there are so many bad reviews about this film as I can't really see a fault with it. I must admit though I did find the story incredibly confusing, especially when David purposely contaminates Charlie Holloway's drink. To avoid any misunderstanding of the film before you go and see it, I would recommend prior to watching it that you have at least watched one of the Alien films, as it is rather similar.

I know rating this 10/10 is probably slightly generous, but it probably is the best film I have seen since Avatar by James Cameron came out. Please just ignore all the negative reviews and give it a shot otherwise, you will almost indefinitely regret it.","10"

"masonmorgan-92917","An unnecessary expansion to the Alien universe","23 May 2017","After the colossal embarrassment know as Alien Resurrection, the chugging narrative of the Alien films has finally been demolished. It seems that Scott had recognized this, and decided to take the reigns of his franchise once again, but this time, he's taking us back to even before the events of his 1979 masterpiece. While the film is noticeably ambitious, through both it's complex narrative and visionary science-fiction setting, Prometheus only manages to be a filler chapter in a saga that repeatedly makes unnecessary additions to it's continuously expanding mythos, never really earning justification for it's own existence.

Even if Prometheus is merely filler for the franchise, it's visually impressive filler. The obvious architectural borrowings from the original Alien film add a tasteful amount of nostalgia that will undoubtedly excite fans. The massive extraterrestrial catacombs engulf any signs of life as our human characters venture further into the bio-mechanical labyrinth. In the first couple of shots, Scott let's the audience know that he hasn't lost a touch of his technical prowess, however, the uninteresting narrative and characters does raise questions about his storytelling skills.

The crew of the Prometheus are, for the most part, paper-thin. Despite their utter lack of development or depth, Scott seemingly expects us to care for them when they unsurprisingly meet their demise. Noomi Rapace does give a good performance as Elizabeth Shaw, along with Fassbender as the synthetic David, and their chemistry showcased in the final act of the film could be compelling if continued.

The overall plot is rarely compelling as it is stupid. Prometheus features possibly the most inept scientists ever put to screen. Their bafflingly stupid decisions are laughable and broke the gloomy tone of the film on multiple occasions. It does feature some tense scenes as well as a satisfying final act, but too many questions are left unanswered to make the film satisfying as a whole. This film was created to explain who the engineers were and how they fit into the Alien universe, but sadly the film asks more questions than it answers, making for an ultimately frustrating final product.

Prometheus is a gorgeous piece of sci-fi from one of the best directors of the genre, and while it is admittedly above average, it still falls flat when it comes to delivering compelling or cohesive backstory to Alien (1979). We have a few interesting characters, a slow building sense of tension and unexpected small bursts of violence, and while all of these aspects should result in an enticing sci-fi horror, even the best aspects of Prometheus don't look too great alongside an uninteresting and frustratingly illusive plot.","6"
"redhighed","Visually stunning but no engine under the hood !","4 August 2013","Well where do you start with this movie. It was a movie I was so looking forward to. Ridley Scott has produced some of my favourite movies, so with him in charge how could it possibly go wrong ? Visually the movie is extremely impressive both from the CGI aspect and the sets that were created that gave an epic movie feel. But sadly the story line and character development appeared to have been written by a five year old. Don't get me wrong there is absolutely nothing wrong with the concept for the prequel, in fact it's a great idea and the potential to write a brilliant script was there. But Ridley would have been well advised to have got Frank Darbont involved in this prequel both to help with the storyline and in particular with the character development, something Frank does extremely well. He builds believable characters you empathise with and care about . Instead he ended up with 2 dimensional characters who you don't really relate to, and as such don't care what happens to them.They also don't act at all like the people they are meant to be representing or at all like you'd expect them to in the different situations they find themselves in. Watching the documentary afterwards you get the feeling their were too many people involved in the storyline decision making and as such there is no continuity to the film. It jumps from one event to the next with scenes not reaching a climax or conclusion. As for plot holes and things that simply didn't make sense, here's just a few. ( Note Spoilers !! )

1) Milburn a biologist that wants to go back to the ship when they fond a 2000 year old alien corpse ?

2) Fifield the mapping Wizard who gets lost ?? I mean we have the capability now to re-trace our steps electronically let alone in the future

3) The crew who've been asleep for two and a half years suffer nauseas, sickness and mobility problems when they awake and yet the 'creator ?' who's been in limbo for 2000 years becomes a ninja warrior when he's awakened.

4) All the Creators buddies have been killed by what ever they created and his spacecraft left stranded, so he climbs in a life pod for 2000 years. Amazingly the ship is all okay when he awakens and he can fly off ! Why didn't he do this before ???? Not to mention there are other crafts on the planet....oh and how did Dave the Droid know that ??

5) They too easily take there helmets off.

6) Too easily open the bow doors to anything that comes knocking.

7) Shaw bouncing around after an alien caesarean that was office stapled together...not to mention (and she didn't) that an alien life form had just been removed from her stomach!

8) Guy Richie playing an old man.....errr why ???

And many many more to numerous to mention.

A beautifully rendered movie destroyed by inept story telling and character development !

"zardoz-13","Ridley Doesn't Top Himself","8 June 2012","In a New York Times interview, ""Blade Runner"" director Ridley Scott described his third science fiction film ""Prometheus"" as ""'2001' on steroids."" This comparison is entirely appropriate, particularly if you've seen the enigmatic but thought-provoking Stanley Kubrick epic about the evolution of mankind since the dawn of time. Scott's first 3-D spectacle (""Prometheus"" is fun to watch once in 3-D) has elicited a wide variety of commentary since it arrived in theaters. Essentially, ""Prometheus"" chronicles mankind's search for its origins. Two archeologists convince a wealthy corporate sponsor to create a spaceship that will transport them to the far reaches of the galaxy where they believe that they will find the answers to questions that the ancient etched in caves long ago. Of course, what they find is not what they wanted. Nevertheless, they do learn something not only about themselves but also their creators that will keep audiences arguing about the meaning of ""Prometheus"" until the producers shed more celluloid on the situation. Ostensibly, ""Prometheus"" qualifies as a quasi-prequel to Scott's own scary sci-fi saga ""Alien."" The chief difference is that ""Prometheus"" isn't a tenth as horrifying. Nothing like the pugnacious pickle-shaped predator bursting from the chest of a human appears in this tame sci-fi opus. Meantime, Scott has stated that ""Prometheus"" isn't a prequel. He concedes, however, that the seeds of ""Alien"" have been sown into it. You cannot watch ""Prometheus"" without thinking about ""Alien."" The ""Alien"" space jockey—as it is referred to--appears in ""Prometheus"" and so does an ""Alien"" prototype. Furthermore, the story unfolds like ""Alien,"" boasts a contemplative android, a tenacious female protagonist, and a couple of tentacled reptilian creatures icky enough to make you shrink in revulsion. The problem with ""Prometheus"" is that it is more speculative than dramatic. Everybody about the physical appearance of ""Prometheus"" looks dazzling. The technology and the equipment look like each belongs in the future. Some of the performances are extraordinary, too, especially Michael Fassbinder as a sophisticated android with a lethal sense of humor. Like ""2001: A Space Odyssey,"" ""Prometheus"" spends more time contemplating our predicament rather than frightening the living daylights out of us above it.

""Prometheus"" opens on what appears to be planet Earth. We are treated to some awesome vistas as we fly above the sprawling terrain. A man in a cloak with alabaster-white skin and a muscularly sculpted physique walks up to a waterfall while a gigantic, saucer-shaped UFO hovers not far away. He takes the lid off a container and consumes some blackish goop. No sooner has he swallowed this nasty stuff than he suffers crippling spasms and plunges into the waterfall. The man's powerful body integrates and we see his DNA appear. As incredibly visual and mysterious as this scene is, you find yourself wondering exactly who this dude is and from whence he came. The next sequence finds a team of archeologists excavating a site in the year 2089 when Dr. Elizabeth Shaw (Naomi Rapace of ""Sherlock Holmes: Game of Shadows"") finds a star map on the wall of a cave. She summons her colleague, Dr. Charlie Holloway (Logan Marshall-Green of ""Brooklyn's Finest""), who also happens to be her boyfriend, and shows him a cave painting with a tall, thin, man pointing to an array a stars. The importance of this primitive drawing is that Shaw and Holloway have found similar examples of it around the world. They believe that they have discovered a star map that will take them to meet their creators. The next scene finds everybody aboard the Exploratory Vessel Prometheus in the year 2093 as an android, David (Michael Fassbinder of ""Centurion""), keeps track of them before they awaken from stasis. Once Dr. Shaw and Dr. Holloway along with their colleagues have gotten up and eaten, they meet the CEO of the Weyland Corporation, Peter Weyland (Guy Pearce of ""Lockout""), whose billions have brought them into orbit around a faraway moon designated LV 223. He makes comments about the mission in a holographic presentation to them and then hands the briefing over to our heroes. Not long afterward, Weyland's dictatorial daughter, Meredith Vickers (Charlize Theron of ""Snow White and the Huntsman"") informs them that they answer to her and she controls the mission. Basically, Vickers is the equivalent of Ellen Ripley from ""Alien."" She warns them not to contact any aliens until they have notified her about it.

Our heroes, David, and their colleagues land on the surface of the moon near a gigantic structure and enter it wearing space suits. No sooner have they walked in than they discover that they can take off their helmets because they can breathe the air. They find a Mount Rushmore sized alien head in one of the rooms as well as mysterious vases that contain the black goop that the exterrestial sampled in the prologue. They also find tall, imposing aliens like the ""Alien"" space jockey. Most of these fellows are dead and laying about in piles in what appears to be bunkers. David checks out a room teeming with vases. Their exploration is cut short because a storm is moving in and they are order to evacuate and return to the ship. Two of Shaw's colleagues are accidentally left behind. The captain of the spacecraft, Janek (Idris Elba of ""Ghost Rider, Spirit of Vengeance""), advises them to sit out the storm and await their arrival in the morning. Creepy things begin to happen and the two men encounter a snake-like creature that latches on to them. They are not prepared for what happens to them. Later, it turns out that Dr. Shaw has been contaminated with an organism in her body that resembles an embryro. She explains that she is not fertile and begins a mad dash to remove this organism from her body.

The monsters in ""Prometheus"" aren't as scary as the ""Alien"" beasties. Meantime, this two hour-plus, R-rated potboiler will make you think about what didn't happen on screen more than what did.","8"
"dee.reid","""Prometheus"" - More questions than answers...","30 November 2012","Prometheus - ""A Titan in Greek legend who steals fire from heaven as a gift for man"" (Websters Seventh New Collegiate Dictionary, 1965)

With Ridley Scott's 2012 futuristic science fiction adventure-thriller ""Prometheus"" (his first sci-fi film since the 1982 science fiction landmark ""Blade Runner""), the audience gets more questions than answers - even though one of the movie's tag-lines is, ""Questions will be answered."" Heavily touted early on as a prequel of sorts to Scott's equally ground-breaking sci-fi/horror masterpiece ""Alien"" (1979), ""Prometheus"" IS more or less - mostly less, but also a little bit more - a prequel to ""Alien,"" while also leaving an open-ended conclusion that will spin more sequels to the prequel that supposedly started the whole thing in the first place.

""Prometheus"" is a visual marvel; this cannot be denied by anyone watching the movie with an open mind (and with their eyes pried wide open). Scott has always been a strong, masterful visual filmmaker; most filmmakers can have a strong visual sense, but weak story-telling capabilities. Scott, always the strong visual-lover, remember, tells a sweeping existentialist tale regarding questions about humanity's origins (including our potential beginnings in the stars), the role of God in the equation (if any, really), meeting your maker (a central theme in Scott's earlier ""Blade Runner""), and why a creator would ultimately want to destroy the creation that they labored so hard to create. But again, Scott's ""Prometheus"" may only leave the audience even MORE confused than BEFORE they went in.

""Prometheus"" begins with a sweeping panoramic view of what is presumably an alien planet that looks remarkably a lot like Earth, backed with a majestic orchestral overture by composer Mark Streitenfeld (who's serviceable, but he's no Jerry Goldsmith - may he rest in peace - who composed the moody, atmospheric, and ominous ground-breaking score for Scott's earlier ""Alien""). This opening sequence by itself may be worth the ticket price alone, but it also presents the first of many unanswered head-shakers in a movie that will no doubt have you glued to your seat, but also shaking your head in confusion most of the time.

Flash forward thousands of years into the future to 2089 (77 years from now - I did the math!), where it introduces us to its principal players, archaeologists and lovers Drs. Elizabeth Shaw (Swedish actress Noomi Rapace, from the original Swedish-language ""Girl with the Dragon Tattoo"" trilogy) and Charlie Holloway (Logan Marshall-Green). The two have discovered the latest in a set of ancient cave paintings that they believe confirms their competing theories on the extraterrestrial beginnings of all life on Earth.

They also pose an interesting (if all too obvious) dichotomy that has hounded humans since the beginning of time: Shaw believes in God almost as much as she does science, while Holloway is a staunch supporter of Charles Darwin. Anyway, they manage to find themselves (with 15 others), four years later, on the scientific research vessel - overseen by chilly corporate head honcho Meredith Vickers (Charlize Theron) - the ""Prometheus"" of the title, which is traveling to an unknown planet in an undisclosed region in the darkest reaches of outer space. Of course their natural scientific curiosity compels them to search the planet for any signs of life (which also harks back to the vaguely sexual, bio-mechanical architectural set-designs by ""Alien's"" Swiss surrealist H.R. Giger), and eventually uncovering a horrifying secret that has the potential to wipe out all life on Earth as we know it.

I'll say that as a fond admirer of ""Alien"" (though I personally prefer James Cameron's superior 1986 sequel, ""Aliens""), ""Prometheus"" is one of the most eagerly anticipated movies of the year for me. From the opening moments, I was hooked just to see where it would go. I knew from the previews that things were going to get gory and scary eventually, so I was not worried about a potentially disappointing third act here. I guess what ultimately did disappoint me were the unanswered questions that would presumably link this movie to ""Alien.""

I presume a director's cut is on the way eventually (since Scott has a funny habit of re-cutting some of his most well-known works), but then I remember reading somewhere that this is unlikely, for whatever reasons Scott has in mind. I think that if a director's cut were to be released, it would answer some of the unanswered questions that will no doubt be confounding viewers for many more years to come, but it will also make the movie make more sense. I know a wealth of material ultimately did not make it into the final film, and I'm sure it'll make some things (like some of the character's questionable actions and motivations and the exact origins of the extraterrestrial threat) much clearer.

There may be one or two breakout performances here (Noomi Rapace being the most likely), but the film's real stand-out proves to be the android servant David (Michael Fassbender), who studies to learn how to be human by mostly watching old movies. The predecessor to Ian Holm's traitorous android Ash in ""Alien"" and Lance Henriksen's enigmatic Bishop in ""Aliens,"" you're utterly convinced by Fassbender's subtly remarkable performance that will no doubt spark calls for an Oscar nomination. His acting also recalls ""Star Trek"" (2009) and ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" (1968) in his robotic expressiveness that makes him appear more human and empathetic than some of the other characters that we KNOW are obviously human.

""Prometheus"" does boast one of the strongest visual senses of any big-budget Hollywood movie I've seen this year. I'm unsure if it's truly Ridley Scott's much-fabled return to the genre that made him such a prominent name in the film industry. His return to sci-fi is not a triumphant one, but a confounding one, as I'm sure anyone looking for a definitive connection to ""Alien"" will most definitely have to wait for another sequel to the original prequel.

"sarthakbharad2926","Big Things... Have Small Beginnings.","10 March 2023","I admire this film. I really do. Ridley Scott presents some really interesting ideas about the origins of the terrifying being present in Alien (1979). However, it is something that will require a lot of re-watching and thinking to fully understand what the crew was actually going for.

First off, the acting, there are a lot of ups and downs here. Michael Fassbender completely steals the show. He is leagues ahead of everyone else as David the Android. Guy Pearce is interesting in the role and he's having fun with it, and so do we because of that. Although his role had a twist which I saw coming from a mile away but nonetheless it was an interesting take to further progress the story. Charlize Theron and Idris Elba are so terribly wasted in their characters that it is baffling considering the talent they possess.

The real problem here is the story. I'm sure the writers Jon Spaihts and Damon Lindelof along with director Ridley Scott knew what they were doing but still they had a tough time translating it onto the screen. After some fantastic buildup towards the 3rd act and some really gory sequences in the 2nd act, the film just loses track, the twists are still baffling and the end result is hopelessly convoluted. As an ambitious epic, it cranks up the style and scope of the Alien saga, to differing effects. In terms of positives, this is one of the best-looking fantasy worlds ever created, and is every bit as immersive as the previous films, if not more so. This makes for some ground-breaking visual effects and stunning production design, but as is the case with most technical marvels like Tron: Legacy and Transformers, less is invested in the story. The ending also doesn't make a lot of sense but it's like enjoyably audacious nonsense.

I would like to say although Ridley Scott presented us with new ideas he had for the alien franchise which were differing from the original alien presence, they weren't translated on-screen as polished as they should've been. I do want to know more about the Engineers but I guess Scott decided not to pursue this new storyline completely and hence just made Alien-Covenant afterwards which was a great decision considering the continuation of the franchise but also saddening that we just get back to the old Alien thing and the possibility of having a new, beautiful creature was lost. Prometheus is a preposterously preposterous film with preposterousness around every corner, but it's a fun ride.","7"
"kamran_s80","The Emperor's New Clothes....","6 June 2012","""THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS. PLEASE BE WARNED.""

Questions: In the context of the ""Alien's"" and ""Prometheus''' universe - How did life begin on earth? Where did we (humans) come from?

Filmmakers: Watch Prometheus, if you want to gain an understanding of and answers to these deepest of all questions.

Critics (majority thereof): The movie doesn't really make much sense, least of all providing answers to or even guidance on these questions. However, only those who can really understand the unexplained mysteries and the deep philosophical implications of the movie, will be able to recognise its true greatness.

Truth: This is really the classic case of the Emperor's New Clothes. The Emperor is not wearing the 'unexplained mysteries'; the Emperor is not wearing anything at all.

Consider this: ""The spaceship arrives at an alien planet (or was it a moon of a planet?), descends directly into its atmosphere and the crew just finds the spot where the alien structure is built (of the whole planet) thanks to the sharp eye of one of the archaeologists. The key members of the crew (and consequently playing the lead roles) on a deep space exploration mission to seek alien life are two ARCHAEOLOGISTS, one of whom also happens to be an expert on really anything the movie requires her to be an expert on. The crew goes into the alien structure straight away after landing, is not supposedly led by anyone on this expedition (as anyone can do whatever they want, especially the Android, who continuously keeps prodding and poking at everything within his reach), take off their helmets because there is good enough oxygen in the alien environment, come across a decapitated alien form (their very first such encounter), the geologist (who looks like a real bargain on a trillion dollar mission) goes all psychotic (Lock-out movie style) and the biologist (who is supposed to be the most relevant person for this moment and should have been waiting for it all his life) walks away with the geologist back to the ship (but they still manage to get lost...another story for another time). Meanwhile, the remaining crew gather the head of the alien, put it in a plastic bag, bring it back to the ship without so much as a shower after their exposure to the alien environment, play with the head in the ship's open air and then make it explode perhaps just for the kicks. The best thing was, while the poor alien's head was being played with, one of the archaeologists was getting drunk in the same room watching the show.""

How about that for A-class science fiction? There is nothing 'unexplained mysterious' about this. It is just plain nonsense.

Almost every other minute of the movie is littered with stupidity / inconsistency / incoherence / convenience (pick one). I don't feel the need to list them all down here as (a) the list would be way too long; and (b) a lot of it has already been adequately covered by fellow reviewers.

Don't be deceived by the mantra that it is doing a Bladerunner and its true greatness will be recognised once we start understanding / appreciating the deeper / dual meaning of the movie's various plot holes / situations / characters' actions. There is nothing deep about silliness / nonsense other than the fact that it is so.

The reason I have not given it a one star is due to hundreds of millions of dollars worth of special effects, which were pleasing to the eyes. Other than that this movie is an insult to intelligence.","3"
"Smerdyakoff","Should Have Been Better","9 July 2016","Prometheus was a movie that should have been much much better. It had everything it needed to do that: budget, actors, backstory and a directory. Sure it had big ideas and concepts like where did man come from, the old ET seeded earth, Panspermia concept. But like many a grand plan, it undid itself on stupid B movie maneuvers and nonsensical plot elements. Let's start with the stupid maneuvers. The Geologist and the Biologist managed to get themselves lost on in the cavern, even though the Geologist Fifield mapped the cave out with his laser imaging balls and supposedly would be able to access the map from his local computer. Then they are forced to spend the night in the cavern, so the pick the room with the proto alien organisms. They see this hideous python snake creature, slithering through the black ooze. So instead of running away, they treat it like a stray Golden Retriever puppy and try to pet it, DUHHH?? This is on par with the average cheap horror slasher movie where characters inexplicably go off and wander into dark spaces to get killed and eaten. They could have given the two hapless scientists a better story. Their machine broke down in the storm and they had to return to the caverns for protection then the snake snuck up on them when they were asleep. Such sloppy writing.

Then in a more serious scene of true horror, our intrepid driven female scientist, Dr. Shaw, climbs into a medical pod to get this alien fetus removed, a med pod conveniently for men only in spite that it is in the female commander's private pod and there are 4 women total on the ship. So she gets the pod to remove this horrid face hugging thing, then she stitches herself up it was a true well done horror scene. So instead of screaming and alerting the crew to the treacherous android David and this horrid alien, she keeps it all to herself. And for someone who just had major surgery and just stapled the incision shut, she is remarkably active and in character. Mind you later on this same alien, sans any food, in a few hours increases in size 200 fold. Then there are the more esoteric parts of the theme. This ship was commissioned to go to this planet based on ancient cave drawings found all over the world of the same star system. So this is all pre Alien, no one on earth knew about any dangerous xenomorph, This is in contrast to Alien where the Wayland Corp knew about the dangerous xenomorphs, put an a maliciously programmed android aboard the ship and they treacherously planned on sacrificing the crew to get the alien. In this case, all Weyland knew was that the earth seeding humanoid aliens came from this planet and the president of the corporation, near death, wanted to find a medical miracle to extend his life. Yet the android on this ship did act treacherously. Apparently it, David, had some daddy issue concerning the president, or people in general. So what, in the space of a couple years this emotionless android hatched a plan to destroy people he was supposed to serve on his own? This is more troubling since David was busy watching classic Britfilms like ""Lawrence of Arabia"" while the rest of the crew was in cryosleep. Would Lawrence, whom David was modeling, betray his own people and country? Was this some Skynet scenario? Also, according to ship's captain, this alien outpost was some sort of military base. You know, black guys who are just pilots or other nonintellectual types always have some preternatural sense of aliens two thousand years dead, even though he never left his ship. Then we are left with the big question. Why did the aliens put directions to their military base in the ancients' minds? I can buy the inscrutable aliens' inscrutable motivations that last seemed to be to destroy earth. But why 2000 years ago, which is when the aliens all died there? Did the aliens not like Jesus, which could tie into Dr. Shaw's religious beliefs? Why give our ancients DNA memory of that star system? Then they add in David's inscrutable motivation to wreck everything. Then David warns the Prometheus of the destination of the now active alien ship and its cargo. That is just plain Grade B sloppy writing. Then the final charge of the Prometheus at the alien ship as it takes off? Tra la, save the day. Then the stupid women who just couldn't run to the side as the ring shaped alien ship rolls on its edge. This is what made this an un-great film, in spite of the awesome epic scale and visuals of the ships and the alien world. The newer Star Trek and Star Wars cash grabs were cheesy takes on the classic themes and plots with a few new characters thrown in. They sold since their idiot fan base is easily led and Abram's schlock was at least more watchable than the previous installments. Like Star Trek Insurrection. Prometheus was supposed to be more and billed itself as more than just pre-teen Star Wars space opera or just more horror monster movie too. IT was supposed to bring us back to the glory days of real serious Sci Fi. So it deserves a final kick for letting us down with such shoddy writing.","4"
"cdu-387-984982","Terribly bad, so many mistakes and weaknesses ....","3 June 2012","As a big Alien fan, I just saw this very promising movie 2 days ago and ... that was a big disappointment in the end ... Instead of giving you a dissertation I will simply list the flaws that made me think that was just crap despite nice visual effects:

some characters are simply useless, like the Asian guy and the old man, and we could skip 2 or 3 more


the way the male main character dies is so stupid: drinking a worm, getting sick, and being burned by the blond bitch ... so what?


one final scene with the old man trying to talk with the giant humanoid is more than ridiculous: a few words and gets the head crushed... so what? nothing original as ""aliens"" only kill and scream right? they are superior to humans by their technology and science but in the end, try to talk with them and they react as wild beasts with only strange ""grrrrrr"" as communication skills ... this is pure nonsense. The cyborg spent 2 years learning ancient languages in the ship and after one sentence to the humanoid his head gets crushed. So ridiculous.


the 2 guys (biologist and geologist) getting lost in the caves is also ridiculous, their trip is overly long, we don't hear about them during ages, and when they cry for help, the ""captain"" (black guy) replies in such stupid ways that they should go to bed and does not even take them seriously! is it about teenagers getting lost in the forest or professionals/experts having minimum sense of duty?


we still don't know why and what the humanoid drank some strange liquid in the first scene and why the hell to we need to see his DNA going wrong in the Niagara Falls? - the major flaw and most stupid element: the humanoids finally wanted to destroy the Earth/humans (us) using biological weapons (the ""aliens"") BUT in the meantime, all of them (except one sleeping) were destroyed by ... the ""aliens"" !!! can someone explain to me what that means?


the way the ""team"" travels around the caves is also ridiculous, they look like teenagers in a haunted house: almost no weapons, no serious protection, no clear plan or coordination between them


finally the first speech of the ""scientists"" about their discovery of matching patterns telling us that aliens in the sky are calling us is also very weak


Conclusion: except for those unforgivable mistakes, it was okay but no way can it make me forget the ""true"" Alien movies. This movie has no spirit, just good computer design, but big nonsense going nowhere, we also don't learn anything about the original Aliens. Very disappointing. Quickly forgotten. Waste of money but still better than Evil Dead.","2"
"james_stabwest","Visually stunning Sci-Fi","16 June 2013","Prometheus is set in the same ""universe"" as the Alien films, but does not have the same atmosphere. Alien and Aliens are in the top 10 sci-fi films of all time, but can also fit into the horror genre. They were suspenseful edge of your seat movies, making you afraid to see what was around the next corner. The same cannot be said for Prometheus, but it does somewhat make up for it with some stunning visuals that the Alien films cannot even remotely compete with. This is definitely a Ridley Scott epic, and lives up to the director's reputation. Michael Fassbender was brilliant, unfortunately he was not the lead. Poor Noomi wasn't up to the task, but some decent support characters including Charlize Theron and Idris Elba help round it out. Overall this is a great film, and quite entertaining. The minor plot holes can be overlooked, hoping things will be cleared up in the sequel(with Fassbender in the lead).","9"

Full of clichés, bad acting and caricatures, Prometheus is a huge waste of money and talent. I couldn't even sit through the entire movie. Stephen Stills should sue the producers for mentioning his name in this poor excuse for a movie. My husband tried to defend the movie by arguing the special effects are good, but less than an hour into the movie, even he was groaning at how bad it is.

Since I'm required to write 10 lines, I'll share some of the more insipid lines of dialog: ""captain, can you out her down here?"" ""I wouldn't be much of a captain now if I couldn't!"" ""so help me God, I will find the cord and I will cut it!"" ""I just want answers, babe.""","1"
"EvanKevelson","This was the less entertaining than any Alien film in the franchise","7 August 2021","Obviously Alien 1979 is one of the best horror Sci-Fi/Horror film in the genre. Personally I don't understand America's love affair with James Cameron but I felt Aliens albeit predictable brings in some nonsense..e.g. How long she was drifting for, and the fact the ""Company"" thinks it can control the Alien is moronic, and Reiser playing a lying sleaze ball was no surprise at all. If anythIng in Cameron's Sequel or second story it doesn't even make sense that the Company would want Ripley on the mission. Nonetheless outside of Terminator 2, this is an entertaining film but is not nearly as brooding as Ripley Scot's film.

Then Alien 3...The special edition upgrades the film tremendously...and though obviously a different situation than the first film but it's the first film where you can see that the facehugger doesn't require a humanoid host. It's an excellent cast, the prisoners are fascinating sociopaths. And I assume being that it's a hybrid (with a dog in theatrical and ram in special). That it's not as intelligent as the Alien we've come to love. This is good because it makes their attempts to trap it feasible. The gore was phenomenal as well.

Resurrection falls into the category of ""This is so bad it's good"" it's a Cheech and Chong film totally ridiculous.

Then people are pumped Ridley is back.

This is the dumbest Alien film I personally ever saw.

1. They're touching everything, they're taking off their helmets, it's beyond moronic. ""David"" did a phenomenal sociopathic Synthetic it but Blade runner to shame.

Though the problem is the free will aspect his actions are outside the perimeter of his job.

Now the premise this other humanoid race responsible for the origin of the species though plausible doesn't fit in with the first film. However the insane scientists and Weylan think that they were going to find their Creator? BASED ON WHAT? You find pictographs and astrological maps in ruins so that means they created Humanity? All it indicates is that either humanity had to flee before, or that earth was visited by another species. The constant dialogue about creators etc..I'm aware Mr. Scott is an Aetheist...so I don't know if he's mocking faith...but I do know he's made a nonsensical story with minimal points that are like a shot of espresso to make sure your still paying attention.","5"

If u remotely consider the first AvP canon then we know EVERYTHING PETER WEYLAND SAYS IN THIS MOVIE IS A LIE! There's no way he wants reputable scientists on this trek, they might ask questions so of course he's going to hire the worst he can find. There I just answered the why are the smart people so dumb questions. Now I'm not saying this movie doesn't have its bad parts(my god is Shaw annoying). But really this movie is a prequel to a prequel and as such can be seen as kinda throwaway. I do agree with most people about the anthropologist, and the Vickers character appears to be there as nothing more then a quasi-antagonist. As for the Grey men seemingly wanting to destroy what they created for no reason, humanity has been doing that for our entire history so it can be seen as a parallel to our own habit of doing the same and another way of showing that, yes, we truly do come from them.","8"

"clive_slatter","Epic possibilities, mediocre delivery","11 June 2012","I don't want to give to much away with this review but I might.

For me, this has been one of the prequels I have been looking forward to the most for some time. I loved Scott's original which didn't play too much on the actual horror, more on the expectation of it. Given it is now over 30 years old the film stands up pretty well.

Then we come to Prometheus. It's not a bad film in the sense that it sucks, but I don't think it succeeds in any of the important areas. By this I mean it doesn't seem to really tie into the original very well. I think it has tried too hard to be a prequel and maintain some elements of the later films such as a rogue synthetic that has its own agenda. There are some random elements as well such as the alien procreation by pregnancy rather than by gestation and the rather silly post-cesarean runabout by Noomi Rapace.

I expected to be able to move from the prequel and be able to translate these events into the original and I think I felt a little cheated. Was I not entertained? Well, yes it was entertaining but still. Unless there are plans for a sequel to this to answer many unanswered questions then this was an ill-conceived film.

Ho-hum. Let's see what comes of the Blade Runner sequel if it ever happens.","5"
"moviedump","Big questions, daft answers.","8 June 2012","The crew of the starship Prometheus are roused from cryo-sleep to ask the big questions. Who are we? Why are we here? Yes they're really asking those questions. None of them seem to know who anyone else is or why they came. Some don't like the mission and want to go home. Seriously, no one knows what they're doing, except Fassbender's android. By the end it's still not clear who some of the crew are – not even a pair who actually save the earth from alien apocalypse. Then again maybe that's fitting as we never really find out who these rebooted aliens they're saving us from are either.

Far from explaining everything, there are more loose ends left in Prometheus' wake than the Alien saga began with, plot tendrils snaking about like a grasping face hugger that's drunk too much coffee. Spotlight on writer Damon Lindelof who penned the TV series Lost. Mystery is replaced by bafflement.

A couple of times Prometheus stops ploughing a furrow through the dirt and actually gets off the ground. There is one classic, possibly genre forming scene of medical horror in this movie that goes places only the Japanese have gone before. And maybe thats where Prometheus went astray. This was all too sci-fi, while Alien knew much better what it was, and it was single minded, uberstylish horror.

The franchise that inspired so many films that followed it now borrows back from nearly all of them. Even the Thing makes an appearance, complete with flamethrower demise. The greasy metal and CRT interiors of the original are apparently predated by overfamiliar floating holographic displays. Maybe an intervening GFC and resulting technological devolution will be described in the sequels, or interstitials, or whatever the sequel to a prequel is called. moviedumpblog.wordpress.com",NA
"kalebfr","The most inane scenario ever","4 June 2012","This movie has to be the worst SCi-Fi movie I've ever seen, and I am quite a fan of the genre. I even find entertaining some below than average movies such as Red Planet with Val Kilmer. But waisting over 15 $ for this 3D crap really made me angry. I could do a better job at writing a scenario with some characters actually having some psychological depth, and whose actions are not totally incoherent or inane. At every frame you ask your self ""why oh why is he/she behaving like this, this is utterly stupid !!!"".

I thought Avatar's scenario sucked, feeling I was watching a rosy version of Danses with wolves and Pocahontas, but it's actually brilliant compared to this one.

"Ekul1021","A different path in the Alien universe","14 June 2012","I was very lucky to see the film in the IMAX theater and like Scott's film Kingdom of Heaven, cinematography makes the film very beautiful.

The story looks into the origin of the human beings where the creation tries to find the creator. Many characters have personal agendas that range from noble to selfishness.

The actors played great and I love Guy's James Mason-like voice and how he could play an old frailed man. Mike as the android is just as creep like Ian's character from the original Aliens, and Miss Theron has that beautiful woman dark heart character.

In all, a great return to the Alien universe without the cheesy characters like in Aliens 3, 4, the versus Predator 1 and 2. Don't expect the movie to be gun shooting with bugs around, this is a film about searching for your long lost parents.","10"
"davish_wulf-1","enjoyable but disappointing","9 June 2012","I went to see this movie without knowing much of the script or even if it was an Alien prequel, i heard some rumors that it was and the name sure brought me back some memories.

It starts a bit awkward, with this huge E.T. drinking some boiling ""sake"" from otter space only to desintegrate himself in a huge waterfall.

Confused from the beginning, i became even more confused as the movie rambled on with strange decisions from crew members, lack of logic in many parts and general lack of direction.

Without going into many details, i doubt that in 82 years from now we have the kind of ships portrayed in the movie.

I doubt even more that human beings are capable to withstand a baby pop-up cirurgy in 2 minutes and run, hop and jump in the next minutes like nothing ever happened.

Major faults:

The giant Alien dude dies inside Prometheus instead of being in his chair when the alien pops out of his belly (like he was shown in ""Alien"") - strange decision since Ridley took the trouble of detailing the chair, suit, ship and even Helmet only to strip him out again and kill him far from the alien ship

The belly operation was ridiculous

Robot made no sense in his intentions: i don't understand if he was just following directives, trying to bring a species back home or trying to destroy it (ping-pong beta model?)

Charlie transformation after being cremated was a stupid move, i swear it almost ruined the movie right there, but thankfully he never appeared again

The 2 crew members in the cave that suddenly want to bail out just because they find out they weren't there just for rocks (what the hell???)

Lack of enthusiasm from the biologists who wanted to meet their makers and yet wanted to run away or even destroy them at the first sign of danger

Aliens had the technology to build very advanced ships with very detailed space travel menu-holograms, only to have very primitive holograms whenever they appeared in action

Apparently aliens film themselves all the time (with terrible quality holograms) including on how to operate their ships (this was by far the most awkward ship-manual method i ever saw)

After all the mess, Shaw wanted to go back to the planet of the same beings that wanted to destroy her (yeah right...) - very forced excuse for a sequel

A crew that, realizing their warship sucks (no major weapons hint hint), volunteers to destroy the alien ship with their own ship, risking their lifes..... right... forced patriotism here we go again (Independence day 2?)

Some music elements were way off, sounding like a G.I. Joe movie

Technology seems light years ahead from the ""Alien"" movie - they could have disguised more the suits, computers and all that stuff so it felt more in line with the original movie

Planet is huge and yet they amazingly land the aircraft exactly in the spot where the alien ship is standing (even not knowing there was a space ship there), just because Charlie thought it was the perfect place to land (riiiiight)

Guy Pierce used as an old man (he sounded ridiculous). Why the hell didn't they use a real old man instead? By the way, why the hell was he hiding/pretending he was dead in the first place? After all he was financing the whole operation!

Good points:

Some music elements, dark themes were well used here and there.

Very good CGI special effects: I liked the giant Alien looks and the huge ""face huggers"" (although nothing beats a good old Alien look)

The ""cave"", alien facilities, ship & atmosphere were well conceived, although i would have made it even more darker putting more emphasys on suspense & detail (you hardly know whats in the ceiling or whats that strange sculpture on the wall)

Very good acting by Fassbender, the best actor in the movie and a major role well deserved

All in all, an entertaining movie but the faults are so obvious even a blind man would notice them.

The sequel will come, for sure... but if there aren't original Aliens there, i doubt it will have the same impact: this giant Alien lacks the charm of the classical ""Alien"" series, perhaps the most successful creature ever created in cinema.

I sincerely hope there's a director's cut to this, to somehow redeem the script gaps and explain what the hell was going on in the head of this crew, alien & even Ridley Scott to release such a faulty ""vehicle"" to the public.

But.. then again, perhaps Ridley will be known for the director who used to do things perfect in the old days (""Alien"", ""Blade Runner"", ""Gladiator"") but now needs a director's cut in every movie he makes to bring some sense to them and make them somehow better or even great (like in ""Kingdom of Heaven"")","6"
"LetsWatchSomething","Expectations + Logical fallacies","7 January 2013","When you decide to watch Prometheus, you'll probably do one of two things. You can either disregard the entire film due to its poor scientific standing or you can just appreciate it for the decent film it is.

I've chosen to do the latter just because it's ridiculous to bash a film constantly based on the science. What about the imagery or the acting? I think too many people have got carried away with actively attacking the film due to many positive reviews.

In any sense, the film serves as an average 'prequel' to the 'Alien' series, it was no surprise that they tried to distance themselves from the Aliens by throwing in the idea of the engineers who they believe created the human race. Unfortunately I must admit that the thought process on the characters and the actions they do are extremely limited and come across as reckless and stupid.

This for me is where the main problem lies, I can't fault the acting because clearly the script is the trouble. It appears the characters are magnets for disaster, they have no regard for safety and don't seem to be at all aware of the conditions of the planet (LV-223 which I believe is a moon). This has nothing to do with the science element of the film, but since these people are looking for the greatest question asked to mankind, it appears they don't seem to be the ideal candidates intelligence wise.

Other than that, the film is quite interesting in the way the events pan out, it's hard to categorise the film in terms of a genre since it isn't a horror like 'Alien' and it isn't a thriller since it doesn't really keep the viewer gripped.

Just take this film as it is, basically a 'Look what we can do with effects and a $100 million dollar plus budget'. If you take nothing else away from the film at least enjoy the aesthetics... or watch this film as you dumb down a notch or two!","5"
"alex-369-867786","Could, and should have been better","31 October 2012","Being a sucker for sci-fi films, I awaited the release of Prometheus with great anticipation. Unfortunately, my expectations were far too high; what started off as a great premise, and a genuinely impressive opening section was soon let down by unlikeable, and forgettable characters (with the notable exception of Michael Fassbender), clunky dialogue, and a swiss cheese-like plot. If these so-called experts and scientists were Earth's supposed creme de la creme of intelligent minds, then we would have no hope at all; a more inept, unprofessional bunch you'd be hard-pressed to find. There is also an over-reliance on CGI, which cannot save this film as you're too busy trying to understand how some of these actors could have been so badly miscast. Maybe this film wouldn't seem so bad if it wasn't directly associated with the far superior Alien films, well, the first two in the series, anyway. Also, maybe if I hadn't just been watching Red Dwarf just before this I might have taken Prometheus a little more seriously. I doubt it.","3"

"georgehreed","explanation of some of the more vague things in this mythology based sci-fi film","10 June 2012","I've just seen Prometheus, and here is an explanation of some of the more vague things in this mythology based sci-fi film (not official)>>

Did the Engineers Create the Plague (black substance) that they found throughout the spaceship?

> No, the engineers did not create the plague/WMD in the bunker - they were enslaved by another race that did. The race that created the black super-virus (for an Apocalypse) were using the Engineers - as the Engineers have special genetics that make it possible for them to create anything, notably genetically modified freakish composite creatures, but in this film they allude to with the original Alien. The Engineers want to come back to the Earth not to destroy it, but to capture souls of as many people as possible before the Apocalypse, and then put them in the bodies of the children of the survivors. They kill the body in the process - but that is because a body without a soul is pointless, and would be used against them.

The engineers are not evil, as the movie shows they were used by God in creation of the Earth. They are very close to God, God is the same race as the Engineers - God is one of their Rulers, the Earth is God's creation.","10"
"markgorman","Not a patch on Alien. But what is?","5 June 2012","""In space nobody can hear you scream"" proclaimed the poster for Alien.

Even before you stepped into the cinema back in 1979 you knew, you'd read, you'd heard that you were going to be wincing with fear and disgust. When John Hurt's chest was ripped open by a baby monster you did scream. It was, and still is, a monumental movie.

Fast forward 33 years and the ""cinema event of the year"" arrives with reel after reel of preview film but little in the way of proper reviews. No talk about what the content was. I feared it was a studio ploy. Keeping the film away from the critics because it wasn't that good. And then, right at the last minute the reviews appeared. ""Hmmm"" that was the general consensus. So I went to my local multiplex in a state of anxiety. Could it possibly live up to the hype? Right let's get one thing out of the way right from the off. 3D does not make movies better, arguably the opposite, as directors strive to create set ups that allow them to show off the technique. The only 3D movie I've seen that even remotely benefits from the exercise is Avatar. Prometheus just doesn't need it.

By now you'll know the basic premise of the movie. Say what they like, but it IS a prequel to Alien and the obsession Ridley Scott has with the creation of man, religion, Darwinism and all such borders on the insane. It makes for some laboured moments and overblown plotting. The movie overall is too long (a common mistake these days) and lacks both pace, at times, and screams.

This simply does not scare you like Alien did, but apart from those criticisms it is a fine theatrical experience. It looks astounding, it has good central performances from Noomi Rapace and Michael Fassbender and adequate back up from the rest (although Kate Dickie is hopelessly miscast).

It's a good film. Just not a patch on Alien. There's an obvious sequel standing in the wings but I guess we'll have to see how this fares at the box office before taking the plunge because this ain't a cheap exercise ($120m - which incidentally is only half what Avengers Assembled cost)","7"
"TOMASBBloodhound","Grim, but engrossing prequel to Alien","25 November 2012","Make no mistake, that's what Prometheus is. It is a prequel to the 1979 classic by basically the same people. Sir Ridley Scott may want us to believe this is a stand-alone film, but there are simply not enough original ideas or set designs for this to be the case. That said, this is the best film to come along in many years dealing with this subject matter. The first couple sequels to Alien were quite good, even though they each had their own style and ideas. By Alien Resurrection, however, it became clear that there was no way either Ripley or the Alien could be killed off completely. Not as long as there was any money to be made. And by the time Predator showed up this critic had long since tuned this series out! But now with Prometheus, we are able to go back and see where this story may have begun. Only this time, it is not just a story about a doomed crew of a deep space freighter. This time, the origins and fate of all humanity are at risk.

Our story begins somewhat ambiguously as we see some sort of humanoid drink something and essentially cause himself to disintegrate into a river here on earth, presumably setting the wheels of DNA in motion countless years in the past. Fast forward to the 21st century, and some scientists uncover a cave painting that seems to indicate this alien race is inviting us to come and find them somewhere out in the vast reaches of space. The painting didn't look like anything worth sinking in trillions of dollars into with the hopes of building a big ship and sending out a crew to hopefully find the people that inspired it, but if a corporate tycoon wants to find the key to halting his advancing mortality, then it looks like the mission is a ""go"". We cut straight to the mission where our crew is being awakened from a long sleep to investigate a moon below them that might be the source of human existence. From here on out, the film is largely a series of clichés and ideas we have seen in other films. The skill at which this is made, particularly from the director's perspective, is what makes it so watchable. The acting is also quite good. The sets and creatures will look familiar to those who grew up on the Alien films, and that's not necessarily a bad thing. At least now all understand who that gigantic humanoid in the big chair was, and what his purpose was going to be. To me, the most fascinating thing about Alien was that doomed ship, and its fossilized passenger. Even if it was only a brief part of that film.

Although this is a deeper and more philosophical film than any previous Alien movie, none of these ideas seem terribly cutting-edge. Some of these same ideas have appeared in good films (2001) and bad films (Stargate) of the past. Perhaps the most compelling question is posed to us like this: What would we do if we found out the person who made us only did it because they could? But then we could ask, who made that person who made us? In addition to the more intellectual side, Prometheus is also filled with graphic violence and all manner of gruesome goings-on. And of course at least one of the crew is really a robot who seems outwardly pleasant, but most likely is doing the evil bidding of the Weiland Corporation. All things considered, Prometheus is more than worth a look. 8 of 10 stars.

The script had too many holes while visually pleasing I often wonder if the director or script writer was sober at even 1 point in the filming of the movie.

I only read reviews, I actually made an account to make a review on how terrible this picture was. AVOID WITH ALL COST.

This movie not only make me lost respect for Riddley Scott since he's helped make masterpieces like Gladiator, but then if you look carefully he's UNCREDITTED for the biggest pictures he's accomplished. This proves once in for all that it's about WHO you know than WHAT you know.","1"

First time round I did actually enjoy Prometheus despite it getting slated by Mark Kermode et al, I never understood their gripe with it when they certainly have sympathy for much more problematic films.

The story is nuts and bolts, Aliens/Sci-Fi, no surprises unless you're fastidiously interested in the hierarchy of the Aliens universe. I enjoyed the suggestion that the 'engineers' are our gods, mainly because I embrace at least the hypotheses that Darwin is wrong (in the case of humans).

In conclusion, the format is very generic and some of the dialogue is cringe worthy but I enjoy exploring Ridley's imagination and ruminations on the origins of our species.","7"
"kenhe","A thoughtful prequel","7 July 2013","This was at least as good as Alien and it was visually more compelling. The story line was obvious to anyone who had seen Alien and all the more enjoyable because of it's predictability. Every generation should have it's own version of Alien, and I feel that this version was perfectly suited to the present generation. This film had really excellent CGI and it attempted, largely successfully in my opinion, to put the human experience into a specific perspective. That is to say, where did we originate and what might be the consequences of our trying to find out. Ridley Scott managed to include a religious perspective effectively without becoming mawkish or overbearing. This film was easy to watch, exciting, and sufficiently suspenseful to keep my attention.","9"
"jt6626","The perfect Ridley Scott movie, executed far from perfectly","9 February 2015","Based on Ridley Scott's directing repertoire (and dodgy success thereof), it was impossible to predict how this movie would turn out. The premise, however, seemed like Scott's most creative since Blade runner. Of course, I then wanted this movie to be Scott's best since Blade Runner, but that just set myself up for disappointment.

Its many flaws aside, the premise (and most of the story) of Prometheus are brilliantly and profoundly creative. Upon first viewing, the story may just appear like a series of arbitrary and poorly explained scenes, but it's far more meaningful. There are subtleties throughout that transcend the seemingly aimless plot Once you catch them, its delightfully spine-chilling. Unfortunately, the plot is weakened some by the characters' demeanors. Initially, the main characters have some stereotypical identity imposed upon them by a fairly mediocre script. Then, throughout the movie, these characters inexplicably and utterly defy the disposition originally associated with their character. Much of this character dissonance is just stupid and corny, akin to the stereotypical ""investigation of the scary noise in a dark forest"" slasher film mentality. I've researched this largely disappointing element of the film and have come up empty handed - assuring its nature as a flaw, rather than symbolic deliberateness.

Poor acting accompanies the poor scripting. Apart from Michael Fassbender (maybe), the performances were altogether disappointing. I really wanted this movie to be a sci-fi masterpiece, and it was - executed horrendously. The story I will forever defend as intelligent and original, but the poor characters and script spoil the experience. The film resultantly blurs the line between creative ambiguity and pointlessness.","6"

Ridley Scott has pulled off a genius movie it has everything, action, mystery, horror, suspense and of course a unbelievable plot line that keeps the guessing game going and going.

By the end of this movie i couldn't help thinking i had come across a puzzle, some of the characters actions were questionable, when you leave a cinema asking your friends why did he or she do this, you know there is more to come.

"kdnor2011","Personally, I enjoyed it a lot.","22 September 2012","This movie seems to be getting pretty mixed fan response. People who like it either like it or love it, but it seems that most people on the negative side, HATE it. Now after Skyline, we went all the way through 2011 with like two really good alien movies. The two alien movie we got this year (John Carter and Battleship) were only OK, so I wanted a really good alien movie again. That's all I wanted, and you know what, I got one. Kinda.

I won't spoile anything, or at least won't do it intentionally. But the big problem is that this film is much better in story and visuals than it is with characters. There are some good characters, but for the most part they were extremely forgettable. It seems to leave way too much open to just audience interpritation. Basically the writer just did something and made us figure out how the hell it works a few too many times. It doesn't focus on the alien as much as I would hope, and the alien itself, well it's a little disappointing.

But the best part about this movie are the visuals. They are amazing, just the massive scope is enough to make it through the film. And a few effects even made me go, ""how the hell did they do that?"" The acting is good all around, especially Micheal Fassbender as David, for like half the movie I completely forgot he was a robot. There are some interesting twists, the plot isn't anything too complex, but face it guys, neither were Alien or Aliens. The last scene actually is quite surprising, and it makes sense. Some may complain about it, but personally I found it to be cool. And it's just fun, it's got good suspense, good action, and good atmosphere.

It isn't quite as good as Alien or Aliens, but watching it made me realize how much I liked those movies. The atmosphere, action, and visuals. Don't give me any bulls**t that they had deep plots, they were a haunted house in space and a shoot em up. Prometheus may not be perfect, but it's a damn fun time, with creepy scenes, great visuals, a basic but well done story, and some damn great performances.","8"

"BillK","Are all prequels to franchise films fundamentally doomed?","9 June 2012","Prequels to films with fully-detailed ecosystems can play out like a grocery list of payoffs and 'tribute' scenes. Prometheus has that challenge. Sir Ridley Scott came from the world of commercials where the stereotypes must reveal/explain and play themselves out quickly. So we have all the Alien ""hooks"" in place and plenty of sci fi genre hooks (Star Trek, Star Wars, Indiana Jones) all blended into a script that sometimes -- because of these hooks -- distracts rather than enthralls.

Yes, there has to be a corporate expedition, and a diverse crew and crew conflicts and an amoral robot and slimy creatures. Check, check and check. But where is the growing sense of dread that worked so well in Alien? Granted, this is -- by necessity -- derivative stuff. But I watched Prometheus from a distance. Never with the sense of intimate menace that Alien so brilliantly exploited.

There is one situation that is so preposterous and distracting that it took me right out of the film -- and I was barely in it, anyway. The best science fiction puts you into the world you are observing and uses that to give you new perspectives. Prometheus was at times a bit like a thing wriggling in a test tube. Fascinating, but safely removed and not really threatening.

I also think the film will improve with further viewings as you deconstruct some of the imagery and ideas. It's not your archetypal Hollywood science fiction action movie clearly Ridley Scott is not going to do that kind of movie, 3 science fiction films in a 30 year career needs to be understood. His methodology to this genre is a measured and thoughtful one. And that is a good thing and so is Prometheus. Is the film perfect, no. But it strives to bring something more ethereal and thought provoking to the screen and Scott should be commended for that.","9"
"dmhughes-448-695102","Finally, The Alien Franchise Is Reborn! Thank You Mr. Scott!","15 August 2012","It's been a long time since the Alien franchise has had a hit. The first two films are masterpieces of science fiction and cinema in general. Alien 3, the directorial debut of David Fincher, was slammed by fans and critics in 1992, but it was a box office hit. After the 2003 Director's Cut was released, a lot more people began to appreciate it, and I view it as a great horror/survival film that mixes the first two Alien films together in a darker, more serious tone. Then we got the really weird Alien Resurrection in 1997, a film that was penned by Joss Whedon and directed by Jean-Pierre Jeunet. Unfortunately, it was pretty mediocre. The story wasn't that intriguing, the characters were there pretty much only to die, and can we not forget that disgusting Alien-Human Hybrid thing? Then we got the crossover films Alien Vs. Predator and AVP Requiem. They're so bad, I won't even talk about them. Then we got word that Ridley Scott, the director of Alien in 1979, was directing a new prequel to his original film. We got hyped, and when we saw the trailers; wow, it was incredible. This film does not disappoint.

The film takes place in 2093 (30 years before Alien), where two archeologists, Elizabeth Shaw and Charlie Holloway (Naomi Rapace and Logan Marshall-Green) are leading an expedition on the Weyland Corporation-owned spaceship Prometheus. It's captained by Merideth Vickers (a fantastic Charlize Theron) and Janek (an excellent Idris Elba), and has a total of 17 people (most you will never know). Also on the ship is an android named David, played by Michael Fassbender, who I believe deserves an Oscar nomination. He was hands down the best actor in the film. The ship is headed for a planet called LV-223 after Shaw and Holloway discovered a star map in ancient human ruins dating back tens of thousands of years. They are now in search of the ""Engineers"" (Space Jockeys if you're an older Alien fan), the humanoid alien beings who created humans on Earth.

The crew of Prometheus land on LV-223 and find an ancient structure built by the Engineers. They go inside and discover a chamber holding vase-like objects that secret a black liquid. This liquid actually triggers massive alien growth in different animals. Small worms become slimy snake-like creatures, and humans can be turned into alien zombie-like creatures. David the Android even infects Holloway with the liquid, and this eventually leads to Shaw getting pregnant, and then getting an alien abortion (it's not a xenomorph, more like a squid creature). All hell breaks lose, and the crew start dying like flies. I won't spoil anything else, but the film introduces a new character towards the end, and the last two minutes of the film were designed specifically for Alien fans! Let's just say I got up and cheered!

Now, as you know, I said LV-223, not LV-426 from the first Alien films. Yes, that's right. Ridley Scott decided to make this a prequel, but a prequel that only gives us more questions than answers, in preparation for a sequel. A lot of people walked out of the theater feeling disappointed, but I actually enjoyed myself. I can't wait to see what else this series has to offer. This film is dark, gross, and scary, but it's a beautifully crafted work of science fiction. My only complaint: Damon Lindelof as the screenwriter. This guy wrote Lost, and Cowboys & Aliens, and he throws in a lot of curveballs in the story, but you can see them from a mile away. Also, some of the dialog in this film is pretty bad. I can only hope they get a different screenwriter next time. However, this is a great film that I loved, and is easily one of the best films of 2012! It's good to have you back Sir Ridley Scott! Let's hope you can make an even better sequel!

Final Verdict: 9/10","9"
"sandeepoke","Does not live up to high expectations","10 June 2012","I went to watch Prometheus with a lot of expectation. The prospect of watching Ridley Scott's latest that too in Imax and 3d was riveting in itself. The movie was disappointing in many respects. I wanted to watch Prometheus in spite of all the negative feedback it got hammered with because of Scott's reputation as a storyteller. What I got in the bargain was a movie which begins with an interesting premise but goes nowhere. The motives of some of the characters were not fleshed out. Why did David, the android put the black gooey stuff in the drink which he made for Dr. Holloway? If David is indeed an android and beyond human emotions why did he feel the urge to warn Dr. Elizabeth of impending danger at the climax and why does he convince her to rescue him? What is Charlize Theron's agenda? The captain of the ship is shown heroic but also has a high libido and has no qualms in proposing to lay his boss's daughter. There is an engineer, a geologist but again their purpose of being included on the mission remains clouded. They appear goofy at best with no semblance of intelligence. The geologist says, ""I love rocks"". The movie pretends to be serious but turns out to be nothing but a good vs. evil drama. All this talk of ""where we come from"", ""who created us"", ""what is our purpose"" remain unanswered, as they should be. Scott seems to have slipped big time in trying to make a magnum opus. Admittedly the movie has stunning visuals and has some compelling on screen events like the machine operating on Dr. Elizabeth or the holographic galaxy forming in the cave But the movie lacks content. Scott keeps the back door open with the promise of a sequel. I shudder at the thought. I barely managed to stay awake in this 2 hour 'saga'.","3"
"action-man101","It's Alien, Jim but not as we know it.","9 June 2012","Ridley Scott's Alien-prequel is like a Christmas present sitting under a tree. Attractively wrapped it promises to be the present you always wanted. But come Christmas morning as you begin to unwrap it, it quickly dawns on you that you haven't received the Playstation 3 you always wanted. Sure the box says it's a Playstation but once you open it, it turns out it's another knitted jumper from Grandma. As any fan of Alien will tell you, Prometheus concerns the large humanoid, or ""Space Jockey"" seen at the beginning of that film. Ever since that memorable scene fans have wondered what it was and why it was there. Well, after watching Prometheus they're still wondering. This film probably sounded better when the producers discussed it around the production table. Sadly the end result simply doesn't work. There are too many needless characters, too much bad dialogue and not nearly enough thrills or suspense that Alien and Aliens gave us in spades. Poorly written, this mishmash of ideas turns out to be a sheep in wolf's clothing. The premise (I hesitate to use the word plot as there isn't really one) concerns an expedition to a faraway world to discover the possible origins of mankind. When our explorers reach the planet of LV-223 (not LV-426 featured in Alien and revisited in Aliens) they discover several large structures in a barren wasteland. It soon becomes apparent that the giant humanoids were our ancestors (surprise surprise) and the large structures are in fact alien vessels - the doughnut shaped ship from Alien being one of them. Our intrepid explorers find out they these humanoids were wiped out by some kind of biological weapon that they created and wished to destroy the Earth with. Soon things go down the tubes and, just like in Alien, there is only one female survivor. Why the giant humanoids were planning our destruction is not explained - though we can speculate, nor is the nature of the biological weapon, which appears to be a forerunner of the alien creature. In fact several things are not explained at all and all this does is leave you with a sense of disappointment. In fact it's no better or worse than the laughable Alien v Predator films. Michael Fassbender is amusing as an effeminate robot and Charlize Theron looks smoking hot as the ice-cool corporate suit from Weyland Industres. You'd be better of watching Stargate.","4"
"vesajarv","High hopes, big disappointment","1 June 2012","Warning: this review is full of spoilers.

First of all I'm a big fan of Ridley Scott and especially the Alien Anthology.. Whatever, I'll just cut the crap and get into the good and bad:

The Good:

First 60 minutes of the movie was mostly awesome and got me really pumped up and excited. At that point I really thought Ridley pulled it off.


Beautiful visuals, opening scene was breathtaking!


The ""engineers"". Good stuff, well done original characters.


The Bad:

Last 60 minutes. The story and the characters just fell apart. Short and simple: the story and the characters were not believable.


Main characters. I didn't feel any connection or empathy with the characters. Worst of all was the yoga (old guy), simply ridiculous. I could not help but laugh whenever he was in a scene. Also David must be the worst robot/cyborg in movie history.


Poorly executed scenes. Example: C-Section. Come on Ridley, this was ridiculous.


The end. Main character (Elizabeth) 'demands' the captain to crash into the alien ship. The crew is OK with suicide, no problem... Then later she flies away with another alien ship that is surely carrying ""death"" on board. Ridiculous. When she walked back to David I thought she was going to smash his head or something to prevent anything leaving the planet, but no.


This movie is full of clichés. ""I'm not here to make friends"", everything about the captain etc... I really thought Ridley would come up with something original instead.


Small things that make no sense. Example in the end Fifield sitting in a ridiculous position outside the ship before going bananas. Was this meant to be scary? Also just before Prometheus crashing into the alien ship you see the captain in front of a $5 shaky plastic control panel. Did they run out of money?


Directing, acting etc... Im too tilted to comment on these. In the bottom line if you like old classics by Ridley, don't have high hopes for Prometheus. I don't want to totally destroy the Alien saga, so I wont go and see the follow-up for this (there is more to come). Ridey is doing to Alien what Lucas did to Star Wars.

And anyone claiming this isn't a Alien movie is wrong. It's a prequel plain and simple.

Now to get totally wasted.","4"
"Sablicious","The irrumation of sci-fi cinema.","11 June 2012","Prometheus goes wrong (often abjectly) on so many levels, one almost feels compelled to extol Scott on the success of, what seems like, his way of raising a middle finger to the audience. The problem is, the director's latest foray into the Alien universe is almost certainly an earnest exercise.

From dialogue to casting. From inexplicably irrational character motivations to movie monsters a 10-year-old looks to have conceived. From preschool philosophy ham - fistedly spoon fed to the viewer, to a mine field of plot holes that render the entire story an incoherent mess. Prometheus is such a confluence of poor film -making elements, it is difficult, if not impossible, to find a substantive redeeming aspect to predicate praise upon.

Corralled by a script that looks written on toilet paper (in a single sitting) - and under the extreme adversity that was this lesson in 'How Not To 101' in film -making - Fassbender's performance is admirable. The special effects and CG renders are serviceable, to very nice in parts. (Though, this is not Avatar -level avant garde, technically.) The ""international"" trailer was masterfully paced and harked back to thought -provoking cinema not witnessed in this genre since The Matrix. At the same time, the trailers spoil pretty much the entire film; as are the promotional tools' wont, of late.

Other than the aforementioned superficial (backhanded?) plaudits, it is at a dire risk to one's integrity to endorse anything else Prometheus has to offer. The film is the veritable quintessence of dumbed down sci-fi; pandering to Generation Dope by repeatedly and unashamedly stooping to the most insultingly clichéd filmic tropes.

There is little-to-nothing here for the epicurean viewer. Fans (not fanboys) of Scott's more laudable past works will be gravely disappointed. Only the video game -reared, tween demographic will feel they derived a worthwhile two hours of entertainment from Prometheus. A sad indictment, indeed.

Verdict: Based on a seminal sci-fi license, a film that promised existential depth and exposition, delivered nothing short of HD diarrhoea. 3/10","3"
"saadgkhan","Its a Sci-fi Adventure not Sci-fi Horror (Don't get confuse)","1 October 2012","Prometheus – CATCH IT (A-) Prometheus is one of the most anticipated movies of 2011. Prequel/sequel speculation has been started from years since Ridley Scott showed interest in directing a sci-fi adventure. Prometheus is about a team of explorers discover a clue to the origins of mankind on Earth, leading them on a journey to the darkest corners of the universe. There, they must fight a terrifying battle to save the future of the human race. After viewing Prometheus I realize that it's a sci-fi adventure movie not a sci-fi horror like Aliens. Ridley Scott took us back into that world but this time with completely different agenda. This time the explorer went to space to find the source to humankind in simple words they went to find GOD. Prometheus is one of those movies which doesn't answer any questions and leave all questions unanswered in the end. Sadly there are not answers in the movie either like Memento or any other confusing movie you would recall. The production value, CGI and cast are simply fantastic in Prometheus. While watching Prometheus even though you don't get any answers to what's happening and where they are exactly. You still enjoy the movie because of strong set up and performances. I would defiantly agree that the story was very bleak and incomplete. And I wished they worked hard on the story and on the purpose of what they are trying to sell us. Noomi Rapace got worldwide recognition for her stunning portrayal of Lisbeth Slander in ""The Girl with a Dragon Tattoo"" trilogy. Breaking off of that strong image is a hard task and Noomi Rapace is trying her best. She was good in Sherlock Holmes 2 but her character didn't have any importance in the movie. This time she gets to shine and no one can deny from the fact that she stand on her own and the dissection scenes are extremely powerful. (Though I don't understand where everybody was when she was running in pain to Charlize Theron's room for dissection of her stomach?). Michael Fassbender is simply outstanding. He is such a raw talent and Hollywood is lucky to have such an amazing talent who does everything with perfection. Charlize Theron as the woman trying hard to find the answer to her mission millions miles away from earth is amazing. This is undoubtedly her year as Evil Queen in ""Snow White and the Huntsman:"" and now in ""Prometheus"" she is simply amazing. Logan Marshall-Green has a structure to be anything, he is just amazing looking man. If a good script provided he can do wonders with it. Guy Pierce, Idris Elba and Sean Harris are good in their respective parts. Overall, Prometheus fails to answer any questions but it's the whole set up that intrigues you and even though you may feel little irritated in the end just like me you can wait for its sequel.","8"
"petarmatic","I liked it!","19 November 2013","I watched this film with my two boys and their friend. While my two beautiful boys loved it and enjoyed it, their friend was really scared. I did not think that new generation can be scared by these types of movies, but they can. So I was scared 30 or so years back when I watched the original Alien, so there are new scares for the next generation.

I hear there is second part in the offing. Well it deserves to be. This film kept me glood to the screen so I hope that number two will as well. From the times of first Alien to this one we have a range of good and bad sci fi films, this one is very good. I am looking forward for number two.","7"
"dany4k","Great addiction to the Alien franchise.","11 May 2021","Overall a great movie.

Great addiction to the Alien universe that gives us some background to for a better understanding the first movie released (Alien 1978).

The sci-fi and the scenery are really good, most of the characters are not that memorable but Michael Fassbender saves the day with an amazing performance as David. Prometheus also introduces a new ""type"" of Alien and in the end, by combining an engineer with some sort of octopus that was left forgotten inside the clinic. The scene that leads to this encounter is also really good, where we can finally see the engineer struggling in a fight.

In the end, the movie is pretty entertaining, and adds a lot of lore to the franchise. Definitely recommend for every Sci-fi fan!","8"
"Screen_Blitz","Visually captivating and riveting with thoughtful ambition, Prometheus is a triumphant science-fiction endeavor","26 May 2017","The Alien franchise boasted a promising start in 1979 when the first film was debuted by Ridley Scott. But that promise only seemed to move just a few step forward when James Cameron came into the picture to unleash the powerful follow-up in 1986. Since then, the once mighty sci-fi/horror franchise seems to have fallen in the ruts with a series of unappetizing sequels. Ridley Scott however, makes a triumphant return to the franchise with this quasi-prequel to the original film, delivering a visually striking and intellectually rich origin story of the franchise's chronology. Drifting away from familiar elements and venturing into fresh new territory, Scott serves the mastermind behind science-fiction thriller; tackling on thoughtful ideas including creationism and evolution of human life, while operating on a gripping narrative scope. Set in 2093, this film follows a crew of scientists aboard a spaceship known as Prometheus, who set out to a distant planet to discover artifacts that will open doors to the discover of the origins of mankind. Consisting of Captain Janek (played by Idris Alba), archaeologist Elizabeth Shaw (played by Noomi Repace), human-like android David (played by Michael Fassbender), Shaw's love interest Charlie Holloway (played by Logan-Marshall Green), and corporate CEO Peter Weyland (played by Guy Pearce), the crew conducted by mission commander Meredith Vickers (played by Charlize Theron) soon make a sinister to threatens the lives of not only themselves but all the human race.

The film does not come without its problems, particularly when examining the script by Jon Spaihts and Damon Lindelof. But arguably the bigger flaw plaguing the thrilling experience is the film concluding with more unanswered questions than desired. There are some significant moments that are bound to leave viewers scratching their heads, hungry of explanations. Nevertheless, Ridley Scott makes an effective comeback to the franchise by not only introducing a new route but also experimenting with much more intellectual ideas than what we were used to in the past. As this is a Ridley Scott picture, the film shines with a gorgeous visual style from the interior of the spaceship Prometheus, to the nifty production design of otherworldly planet. Shall I mention the costume designs worn by the crew? The plot on the other hand, marks the film's biggest strength along with its biggest weakness. Focusing on a story premature to the franchise's familiar timeline, the primary concern here is a team of scientists venturing to an another world to discovering the foundation of the human race, unaware of the ugly forces that await them. This concept open doors to some thought- provoking discussions of creationism and evolution, with the characters tackling on the perplexing philosophy of extraterrestrial being the founders of mankind as opposed to the idea of creationism which is widely favored by the Christian community. Sure, it is a concept that God believers are likely to take offense. Nonetheless, it is hard to argue the ambition behind the story's intellectual heft. Beneath it all, there are some scary and even gory moments sprinkled throughout the pictured. One of which involves a surgical precedure that can be tough to watch if you developed a weak stomach for the chest-bursting scene in 'Alien'.

Surround the slickly paced and alluring atmosphere is an all-star cast who all manage to bring their A-game in their roles. Acquiring the most screen time in the predictably large cast is Noomi Repace. Like many of Ridley Scott's films, there is always room for a strong female character. Playing Elizabeth Shaw, an archaeologist who happens to be a believer in God and is skeptical about the whole mind-boggling idea of aliens being mankind's birthgiver, Repace absorbs the role with a great amount of fortitude and humanity. If there is anything she earns that the nearly the rest of the cast doesn't, it is a more powerful character development. While her character never levels up beyond a two-dimensional state, she manages to stand out among the crowd of the underdeveloped figures. Idris Alba, the captain of the crew, makes good use of his role. Charlize Theron, playing mission commander Meredith Vickers, boasts a fair amount of compulsion. Guy Pearce and Logan-Marshall Green are fine, but nothing that leaves a strong impact. Michael Fassbender on the other hand, delivers an incredible portrayal as David, the android. His stoic delivery including his facial expression firmly match the robotic nature of his underwritten character.

Prometheus is a visually captivating sci-fi endeavor, riveting with thoughtful concepts and an ambitious direction by visionary Ridley Scott. And most importantly, it stands as an applauding return for the blemished Alien franchise. While the film excels on both a narrative and visual scope along with serving as an admirable relative to the Alien films, it is critical for moviegoers who are expecting a carbon copy of the previous entries to go in low expectations to avoid sheer disappointment.","8"
"dragon_x","Not like any OTHER Alien movie ...","10 June 2012","This movie has a lot of similarities to other Alien movies, but this is only skin deep... The movie mostly takes places on an alien moon, orbiting planet, LV-223 (not the one from Alien/Aliens) and their ship is pretty cool and the crew has just awaken from about 4 years of hibernation, during the trip from Earth.

The story is tight and the script is spare, so make sure to pay attention to everything, because it always means something. Many things are setup so you can guess what is going to happen, but this is not a bad thing, because the WHY is so much more interesting ...

There are no wasted moments in the movie. There may have been one or two wasted opportunities - though that remains to be seen (sequel).

Some people complain that the crew was immature or did not follow careful/smart procedures (protocols) during the visit to the alien moon, however they also miss the big point and the twist in the story, but I wont reveal it. You may guess it, but I did not even guess this - though I did guess a lot (which is probably intentional by the director), but again the WHY is so much more fun ... or even cerebral.

I also avoided every promo and trailer after the second trailer - and I did not see those for at least one month. Some movies it best going into knowing as little as possible.

The actor playing David was excellent... most of the special and CGI effects were excellent. When I say the CGI and sets were excellent I mean that they only added to the film - they were not a distraction. The 3D was only OK and unfortunately the theater we were at could not reproduce all the sounds accurately (usually the theater is fine, but I guess that is mostly for Michael Bay type explosions, not this movie).

Most of the cast was pretty good - there is little in depth character development, but there is just enough to figure out what is going on ... after you talked about the movie for some time - with people who PAID ATTENTION :) I do wish some things where changed - some of the deaths were not very 'heroic' or even 'epic' though some may have been epicly 'lame'. Again the character development could have used maybe 10 or 15 minutes more - maybe just some ""fun"" scenes were we get to know, like or hate or whatever some of the characters.

This is not your father's Alien, this is not Alien vs. Jesus, this is not even Aliens, but it is very good in its own right, maybe even better.

I would also expect to have one more prequel movie before the ""proper"" Alien (original) one takes place.","8"
"ketgup83","Just enjoy the highly entertained film with fantabulous special effects , visually appealing graphics and good performances.","12 June 2012","Highly anticipated Prometheus finally arrives which is a dark, keeps- you-on-the-edge sci-fi thriller , was almost there but could not satisfy on the overall due to the unsatisfying climax.

A group of explorers and scientist discovers a clue to the origin of mankind on earth. To find the hidden truth , they embark on a long journey at a distant planet's moon. However , things turn topsy-turvey as they discover more things than just finding the clue and must fight to survive till the end.

Before reading the review , statuary warning :- Don't expect an alien movie here. True , it is a prequel to Alien (1985) but this flick is more of the actual story leading to evolution of mankind. Legendry director Ridley Scott goes back to his roots and delivers a knock-out direction. However , few people will be definitely disappointed with the ending same as me who strives for more satisfactory climax. I just came back after watching it in 2D and I must say I would love to see it once again probably to understand it better. But I was blown away by visual treat the film has given to the audience. The eye-catching cinematography , gorgeous sets , amazing art –direction and superb visual effects make the film worth watching more than once. Coming back to review , the film is entertaining from the start till the end and you would not feel bored even a second. The screenplay is crispy and tight that you will be completely involved in the film the moment you enter the theater. I have been an ardent fan of Scott's earlier work ( Gladiator , Black Hawk Down) and this one is no exception. He has done full justice to the script . However , it is the climax which has bothered me and I kept saying to myself if only something could have happened in the end ( or probably I was expecting much more out of it ). The film boast huge star cast but it is Noomi Rapace and Michael Fassbender who steals the show with their convincing performance.

So , on an overall basis , a highly entertained film with fantabulous special effects , visually appealing graphics and good performances. Good 3.5 /5","8"
"InaneSwine","Gorgeous, intelligent and skilfully made","3 December 2017","Prometheus is a gorgeous, intelligent and skilfully made film that stays true to its origins. There are times where the pace lags behind, and perhaps it delves too deep into its own themes and ideas that simply can't be fully explored or appreciated within its running time. But with dazzling visuals, well rounded and well performed characters and a sort-of open non-ending, it's simply begging for a sequel. And so am I.","8"
"Luv2Spooge","A very powerful revival of the franchise","25 September 2022","I thought I already reviewed this, but apparently not. Prometheus is probably my 2nd favorite of the franchise right behind Aliens. First, this film is beautifully made, the camera work, the music, is just shear captivating. This would carry on to the sequel in Covenant.

However, what I really like about this film is some of the deeper thematic allegories. Scott is a very open sci-fi agnostic and he lets his ideas flow into this film quite openly. The theatrical version left out most of the straight references, leaving clues for the audience to piece together.

Basically in a nutshell from the uncut version, these ""Engineers"" created humans long ago. However, with the way humans were with sin and selfishness, they sent a hybrid 2000 years ago to teach them to be selfless. From the opening scene, you can see that an engineer sacrificed himself to create life. This hybrid is Christ and the people murdered him. This sets off the premise of this film, why the engineer was so set on destroying Earth.

Now while that itself is just entertainment and cool idea, but it create a bigger deeper theme of questioning our origin, our sin, and the ever lasting struggle of humanity to replace God. This again was repeated in the opening theme of Covenant. And in Covenant, it was revealed mankind's desire for immortality ultimately led to its destruction by the creation of David, a psychopathic android. Remember the conversation Between David and Walter? David was created ""too much"" like human, including sin and he took that and gone pro from his faster evolution and self-awareness due to this computer brain.

Many are confused by the scene when they confronted the engineer. Imagine the engineer as ""God"" Himself, not just the shear power of God but the righteousness and goodness. Remember Simon Peter on the boat? When he realized it was Christ, he bowed in fear b/c He was so perfect and Peter was sinful?

That scene is the reflection of that passage with Simon Peter. In the presence of God, these humans were arrogant and violent. The look on the engineer's face said it all as he held David's face, a very sad disappointment in humanity. An engineer sacrifices himself to create life, and here Waylen created life through mechanical means to reflect himself rather than the sacrifice of being a father, remember Waylen did have a daughter but treats her not like his own. David was an abomination to the engineer.

This is why the engineer smacked them around and was ever more determined to destroy Earth. The black goo is not evil per say, as the engineers used it to create life. It amplifies and mutate from the being it touches, so from a selfless engineer it sprouts life, but from corrupted humans it creates an evil creature.

Very deep and well thought out. 10/10.","10"
"Chris_Pandolfi","Mankind's Search for Truth and Meaning","8 June 2012","Fundamentally, Ridley Scott's ""Prometheus"" is about the search for truth and meaning. Under the guise of a 3D science fiction thriller, it begs most of humanity's most basic spiritual and/or philosophical questions. Why are we here? Were we created, and if so, by who or what? Is there a purpose to our very being? The film does not presume to answer all of the above, although it does leave us with the strong possibility that such truths are not only out there but can be found. It's no coincidence that the film's title is also the name of the immortal Greek titan that sculpted mankind into existence from clay. He also enabled mankind's progress by giving them the fire he stole from the gods; he championed us to such an extent that he would ultimately be punished for it, condemned by Zeus to endure an eternity of having his liver pecked out by an eagle.

Most potential audiences cannot be expected to see this film from a more introspective angle. It will be regarded primarily as the semi-prequel to Scott's own 1979 film ""Alien,"" a great horror film in its own right but obviously devoid of any spiritual subtexts. Keen observers should be able to spot all of the references, from the overt inclusions of the ""space jockey"" and the crescent-shaped alien spacecraft to the subtler throwbacks in characterization, production design, and tone. I personally pride myself on having caught an instance in which a section of music from Jerry Goldsmith's ""Alien"" score was mixed into the soundtrack. Those seeking any obvious inclusion of the now well-known alien creatures are likely to be disappointed, not because the film lacks close encounters with extraterrestrials but because they introduce themselves through a deliberate and somewhat confusing process of evolution.

The story proper begins in the year 2089 when, on an archaeological expedition on an isle off the coast of Scotland, scientist couple Elizabeth Shaw (Noomi Rapace) and Charlie Holloway (Logan Marshall-Green) discover a cave with a painting of a star map. This is but one of many star maps found around the world, which is unusual given the fact that the sites on which they were found belonged to ancient cultures separated by time and distance. Shaw, without a doubt a believer in a higher power, interprets these findings as an invitation from humanity's outer space forerunners, dubbed the Engineers. Quite simply, it's a chance to learn who we are and where we came from. Four years later, a privately funded interstellar expedition aboard the starship ""Prometheus"" arrives at the only logical location outlined in the star maps: A moon in a very distant part of the galaxy.

The crew consists of your usual grab-bag of mechanical and scientific experts, including Shaw and Holloway. Of particular interest are two characters. One is David (Michael Fassbender), an android; while initially no more than a machine, unclouded by emotions or morality, his mechanically superior ability to process and learn gradually gives him something of a superiority complex towards the human passengers. The other is Meredith Vickers (Charlize Theron). She has been sent by the company funding the expedition, the Weyland Corporation, to monitor the crew. Level-headed yet elusive and controlling, we spend most of the film trying to determine what her hidden agenda is. Perhaps it has something to do with a holographic projection of the company's long-gone founder, the deeply wizened Peter Weyland (Guy Pearce).

After landing on the moon, Shaw and her team soon uncover a sprawling network of underground caves and corridors, which inexplicably produce an atmosphere capable of sustaining human life. Their expedition reveals the remains of an Engineer's head, along with a vast subterranean cavern well-stocked with cylinder-like urns. Upon their discovery, the urns begin to leak a strange black goo. David is the first to discover this. As he secretly stashes an urn on the ship and conducts an experiment, Shaw is thrilled to learn that the Engineers' DNA is identical to a human's. But then begins a biological epidemic begins to infect the crew; it reaches such a degree that Shaw is forced to conclude that she was wrong about the Engineers' intentions.

The original ""Alien"" achieved a shocking visceral thrill with the infamous chestburster sequence, a turn of events that audiences at that time could not have foreseen. ""Prometheus"" attempts to outdo its predecessor with its own disturbing birth scene, one that kick starts an unstoppable evolutionary process. As to whether or not it's successful, that's entirely a matter of personal opinion. I admittedly had a difficult time navigating the story's biological path of destruction, as I found the link between organism and host convoluted. My response to the less tangible spiritual aspects was much better. ""Prometheus"" is at its best when it speculates on the unknown. Like Shaw, many of us have chosen to believe in something greater than ourselves. Unlike Shaw, we tend to leave it at that. She's not content with mere blind faith. She will always be searching.

"dmode71","Cynical cash in - don't waste your money","8 June 2012","SPOILERS AHEAD!! Prometheus is not, repeat not an Alien movie. If you go into the cinema expecting one you will be sorely disappointed.

As an entry into the Alien franchise, which lets fact it we all wanted, its a wasted opportunity and very disappointing. The worst thing about this mess is the incoherent and frankly dumb story and screenplay.

It all starts so well. Some stunning vistas which look like they could have come from a National Geographic documentary and the images of the lone humanoid all promise something special. Unfortunately the film just does not deliver on any level which is crushing.

Cinematically it's stunning, that much the director gets right. He knows good cinematography, you just have to look at his body of work to see that. The casting is a mixed bag. Michael Fassbender is great as David. Charlize Theron does a great job as the Weyland heavy and comes across as the icy bitch she's supposed to be. An unrecognisable Guy Pearce is wasted as Weyland thanks to some very unconvincing prosthetics. It would have been so much easier and better for the film if they'd used an old actor instead. Ultimately it looks like Guy Pearce in bad make-up. The rest of the cast that fill out the remaining crew are largely forgettable, due in part to the bare bones material their characters are given. As most of them aren't given much to do, when the inevitable deaths start occurring you don't really care enough about them. In fact in one particularly messy scene its hard to figure out who's been killed anyway. They are largely just cannon fodder not at all like the fleshed out characters of the previous films. When they bought it, you cared, that just doesn't apply here.

For me the film struggles with its own identity. I starts out with philosophical overtones, then moves into more familiar exploratory sci-fi territory, then shifts gear again around the half way mark but it just doesn't gel together.

I read several reviews about how scary and gross some of the scenes were, especially the medpod sequence but honestly, i've seen more scary and graphic x-files episodes than anything on offer here. There is nothing remotely scary about this film. Some of the scenes are laugh out loud funny. There are times when the tension is ramped up and lets face it the first film was a master-class at building up tension to breaking point. Unfortunately the film just does not deliver on that or many other counts. The egg chamber sequence with actor 1 and 2 (I have no idea who they were) who are left behind is so contrived and obvious i'm not sure whether it was put there as a joke. Certainly the guy attempting to hug the snake-alien was pretty damn ridiculous.

Considering how much this is supposedly not an Alien film, there are scenes that could have been ripped out of any of the previous films and in certain scenes this is practically rammed down our throats (no pun intended). The medpod sequence could have been way way better, but just ended up being another damp squib for me. In fact it reminded me of the grab claws you get at a penny arcade - reach in grab the toy or in this case a fat grey featureless octopus that's about as menacing as a puppy.

It's not the only scene that just falls flat. Unfortunately.

The story has some interesting ideas. The origins of the 'space jockeys' or 'engineers' as they're known is handled pretty well but raises more questions than it answers which is the fault of the writers.

OK, in no particular order here are some of the brain farts the writers came up with.

The all powerful engineers decide that to wipe us out they're going to create a lethal black goo which presumably is going to infect the entire planet. How long would it take for the infected human race to tear each other to pieces? Obviously they're not to so advanced as to invented bombs/missiles/pointy sticks or some kind weapon that would have very easily done the same job a lot more efficiently.

The expedition to the unknown is manned by complete idiots with no logic, sense of self preservation or reasoning.

Quarantine procedures...anyone??!!! Lets carve up an alien head with an alien organism on it with no safety procedures whatsoever.

The Prometheus doesn't have any weapons of any kind and yet is travelling god knows where to confront god knows what.

Charlize Theron gets killed by a very large ship rolling onto her....no kidding.

We're supposed to believe that characters that have barely said 2 lines of dialogue are willing to blow themselves up cos Idris can't pilot the ship himself.

I could go on but honestly I can't be bothered. The most annoying thing for me about this film is Scotts insistence that this is not an Alien film - oh really.....let's think about that for a minute.

A large ship is sent to an unknown planet manned by civilians with strong female protagonists.

A sinister organisation involved has ulterior motives. An android onboard is a good/bad/good/bad...wtf guy who ends up decapitated but still able to talk and function. One of the protagonists ends up impregnated with an unknown organism. 'Birth' sequence involving said protagonist. The last 5 secs of the film - nuff said.

Any of this sound familiar??!!!! this film is as subtle as a sledgehammer to the nads.

Wtf Ridley Scott...at least be honest about your intentions....even the trailers were deliberately intended to draw in the poor unsuspecting public on false pretenses! Please please PLEASE do not make a Blade Runner sequel.","2"
"arkif1","The riddler","12 June 2012","People are saying that Scott has lost his ability to make good films apart from ""the craft"".

I understand the point, but Prometheus is a very good film in its own way.

Watching it is a little like being slapped in the face. You hope for all kinds of developments, but nothings happens and at the end you are forced to piece the information together that you've got.

It is enough information though.

At the core there's of course the clash of giant people and giant squids.

Well, what kind of metaphors are that? I think one gets the idea, systems are usually equated with octopuses and the like, whether it's tax revenue or something else.

Something else... something else... what might that be? Looks innocent at first, wrestles itself around your arm, if you resist it breaks it and at the end comes the beheading.

""Big things have small beginnings."" Says who? Where and when? And what answer does he get? So, I think it's a very good film after all. There's hardly talk about this clash elsewhere. Does humanity prevail or do we fall victim to systems that are stronger than ourselves? And don't complain. What's better to wake you up, than being slapped in the face?","9"
"silverkelt","Like many, could see potential, but scope and execution a problem.","2 April 2015","There is something distant with the movie, you can barely care about any of the characters, it was a disappointment on many levels.

Character development, plot line development are either shallow in concept or long in development, with little pay off for either.

Overall, the sum of its parts just seem a little disjointed to me. It was pretty clear to me, that they seem to be developing a multi- movie story arc of sorts, and left much to be desired to resolve this one.

That being said, its not the worse conceptual sci fi film I've seen, and CGI integration with human actors and overall thematic scenes are very nicely done.

Prometheus is a film that plays to the lowest common denominator. Every tiny piece of the film's plot is spelt out in painstaking detail for even the most dull of dullards. It's agonising. Even the 'twist' at the end reeks of making sure everyone gets it. Nothing is left to interpretation - there isn't an ounce of clever here.

With most sci-fi films, you're willing to suspend your disbelief to a degree, because it's enjoyable. However, there are two or three occasions watching this that throw you straight out of the world.

It's such a shame. Prometheus could have been really good, but I almost wanted to ask for my money back. Films should not be made for idiots, but for people who want to be absorbed in a story, in a world and left to make up their own mind about at least some aspects of the plot.

"davidtraversa-1","Visually Stunning.","21 September 2012","Awesome.

From the visual point of view, absolutely gorgeous, impeccable photography, magnificent backgrounds, great imagination for the vehicles, for the interiors and for the futuristic equipment. The works! The whole movie was done with impeccable taste --technically.

The use of scale to show the immensity of the planet compared with that bunch of tiny aliens (earthlings) blows the mind because of its impeccably manufactured realism, virtual or otherwise, being impossible to detect one or the other, ever.

The script makes no sense whatsoever, and scenes can drag a lot more often than desired talking pseudo-scientific blabber all the time, having the viewer bored and more interested in the pattern of the room wallpaper --my case, since I was watching this film at home-- than on the screen goings on.

Another puzzling point in the script is the intervention of religion in it, quite disconcerting when we are talking top scientists here, in the year 2095...

Charlize Theron is so beautiful, ultra-thin and super-elegant that one wonders how can she manage to look so super cool in that spaceship 24 hrs a day with no beauty parlor in view or boutique with designer clothes around to keep her so neat looking (no dry cleaners either or showers in view, although they take care of those details within the studio facilities I suppose!).

The rest of the ship crew is the constant usual that we have seen in this kind of films a thousand times before, we can even anticipate the dialogs they will speak, since those are always the same. The very first scene, with the braking up of the alien body reminded me of ""Altered States"" where they did the same special effects but, oh...! so many years ago!

The truly unpardonable scene is the very last one, that seems to have been conceived by the monster alien itself still mentally confused thanks to that shocking way of coming to life or a very inebriated director with too much money to spend and not knowing what to do with it.

"jcdslayer","Ridley drops the ball","10 June 2012","This movie only gets a 3 from me for most of the special effects but in all honesty, Ridley Scott dropped the ball on this movie. For being the father of the Alien franchise, he should have known better than this. I know this movie is supposed to be independent of the Alien franchise yet was suppose to tie in with it towards the end... it didn't.

Charlize Theron's boring, cold boss just didn't make any sense when she and the David character got confrontational with each other.

Speaking of David, his motivation throughout the movie was unclear. Everything he did only left more questions for me than answers. Like how the heck did he know what the goo would do to the Holloway character? And what exactly was happening to him?

What happened to the eggs that were seen in the original Alien movie? How'd they become these canisters of genetic goo that create these white snake things with acid blood and replaceable heads?

The ""pilot"" was dead in the driver's seat of the ship in the opening of Alien but at the end of this, he dies at the rescue ship of the humans. And the xeno that popped out at the end?? WTF??!!

"mayres1975","Oh how the mighty have fallen","2 June 2012","Script deserves 1 out of 100. There are so many holes in it that you could serve it up on a cracker, at least then it would be easier to digest.

The acting although great from some (Fassbender and Repace) was atrocious from others. The lack of emotion was sometimes laughable. It was very predictable in some parts and in others you were left thinking, how did that happen and for the sake of the film, why did that happen?

This was probably my most anticipated film ever, I couldn't wait and booked the opening day tickets weeks ago. Well, I wish I'd not bothered because the whole thing was a complete shambles.

I don't want to give anything away so wont go into details but this film is shockingly bad in many respects. At one point I was sat there going ""no don't say it, no"" but oh yes. The word ""father"" came out and more than a few sighs came out of the audience it was that obvious.

The main thing that bothered me was the script writing, it was overly complicated and got caught up in its own mess. Why they tried (and failed miserably) to answer the biggest question in humanity, is beyond me. Where did we come from? Sheesh. I'm going to be blunt now, the reason we all loved Alien and Aliens was because of their simplicity and in many respects believability. But with Prometheus there is soooooo much that is totally outside the realms of believability that your left thinking, ""she can't do that"" or ""why is know one shocked that a 2 thousand year old alien head is coming to life"" or ""where did these holograms come from"" or ""how did he know how to do that"" or ""I know what, 2 of our crew is stranded in an alien cave so we'll all ignore that and go and have sex"" wtf?

Irishman Fassbender was shockingly amazing in this Sci-Fi hit, he's definitely one to watch out for. Rapace also gave a rather spectacular performance.

Its definitely one of the most anticipated films in the last couple of decades and I'd say it has definitely met its expectations. A must watch for Sci-Fi lovers.

The film itself seemed to be hidden with secrets or easter eggs as such, and so is definitely a film I would advise buying once available on DVD and watching multiple times to gain full understanding to this fabulous prequel to such a cult series.

Since then, I always wondered... The fossilised being?, lounging on a half bed-half chair with a telescope attached - Where was the being from? Where was it going? Why was it carrying such an unstable, lethal cargo?

After watching Prometheus I have the answers to two of those questions, now I still have to wait to discover where the being, and man, was originally from - according to Ridley.

Prometheus is good (not great)with acceptable special effects, and Michael Fassbender (as David), is Prometheus's best actor & character, with a great line in the movie - ""I didn't think you had it in you"".

Where can I get a refund?","1"
"The-Social-Introvert","Huh?","24 August 2014","I caught a viewing of Prometheus the week it came out. Let me just start off by saying that I watched it in 3Dwhich was terrible. I'm not the world's biggest 3D fan but I even had to take off my glasses a couple of times to make sure I'd walked into the right screen; It made as near as no difference.

Being a hardcore fan of the first two Alien movies, I've followed the franchise from the classic 1979 horror to the disastrous non-canon AVP- R. When I heard that Alien 5 was being sniffed about in Hollywood, I was excited as hell. Sure, the latest string of cash-in sequels had been epic fails, but I was eager nonetheless. Then it was revealed that it would be a prequel, directed by none other than Ridley Scott himself, after which it was publicly announced that it wouldn't be a prequel (Awwwwww) but would still tie in with Alien (Yeeeaaaah).

Now I wasn't expecting a miracle. I mean, Scott isn't the same director as he was 20 years ago. And maybe all the flaws of Prometheus aren't his fault, but I was still left with a what-the-hell-just-happened kinda reaction after my first viewing. Note: After my first viewing.

It opens with a beautiful shot of Icelandic landscape, coupled with the Alien-trademark opening title sequence. Then a hooded Martian dude appears, proceeds to strip down, and sends his body decaying in all directions after having drunk something from small pot. I found the Martian's appearance hilarious, I have to say, and I doubt Scott intended that scene to be funny. Seriously though, it just seemed so random and weird. Plus, this Martian's race turns out to be the movie's antagonists, which contrasts with Alien's less-is-more rule when it comes to baddies. The Engineers may have been a bit more fearsome if our first sight of one wasn't an overly-hench naked one that splattered into a million pieces.

I think the best way I can do this review is by getting the flaws of the movie, both major and minor, out of the way. Plot holes, irritating scenes etc. So here goes.ahem hem

The dream sequence. David can watch people's dreams. Not only that, but these dreams cut continuously to different viewpoint angles. Hmmmm, it's as if it's all just a movie! Coincidently the crews' choice of landing just happens to be so close to the temple. Alien thumped realistic environmental measures and precautions that needed to be taken, such as the rocky landing. In this, it's far too soft and easy. Why on earth would the scientists remove their helmets? I mean, come one, the air isn't just made up of CO2 and oxygen. It's such a moronic scene and so utterly filled with clichés. A classic Hollywood science moment. Some of the crew, after a couple of years of flying, have no idea why they are there. I wouldn't exactly sign up for something that would take me over four years to complete if I didn't know what it was. Yeah, it can be seen as logical because maybe Peter Weyland wanted the crew to know as little as possible, but it's still annoying. As stated above the useless and random plot twist involving Guy Pearce with a lasagne face. Why did Weyland need to pretend he was dead? What advantage did this give him? One of the scientists decides to pet the mutated worm-snake-vagina thing. 3 TIMES! Its showing blatant signs of hostility and the guy decides to play with it! What an effin' retard! The crew go in search of lifeand return with a 2000 year old corpse head. Then Shaw and 'Igor' decide it would be useful to stimulate the head electrically to reanimate it. They don't say why. They give it a bit too much juice, then too little,then dither over too much or too little like a couple of schoolgirls fiddling with a dicky Bunsen burner, while the most important scientific discovery in human history waggles its ears and rolls its eyes – before eventually blowing up like a frog in a microwave. This scene is is in no way scary, suspenseful or creepy. Just amateurish, retarded, and comical. Why are the medical staff so damn careless with a possibly disease ridden and bacteria infested decapitated head anyway? They didn't even wear plastic gloves. What does this Black Goo do exactly? Accelerate worm growth? Infect crew members? Cause pregnancies? Create life? Pick one and stick to it please. Prometheus forces us to assume too many things, which takes away credibility form the movie and gives it a half-arsed feel. Like why the Engineer just wants to kill, kill, kill. ""HANDS UUUPPPP!!"" – The Titanic style death of the captain and the two henchmen. Utterly cringe worthy. And anyway, they were hardly aware of the situation, and only buttocks-bashed the Engineer's getawaymobile soley on the fact that Shaw assumed he was headed for Earth – even though she wasn't there when Earths co-ordinates showed up on the Engineer's.thing.","5"
"capitonis","Beyond the good looks, there's absolutely nothing","1 June 2012","I caught the midnight premiere of Prometheus last night, and left the cinema in a state of bewildered disappointment. Sure, it was a good looking film, but everything beyond that was at least bordering on awful. I guess this is largely because of my great expectations on the film (Scott's earlier SF movies rank amongst my favourite films), but there is no escaping the fact that the script is horrible.

Coming to IMDb, I was quite dumbfounded to see that it currently has an average grade of 9.0, and several reviews calling it ""intelligent"". Because that is exactly what this film most clearly isn't. The story is weak and frequently illogical, the characters wooden, and the action is predictable. This is a shame, because the ideas that it is based around are interesting to explore.

The most grating parts are where characters essentially discuss philosophy (why are we doing this, what are we seeking, what is the difference between men and machines). I would describe it as if it was written by angsty 14-year olds, if it wasn't for the fact that I don't want to insult 14-year olds. It is ham-handed, shallow and riddled with cliché.

The characters' behaviour is often highly implausible and/or erratic. Sometimes I got the feeling that there are scenes missing that would make sense of what happens, but there is enough stupidity in what's there to make me doubt it would make a difference. There is no real journey for any of them, and there is hardly personality enough among them all to match even one of the characters in the first Alien film.

Speaking of the old film, it is also sad to see how much they rehash old scenes. (cryopod awakening, stomach bursting, facehugging, alien oral fixation, android physical prowess, gruff weapon guys, alien in the escape pod, etc.)

The story has a lot of gaping holes. There is a lot unexplained, which could have heightened the mystery, but now only serves to provoke a ""I don't buy that at all""-reaction.

In all, an utter disappointment, which gets three stars for the visuals and some residue sentiment from earlier films.","3"
"The_Film_Cricket","A grand, visionary science fiction experience","10 June 2012","Ridley Scott's Prometheus is a grand, visionary science fiction experience, but just as important, it is an affirmation that idealistic science fiction is not dead. The best sci-fi is based on ideas, not laser guns and global domination. With the death of Ray Bradbury, I felt sad that the grandness of thoughtful science fiction was passing with him. Ridley Scott's film gives me hope that there is still a film artist who sees the possibilities of the genre. Yes, there are monsters and shoot-outs, but there's something worthwhile in the screenplay to back it up.

Scott's Prometheus does what science fiction is suppose to do, taking us to a place we could only imagine and presents completely new ideas about the origins of the species. It is officially a prequel to Scott's landmark Alien, but doesn't completely hitch its wagon to that film. It leads into the events of that film through thoughtful logic. We sense echoes of what is to come, but we don't feel hammered by them. This is a film that stands well enough on its own. The screenplay by Jon Spaihts and Damon Lindelof is written with patience and an intelligence that lets that events unfold as we experience them. It doesn't make everything clear at the beginning and then follow them down a predictable road. The whole way through, we are just as surprised as the characters.

The movie opens with an odd scene that remains unexplained. We spot a strange figure on the horizon of a gray planet. The figure spots a floating object in the sky, drinks something from a cup and vomits before his body decays and falls into the river. The substance reorganizes his DNA into something quite horrible that the characters for the rest of the film will have to deal with.

Cut forward several centuries to a ship called ""Prometheus"" that is run by an even more curious being, a plastic robot named David (Michael Fassbinder) who tends to an extended mission from earth to a planet located in another solar system. David is a curiosity, a four-limbed humanoid that reminds us of the HAL 9000 computer, not just in his function but in his thinking. He knows his mission, but never gives the audience any reason to trust him because he puts his duties above human life. What he's doing is right, but his methods are questionable.

Asleep on board are the ship's crew, who have been in cryo-sleep for the two year voyage and are awakened when the destination has been reached. The ship itself is the product of The Weyland Corporation, a trillion dollar business that is funding a mission to a planet that, evidence suggests, may unlock the key to the very origins of man. Representing the company is an ice-queen named Meredith (Charlize Theron) whose villainy isn't a million years removed from the Queen in Snow White. She wants the mission done with so everyone can get their findings back home. A more idealistic voice comes from an archaeologist named Elizabeth Shaw, played in a good, strong performance by Swedish actress Noomi Rapace (the original Girl With the Dragon Tattoo). She and her partner Charlie (Logan Marshall-Green) have discovered a series of star-maps that that have originated from several stone tablets from every age of man from the Byzantine Empire, to the Romans and even ancient Hawaiians. They all connect and seem to point straight to this strange little moon.

What they find when they arrive on the moon is, in a word, astonishing – a mountain that contains a cavern that once housed an ancient alien culture. The interiors of that cave are a breath-taking and brilliant exercise in production design by Ridley Scott regular Sonja Klaus (she deserves an Oscar). The discovery of an immense stone-face and hundreds of small missile-shaped canisters leads the crew to believe that something dangerous might be afoot. They're right, but they first must discover what they have found. Their discovery leads to the uncomfortable information of possibly that the human race was created for sinister purposes. There's some discussion between Elizabeth and Charlie dealing with her strong faith in God. Knowing what she knows, she has every reason to cast off her religious beliefs and one of the great questions of the movie is whether or not her discoveries will force her to do that.

More of the story, I cannot discuss. Just as with the original Alien, the crew isn't sure what they are up against nor what is killing them one by one. The difference is that there are few straight-forward answers. There are moments of astonishing discovery as when the away-team returns with a severed alien head that contains something that isn't very appetizing. This is a film full of great scenes especially a sabotage by David that leads Elizabeth to need surgery before the alien inside her bursts from her abdomen. That leads to an astonishingly good scene in which she tries to remove the beast with the help of an automated surgery machine that has to be seen to be believed. That scene is a masterwork of suspense.

I could carp about Prometheus all day, finding faults in tiny details, but this is a film that extends itself into the realms of great science fiction. I haven't always been kind to Ridley Scott's work, he makes film that always seem to have grand visuals with characters that leave something to be desired. Here, however, is a movie that Scott has crafted with loving care. His heart was in the material and he has managed to fuse together the wonderment of great science fiction with a sense of danger and horror of his original Alien. The result is not for all tastes, but it rises above just a weekend entertainment. It us leaves us with curious questions about the origin of the species that Darwin probably never would have imagined.",NA

This film holds such an original idea and marvellous visuals (3D is amazing) that you would be an absolute FOOL not to watch this in the cinema. Even the darker scenes are beautiful in 3D(compared to the horrible 3D in Avengers) This film should not just be watched by sci-fi fans, but also the typical moviegoer, as it provides on of the best 3D visuals I have ever seen, rivalling Avatar. Performances are Oscar worthy, especially the fresh take of an android by Michael Fassbender. He portrays a sense of humour that would have typically not have existed in this type of film. Although this movie was conceived by a scene in Alien, you do not need to watch that film to fully appreciate this film. This film caters for everyone, to the sci-fi nerds, the horror enthusiast, and the action fans out there. I can't stress enough how this film is for everyone.

Im trying not to spoil this film for you, so all I will say is that this film is a must see, forget watching MIB3 or Dictator or any other film, this is the one of the best films of the decade.

"nolarobert","Fascinating exploration of Human Desire","10 June 2012","This is the one movie this summer that you need to go into without knowing anything that is to come. I thought the story did an excellent job in exploring the human need to connect with something greater... for some it is ""god, for some it is eternal physical life, for some it is material and financial profit, for some it is the desire to know what is out there and for some... well, they were programmed to be the way they are. Human desire drives this film and it can take humanity to some very dark places before it is over. Prometheus is a cautionary tale about being careful in getting what you most desire. For fans of Alien & Aliens (like me) Ridley Scott provides the foundation of what is to occur in those films. The revelations were delicious treats for such fans and I know we appreciate them greatly. The writers of this story realized that a lot of the viewing audience would not know the Alien mythology so they wrote the story in such a manner that you can come in not knowing anything about the Alien franchise and being just fine. Actually, it would be even better to know nothing and see Prometheus and then watch Alien & Aliens to go in chronological order. I am really looking forward to the sequel to Prometheus because I get the feeling that payback will be a bitch. This is not a film for the young because it gets quite intense & it explores deeply philosophical issues that lead humans to some very dark places. Teens & adults will appreciate the serious storytelling while admiring the fantastic cinematography which is best appreciated in Real 3D. The cast is brilliant, the relationships intense and the discovery of the creators may not be as pleasing to the religiously faithful versus what they find in their holy books. - Now the part that contains spoilers. - I see where some have had a field day in picking the plot to pieces with criticism on how it wasn't scientific enough for them. I agree that the writers clearly had these humans do some stupid things if this were a purely scientific expedition to look for new life. NASA would do it much differently than the crew of the Prometheus. Instead to drive the story about humans on a search for their desires, some material and some spiritual, you have to suspend your connection to the rational world because this is mythological storytelling. You even get a miraculous birth thrown in but it ends a bit differently than the Jesus story. Dr. Shaw is looking for the Biblical Creator and she is the Ying of this adventure to the David/Weyland Yang of looking for the secret to eternal physical life. Weyland and his corporation have their own agenda which lives on in the evil found in Alien & Aliens. Now that everyone has had their hopes and desires crushed by what they found on LV-223 it will be interesting to see what Dr. Shaw and the newly liberated David find on the Engineers' homeworld when they find it & bring a dish of revenge which is best served cold... and it gets very cold in space. So go see this movie without dissecting every little thing that happens and just enjoy the philosophical exploration of the human condition.","8"
"umarmallinson","Intelligent and Purposeful","12 May 2017","This film is spectacular. It allows the franchise a much needed breath of fresh air. No clichés, no stereotypes but with all the menace and terror of the original movie. It's a real shame its successor 'Alien: Covenant' is such a let down.

The set up of the Engineers was skilfully added and allowed the viewer to take onboard a broader perspective. After all, if you want a ship in a bottle type of movie with a very narrow perspective then don't bother with sequels just stick to the original.","10"
"arvindmohindra","Absolutely breathtaking visuals! Ridley Scott sets a new bar!","7 June 2012","Prometheus is a visual delight. In IMAX 3D version, this has to be one of the best movies I have seen.

Spectacular jaw dropping visuals, great photography, music and well acted by all the actors. Thoroughly enjoyable. I saw the alien [1979] once again after Prometheus and this is a befitting prequel and absolutely connects beautifully where Alien franchise began!

Ignore the reviews where people expect Ridley Scott to provide lame action a la Transformers. This is as the other reviewer says - a very though provoking master piece!! Ridley Scott delivers as he always did in Alien, Blade Runner, Blackhawk Down, Gladiator and all the great movies he has ever directed.","10"

"davidcharles300","A disappointed fan of the work of Ridley Scott","7 June 2012","I have now seen Prometheus here in London, England yesterday afternoon. I admit to being a fan of Ridley Scott work, but this is definitely one of his worst efforts. The film disappointed me on many levels, which I think many reviewers have reasonably well detailed, notably Michael-Albertsen (Denmark). However, to use one of the supposedly present thematic threads from the movie, that of human nature, I expected Scott (with his vast experienced) to have fathomed that unless this effort could at least match his greatest works he was always going to take a hiding from critics. I hoped for something on par with Blade Runner, or even Gladiator. It appears that he did not. Not even I would have thought the final script for Prometheus was worth waiting 30 years for in order to return to that film genre that Scott had clearly contributed towards.

At points during the film I wanted to defend the film and the directorial flaws I witnessed, but as the lack of a strong story became more and more apparent I asked myself why be defensive? To err is human. Let's be quite frank here, Scott criticised the others for milking the Alien franchise. However, I genuinely believe that even the film Alien v Predator was better than Prometheus. I'll go as far as to say that it appeared to me that the Prometheus writers 'ripped' aspects that are clear and fully present within AVP. Maybe it was just a rumour but if there is any truth to it Scott should have been less grandiose and directed the AVP script as he would have produced a better final product than both the existing AVP and Prometheus.

Here is my 'Turing test' for this film. Imagine if you will there was no Alien film or story to predate this. Or that you'd never seen Alien - and folks there are many people that haven't seen that film - Would Prometheus be able to stand on its own merit as a film with a story to tell? I'm sorry but for me this is a 'B' movie, and definitely not worth the alleged $200million.

There is a lesson here to all film makers. Invariably your best work is done when you're hungry (eager to make your 'break', to expose your talent) and / or that you have a story to tell. Without either of those two forces as your motivation generally it becomes film making by numbers, or simple prostitution (merely selling oneself).","5"
"ppilf","Another disappointing attempt to squeeze more Alien blood","14 January 2015","This movie, like all other sequels to the 1979 movie ""Alien"" (in this case also called a ""prequel"", I guess), was a big disappointment to me, as I think it is to all serious science fiction lovers. I think I'm even more disappointed in Ridley Scott for directing it. Prometheus is another feeble attempt to squeeze more blood from the 1979 classic film. Prometheus did make a lot of money at the box office by appealing to the dumb and young movie audience masses, and will probably make more profit in other media. I guess one really can't fault film producers for wanting to get rich in their retirement. The plot of Prometheus convolves the original Alien story into a whacky futuristic thriller adventure in order to maximize use of CGI, and appeal to the 12 year old intelligence level, which is the largest demographic sector of the movie-going public.

The original film, Alien, a great classic and favorite of mine since I first saw it as a young man with my girlfriend in a 1979 movie theater, has been the source of many poor efforts to capitalize on its greatness and fame. Granted, some of the original movie's special effects could have been better, but its story, film editing, visual effects, directing, camera work, screenplay, script, and acting were pure science fiction genius, brought together to make a beautiful classic suspense film that I am now convinced will never be improved upon, mainly because the film industry is driven by profit rather than art. Personally, I think it would be nice if film makers stopped getting a piece of the 1979 film action, and concentrate more on creating new original, serious science fiction motion picture art.","6"
"FountainPen","Bad casting, too long, great idea messed up !","16 February 2018","The Captain and the scientist Elizabeth Shaw were mis-cast. Idris Elba trying to play a Southern black was laughable, pathetic, and his part contributed next to nothing to the storyline. The female scientist was immensely annoying, yelled and screamed a lot, very unattractive, came across as a tradityional sterotyped hysterical woman, sorry. The movie just went on and on and on; At 1 hour 35 minutes I was praying for it to end VERY SOON! Cinematrography was excellent, most special effects very professionally done. The android character David (Michael Fassbender) was terrific ~ now that's acting! Charlize Theron did a great job, too, in a very difficult part. Smaller roles well-handled. Btw, it was very easy to anticipate the big surprise regarding the guy who had financed the trillion-dollar venture! Had the film been one hour 30 minutes, I would probably have awarded 6/10, but as it is, 4/10 is the maximum I can manage, and sci-fi is one of my most favourite genres.","4"

"cdjh-81125","A Worthy and Strange Addition To The Alien Franchise","9 December 2016","When I heard about the massive controversy surrounding this movie I had heard that the biggest reason so many people didn't like it was that it wasn't what fans of the Classic Alien movies were expecting, so I decided to watch this films before any other in the franchise and I thought this film was very thought provoking, strange and fantastic. The thing I loved about this film was how well balanced it was, we had our scares and intense action sequences that were used to but we also have an overarching mystery that makes this film all the more intriguing as the idea of tracking down the beings who originated human life was a very unique ideas. Like the original Alien this film knows exactly how to build suspense, it takes its time to build up the scares through clever editing and Ridley Scott's perfect directing. The special effects in this film were mind blowingly good, there was not a single moment where I wasn't convinced of them, they blended perfectly with the environment. The actual ship, Prometheus it self was very well designed, you could see cues from the original Alien ship in the design but they updated it to appeal to a modern audience while giving a good explanation as to why it looks more advanced. The performances in this film are for the most part really good, Michael Fassbender easily gives the best performance in the whole film, he hot just the right note of intrigue and he was convincing as an android without ever coming across as lifeless. Noomi Rapace was really good in this film, she was a very effective and confident character just like Ripley and was the perfect protagonist for this film. Idris Elba is really good in this film, he is clearly enjoying himself with this role and gave a very enthralling performance. But this film does have some issues that mostly come from the script. For one this film asks a lot of intriguing questions that force the audience to think but never really resolves any of its mysteries and leaves far to much open, I know they were trying to go for a franchise with this film but they still left to much open. But the worst thing about this film is the characters, not only are most of them very forgettable but they're also really dumb, they do things unbecoming of the characters there playing and set up a poor start to the chain of events of this film.

I really do like Prometheus, it has fantastic visuals, an intriguing story and Ridley Scott shows that he truly is a master at directing Science Fiction, if Definitely does have some issues with its script but should they take them onboard they can improve upon them for Alien Covenant.

"seanhollingsworth85","clear a few things up for uneducated reviewers *possible spoilers?*","8 June 2012","*spoiler*

I see a few reviews on this quality sci-fi movie complaining about if the engineers were so much more advanced than us why would they use biological engineering to kill us off. If you do some research on some Alien lore, space jockeys used biological weapons to wage war, they use their huge carriers to drop eggs on the planets and wipe out life on the planet. So why would they change their tactics for a race they created.

With that cleared up, I enjoyed the cinematography, the acting and some very similar scenes that relate with alien, and Fassbender's performance as David was spectacular. If you are a sci-fi fan this is a must see, also the way Aliens were developed is really cool. Honestly I want answers, can't wait for the rest of the trilogy.","10"
"PhilipGHarris","Not quite stolen fire","1 June 2012","There's no point crying over spilt milk and, after the Alien vs Predator outings, you could be forgiven for thinking that there wouldn't be another good movie in either series. With Ridley Scott at the helm Prometheus seemed like the perfect chance; and even with trailer upon revealing trailer you held out hope for the movie.

And, for the first two thirds, you were right to.

We can skip across performances quickly. Everyone is good, even when the script isn't perfect, but worthy of mention is Fassbender's awesome and creepily logical David, Theron's Vickers and Elba's, long in the tooth, Captain Janek. Rapace is good too, but she is so much in the mould of Ripley she doesn't stand out. If there's one complaint there are too many characters to keep up with and so fine banter is often lost, as the viewer is trying to catch up on each members motivations.

Music is oddly upbeat at times, but occasionally harks back to the series that spawned it. Direction and camera work is what you would expect from Scott and his team; simply stunning and often beautiful, even at the moments of true horror. There are even subtle nods to his own original, as well as the sequels (not the AvP Movies).

Where Prometheus is let down is with story and editing. Both of these sit reasonably well for the start and middle section of the movie, as long as you accept that none of these scientists have any common sense: Quarantine anyone? As you approach the end, and the inevitable links to the Alien films, the ball is dropped dramatically and continuity falls apart. There is no explanation why the planet visited by the Nostromo is so ravaged, why the planet number listing has changed, why the alien jockey does not die in the correct position on the ship or why the Nostromo failed to recognise the remains of the Prometheus. There is also the scene designed to kill off numerous characters you never knew, making you wonder why they were there in the first place. This may sound like geeky picking but, really, who was this film directed at?

Worse still is the editing. When Guy Pearce's oddly accented Peter Weyland is proved to be alive, and on-board, the whole ship seems to accept this without batting an eyelid. There is a rather pointless scene where Vickers is proved to be his daughter, Shaw seems to become close to invulnerable after a major operation and the aliens, who led them to this world, make no sense – especially when you take into account the opening scene. Even David's logic seems to fall through the floor and the whole film gets very jumpy, as if large sections are missing.

What Prometheus gives you is a better film than the cinema release of Alien 3 and Alien Resurrection but something that is well off the mark of Scott's own epic and Cameron's sequel. The shame is, with a little bit more thought, it could have been much better. However fans will still enjoy the experience, even if it is just so they can pick holes in it with their friends later.","7"
"rphoebus-3","Prometheus is Awesome!","8 June 2012","Ridley Scott has done it again! Prometheus is awesome, and while many things take place without explanation, that is much like life. Stuff happens. You see it. You move on. Some stuff matters later on, and other stuff was just there because not everything in life serves an obvious purpose. After watching this at the midnight opening, we were talking for hours about ""What did that mean?"" and ""Why did he do this thing at the beginning?"", and it made for great conversation. How many films are worth talking about for hours on end after you have seen them? Much like a Kubrick production, Prometheus leaves so much unanswered that it will fuel a lot of really great conversations for a long time. Ignore any negative reviews and see this one for yourself.","9"
"dysmc","Excellent, Prometheus chapter one","3 August 2012","Had to write this review, saddened a film has caused so much anger, its quite ridiculous. Adding new editions to existing franchises will always garner mixed reviews but its unhealthy people take it so personal when it doesn't meet their unrealistic expectation(its just a film).

I Have to disagree with people who believe this is not a prequel, its the first chapter of the prequel, yes Prometheus can be a franchise of its own, but this ambiguous prequel is a prequel none the less.

This film has its flaws(every film in history does) but i enjoyed it, i went to the cinema not as a critic with a notepad scrutinising every scene so that i can sound intelligent when i point out some obscure flaw later on during a conversation in the local comic book store... where the worlds leading experts on everything lurk.

Those who hate it want everyone else to hate it too, and if you say anything positive you will get abuse in the form of your intelligence being questioned as to why you have a different opinion to theirs.

I hate the batman and spider man films, i hate superhero franchises period! but i don't spend anytime on them or convince others to hate them. It's not right or wrong, fact or fiction, just an opinion and different things work for different people, Science fiction is an acquired taste.... especially R rated.

Prometheus isn't a rehash or remake of alien, it explores something much more interesting and vast, provokes thought, answers some questions but opens many more, you are never quite sure where it's going... reminded me a lot of the first time watching 2001 a space odyssey, the book chariots of the gods by Ian Von Daniken, this is where it's worlds apart from alien, but i do believe Promethues is a prequel, though not a full prequel, it's chapter one or the pilot episode of an epic science fiction drama, and like the latter mentioned its bits and pieces of a bigger puzzle yet to be put together in future episodes.

Viewing Prometheus multiple times you start to see a pattern of what is going on, i seen the film on four separate occasions with four groups of people, The answers are right there in front of you yet well hidden, you have to look harder and more often, no doubt this is why there is websites dedicated to the film, people discussing what they discovered after further viewing, i don't remember the last time that happened with a film. There is nothing on screen that is there for aesthetics only, everything means something, it's a giant puzzle. Like 2001 a space odyssey it's a film you can watch over and discover new and interesting things.

The ancient alien storyline is based very loosely on chariots of the gods, a book that many ridicule, yet has become a very popular theory and subject for many interested in ancient civilisation's and their relationship with space, history channel even has a popular series dedicated to the subject which has run for 5 seasons, and its not that ridiculous in the realm of science fiction... it works. The theory is only ridiculous or offencive if you view and believe it as something more than fiction that challenges your own beliefs, the key is Prometheus is a science fiction epic, discovery science is where you will find documentaries.

From an aesthetics point of view Prometheus is flawless, possibly the most stunning looking science fiction epic ever made, i have not seen a film look this spectacular on the big screen since the star trek and avatar... of course i haven't seen many of the recent superhero epics. The blue ray will be a must for any collector, not to mention it would be good to get those 27 minutes cut from the final edit. what makes it even more beautiful to look at is the sets, designs of everything from the ship itself to the space suits.

The engineers are more disturbing than i could imagine. They are human like, this is what makes them horrific, more human like the more terrifying, Frankenstein, Michael myers and Jason Voorhees for example. Grandeur of their size and the statuesque god like perfection of their builds provokes visions of the gods of Olympus. Most of the creature and set designs are true to the original source material... Hr Giger original art work. The other major plus of this film is android david8 played by Michael Fasbender in what has to be the best performance of his career so far, david8 is the best android in science fiction IMO

There are plenty of in-depth positive reviews to read on the web for anyone interested in Prometheus, it's not a remake of alien, Prometheus's is an old school science fiction and its only chapter one, sequel confirmed.","10"
"onevoice-397-117711","Disappointing sums it up","15 June 2012","First up I admit I am an Alien fan. Even so I wasn't expecting this movie to be ""the next big thing"", I was only hoping it would be a decent 2 hr escape to fantasy land.

For me there were two very good performances; Fassbender and Theron. Both make their characters intriguing with not much to work with from the script. This would have been a far better film if Theron's character turned out to be the heroine; at least she has presence.

As a lead, Rapace's character is uninspiring (and most certainly no Ripley). The only scene she is in that I enjoyed was the ""removal"" scene. This, and the scene where the first two scientists are knocked off, are really the only ones that evoke some of the wonderful suspense of Alien.

There are so many plot holes, errors of fact, continuity issues and insufficiently explained scenes that this film is painful and just plain confusing to watch. One other reviewer expressed it perfectly when saying that it's like every few pages they randomly removed a page from the script.

On the plus side the film is wonderfully beautiful; the scenery, sets and props are all fantastic. Which makes it even more tragic that the script is such a let down.

It just feels like the writers decided to slip in any philosophical/religious idea they have ever had then tried to make tenuous connections to Alien. Worse still, as a result, character development is lacking and I genuinely felt no emotional investment in what happened the crew (and I'm a gal that gets sucked in easily).

Frankly it feels as though the film was purely an intellectual exercise, not an artistic one. The sad thing is that the themes the film attempts to explore are interesting, it's just the story is not.","3"
"bernard_gil","Bad script, great visual effects.","13 April 2013","Total disappointment. I don't think I could've expected much from these mainstream alien movies, anyway.

There's no correlation between the characters what-so-ever, the story won't make any sense to you, as it didn't for me. There's a lot of incomprehensible dispute between many characters, which some of them are the actual protagonists.

A lot of b-movie type clichés, and a lot of untold story to be told. The only thing worth in this movie is the FX, which, I must say, was really great. The acting was quite okay, though.

I'm just surprised this movie has a 7,2 rating, which in a website like this one, I find it utterly ridiculous.","5"
"richardmarkham42","Uneven but worth seeing","16 June 2012","I guess I'm missing something as the average vote for this movie was 7.7 when I wrote this. I'm long enough in the tooth to have seen the complete Alien series on first release in the cinema and am a big fan. I'd read that ""Prometheus"" was conceived as a kind of prequel but subsequently gained a life of its own, so my hopes were high for great visuals and special effects (achieved) and a strong new storyline (not so much). I can't stand 3D so saw the movie in old-fashioned 2D. Somehow after a breathtaking and intriguing opening sequence the film ultimately seemed rather disjointed, as if Scott had shot a three-hour epic then edited it down crudely to around two to suit theatres. It was also curiously flat and uninvolving in its pace and the acting, with lame twists predictable from a mile off and even the leading two or three characters given little chance to develop as personalities and many just ciphers. Later I may come to see this as deliberate, perhaps part of an overall aim to show the human combatants as helpless pawns in a bigger game. Of course, the original ""Alien"" had the advantage of shock and awe, whereas audiences are maybe now too familiar with these landscapes and ideas to be impressed; Scott's back catalogue raises the bar really high for him! Finally on the downside, one odd thing was the curious lack of tension in the roving sequences. Much play was made of the hostile atmosphere but not until the very last minutes did this seem to threaten the combatants at all. Despite all I say above, this is still an interesting piece of work which looks great and I will no doubt be re-visiting it on DVD or TV very soon to find out what I missed first time around!","6"
"brando647","Plot Issues Aren't Enough to Detract from PROMETHEUS Overall Successes","16 January 2013","The original ALIEN is one of my all-time favorite movies. So it should be no surprise that I was super excited when I'd read that director Ridley Scott would be returning to the franchise for a prequel. Then the news came that Scott claimed it was no longer a prequel to ALIEN but claimed that it retained the same ""DNA"" of the original film. OKwasn't sure what to make of the news but I remained excited regardless. It's Ridley Scott returning to science fiction; I was sold from the start. I can't say I was disappointed when I finally saw the finished product in theaters, but I was certainly confused. I knew I liked it but I was overrun with questions about what I'd seen. I started checking out reviews and getting a general consensus on what others felt and I wasn't alone: this movie left a lot of people baffled. Bizarre character decisions, confusing plot elements, and a black ooze that would apparently serve whatever purpose the script neededI was glad I wasn't the only one having trouble wrapping my head around it. The movie is set long before the crew of the NOSTROMO arrives to investigate a distress signal at LV-426. Elizabeth Shaw (Rapace) and Charlie Holloway (Marshall-Green) are archaeologists who believe they have discovered an invitation from an ancient race drawn on the walls of long-dead civilizations. Hoping they've discovered a message from a race of beings responsible for human evolution, they gain support from the infamous Weyland Corporation and embark on a mission with a corporate crew to investigate the possible origin of our species.

Investigating the origin of our species and filling the movie with science vs. religion tones means you can expect some pretty heavy material. That is exactly what I want from my science fiction. The best science fiction films challenge the audience to rethink aspects of our society, in this case toying with the proposition that the human species is the result of alien intervention. And it was directed by Ridley Scott, whom most can agree has some incredible talent in terms of film and storytelling. So where did it go wrong? In my opinion, this is a pretty complicated answer. To start, the original ALIEN isn't so much science fiction as it was horror in a space setting. There were no grand questions or designs; it was an unstoppable killing force murdering the crew of a mining ship one at a time. PROMETHEUS attempts to be both. The first half of the film focuses on the science fiction elements and the second half shifts over to the horror we expected when Scott returned to the ALIEN franchise. As a result, the first half of the movie raises a lot of interesting questions and teases a few answers but the second half of the movie is when the mysterious black ooze takes over the plot and it becomes a stream of bizarre, horrible mutations and death. By the end of the movie, we've lost any chance of receiving the answers because it's suddenly about killing the crew and fulfilling the audience's blood-lust. I'm cool with that. I enjoy horror and I love science fiction. Just, you know, commit to one. Don't tease me with an intriguing story and leave me hanging.

Despite it's problems, PROMETHEUS was still a good movie. Scott is a talented filmmaker with a great eye for visuals and this movie is a great example. PROMETHEUS is an amazing looking film with fantastic production design and beautiful cinematography. Everything in the film, from the design of the PROMETHEUS ship to the alien tech and the Engineers, looks amazing. The cast is full of incredible talent as well, with Charlize Theron, Michael Fassbender, Idris Elba, and Noomi Rapace (though Shaw is no Ellen Ripley) turning in great performances. The only casting misstep, and I'm sure you've probably read/heard about this elsewhere, was Guy Pearce as the 100+ year-old Charles Weyland. Pearce is a great actor but I've never cared for old age makeup effects and the ones in the film aren't the best. I kept imagining him as the 2015 version of Biff from BACK TO THE FUTURE. Needless to say, it pulled me out of the movie a bit. I've since seen the behind-the-scenes explanation about how Pearce came to the role (i.e. there were originally more scenes intended with a young Weyland and he was put in the makeup to match the character) but it's just a shame it turned out as it did.

The abundance of loose ends is a bummer but the movie itself is still great entertainment. The visual effects are fantastic, the creature effects are on par with the original's, and the performances make up for most of the script issues. There has been some chatter about another movie or two following PROMETHEUS that might bring the answers I hoped expected by the end of the film and, if the next films maintain the quality of PROMETHEUS, it's safe to assume I'll be in line for them too.","8"
"GM_Cornelius","The Most Stupid A-List Science Fiction Movie Ever Made. Maybe Worse.","14 May 2017","Before his career started circling the drain, Scott was on record saying he would not make another 'Alien' flick -- the Xeno was all played out. But even Sirs gotta eat, so with thoughts of quick bucks dancing in his head, he decided to cash in with the last refuge of a has-been: A prequel. Well, not so much an 'Alien' prequel as a movie that took place in the 'Alien' ""universe"", was full of Aliens, revealed the events that happened before the Nostromo encountered the Alien, and had ""Alien"" in the title. So he got Jon Sphaits' to write a script entitled 'Alien: Engineers'.

Then he lost his mind.

He realized he actually didn't like xenomorphs, so he simply deleted them. I don't mean he had the script rewritten without them, I mean he revised the script to excise them without changing much else. The result is a morass of incoherence.

In Sphaits' original script, the Engineer was furious when awakened because he had a chest-burster and would surely die. Rewriter Damon Lindelof deleted the chest-burster, (thereby his motivation and the impetus for the climax), but did not otherwise rewrite the scene. Remember when hologrammed Engineers ran down a hallway because nothing was chasing them? Excised Xeno Syndrome again.

From draft-script through post production, Scott didn't know what movie he wanted to make or how to make it. Shrink your Space Jockey after you've built most of the sets? No problem, only ""nitpickers"" will care why an Engineer that stood upright in an escape pod airlock would own a ship with interior door controls the height of a basketball rim.

There is no major scene that doesn't have a catastrophic problem. None. From an early scene where a tiny hole becomes a fully excavated cave complete with floodlights. To scientists in three cases, not taking a couple steps to view the IMPORTANT DISCOVERY IN THE HISTORY OF MANKIND. Nobody ever shows any awe as they scoot their asses through a temple and steal body parts.

An ARCHAEOLOGIST wouldn't even walk a COUPLE STEPS to EVEN GLANCE at the face of the being who created life on Earth and micromanaged all of human history -- He wanted to learn the facts of life from a living being. It stinks so bad you can smell Damon Lindelof's hand as he sits on the toilet, Clippy the Paperclip in lap, squeezing out the scenes.

Did I mention the characters constantly declare things they could only know if they watched the movie and saw themselves say it? EVERYTHING in the original 'Alien' had an explained rationale behind it: Ash's (the Android) decisions were to help the creature; Ripley was sometimes as low as FOURTH in command (Ash>Dallas>Kane>Ripley); they had guns but didn't shoot because acid would burn through the hull; they didn't have enough air to blow it out; they had to investigate the signal or would forfeit their paychecks; the Narcissus couldn't hold the entire crew because it wasn't a lifeboat, it was a shuttle; There wasn't a spear-gun in the Narcissus, it was a grappling gun for use when they took the shuttle to harsh planets (actually used in a sequence that was cut for budgetary reasons); They didn't ""have"" flamethrowers, they fabricated them. In 'Prometheus' she grabs one from the First Aid Kit or something; Ripley went back for the cat. I'd go back for my dog.

Kane wasn't stupid looking in the egg because he had a gun, and was wearing a heavily padded suit with a thick helmet. Nothing conceivable could be in that egg that could hurt him, unfortunately something INCONCEIVABLE was. Remember, HE didn't know he was in a horror movie; I could go on endlessly, there's nothing stupid in 'Alien'. But reaching for an angry cobra-gina in 'Prometheus'? The MOST conceivable thing happened -- he got attacked. In a suit the movie established could be pierced by hypodermic needles.

Scott's slapdash approach to 'Prometheus' extends all through post-production. He substituted a pyramid with Giger's dome in post-production but didn't bother re-dubbing the dialog. THAT is the reason everyone calls the dome a ""pyramid"", and don't let any over-weaning fanboy tell you it's for some artistic, allegorical reason. This alone disqualifies the movie from any serious consideration, could you imagine everyone in '2001' calling the monolith a ""sphere""? Even if we push all these problems aside, 'Prometheus' is still deplorable because it retcons the original. A deleted line of dialog reveals the entire original warning: The derelict crew encountered eggs ALREADY on the planet and set up a warning before they were killed.

Even without the explanation, no thinking 1979 viewer thought the eggs were in the derelict intentionally. What kind of imbecile thinks the Space Jockey strew his own cargo hold full of loose, barely closed eggs filled with horny monsters that ejaculate hull-melting acid? No doubt the same kind who thinks the Space Jockey taught Fred Flintstone how to finger paint.

No matter how much credit Scott takes, 'Alien' was never his vision, it was Dan O'Bannon's. Scott stumbled into a movie well into preproduction as the 6th director considered. He just pointed a camera at Ron Cobb's Nostromo and sets and creatures hand-crafted by H.R. Giger. The ending for which Scott takes credit existed before he was hired. His sole addition was the unfilmed finale where the Alien bit off Ripley's head and imitated her voice in a call to Earth. No, really, Google it. When it came time for a sequel, Scott wasn't even considered.

Despite heroic efforts to con the audience into thinking 'Prometheus' is ABOUT something, it's nothing but two tedious hours of the Gilligan's Island cast trying to figure out how jars work to the sound of Giorgio Tsoukalos slapping his dick on a crystal skull.

Prometheus is certainly no 'Alien' movie, Ridley Scott won't make any more of those. He told us so.","2"
"rob-swithenbank","In space no one can hear you yawn.","3 June 2012","Remember when films didn't use their budget as a means of advertising? When narrative, performance and breath taking images were all you needed to enjoy a film? Me too, and i miss it. I'm sick of going to see a film and having the budget crammed down my throat, ""WE SPENT $130 MILLION DOLLARS ON THIS MOVIE, LOVE IT!!!!!"". Honestly i don't care i just want a decent story. And this my fellow movie goers is where Prometheus falls extremely short.

From the minute we hit go we're hit with ridiculous shots that last a good ten minutes obviously intended for 3D that do nothing to advance any sort of narrative, and seen as though i hate 3D and will avoid it at any cost the effect was lost on my 2D screening. Then the film starts, and you are lost straight away. The plot is convoluted and ridiculous. Like a younger sibling shadowed by it's big brothers achievements, it scrambles desperately to try and be different but just ends up being a shallow rehash of something great.

There are far too many characters and not enough time to care about any of them and so when the crew start to fall, what's meant to be emotional and poignant just becomes cliché Hollywood horror. The effects and sets are truly great and the only reason really that i'd give this film any sort of rating, however when a film rests on it's effects and not it's plot, you can be sure it's going to be terrible.

Noomi Rapace does her very best to make me question whether or not she's playing a British character or a Swedish one. Logan Marshall Green's character apparently suffers from split personality and often switches between the hero and a villain at the drop of a hat.

All in all i came out of the cinema feeling doubly hard done by, one because this film that could have been so good became so boringly average and two because every time i sit down to watch Alien, i'm going to have the bitter after taste of Prometheus swilling around in my mouth.","3"
"andreandpaula","A mix of star wars episode 1 and Blade runner.","2 June 2012","This film is watchable but slightly deflating. And perhaps the worst part is the glaring script error at the end. Has no one else spotted it yet?

From the first mysterious scene there is a strong emphasis on DNA. And in that first scene lies the problem of the entire movie that much remains unexplained or at best badly explained.

Soon after, the first hint of a 'Chariot of the Gods' and ancient humans type storyline begins to loom with its religious undertones.

I love the early spaceship scene, very reminiscent of the original Alien scene, Into this mix was thrown David, who is an android. For some reason, never fully explained he likes to read Elizabeth Shaw's dreams.

Elizabeth, well played by Noomi Rapace, is a key figure of the film, a failed attempt to equal Ripley. She is an archaeologist. Naturally you take an archaeologist on a deep space voyage to an unknown planet. Clearly David and Elizabeth are closely linked though this relationship is not fully explored which is a bad loss for this movie.

Once on the planet there is the usual sequence exploring the newly discovered alien structure. Despite having clever robot scanners they still sent humans first. The structure scenes are well filmed and very suspenseful but perhaps this is because you are anticipating the alien to arrive very soon.

There are odd scenes such as where David operates a ""computer panel"" with no effort or even study and no one challenges him much on this brazen act. There is a poor hologram of ancient humans running for their lives. Interestingly if you look closely you can see they are wearing the helmets the space jockey in Alien was wearing. Why the hologram is so poor is unclear. This is a technologically advanced race. Digital holograms are either on or off. They do not degrade unless they were using VHS.

There is a scene best described as a church with a large statue in the middle. This movie is riddled with religious undertones but they are so understated they fail to make the point.

In the best scene where two stranded men are left in the structure they are attacked by a rapidly evolving creature which though not a face hugger has the same type of behaviour. Almost immediately the storyline is now obvious and a sense of disappointment sets in.

Then Elizabeth becomes pregnant (hints of Ripley in Alien 3 here) and there is a laughable scene (not gory like some have said) where a machine operates on her and removes a creature. The creature is left, presumed dead, in this amazing automatic surgical robot.

Then we are told that the structure is a military base where biological weapons are produced. And later the android, having managed to operate yet another computer console, deduces that the human-aliens planned to return to earth to eradicate all humanity via their biological weapons.

Around now Weyland emerges from his secret hole in the ship. This is so poorly done it is unbelievable. So many wider questions about Weyland Corporation are left hanging. Ironically AVP explains more about this than this film.

Of course an ancient human is found alive who naturally kills almost everyone.

And then there is our major error. The alien is going to pilot his ship (which we now see is the ship from 'Alien.' He climbs in to the famous seat (Alien fans will know what I mean) the famous mask comes over his face and you go ohhhh and hold your breath. There he is in the seat, one of the most famous scenes in Alien but 'IT' does not happen. The film speeds up here. There is a ramming, a squashed Charlize, a reunion between David and Elizabeth and the ancient human being impregnated by a creature more like a face hugger.

Laughably David knows there are other spacecrafts on the planet. How? Elizabeth decides rather than fly this fantastic technology back to Earth she will take in to the alien-human home world. Nice decision girl. Next scene we see another alien space craft and are left to presume they are heading to the home planet for Elizabeth to give them a damn good talking to. (Hint of sequel here I guess.)

And here is the continuation of the blatant error. The space jockey dies on the escape pod from the Prometheus, not in his chair. His chest cracks open and out pops another stage of evolution which clearly is an early version of the classic alien. This last scene both elated me and disappointed me. One the one hand we finally see the clear history of where the alien comes from. He is nothing but a biological weapon. On the other hand the mistake is so embarrassing I cringed.

As for the characters - they were irrelevant. The crew numbered 17 but I am sure we did not see 17 characters. There is Elizabeth's boyfriend. He dies because David poisoned him. I am pretty sure Elizabeth knows this but she does not seem to be interested in revenge. Then there is Charlize Theron who plays what turns out to be Weyland's megalomaniac daughter. Sorry but her role is pointless and her death is very poor. And there is even an old Weyland himself though this is very poorly explored other than to say he is seeking immortality.

Clearly Ridley has stuck a finger in the air about any link with the Predator character. which is a shame even if the AVP films have disappointed to date. We now know that the alien creature was evolved in the late 21st century so quite what the predators were hunting in the pyramid in the Antarctic is now unclear.

I rate this better than Alien 3 and 4 but far behind Alien and Aliens.","5"
"mikedao","Wow! This movie really makes you think. Can't stop thinking about it.","8 October 2015","I recently became a member of IMDb so I can share my thoughts on movies I have seen. I was very surprised to see all the negative reviews of Prometheus as I think it is one of the best movies I have seen in years. I am a big Ridley Scott fan and this one did not disappoint unlike The Martian, which I thought was horribly cast.

Prometheus is one of those movies that draws you in and keeps you in suspense until the end. It is subtle and thought provoking with a lot of questions left unanswered as they should be.

Reading the reviews, I am wondering what other viewers were expecting to happen in this movie. How else could it end? We are not ready to wrap our minds around the explanations of how we got here that this movie attempts to explain. That is what makes it so intriguing.

The movie is so visually striking with the right balance of humor and suspense. Michael Fassbender is amazing as David and really holds the movie together. I also really enjoyed Charlize Theron role as Miss Vickers. Noomi Repace was also good and I look forward to seeing her in the Prometheus sequel.

This movie is far superior to The Martian, yet that movie has much better viewer and critic ratings. Really doesn't make sense to me. I have watched Prometheus many times where I would never watch The Martian again.

Great job on Prometheus, Mr Scott. I will be interested to see where Miss Shaw and David end up in their search for where we came from in the sequel.","10"
"baberchik","What a ripoff!","24 August 2012","First off I give it 3 out of 10 and that is ONLY for being a kind of prequel to Aliens, but for the rest the movie does not measure up to anything. The good and interesting part of the movie is the actual contact with an intelligent alien, but that contact is so short that it might just have been the whole movie - all 15 seconds of it. Now for the bad part: the movie like many recent flicks is over-hyped. Prometheus brings nothing new to the table: a crew of misfits and egoistic idiots which eventually leads to infighting, 80% of the movie taking place in ""dark spooky caves"", scary moments and a lot of searching with flashlights (I guess in the future a hand-held flashlight is as far as technology is capable of evolving), slime on the walls and secretive alien writings on murals, random alien creature attack and (of course) a triumph of (relatively speaking) technologically backwards humans against a super-intelligent alien. At one point the filmmakers just got so lazy that one alien was almost like a cobra without a head that has a strange resemblance to a male genitalia and another was just a plain old squid, I kid you not. They might have thrown in a bat and a spider for good measure, would be equally absurd.

If you are a sci-fi fan, you will probably manage to link 90% of everything found in Prometheus to another movie. This kinda reminds me of Cabin In The Woods - just like that movie Prometheus manages to suck itself like a leech to a number of different other movies ""borrowing"" them dry of ideas. The actors are boring and most lines predictable, so that also adds to the staleness of the movie. I was expecting at least SOME fresh ideas, but this movie is a letdown plain and simple. The best way to describe it would be if one can imagine opening a very old can of soup with a brand new label. Contents are stale, and the ""novelty"" of it is just the label alone.","3"
"iansputnik","What?","8 June 2012","Dear Mr Scott. Would you kindly return the 2 hours of my life that you 'stole' from me on Monday. 'A team fights terrifying battle to save the future of the human race', really? I must have slept through that bit. No wonder Ridley Scott has said that this is not a prequel to Alien. That would explain the continuity errors between the ending of this festering pile of dung and the beginning of the far superior Alien. The first hour of this film is a long yawn the second is a long disappointment. If you're going to make a prequel then do it correctly. If you state it is not a prequel then come up with an original idea, don't just pilfer bits and pieces from an earlier piece of work. Also, if you're going to release a film in 3D, then make an effort to shoot it in 3D. Don't just add a half arsed 3D makeover just so we can get ripped off at the cinema by being made to spend a couple of quid more than the 2D films. Really Ridley, go and sit in a darkened room and re-think your life.","5"
"richard-milton","He should have left Alien alone","21 July 2012","Ridley Scott is one of the greatest film makers. Prometheus is his crowning achievement. He must glow with pride at the honours showered on him. Yet I cannot shake off my suspicion that, late at night, he prowls the empty corridors of his vast mansion alone, a real life Charles Foster Kane, attempting to quieten his inner doubts. From his hand he lets fall not a snowstorm paperweight, but a tattered copy of a screenplay from the 1970s, and from his lips, falls not the word ""Rosebud"", but ""Alien"".

It was Scott's great fortune to make the best sci-fi space film ever conceived. But his misfortune to make it in 1979, before CGI. With each passing year, advances in digital technology brought miracle after miracle to the cinema screen. Jurassic Park, Star Trek, Terminator, Titanic - each new digital triumph must have felt to Scott like his Alien creature's acid blood, eating through his skin and bones and, eventually, even his artistic soul.

The technology now existed for Scott to re-make his greatest film using digital technology sufficiently advanced to live up to his original vision. Now at the peak of his powers, he could command with ease what he had to fight for in his youth: cash, locations, talent – but above all, millions of dollars' worth of computerised special effects – the one tiny flaw in his 1979 production, when compared to today's films.

And it was a flaw that would worsen with time. As technology improved irresistibly, his original film would sink further back into the prehistoric realm of movies made before CGI – destined one day to seem as naive and charming as Georges Méliès ""Voyage to the Moon"" of 1902.

He must have thought; while there is still time, while I still command respect from the studios and the money men, let me make sure of my cinematic immortality by re-making Alien using modern technology. And so we have Prometheus.

The opposing tensions that gave rise to the film were there in the making too. The goal was to recreate the terror of Alien, but it must be Alien in a new form. The film must be new, but it must also be old - true to the original.

The solution adopted was that used in the prequel to Star Trek in 2009, where J.J .Abrams had miraculously breathed exciting new life into the 40-year-old franchise by taking us back before the period we knew. But where Abrams had succeeded by playing in a nuanced way on what we already knew about the Enterprise crew, Scott merely reprised his previous most successful moments, now clothed in CGI finery. And not merely reprised them, but re-filmed them, shot for shot.

And so we had to sit and watch again the crew of a corporate space ship reawaken from cryogenic sleep, tended by a humanoid robot. We had the obligatory black ship's captain who was both anarchic and courageous.

We had the discovery of alien life – the same alien life-forms as before. We had parasites who invade their host through the mouth and burst through their abdomen to be born. We had a second-hand glimpse of the parasite in attack mode, seen only as a blip on a CRT screen. We had the android's head being ripped from his shoulders and lying on the floor in a pool of goo, still talking. All shot for shot from the 1979 film.

We also had shameless imports from other blockbusters. We had irresponsible billionaire John Hammond from Jurassic Park reincarnated as Guy Pierce's Weyland, first appearing as a hologram in a lecture theatre. We had the alien starship disguised as a pyramid from Indiana Jones and the Crystal Skull. We even had a ""Luke, I am your father"" moment. When we learn that Guy Pierce's Weyland (a Rupert Murdock-alike economic despot) is father to the icy-blond expedition leader.

The hero's journey was played out through a female protagonist. Deconstructing her name is illuminating. She is named Ellie - stolen from the main character of Carl Sagan's Contact, Ellie Arroway, and imported complete with the flashback to her dead father giving her life meaning. Her surname is Shaw. Shaw=sure. Ellie is the religious believer in the story and hence the only moral person who deserves to survive.

What has the addition of CGI done for Alien? The claustrophobia of the original has been replaced by a kind of cinematic agoraphobia. Everything is now on a grand and heroic scale. The alien ship is so vast you get lost in it (yet mysteriously, its deadly cargo is restricted to one tiny area). In flight it is as large a small city, yet when it crashes to the planet's surface it's like a small tinny gasometer falling on you – you just dodge behind a rock and you're Okay.

There are also genuinely miraculous CGI moments, not least of which is the heroine performing a Cesarean section on herself to deliver an unwanted alien pregnancy. The trouble is that none of these jaw-dropping creations advances the story or adds to our knowledge. They are there not because they are necessary but because they are now technically possible.

Even if everything I say here is correct, does it matter? Does it in any way detract from Scott's magnificent achievements? I want to say ""No, of course not"" but I have a horribly queasy feeling – a little like John Hurt catching up on his missed breakfasts – that something isn't right. It's as though Michelangelo had a second crack at the statue of David in expanded polystyrene, or Gustav Eiffel chose to rebuild his tower in pre-cast concrete sections. Modern but brutal.

As one of Ridley Scott's greatest fans, I wish he had left his masterpiece alone, and left me with my memories of Alien untarnished. The film making is flawless. The film is pointless.","3"
