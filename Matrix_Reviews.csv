So we left and he sat through it a second time. This movie is splendidly done. The mystery about what the Matrix is, unravels and you see a dystopian future unlike any we as a race would want. I have watched this over and over and never tire of it. Everyone does a great job acting in this, the special effects are above par and the story is engaging.","10"
"coasterdude44","Ah yes. My first existential crisis.","5 August 2020","I have an interesting history and relationship with this film. Never before has a film made me question the nature of reality before. At first glance, The Matrix at the surface might have looked like a really good action movie with some cutting edge special effects with a kinetic and engaging story, and it definitely has that, but on my first viewing of this movie back in 2006 when I was 9 years old and slid this DVD into my small box TV at the end of my bed. I had absolutely no idea what I was in for and what I was about to experience.

This movie is actually more disturbing and honestly terrifying than many would let on, especially to a young child when this movie drops some major psychological and philosophical themes in it's first act. The first 40 minutes of The Matrix is frankly terrifying and suspenseful in all the best and right ways.

The surreal bugging scene with that crazy bug with the long tendrils swirling around in what looks like a higher frame rate than the rest of the shot around it, followed by the mirror scream and the metallic drowning scream followed by the waking up in the pod of human entrails scene, followed by the highly messed up ""How do you define 'real'"" Where the concept of reality literally goes up in quotation marks and flies away, where the movie sets the tone that 'reality is simply electrical signals interpreted by your brain' is the most we humans can make of our surroundings - almost makes the concept of The Matrix scarily plausible - and also in a way kind of timely of how the Internet has evolved leaps and bounds since 1999 and the plausibility of VR at the moment (I mean have you seen Half-Life Alyx)

And of course you have the explanation of the matrix that follows. Truly one of the heaviest exposition scenes in cinema history.

And that's about as far as I survived my first viewing of this movie all those years ago. As a kid's first viewing, this movie successfully found it's way inside my head and left my mind shattered literally unable to watch any more. You would think that would be a terrible thing to say about a movie, but not here. The Matrix is an unparalleled and unprecedented movie experience as humanity is at the core of this movie.

The first act plays as a setup for such a hopeless notion as the nature of the matrix is revealed, only to have this notion flipped on it's head when the matrix itself starts being a fun place to be in the eyes of Neo and the evolution of his character aswell as the rebels that he meets that teach him of the humanity that underlies every person trapped inside it under the oppression of the inhuman controllers.

Once the true nature of the matrix is revealed. You can bend it to your will and then you can do whatever you want. The Matrix is the ultimate story and parable of humanity overcoming and opressive and dystopian scenario, being controlled by machines, and is masterful in it's writing and direction. The casting was very well thought out with Keanu Reeves killing it as Neo, aswell as Laurence Fishburne and Carrie Anne-Moss as great supporting roles, with Hugo Weaving as an extremley strong Sci-Fi villan as the cold, sociopathic AI Villan Agent Smith.

With Neo as the embodiment of humanity against Smith which is devoid of such, follows an unforgettable experience of human over machine. A classic and terrifyingly brilliant film which may cause you to have an internal existential crisis, but that's just the power of this film.","10"
"suryanmukul","Benchmark forever.","1 October 2020","The Matrix - 1999

This was a real change in filmmaking. Like watching it again in 2020, i.e. after 21 years and it still feels fresh. Iconic scenes are still having benchmarks setting up.

If we say it sci-fi at its best, it won't be wrong. The hype was real, it is still not easy to match the level of Matrix where we experience the connection of humans and science, that too with amazing action fight and chase scenes, not just normal scenes they were, multiple exposures, slow motion 3D moves, Oh My God, and it's understandable as well like what are the characters up to and what storyline they are entering into. The script was very well written and executed otherwise it could have been a mess. A special appreciation in managing the theme with those black color costumes and a scientific zone with unimaginable equipment and props doing unbelievable things in the two worlds created. No spoilers, but the action scenes in the climax where the protagonist goes to save someone from agents are really breathtaking. The technology used at its best.

A salute to Wachowski Brothers and the team for creating this masterpiece. It will be a great competition and motivation as well for many films coming in the future.","10"

"gogoschka-1","A watershed moment in film-making – and what a kick-ass masterpiece","26 July 2014","** May contain spoilers **

There aren't many movies I watched in the theatre twice  let alone on the same day - but immediately after the credits had rolled (and still pumped up by 'Rage against the Machine'), I queued up for the next screening of 'The Matrix'. I was so blown away by that film, I feared - and probably rightly so - that I hadn't caught every detail of what I'd just seen. I later found out that many of my friends had had a similar reaction to the film, and I know virtually no one who liked the film and didn't watch it at least twice. It's simply one of those rare films that are so rich you just have to watch them several times.

In structure, style and concept, 'The Matrix' was ground-breaking; it marked the first time the visual style of Manga comic books and Anime such as 'Akira' or 'Ghost in the Shell' had been successfully translated to a live-action film. Apart from 'Blade Runner', which has a totally different mood and pace (but is also a masterpiece and visionary film-making), there simply hadn't been anything even remotely like it. The jaw-dropping action sequences have such a raw, gripping energy they feel like an adrenalin overdose, but unlike most action films, they never overshadow the story; on the contrary - they enhance it and make complete sense within that universe.

As for the story itself, I think this is one of the most original, fascinating Sci-Fi tales you'll likely ever see on screen. Clearly inspired by Japanese Anime and Manga yet also by authors like Isaac Asimov or Philip K. Dick, the story about humanity's war against its own creation, machines of an artificial intelligence that have evolved to the point where they have become the dominant 'species' and vastly superior to their creators, could take place in the same world as 'Blade Runner' or 'The Terminator' - albeit several hundred years later. But there is also a mythical, even religious undercurrent to the story; the themes of a prophecy, a ""liberator"" or even a ""messiah"" make 'The Matrix' transcend the Science-Fiction genre and become even more unique.

'The Matrix' was a watershed moment in filmmaking  in every respect  and even though two inferior sequels have left a bit of a stain on the film, they can't distract from what an uncompromising and hugely influential masterpiece this is. Sci-Fi movies that were released after 'The Matrix' have tried very hard to achieve a similar look and tone, but the original still owns them all. 10 stars out of 10.

The concept and the villains are what I love most about it. Everything about the agents excellent, Hugo Weaving gives his best performance. Cypher who's Judas, the true villain of the film, the most sensible. The character development and the choice of casting in regards to Trinity, the only real weakness of the film. I feel like we could of got to know the Neo character some before this, we have no idea what he's thinking at any point, all we know is that he was the greatest hacker and that's because he's the one. The trinity character's too butch, the other female crew member in a lesser role too, what's with this? Like Cypher, I would rather just go back into the Matrix. I get that you become hardened in a certain environment, but I don't see that as the case here. So Trinity loves Neo and he has to love her back, okay. Laurence Fishburne's terrific as Morpheus.","10"

"MinorityReporter","Immensely entertaining, intriguingly philosophical and just about one of the best films ever made!","2 December 2005","Writing a review of The Matrix is a very hard thing for me to do because this film means a lot to me and therefore I want to do the film justice by writing a good review. To tell the truth the first time I saw the film I was enamored by the effects. I remember thinking to myself that this was one of the most visually stunning films I had ever seen in my life. Also having always been a comic book fan and a fan of films that were larger than life, the transitional element of the story was very appealing to me and this probably heightened my enjoyment of the film very much. It wasn't until some time later (and after having seen the film a few times more) that I started to think about the film. I recognized the Christian elements quite quickly but it wasn't until I wrote an actual 15-page essay on the film that I tapped into some of the philosophical and religious elements and that made me appreciate the film even more. I won't say that I have recognized all elements because the film is quite literally packed with them.

Acting wise the film works excellently. I won't say that there aren't any issues because there are but overall the acting is pretty flawless. Keanu Reeves plays the main character, Neo, or Thomas A. Anderson and while he is not the perfect actor I think he does a pretty good job in The Matrix (and the sequels). He doesn't have the longest of lines which was probably a deliberate choice from the directors and it works because this gives him a better opportunity to work on posture and facial expressions and I must say that overall his body language is very good. Very clear and well defined. Laurence Fishbourne plays Neo's mentor Morpheus and he does an excellent job of it. His lines flow with a certain confidence and style that makes his character somewhat unique and interesting. Carrie-Anne Moss does a good job as well and succeeds in looking both cool and sexy in her leather outfit. Joe Pantoliano, a critically underrated actor does a brilliant job of bringing his character, Cypher, to life. I can't say much about him because his character is pretty essential to the plot and I certainly don't wan't to spoil it for anyone. Gloria Foster appears in a relatively small role that will have greater significance in the following films and she does a very good job. The best acting is provided by Hugo Weaving, however, in his portrayal of Agent Smith. It is really something to watch him act out the changes in his character. Agent Smith gains some human traits like anger, sense of dread, hate and eventually even a sly sense of humor (mostly in the sequels). Two thumbs way up to Weaving who has created one of the finest screen villains of all time.

Effects wise the film is simply stunning and it deservedly was awarded the Oscar for best effects (and was regrettably cheated out of a nomination in the Best Film category) ahead of even Star Wars. The reason that I think The Matrix deserves the Oscar for best effects is simply that the effects in The Matrix are more innovative than the ones in Star Wars. Just take a look at how many times the effects have been spoofed and you'll probably agree. The effects also help in the symbolism of the film and in creating a very dystopian atmosphere not unlike the one seen in Blade Runner and this works brilliantly. The film looks beautiful at all times and today 6 years later (my God has it already been 6 years?) the effects still hold their ground against new science fiction films. Add the effects to the brilliant editing and you have a visual masterpiece on your hands. Very well done.

The reason that I think The Matrix is more reviewable than pretty much any other film is the story and the philosophical and religious elements of the story because with every viewing I catch something I didn't see the previous time I watched it. Without spoiling the film I think I can mention a few of the more obvious elements. Obviously the film draws on the Messiah myth as Neo is a clear reference to Jesus with the analogy of his name (Neo = one, as in The One) but also hidden in his other name, Thomas A. Anderson. The first part of his last name, Anderson comes from the Greek Andros meaning ""man"" and combine this with the second part of his last name ""son"" and add a little creativity you will come up with the combination ""son of man"" which was a title Jesus came up with about himself. Also the first time we meet Neo a man calls him (and I quote): ""You're my Saviour man. My own personal Jesus Christ."" It doesn't get any more obvious than that. Aside from the Christianic elements the film also gets its inspiration from Budhism, Gnosticism (Gnosis = knowledge) but is also inspired by Plato and his analogy of the Cave and Jean Baudrillard's essay, Simulacra and Simulations. Explaining these elements would make this review go on forever so aside from mentioning them I will not comment on them further.

To all the people who doubt the profound nature of The Matrix I can only give one advice: Free your mind and watch the film again. You won't regret it. If I had to choose a favorite all time film my choice would probably fall on either The Matrix (obviously I don't expect people to agree but if they do thats great) or The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King and I recommend it to all fans of sci-fi and people who like philosophy.

"ivo-cobra8","The Matrix Is one of the best Classic Sci-Fi Action Film ever","30 July 2015","My review of the best epic Science Fiction Action film, The Matrix (1999) starring Keanu Reeves, Laurence Fishburne, Carrie-Anne Moss, Hugo Weaving, Joe Pantoliano, Marcus Chong and Gloria Foster.

This was be the first movie I went to see in the movie theater with my mom when I was 15.years old, when I read in the magazines about The Matrix I was blown away and I wanted to see it right away. The Matrix is the best action sci-fi films that Keanu Reeves made in the 90's. It is one of my personal favorite movies.

The Matrix is a (1999) American science fiction action film written and directed by The Wachowskis, starring Keanu Reeves, Laurence Fishburne, Carrie-Anne Moss, Hugo Weaving, and Joe Pantoliano.

It depicts a dystopia future in which reality as perceived by most humans is actually a simulated reality called ""the Matrix"", created by sentient machines to subdue the human population, while their bodies' heat and electrical activity are used as an energy source. Computer programmer ""Neo"" learns this truth and is drawn into a rebellion against the machines, which involves other people who have been freed from the ""dream world"".

Written and directed by the Wachowski brothers, this classic sci-fi action film stars Keanu Reeves as a lowly computer programmer who discovers his entire existence, and that of all mankind, is nothing but a simulation in a computer. The reality within a reality is a concept that's done before... but never like this - The Matrix requires absolute attention from his audience, least you'll be completely lost in a few minutes. With the help of supporting cast members Laurence Fishburne and Carrie-Anne-Moss, Reeves discovers that inside this simulation environment known as The Matrix, he can control, bend, and manipulate space-time... resulting in some of the most incredibly iconic images to ever grace the silver screen.

The slow-motion ""bullet-time"" effects as they're known today were groundbreaking and revolutionary when we first saw them 12 years ago. Although Reeves is notorious for his inability to really convey much emotional range, his character here lends itself well to him as an actor. This is a movie that makes you think, makes you gasp, and makes totally forget where the 136-minutes went after finishing it. It's no wonder this film spawned two very successful sequels, and dozens of copy-cats. The Matrix, ""Visually revolutionary, and mind-blowing.""

Keanu Reeves plays the main character, Neo, or Thomas A. Anderson and while he is not the perfect actor I think he does a pretty good job in The Matrix. He doesn't have the longest of lines which was probably a deliberate choice from the directors and it works because this gives him a better opportunity to work on posture and facial expressions and I must say that overall his body language is very good. Very clear and well defined. Laurence Fishbourne plays Neo's mentor Morpheus and he does an excellent job of it. His lines flow with a certain confidence and style that makes his character somewhat unique and interesting.

Carrie-Anne Moss does a good job as well and succeeds in looking both cool and sexy in her leather outfit. Joe Pantoliano, a critically underrated actor does a brilliant job of bringing his character, Cypher, to life. He also played the roles in Underrated Daredevil (2003)and Bad Boys I & II. I can't say much about him because his character is pretty essential to the plot. Gloria Foster appears in a relatively small role that will have greater significance in the following films and she does a very good job.

The best acting is provided by Hugo Weaving, however, in his portrayal of Agent Smith. It is really something to watch him act out the changes in his character. Agent Smith gains some human traits like anger, sense of dread, hate and eventually even a sly sense of humor. Two thumbs way up to Weaving who has created one of the finest screen villains of all time.

The film looks beautiful at all times and today 16 years later (my God has it already been 16 years?) the effects still hold their ground against new science fiction films. Add the effects to the brilliant editing and you have a visual masterpiece on your hands. Very well done.

The film also won 4 Academy Awards including for best visual effects. 10/10 for one of the best epic American science fiction action film's in the history movies like this and Aliens (1986) don't exist anymore. It is one of my personal favorite movies, it is the movie I saw with my mom in the movie theater it is memories on my mom who is no longer with us anymore and I miss he.","10"
"TheLittleSongbird","A sci-fi action thriller milestone","20 February 2017","'The Matrix' may not be one of the very greatest examples of its genre (like '2001', 'Metropolis', 'Blade Runner', 'Back to the Future', 'Star Wars Original Trilogy', 'Alien' and 'Aliens'), but that it is revolutionary in how its visuals and use of sound broke boundaries like had never been done before cannot be denied.

It is not a film to be seen if people want character depth or relationship depth, with the forced and underdeveloped love subplot between Neo and Trinity being 'The Matrix's' sole weak spot. This ended up not being that huge a problem for me because everything else is so well executed.

Particularly striking about 'The Matrix' is its production values. Simply put, the film looks amazing in its audacious production design, dazzling special effects that are some of the most ultra-cool and imaginative to exist, super slick editing and often jaw dropping cinematography. So much more than a film with ground-breaking special effects and use of camera work that broke boundaries.

Use of sound was also striking, and how the pulsating and hypnotic music score was used. Andy and Larry Wachowski direct adeptly, while the script is an intelligent mix of complex and well-explored themes, mysticism, philosophy and even Lewis Carroll and the story is often invigorating and intensely taut with a smart concept brilliantly done.

Action is superbly shot and edited, and the way it is choreographed is relentlessly intense and breathless in its energy, Kung Fu has rarely been more vertigo-inducing (despite how this sounds, this is not a bad thing as it added hugely to the intensity and paranoia of the story's atmosphere) on film.

Keanu Reeves is in one of his best and most iconic roles and has never looked cooler, certainly has not looked this comfortable for a while before then. Carrie Anne Moss is strong. Even better are an imposingly charismatic Laurence Fishburne (also in one of his best roles), an amusing Joe Pantoliano and a deliciously wicked Hugo Weaving.

Summing up, not one of the best of the genre but a mile-stone nonetheless and a great one. Followed by two sequels, both nowhere near in the same ball-park. 9/10 Bethany Cox","9"
"david-meldrum","20 years on from release, some random thoughts on revisiting The Matrix. Spoiler: It's still brilliant.","22 February 2019","20 years after its release, and several years since I last saw it, some reflections on the experience of rewatching The Matrix. In no particular order ...

1) It still look great. I mean, this is one amazing, stylish looking phone. Very little about the look of the film has dated - the mobile phones, obviously, Neo's computer, and very briefly a couple of visual effects creak. But otherwise, this looks as amazing at it did on release. It's sumptuous.

2) I think I was one of the many who misjudged Keanu Reeves all those yeas ago. I made easy jokes about his vacant stare and apparent intelligent. From this vantage point we can see he's been in a good number of successful, intelligent films. It's also become clear that within the industry he as a reputation as decent, hardworking man who is a pleasure to work with.

3) It's apparent again how literate and cine-literate the film is. I knew this 20 years ago, but since then I've seen a lot more films and read a lot more books, and this time around I especially loved the way the film nods its head to other film genres and influences. I noticed a lot of Peckinpah, and did I see a nod to Kurosawa there too? And I was reminded that for an English Literature graduate like me, this is a goldmine of quotes, allusions and references.

4) Seen 20 years on, its influence on cinema since is clear. There's a lot we could talk about here, but I was especially struck by how indebted a director like Christopher Nolan is (keeper of the flame of intelligent blockbusters), especially with Inception.

5) I'd forgotten that the narrative ostensibly maintains uncertainty about Neo's identity until just before the end. I'm not sure this really works - anyone who's read many books or ever done an anagram will not find that the most suspenseful part of the narrative.

6) Despite a run time of 2 and a quarter hours, it never flags and attention never wonders. The film fizzes with kinetic energy and the time flies by. It's a lean film, without a wasted moment.

7) The film is, of course, packed with religious allusions. When I wrote a chapter on this for my BA Theology dissertation, I said I thought the film was neo-Bhuddist (forgive the pun, please), and I stand by that on rewatching. Of course, there's lots of allusions to Christian and other theology, and The Matrix spawned some really bad reading of film by Christians which has never really stopped. When will some Christians learn to read a film/book etc with integrity and understanding of what the film is trying to do? It's a spiritually confused mish-mash of a film - but still a gloriously entertaining one.

8) All these years later, it turns out The Matrix was somewhat prophetic about the role technology would play in our lives. Humans permanently plugged in to networks? Different layers of reality that are somehow more real than what we think of as real? The Wachowskis saw all that and more coming 20 years ago. Artists are the weather vane of society; we really should learn to pay attention to them.

9) Bottom line. I still bloody love this film. I'm trying to work out if I have the requisite strength to revisit the sequels....","10"
"Xophianic","One of my favorites","2 February 2000","At first, I wasn't interested in seeing the Matrix. But after hardly hearing any bad reviews for it (and believe me, I hear bad reviews for every movie I enjoy) I decided to give it a try. At first, although I really loved the fights, graphics and characters, the plot confused me. (Anyone confused by the plot at all should go to www.knowthematrix.com and you'll find out everything you could want to know) By the second time I watched it, I really understood it, which made the movie even more enjoyable.

I really loved this movie. Just about every character, good or bad, is very interesting and cool. The acting was excellent. Even though I think this was Keanu Reeves at his best, the best acting jobs were done by Laurence Fishburne (Morpheus) and Carrie-Anne Moss (Trinity). Hugo Weaving did an excellent job as Agent Smith and Joe Pantoliano was great as Cypher as well.

The plot is one of the best movie plots I've seen in a movie. An accountant by day, computer hacker by night guy suddenly finds out that reality as we know it is fake and that we are actually in a giant computer program run by robots (that we created, of course) in order for them to get power. Not only that, but he finds out that he is one who is, according to prophecy, going to put an end to it. The greatest thing is that you learn things just as Neo does, so you can really relate to his character.

My favorite thing about this movie is that no matter how many times you watch it, you will learn more about it. I guarantee this. Some may not like this movie because the plot is too complicated, but I recommend that anyone who enjoys movies should go buy this one right away.","9"
"EVON1TY","So well written that makes you questioning the reality. ⭐","2 March 2023","This movie is so well written that you can't even prove this movie is wrong about our world. This movie mades you think that our world can be just a reflection, a fake world. It's not just about the war between AI and humanity. It's more about questioning the reality.

And years later the idea is never gets old. This is the movie that you should respect if someone says ""I think this is the greatest movie of all time."" because it has somethings unique, not special it's just unique.

It's beyond all the Science-Fiction movies. Normally Sci-Fi movies mades you think ""Can this subject of the movie be real someday?"" and actually only some of them made you think that way. This one mades you think ""I can't deny, this could be our reality. We can never be sure.""

Besides making one of the greatest Fictional Universes, this movie also achieves so much more.

And not only that, this movie is also achieves something great in Action. It has the most iconic action scenes. Action director is so great. Revolutionary VFX and SFX, amazing Set Decoration and more.","10"
"lastliberal-853-253708","...it is not the spoon that bends, it is only yourself.","23 July 2015","I remember taking a class in social psychology many years ago. The Joy Luck Club figured prominently in the course. I like the idea of combining movies and theory.

I am now studying metaphysics, and any study of reality begins with René Descartes, the father of modern philosophy. Descartes began his intellectual odyssey with this question: How do we know that there is a reality outside our own minds? We each know that we have experiences, and we can be sure of these experiences; therefore, each of us can be sure that we exist. But how do we know that the internal experiences we have corresponds to objects outside our minds?

This is the whole theme of The Matrix. Watching this film is like studying metaphysics.","10"
"MrsRainbow","at last, something I can recommend","2 April 1999","The first 45 minutes of this film had me very excited. It is so rare that I will go to the theater and be presented with something which is both original and intelligent. It managed to hang in there throughout, though the ending was too formulaic. In addition, the voice-over at the very end reminded me of the final scene in Saving Private Ryan. It almost ruins a fantastic film.

The only other objection I can come up with is that the you must know, you must be type philosophy being handed out was just a tad hokey. I must pleasantly admit though, since I don't get to admit this very often, that The Matrix is worth seeing despite these things.

The visuals are extremely impressive, particularly the ""white room,"" the baby harvester, the training scene with the ""red woman,"" the Reeves interrogation scene... I have to agree with some of the previous comments that the plot idea won't seem overly original to a fan of Philip K Dick, but then what is original after you've read him? The Matrix has more original things to say than two months worth of standard Hollywood fare. I have a great deal of respect for a film which will have someone say ""they're turning humans into this"" and hold up a battery. A plot which looks at man as machine will get a thumbs up from me just for trying.

I feel some hope for the future of movie-making in America to be able to recommend this film.","10"

"notoriousCASK","Welcome to the Real World.","11 April 2018","Without a doubt one of the best and most influential movies of all time, the Matrix is the defining science fiction film of the 1990's and the biggest leap the genre has taken since Stanley Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey and Ridley Scott's Blade Runner. The Matrix is a ground-breaking motion picture that not only raised the bar for all the science-fiction films to come after it but also redefined the action genre with its thrilling action sequences and revolutionary visual effects.

The film tells the story of Thomas Anderson a computer hacker that in the world of hacking goes by the alias of Neo. When he is contacted by the mysterious outlaw Morpheus and having always questioned his reality, he is awakened to the truth that the world he's been living in is a simulated reality called the Matrix and that he's nothing more than a slave in this dystopian world, created and controlled by A.I powered machines.

The direction and script by the Wachowskis is fantastic, as they drew ideas and inspirations from every other great sci-fi and cyberpunk movie and anime before the film, combining it with stunning action and putting it into one picture that has enough style, substance and subtext that everyone ended up giving their own interpretation of the story. The research that went into the preparation of the screenplay is quite extensive but the manner in which it is presented on the big screen is also very impressive. Every character presented on the film, has a well-defined arc and a purpose, and their motivations are clear.

The cinematography is impeccable. It was very innovative in the use of the camera angles and movements, the zooms, the slow-motion captures and the different color palette used to differentiate the Matrix and the real World. The editing is flawless, as it makes sure that every scene is integral to the story and ensures the pace of the film stays ferocious through its entire runtime. Each frame is also packed with so much visual information for the viewer to devour. The visual effects introduced us to the bullet-time effect and their impact can still be felt in today's movies. The performances are also incredible. Each member of the cast gave their best performances and brought the characters they portray to life, but the one that stands out the most is Hugo Weaving's disciplined rendition of his character, Agent Smith; a powerful computer program made to search and destroy the human rebellion, in undoubtedly the greatest performance in his career.

In conclusion The Matrix is a masterpiece everyone should see. It is one of the most thought provoking, inventive, pioneering, influential and stylish movies of all time and it's also full of philosophical and religious allegories waiting for interpretation. Immortal for its contribution to cinema and pop culture, its brilliant combination of inventive visual effects, excellent vision and exquisite action easily makes it one of the best, most influential and most entertaining movies ever made.","10"
"TaylorYee94","Still hip as heck even after 20 years","1 October 2020","You name it. Technology, CGI, flow of the story, the concept, action, romance, style, music,... everything you want is realized in this movie to the level of perfection. The scene where Neo and Trinity go to the virtual reality to save Morpheus is so fashionable that I screamed. The camera angle, costume, music, and the gunfights.. all these qualities shine the heroes. The entertainment value of this movie should not be overlooked because of its high quality and philosophy.

I can see how much research Wachowski sisters put in to make their imaginations and concepts realized in the two-hour movie in plausible ways. How is dystopian future and present is connected? How does dream within a dream work? All the questions about their imaginary world is answered because they pay attention to details and they explain every existence and terms with logic one step at a time. There is no leap of logic, very tightly well-woven script.

Their concept is not just future or imaginary anymore. In 2020, we see AI taking over many of works and jobs that humans used to do and invading privacy. Virtual reality games gain popularity over time, and you see Neo everywhere who adapts quickly in the Internet world and learn the combat game so fast and naturally.

The impact of 'The Matrix' in the movie industry is more than imaginable. Of course, revolutionary visual effects with elaborated CGI techniques created iconic bullet-dodging scene of Neo. Because the Matrix system in the movie is kindly well-explained, it widens a scale of sci-fi genre. Hunger Games, Inception, Eagle Eye, Wall-E, and so many other movies that followed benefited from this epic work.","10"
"SdrolionGM","What is the Matrix? Well, one of the best films ever, for one thing...","3 March 2001","The Matrix...when I first heard about it, I expected just another sci-fi action thriller. Good and filled with insane stunts, but not terribly intelligent.

Boy, was I wrong. Oh, the stunts are there in spades, all right, and yes, they are awesome. And the special effects are absolutely amazing (even if similar ones have been used in other movies as a result- and not explained as well).

But the movie has plot as well. It has characters that I cared about. From Keanu Reeves' excellent portrayal of Neo, the man trying to come to grips with his own identity, to Lawrence Fishburne's mysterious Morpheus, and even the creepy Agents, everyone does a stellar job of making their characters more than just the usual action ""hero that kicks butt"" and ""cannon fodder"" roles. I cared about each and every one of the heroes, and hated the villains with a passion. It has a plot, and it has a meaning...and lo and behold, a plot does help the fight scenes! Just try it, if you haven't seen the movie before. Watch one of the fight scenes. Then watch the whole movie. There's a big difference in the feeling and excitement of the scenes- sure, they're great as standalones, but the whole thing put together is an experience unlike just about everything else that's come to the theaters. Think about it next time you're watching one of the more brainless action flicks...think how much better it COULD be.

All I can say is WATCH THIS MOVIE. If you haven't, you're missing out on one of the best films of all time. It isn't just special effects, folks.","9"
"mambubukid","The benchmark for all sci-fi films to come","19 September 2000","The story of a reluctant Christ-like protagonist set against a baroque, MTV backdrop, The Matrix is the definitive hybrid of technical wizardry and contextual excellence that should be the benchmark for all sci-fi films to come.

Hollywood has had some problems combining form and matter in the sci-fi genre. There have been a lot of visually stunning works but nobody cared about the hero. (Or nobody simply cared about anything.) There a few, though, which aroused interest and intellect but nobody 'ooh'-ed or 'aah'-ed at the special effects. With The Matrix, both elements are perfectly en sync. Not only did we want to cheer on the heroes to victory, we wanted them to bludgeon the opposition. Not only did we sit in awe as Neo evaded those bullets in limbo-rock fashion, we salivated.

But what makes The Matrix several cuts above the rest of the films in its genre is that there are simply no loopholes. The script, written by the Wachowski brothers is intelligent but carefully not geeky. The kung-fu sequences were deftly shot -- something even Bruce Lee would've been proud of. The photography was breathtaking. (I bet if you had to cut every frame on the reel and had it developed and printed, every single frame would stand on its own.) And the acting? Maybe not the best Keanu Reeves but name me an actor who has box-office appeal but could portray the uneasy and vulnerable protagonist, Neo, to a T the way Reeves did. But, come to think of it, if you pit any actor beside Laurence Fishburne, you're bound to confuse that actor for bad acting. As Morpheus, Mr. Fishburne is simply wicked! Shades of his mentor-role in Higher Learning, nobody exudes that aura of quiet intensity than Mr. Fishburne. His character, battle-scarred but always composed Morpheus, is given an extra dose of mortality (He loves Neo to a fault.) only Mr. Fishburne can flesh out.

People will say what they want to say about how good The Matrix is but the bottomline is this: finally there's a philosophical film that has cut through this generation. My generation. The Wachowski brothers probably scribbled a little P.S. note when they finished the script saying: THINK FOR A MOMENT ABOUT YOUR EXISTENCE. What is the Matrix, you ask? Something that's closer to reality than you think.

Either that or it's my personal choice for best film of all-time.","10"

"UniqueParticle","Almost my favorite movie ever! The metaphors/quotes should be more known!","31 March 2019","Truly a masterpiece in every way! If it wasn't for Fight Club this would my favorite; I've been on the fence about it. The Matrix along with They Live have the best metaphors about life/society, most of which a lot of the population aren't woke to!

For example the entire speech Morpheus says ""The Matrix is everywhere. It is all around us. Even now, in this very room. You can see it when you look out your window or when you turn on your television. You can feel it when you go to work... when you go to church... when you pay your taxes. It is the world that has been pulled over your eyes to blind you from the truth. That you are a slave, Like everyone else you were born into bondage. Into a prison that you cannot taste or see or touch. A prison for your mind."" Among other brilliant quotes like when he talks about what the world has become, then mentions we have become this referring to a battery. So many genius lines I could list that I won't.

The effects, stunts, lighting, sounds, and tone are outstandingly spot on! They really did train for the fight sequences for months I've seen all the special features plus more. Yes this is a sci-fi film, but I see it as a documentary as well. We're all slaves that take the blue pill throughout many things it's just hard to realize that. I also love what someone else said, it's a benchmark for sci-fi to come, that is very true and it's the last of its kind; movies aren't made like this anymore!

A lot of people worked hard to make this film what it is. I respect that; I've always wanted to work on film just haven't had a way for many reasons. If you've read this far or even at all thanks and sorry! I usually don't leave a review this long, just thought it was worth it for this one.

"Hitchcoc","Wow! I Finally Saw It!","20 August 2019","This is one of those movies that ""everyone"" has seen, except me. I tried to watch it with some friends about fifteen years ago, but they had two kids under five years old and I was only able to ingest it in five minute increments. So a friend lent me the video and I finally got a chance to see it. It's a pretty remarkable film. The premise of an alternative reality works here where it often fails. Keanu Reeves is a sort of messiah, not by his own choosing originally. He has been attacked and abused by men in sunglasses whom, we find out later, are a part of a representation of Artificial Intelligence. The side Neo ends up on are the original humans whose ranks have been nearly driven to extinction. Laurence Fishburne is the leader of the rebels and he believes the the Reeves character is ""the One."" I thoroughly enjoyed it but would have like a little more creative final scene. Too many shell casings. Apparently, weaponry didn't advance much in twenty years. But, it keeps one on edge with its special effects and its non-stop action.","10"

"emptyskies","The more you watch it, the better it gets","23 April 2002","The Wachowski brothers really did excel themselves with this movie. It's a brilliant movie on a number of different levels - the directing is excellent, the camera work is great, the visuals are stunning, the kung-fu is A+, acting is executed with style and conviction, and the plot is truly inspired. It's really hard to use enough superlatives on this movie!

It'd be a 10/10, except for the ending. Having Neo do what he does at the end really lets it down, in my opinion. However, there's a couple of sequels on the way, so let's see what the Wachowskis can do to make up for it.

Other than that, (and like I said above) the movie is operating on so many different levels that each time you watch it, you pick up something new... this isn't by accident, either. The Wachowski brothers had the actors read a number of definitive works (Simulation & Simulcra was one I believe) in modern literature and psychology, and applied liberal dashings of aspects of the major religions to provide the best sci-fi movie of the decade, if not ever.

I'm yet to meet somebody who hasn't enjoyed it. It's my favourite movie to watch on a good cinema system, too.","10"
"aidanratesmovies","Once in a lifetime film experience","18 December 2021","Never will there be a film that can harness the creative worldbuilding, mind blowing story, and intricate themes of social commentary as well as The Matrix can. I first watched this film when I was merely 12, and was absolutely blown away by it, and rewatching it now, i'm so glad to catch so many little things that add to the depth of this film and its storytelling. The Wachowski's have created something masterful here, creating a dystopian sci-fi world unlike any other before it and managing to not only build upon it greatly throughout the film but allow the audience to be immersed within it as well. It's a movie that makes you think, and it may start off a bit slow because of that, but it knows what it's trying to do, and it doesn't need to apologize for it. Keanu Reeves, Laurence Fishburne, and Carrie-Anne Moss provide for excellent leads throughout the film. The cinematography is unique and gritty, its action style more than entertaining, and its deeper themes of societal norms and challenges make for quite an interesting commentary. Its special effects may not have aged very well today, but at the time they were quite unique and it fits the films vibe in a way that truly has to be seen to be believed. In the end, The Matrix is a sci-fi masterpiece and no one can tell me otherwise. Its an intricate and beautifully executed blend of action, sci-fi, and potential and just may be one of my favorite films the 1990's had to offer.

My Rating: 9.9/10.","10"
"MercurioKnight","A great epic that sets the stage for the next level in sci-fi...","27 April 2000","Who is to say what is real or not? We are defined by our view of reality, no matter how twisted or demented it is in comparison to 'normal' people. *evil eye* Yes, I see you all, looking in the mirror, trying to decipher whether or not your view is the reality we all share.

The Matrix not only supplies the world with a whole new level of special effects mixed with style and substance, it also brings a whole new meaning to the word 'paranoria'. This is one of those great epics that becomes a milestone in our present day world, a mark for which just about everybody can appreciate. Not since the original Starwars trilogy has a science fiction film reached across almost the entire population and gripped it with awesome special effects, great sound, and a overall feel of ground breaking movie making magic. It also serves up a good dose of paranoid delusions we all need in our lives every now and then.

With that, I leave you with the fact that I've seen more different types of people liking this one film than most other films to date. Move over George Lucas, you may have just met your match... :)","10"
"Quinoa1984","One of the greatest achievements in Science-fiction film history","5 October 2000","Andy and Larry Wachowski's The Matrix is an unbelieveable achievement. Not only in the visual sense, but in storytelling, the way society is, and much more. And, Keanu Reeves is almost good here.

Reeves playes 2 people in one- Thomas A. Anderson, a regular Joe who is just working it today's society. The other is Neo, a comuter hacker who has broken every single known computer hacking law. But, he soon meets Morpheus, played with great mysticism and wiseness by Laurence Fishburne, who brings Neo down the rabbit hole to tell him the truth about the world; we are living in a world called the Matrix, which uses out brain energy to trun us into batteries. Unbelieveable to be sure, but it is incredibly original story wise, as it sprawls into something every average movie goer can appreciate- hard boiled, visually and bloody packed action, gore and violence.

The best part though is that this film breaks many boundaries in technology and (with it's 4 Oscars for editing, sound, sound editing and visual effects) and deserves every bit of credit it gets. True, some might find the plot confusing and boring and true it isn't for all tastes. But if you can like the story and the action, you've got the key to a fantastic picture, otherwise it is another action flick (great action never-the-less). Kudos to everyone who worked on the film, making one of the best films of the year, decade and of sci-fi film history. A++","10"
"Tweekums","A cyberpunk classic","28 February 2012","Like many people I was fairly awestruck by the special effects when I first saw this film but was unsure how I would feel watching the film again several years after I last saw it; after all special effects are advancing all the time and this is over ten years old... I needn't have worried; I enjoyed it just as much as I did first time.

The story begins with computer hacker Neo receiving strange message telling him somebody was about to knock on his door and that he should 'follow the white rabbit'; his door is knocked and his friends invite him to come out with him; he is about to refuse when he sees a white rabbit tattooed on one of their shoulders so goes with them. While out he meets another hacker, a woman called Trinity, who tells him that the legendary hacker Morpheus wants to meet with him. The next day at work he receives a call telling him the authorities want to take him into custody and he must follow precise instructions if he wishes to escape; he fails to do this and is arrested. During the interview with Agent Smith a strange bug is implanted and in a nightmarish manner his mouth becomes fused closed! The next thing he knows he is waking up in his apartment assuming it was just a strange nightmare but it soon becomes apparent that is was real. Taken to Morpheus by Trinity he learns that the world is not as it seems; he isn't in 1999 but 2199 and none of his life so far has been real; his body is plugged into a giant machine and he is experiencing something called The Matrix.

Once woken he finds himself in a dead mechanical world with Morpheus, Trinity and a few other free people; they mention the last human city; Zion, but we never see it. Now he is free he must prepare to return to The Matrix which means learning the skills he will need to survive and gaining an understanding of what The Matrix really is. Once inside they will have to avoid Agents, parts of the program that will hunt them down as well as assuring that they stay hidden in the real world; if they die in either place their life is over.

This is a must see for all science fiction and action fans; it has a fine story and spectacular action sequences; many of them reminiscent of those in Chinese Wuxia films with characters running up walls and doing impossible leaps... of course within The Matrix nothing is impossible if you believe you can do it. Keanu Reaves might not have the greatest acting range but he is just right for the role of Neo, a man understandably a little confused at finding everything he had experienced so far was unreal. Hugo Weaving is great as Agent Smith bringing a sense of menace to the role. Other main actors Carrie Anne Moss and Laurence Fishburne also perform well. Writer/directors the Wachowski brothers did a great job; the film is incredibly stylish without lacking substance. I can't imagine many people haven't watched this but if you are one of those I strongly recommend checking it out.","9"

"view_and_review","And now introducing the Wachowski Brothers","21 January 2007","Every so often a movie will come around to challenge the minds of the people; make people think, ""What if..."" ""The Matrix"" was such a movie. ""The Matrix"" took an idea that was not entirely original and took it to another level. The concept of machines rebelling against their human creators had already been explored in successful movies such as ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" and ""Terminator"", but never had a movie dabbled with the idea of machines being triumphant and eventually enslaving all of humankind.

""The Matrix"" as a story alone was extraordinary. The Wachowski brothers obviously put a lot of thought, time, and energy into the story alone because it is without equal. The story itself triggered thoughts of ""What if we are plugged into a matrix? How would we know?"" And it also spawned many contemplative conversations all over the country if not the world. The Wachowski Brothers covered even the most minute detail with regards to the matrix: its origin, its function, its current state, and it flaws. Each scene and each conversation seemed to be carefully chosen and put together so as to convey the plausibility of the matrix.

Then coupled with the great story was almost equally fantastic directing and special effects. Before ""The Matrix"" none had tried or adequately tried the still shot and pan. Almost immediately into the movie we get to see a shot of Trinity (Carrie-Ann Moss) jumping in the air, then being frozen perfectly still while the camera pans around her, before she proceeds to kick butt. This movie had no shortage of special effects and action blended it perfectly with critical and revealing dialogue.","10"
"zardoz-13","Cyberescapism Galore!!!","24 September 2013","Co-directors Andy and Larry (now Lana) Wachowski fashioned one of the most revolutionary science fiction sagas of all time with the cyberspace thriller ""The Matrix"" with Keanu Reeves, Lawrence Fishburne, Carrie Ann Moss, and Hugo Weaving. The first of a trilogy, this 136-minute, allegorical actioneer pits a group of resistance fighters led by Neo and Trinity against the status quo villainy of 21st century henchmen who wear suits and ties with sunglasses. The pioneering ""bullet time"" cinematography is as incredible as the action is audacious. Nothing is what it appears to be in ""The Matrix."" The Wachowskis have appropriated a little bit of everything for their derivative but striking cyberescapism. They have incorporated philosophy, martial arts combat, Greek mythology, Biblical themes, and ideas from movies such as ""Strange Days"" and ""Dark City."" Legendary martial arts choreographer Woo-ping Yuen has staged some kinetic gravity-defying, close-quarters combat sequences. Carrie Ann-Moss never made another movie that matched ""The Matrix."" The first scene when she runs up walls to elude the police, bounds across rooftops, and hurls herself like Peter Pan over a street is sensational. This computer generated scene gets the action off to a dynamic start and the Wachowskis never let the pace lag even when things get a little convoluted. Laurence Fishburne behaves like John the Baptist from the Bible, and Hugo Weaving makes a diabolical villain. ""The Matrix"" belongs in the top 100 science fiction films of all time.","10"
"SnoopyStyle","Ultra cool sci-fi","9 November 2013","The Wachowski brothers have created one of the more interesting sci-fi world. Neo (Keanu Reeves) is a computer hacker who has a nagging intuition that the world is wrong. He is literally Alice who goes down the rabbit hole and finds his world is actually Wonderland. It marries Lewis Carroll with HongKong Kung Fu wirework and the back trenchcoat. They invent bullet time and amp up the cool factor in gun fights.

The story borrows heavily from a lot of different sources. Machines have taken over. The world is a computer construct. People fight using computer avatars. These are all ideas that have been done before. The Wachowskis have weaved it all together into a functional tapestry.

But it is ultimately the cool visuals that makes this movie unique. For a relatively lower big budget, the production value is incredible. They have squeezed every movie magic out of all the visual and computer effects.","10"
"Leofwine_draca","Effects-fuelled sci-fi extravaganza","26 August 2016","What is THE MATRIX? Well, let me tell you: it's a crowd-pleasing science fiction adventure, which took audiences by surprise as it came out of nowhere and totally destroyed the year's other big sci-fi epic, THE PHANTOM MENACE. The reason for its success is quite obvious when you look at it. The film isn't just about special effects, although they do play a big part; it also has a rather complex and classic sci-fi set up. While STAR WARS was all bad special effects and little else, THE MATRIX is all good special effects and a lot more besides.

Okay, so there are some obvious flaws: a lack of originality for one; the real futuristic world looks like something out of BLADE RUNNER and there are bits out of DARK CITY thrown in too. The story, too, once it has been set up, is dropped in favour of some increasingly outlandish action sequences. But when these action scenes are fantastic, then you just don't care. After all, I watch a film to be entertained, and fighting and explosions are the simplest source of entertainment around.

The actors and actresses in the film are all okay, although you have to wonder if Carrie-Anne Moss was picked simply because she looks good in PVC. No matter, as it's left to Keanu Reeves in his best role for some time, to carry the film. While he may not be much of an actor (the sheer awfulness of his performance in BRAM STOKER'S Dracula is hard to forget), he just about manages to make his role as a mild-mannered computer operator who becomes a heroic saviour believable. Thankfully, there is some heavyweight support from Laurence Fishburne as the imposing leader of the rebels, and a wonderfully villainous performance from Hugo Weaving as the slimy villain. The costumes are great too - stylish leather and sunglasses making up the main attire.

The film is not really about acting, though, or story. It's the special effects which make this, well, special. Without them, it would just be another average tale, but these CGI effects are truly outstanding, even on the small screen. For once, they do fit into the context of the story as well, as they are computer effects in a computer generated world. THE MATRIX has brilliant CGI, and has to join the ranks of TERMINATOR 2, JURASSIC PARK, and INDEPENDENCE DAY as a film which really sets the ever-changing standard on which all other films are to be based.

Bullets fly in slow-motion, leaving trails in the air; characters can spin in the air, climb walls and jump huge distances; computer-generated villains morph into other people at will, fights are impossibly fast. Indeed, it is the fight scenes which are the most memorable, as they come across as a hybrid of the classic kung fu genre and the very best of style master John Woo. The best moments are the Fishburne/Reeves training fight, the moment where Reeves takes on Agent Smith in a subway, and the lobby shootout where plaster literally flies everywhere. You also have to love the ending, where Reeves finally wins over the baddies and manages to stop bullets mid-flight with his bare hand. A great image, just one of loads in this great film which has to be one of my favourite sci-fi films of the decade.","10"

"ShinKyo81","Let's ponder on the influence of ""The Matrix"" to the whole industry...","31 October 2018","It is funny how it has been 15 years since ""The Matrix Revolutions"", bringing the movie trilogy to a close. I wrote reviews for it and ""Reloaded"" as well back in 2003 and I realized that I had never written a few lines for the first movie. Well, here I am.

I will keep it short. We all know how good ""The Matrix"" is. The plot, the visuals, the mythos, it all adds up to a movie experience that is timeless. Almost 20 years later, it now has a ""retro"" vibe that makes it more interesting, with late 90s cars, rotary phones, Nokia cells and CRT monitors.

Today sets the 4K HDR release of the trilogy. Coming back to ""The Matrix"" after probably 10 years since my last viewing, it is a constant reminder of how the Wachowski's masterpiece shaped up the movie industry and its echos are still felt today.

A true timeless piece of movie history.","10"

"zfiany","50 years at a max the Matrix movie will become our real world!","30 March 2009","I find it strange that most of the people who watched Matrix were only attracted by the visual effects and overlooked the scientific facts on which this movie was based.

People enjoyed the flying mostly and hence liked Matrix 1 more than they did with 2 and 3 although the answer was in part 3 that is who will win the war eventually between humans and machines. Some people they make fun of the idea that one day humans will be in direct war with machines but those people have not read yet about the Nano technology. The latter technology offers something like the software which teaches Neo how to fight in little time. Well through Nano, they will be able to plant a brainlike chip which works 10,000 times faster than our brain and they are now trying to optimize the speed limit in a way that doesn't endanger our brain which might be burnt working under such speed.

As for the flying part, it is very possible if the science of Psychokinesis is given more consideration and in the near future I reckon they will with the evolution of human body which is going toward less and less movement. Has anyone seen the prototype of the new cars which have no pedals and we use sticks to drive and direct the car in different directions.

Well, I guess the movie has tackled all these scientific aspects alongside psychological and philosophical ones in a very brilliant way and I 100% give this move 20 on a scale out of 10!","9"

"BA_Harrison","Whoa!","14 November 2009","With The Matrix having already received 3294 comments and 342,457 votes (with an average rating of 8.7), the last thing IMDb needs is another rambling review from an avid fan describing in precise detail why this film is such a revelation in terms of action and sci-fi cinema.

What I will say is that the film is a stroke of genius that taps into the subconscious belief that our reality is not all it seems to be and mines it for all it's worth, developing a philosophical mythos of biblical proportions in the process, whilst introducing technical and directorial innovations that will be mimicked for years to come.

It also features some kick-ass fight scenes (with jaw-dropping choreography by HK legend Yuen Woo Ping), a superb metal and techno soundtrack, and the awesome sight of Carrie Ann Moss almost completely clad in black PVC (or is it rubber? Oh, who cares... it looks great!!!).

In short: with The Matrix, the Wachowski Brothers have given sci-fi fans one of the finest films of the genre ever.

What a shame they had to go and make those sequels!","9"
"Boba_Fett1138","The most influential and refreshing science-fiction movie since ""Star Wars"".","26 March 2006","""The Matrix"" has redefined the science-fiction genre. Previous to this movie, most science-fiction movies consisted out of scene's in space with spacecrafts, aliens, all set in a futuristic world. Most movies that tried to be different from this, mostly failed. ""The Matrix"" does however does not fail and it redefined the science-fiction genre and has taken it to a whole different and more seriously taken level of movie-making. The movie has inspired many different movies ever since and showed that science-fiction and action elements are a great and spectacular combination. From that perspective ""The Matrix"" is one of the most important movies for film-making, from the '90's.

This is a superb piece of movie-making. The Wachowski 'brothers' were obviously inspired by the Japanese anime style and they transform that style spectacularly into a life-action movie. Because of the style and flair of the movie, it makes the action look spectacular and even also look as something totally new. The fantastic bullet-time effects were something unseen before and are already alone reason enough why this movie is already almost a classic and certainly unforgettable movie. The style and new effects used in the movie make this movie to be also a refreshing one. It's an extremely original movie, both story-wise and technique-wise.

Especially the action is what truly makes this movie a success. The fight and action sequences are beautifully choreographed. It also all is beautifully shot by cinematographer Bill Pope, who uses some fantastic lighting and camera-angles at times. The musical score from Don Davis is also quite good. Also the costumes and settings most certainly do not disappoint. The special effects are spectacular and also something totally new at times.

The cast is not the strongest element of the movie. Keanu Reeves is fairly good as the main character but he lacks some charisma at times. Some goes for Carrie-Anne Moss to be honest. Actors who do not disappoint are Laurence Fishburne, Joe Pantoliano and the fantastic Hugo Weaving in his real big breakthrough role. He is an excellent 'villain' because of his look and way of acting.

But what really makes and shapes the movie is its story. Yes, it's complex and believe, not everything makes sense or is explained in a satisfying way but it at least is something totally original and imaginative. The story really shapes the movie and its style and make the action and science-fiction elements of the movie work fantastically together.

The movie is great non-stop spectacular action entertaining that doesn't even get slow or boring even when nothing is really happening. This is mainly due to the imaginative powerful story of the movie. If you don't understand and/or get the story the first time, just watch it a second or third time. The movie is worth it. The movie uses multiple layers, symbolism and elements from religions and other styles of movie-making. It makes you discover more new things, every time you watch the movie. One of the most original and influential movies from the '90's and therefor also an absolute must-see!

"Sleepin_Dragon","The Matrix is an epic movie.","22 December 2022","Imagine being told that the world you live in is a lie, that everything around you is simulated, that nightmare comes true for computer programmer Neo.

Over twenty years old, and it still packs a huge punch, The Matrix will forever be a sci fi masterpiece. It is lightening paced, energy charged, and filled with tonnes of original ideas.

Epic action sequences galore, but it is so much more than just an action movie, it covers so many genres, and as such will have a very broad appeal, horror sci fi lovers in particular will find it so rewarding.

The special effects hold up incredibly well, and I still find the scene where Neo wakes up incredibly chilling, Reeves looks so different, you'll question whether it really is him or not.

It was obvious that sequels were going to follow, but of course none of them have quite been able to recapture the sheer magic of the original.

The cast are terrific, and along with Point Break, this ranks as my favourite Keanu Reeves film.

""The Matrix"" looked exciting enough in the trailers, so I decided to give it a look. What I found was an amazing movie, with some of the greatest special effects I've ever seen. The camera angles really work for the action sequences and the choreographed fight scenes made me yearn for more. Say what you want about Keanu Reeves' acting. He may not deliver the best dialogue, but his look can carry a film. He was a great choice for the role of Neo. Carrie Anne Moss was great as was the underrated Laurence Fishburne. I highly recommend this film for those who are a fan of visually stunning movies. It will blow away your senses...","10"
"johnfos","The Matrix has Buddhist themes","11 June 2005","A large part of the appeal of 'The Matrix' for me was the special effects and action-packed scenes. But, on reflection, part of the appeal is also its philosophical and religious underpinnings...

When asked whether Buddhist ideas influenced them, the Wachowski brothers offered an unqualified ""Yes!"" and at a very basic level, the movie portrays two levels of reality: our everyday existence and a deeper, more significant, underlying reality (the matrix). This is very much like the Two Truths in Buddhism: relative truth, in which everything is perception, and ultimate truth which is the way things really are (objective reality).

Because of our ignorance, we mistake the everyday world for something real and objective, and this is the cause of our suffering. As in 'The Matrix', breaking through relative truth to direct contact with ultimate truth represents a high spiritual attainment, some would say enlightenment, an awakening. (Remember the message on Neo's computer screen: ""Wake up, Neo!"")

Mahayana Buddhism suggests that there are great spiritual warriors (like Neo?) who are walking the path from ignorance to enlightenment, and who can in turn guide us on the path.","9"
"Lady_Targaryen","Welcome to the Real World","14 July 2006","''Unfortunately, no one can be told what the Matrix is. You have to see it for yourself''. This is one of the great sentences of this awesome movie, and also when the real adventure starts; with a great cast,special effects that made a revolution and an excellent story, ''Matrix'' really is one of my favorite movies of all! I am very happy that neither Ewan McGregor and Leonardo Di Caprio were cast to be ''Neo'', because I cannot imagine a better Neo then the one Keanu played.

One of the things I love about this movie, is all the discussions and the ideas said through metaphors that are applied to our present society as well as many references to famous literary like ''Alice's Adventures in Wonderland'', Things like the government controlling us, the manipulation that almost all people suffer and even values like the world's pollution,religions, and big population that will eventually bring problems or even the destruction of the human race, is discussed in a covered way in the film. (And I need to say, that the debate about what we define as being real or not, is another good thing to make people think about, as well as the information about human behavior, destroying all the living things and multiplying everywhere we go without ''balance''.)

The Computer hacker Thomas Anderson, well known in the web as ''Neo'', lives an ordinary life working in a respected Software Company. The problem is that he has doubts about the life he is living, and sometimes he doesn't know if he is dreaming or awake. When he contacts Morpheus, considered by the authorities as one of the most dangerous man alive and joins his rebel army, Neo finally sees the reality that happened in the world:

More then 150 years in the future,the world has been devastated and controlled by very intelligent machines, who created a fake version of 20th-century life-the ""Matrix""-to keep the human slaves satisfied, while the AI machines draw power from them. Neo is considered by Morpheus ''The One'', the guy who will lead the humans to overthrow the machines and reclaim the Earth. But Neo needs to learn a lot of things first, and being haunted by the Matrix 's''agents'' (a computer program that take on human form and infiltrate the Matrix to control everything and kill the rebels) will give him a very hard time.","10"

"mounirrmaged","An overrated, outdated pretentious movie","30 May 2017","In the late 90s, summer blockbusters were really suffering quality. There were films like Godzilla, Armageddon, deep impact etc. Point is that these summer blockbuster movies only focused on special effects due to the groundbreaking effects of Jurassic Park, and forgot to give us engaging stories and compelling characters, which became tiresome. In 1999, the matrix was released and blew everyone's mind. The audience were talking about how deep and philosophical, cerebral film it is, something new and innovative. But is it really that? The answer is, to be honest, no.

The idea of a society that realize their reality is an illusion and have to fight authorities is not really new. It has been done in TV episodes, satire, books and many other medium. In fact, even anime did that idea before, just 4 years prior (ghost in the shell). The film is very much outdated, silly, pretentious and not as smart as the movie thinks it is.

There are major problems with the movie, particularly the characters. The characters are so dull, uninteresting and bland that it is so hard to get invested in them. Morpheus is your typical mentor figure, Trinity is a boring character, with so little expressions to show and have zero chemistry with Neo, the main character. There is no reason for her to be in love with him. There has not been a single scene which indicates they should be together. And as for Neo, he is as interesting as a plank of wood, having almost no personality, poor facial expressions. And to top it off, there hasn't been a solid proof why he is ""the one"". There isn't anything special about him, he doesn't have any leadership skills, he doesn't even know what AI is or what EMP stands for.

There is also another major problem. And it's a huge plot hole in the film. Why is there a matrix? Why is this system needed? The humans are planted, so why need to give them a matrix? All they need to do is just find a way to keep the human energy alive. The film is so pretentious, and has this confidence that is smart, but has one of the most cop out endings in a blockbuster movie. Trinity saves Neo with the power of love. How is something like that left in a ""cerebral"", ""philosophical"" movie, when it has an ending that belongs in fairy tales? It's stupid, forced and doesn't add up.

So for all the rant this review has, is the film terrible? Not quite. In fact, it's a decent movie with some clever ideas and analogies, and props for having a major impact on film making and actually trying to do something different in the action genre as well as blockbuster movies, but it's not really the masterpiece it is claimed to be. It's outdated and is deeply flawed. But to some extent, it is understandable why many people love it.","6"
"KillerLord","The Perfect Symbiosis of Action and Philosophy","29 September 2008","What is real? How do you define real? This question has been explored for its significance in metaphysics in other movies as well. The Thirteenth Floor is one of them and the other is Dark City. I mention these because they were released more or less around the same time as this movie was released. But these two movies do not enjoy the position and the popularity of this movie - The Matrix, why? Look at the box office success of the Matrix. Look at the popularity of this movie. Advertisements have been created based on the themes of this movie. Most people seem to have heard of the movie if not seen it. The Matrix enjoys a prominent position in the top 50 on the IMDb. Even a list of 100 best movies of all times as compiled by a documentary on the Discovery Channel mentioned this movie as among the top 100.

The key to the enormous success of the Matrix is the symbiotic combination of two opposing elements. The first one being metaphysics or philosophy and the second element being intense amount of action. The Dark City is limited in its action and stresses more on the metaphysics aspect and so does the Thirteenth floor. When you see The Matrix, you see that there is far more metaphysics and philosophy in this movie when compared to the other two. And when you see the action sequences of the movie, the two movies fade into oblivion.

There is so much for the intellectual to busy himself with in this movie. There is a reference to so many mythological places and figures. The character Neo is an anagram of One signifying the One Absolute many cultures believe in and then there is Trinity, an obvious reference to the Holy Trinity. The names of the ships, the numbers on the door, the name of the book Neo takes his CD out from all have a significance, a clue, if that is what one wants to call it. This movie gives enough to the intellectual to study and talk about.

And yet the movie does not fail to capture the attention of the average movie goer. The average movie goer does not want to search for hidden symbols, he does not want to discuss the movie for hours and hours. He wants some action and some fun. The movie gives that as well. The movie has a lot of guns, a lot of chases and a lot of fighting. The average movie goer can appreciate the main aspect of this movie without bothering about all the hidden symbols which the intellectual chooses to see in the movie. Yet, he apparently does not deny himself the spirit of the movie and enjoys it. And I believe this is what has made the movie successful - the reconciliation between action and thrill and metaphysics and philosophy.

This movie deserves all the praise and success that it has got. My personal all-time favorite. I never get tired of talking about it till date and love to see it with my friends if I get the chance.","8"
"elto-30283","One of the best movies ever! (This review is only about the original Matrix movie)","22 May 2018","The Matrix is one of the best sci-fi movies ever made!

I read it used to be one of Tarantino's favourite ones too, but the second and third ones ruined the whole beautiful idea and brought the overall value of the movie pretty low.

The story/philosophy is mind-blowing and the directing, special effects and the overall performance absolutely amazing.

Thomas Anderson (Keanu Reeves) is an IT specialist in his day-to-day job and a hacker (alias Neo) during the night. He is looking for Morpheous (Lawrence Fishburn) who could give him the answer to the question 'What is the Matrix?' The more relevant questions to ask, though, would be ""How would you know the difference between the dream world and the real world?"" and ""How would you know if what is happening right now is not a virtual reality?""

The antagonist, Agent Smith (Hugo Weaving), is one of my favourite characters. Just watch his mouth - the way he speaks, the tone and pitch of his voice, his pronunciation, even the pauses he makes while speaking, have an incredible effect on the viewer. The concept of people being like cancer to this world is absolutely astounding.

Carrie Ann Moss was the perfect choice for Trinity because any other blond, big lipped, big brested 'bimbo' would have totally ruined her character.

A few more questions pop up in one's mind. ""Haven't we gone too far creating such super intelligent machines?"", ""What if they become so powerfull one day and take control over humanity?""

The acting's just amazing, all of them, no exceptions. The 4 leading characters though... (Morphy, Trinity, Neo & Agent Smith) - (yes, to me there are 4 leads) - I love them all. I can't imagine the movie with any other 4 actors but L. Fishbourn, C.A. Moss, Keanu and H. Weaving. They were born to play those roles.

Whoever did the casting did a terrific job. Bravo!

"RichardRowell328","True Cinematic Achievement","30 January 2005","In the year 1999, ""The Matrix"" and ""Fight Club"" were undoubtedly the best films of the year. The Matrix was truly revolutionary in special effects, specifically in CGI (Computer-Generated-Imaging) technology. The still cameras that were used to capture multiple angles of a single shot, in bullet-time technology, was a creative new approach. The film is initially suspenseful with people not knowing quite what was happening until Morpheus (Lawrence Fishburne) reveals that Neo's (Keanu Reeves) reality was actually a fabricated world that is an elaborate simulation created by machines. Neo and the majority of the world's inhabitants have been stuck in simply a mental simulation prison.

The magnitude of philosophy in sync with special effects make ""The Matrix"" a one-of-a-kind movie masterpiece. College classes show this movie in their philosophy class, and at the same time can prove to be one of the best special effects movies ever. Supplementally, ""The Matrix"" also provides endless action and a pretty solid storyline that influences the philosophical ideas in the movie.

There are so many great things in this movie, it is just crazy.

The color palette along with the time and effort put into stunts also accelerates this movie on all filming levels. ""The Matrix"" leaves the viewer a sense of pride in the world he/she can live in to just know that people are capable of creating at this level. Unfortunately, monetary and timing motives offset the potential quality of the sequels. ""The Matrix Reloaded"" and ""The Matrix Revolutions"" were just a waste of time and weren't carefully thought out, as was the first Matrix.

But I've seen much better movies and I don't think The Matrix should have gotten 8.5 stars on IMDB. Maybe 6.5-7 stars...not 8, it should not be in the top 250. I'm sure there are those that disagree with me but if they really paid attention to this movie, and not be caught up in the craze, I think they'd realize it's just a decent sci-fi movie. It should not be given that many stars, and that there are other movies much better than this one.

The plot is Keanu Reeves plays Neo, a man that thinks something is wrong with the world, and is struggling to find out what it is. He eventually finds Morpheus, who explains to him, why the world seems fake..*minor spoilers revealing plot ahead*.The reason is because the world as we know it is not real, it is really a computer matrix made by machines in the REAL world. The machines create humans in the real world, and load them into the matrix. That way while humans are in the matrix the machines are feeding off their energy to fuel themselves. But Morpheus and his gang have been unpluggged, and they explain all this to Neo, and it results to the amazing special effects climax.

The green Warner Brothers (green? you ask) trademark comes up, and without warning you are thrust into the Wachowski brothers grand vision. 2 hours of excitement later, you stumble out of the cinema, knowing what the Matrix is.

This is one great movie. Keanu Reeves is cooler than cool as Neo. The Wachowski brothers skilful direction is brilliant. The special effects sequences will blow you away, did I mention the government lobby scene?

The film starts off with a 'what is real?' first half, and then the first kung-fu sequence makes way for an action- packed, John Woo-esque second half with slomo and style cranked up all the way to the top. Did I mention the government lobby scene?

Keanu becomes Cool Keanu, Carrie-Anne Moss is a real find and Hugo Weaving is perfect in his against typecasting role as the evil Agent Smith.

"CuriosityKilledShawn","There's something very familiar about all this.","24 May 2004","I've always called the first Matrix film a rip-off. It's a mix of many different films put together with component parts stolen from the Terminator (robots rule the future and have enslaved the remainder of humanity), Total Recall (futuristic 'Is it a dream or reality' sci-fi) and even Johnny Mnemonic (futuristic cyberpunk trash starring Keanu Reeves as a guy who can plug computers into his head and 'go into them'), plus various other works by William Gibson and a lot of Anime.

Thomas 'Neo' Anderson, is a computer programmer/hacker who meets with the mythical cyber-terrorist Morpheous, who asks Neo if he wishes to know the truth about the world or live a lie forever. Neo chooses truth and soon wakes in a gel-filled pod in a techno-hell future. His body, and billions of others, is nothing more than a battery to power the machines that rule the future (exactly what they do with this world that they now rule is not explored).

Convinced that Neo is 'The One', Morpheous trains him to be deadly digital warrior, but this set-up doesn't go beyond fighting a sentient program called Agent Smith. The war against the machines comes later.

There's no denying that the film, unfortunately, was massively influential for virtually every action film that followed. Gone was the 'Die Hard' formula where action was gritty, somewhat realistic, and with practical stuntwork. In it's place they all went for excessive CGI, green-tinted photography, impossible cameras, and impossible physics. The Matrix is semi-stylish with it, but it doesn't ever entertain or excite me.

It's the style of the Matrix that's more fondly cherished than the story. It won 4 technical Academy Awards, proving that all the Matrix is is eye-candy. Call that narrow-minded if you want but I believe this movie is no more than a very, very popular cult movie. A contradiction in terms yes, but still the most appropriate way of describing it.","10"

Here's why. Every story that we see on screen, read in a book or on the web has been told before in one fashion or another. ""Jurassic Park"" is nothing more than a retelling of ""Frankenstein"" when you get right down to it. What catches our attention is when the story is re-told in such a different light that we like the retelling without really being called back to an earlier version. The ""Jurassic Park example can work again for this point. No one sees it as another retelling of ""Frankenstein"" at all, or at least, they don't dwell on the issue. Shakespeare didn't create any stories....he borrowed from other texts, used other sources, and used words to his advantage. The whole thing involves what is called ""intertextuality"", a term that I won't go into here, but is what I am trying to explain in the brief example of ""Jurassic Park.""

Okay, stop yawning.

Now, the Matrix has done the same thing, and what is funny is that very, very few people have recognized the major source of the story ( I wonder if the writers really know ). I have heard that it is supposed to be Christian themed, and while there is some imagery in that respect, like a character named Trinity, Neo's death and rebirth at the end of the movie, the ship's name, etc. etc. etc., the list can go on. But it has nothing to do with the story, which borrows very heavily from a philosophy written by Plato, of all people, back when the years were still labeled as BC.

Plato wrote a philosophy, the actual name escapes me, but I keep hearing it referred to as ""The Cave."" In this philosophy on the workings of a society, Plato stated that if you were to take four people from the day they were born, tie them to chairs so that their heads cannot move, and place them in the back of a cave where they cannot see the opening, nor have any daylight. They only have contact with each other. Now, on the wall that they are facing, they can see shadows moving, be it a shadow puppet play, or whatever you can imagine, but all they see are those shadows. You leave them in this cave for 20 years. The only life that they know is the chair, and the playing of shadows on the wall. They will not know the shadows are merely shadows, nor will they know the idea of freedom, and they will now know anything of the real world. Then, you release one man, let him wander the world for awhile. He sees that the world isn't just shadows on a wall, etc etc. If you put him back in the cave, he will not view the shadows the same way that he once did. He will also try to enlighten the other three that the images on the wall are only shadows, and that there is a beautiful and colorful world outside their cave. But they will not believe him, and will even begin to see him as a blasphemer, and an enemy.

WHEW!!

That's the basic story in the Matrix. Neo has been removed from the cave, and has seen the real world, and now knows he has been seeing shadows his entire life, and his mission is to make humanity realize that they are seeing shadows as well, but until that time, he will be regarded as an enemy by those still inside the cave. The agents are the keepers of the cave, and the Matrix itself is the shadows that we see. When you see this connection, the story can make more sense to those who can't quite understand it.

And so by blending old, old stories with modern filming techniques and great acting by all involved and fast paced action, there is something to be said about this movie being a work of art, because it truly is.","10"

It's not without some flaws and faults, mainly that the matrix is so complex and complicated that its own concept had to be ""bent and broken"" to allow for some of the story to translate to an acceptable theatrical experience. At least to its targeted mainstream audience. In the hands of a quirky and edgy Director it could have been done with more ""in house logic"", but then it would be quite a different experience.

I'm thinking of writing a sci-fi pieceThat's why I'm CALLING you, I was an English major and everyone I know but you is an English major. My mother was a nurse, that's the closest I've ever come to science. You're the only person we know with any scientific education at allWell, we figure to sell, it has to have computers, and it has to have VIOLENCE. We're thinking about an eco-techno-cyberpunk-nuclear winter kind of thing with sequel possibilitiesWell, something like Terminator meets 2001 meets WarGames with some Johnny Mnemonic and Blade Runner thrown inIt's, say, about 200 years from now, and the world has been laid waste and taken over by advanced computers. WHY did they take over the world? Who cares? Because they're bad! What? 'Colossus: The Forbin Project?' Never heard of it. Look, it's just an evil computer, okay? I know computers have no feelings, but it makes a good storybecause it does, that's all.

So I have a question: If you had a worldwide computer network, how would you power it?Huge farms of solar cells---talk about boringwhat else?nuclear power plantswhat else?Look, what about electricity from living things? I've been reading about lightning bugs, you know, how they make that light with their bodies? Well, here's what I've been thinking. The human body is the most efficient source of energy on the planet, right?It isn't? It's an energy CONSUMER? Only about 12 percent efficiency? Well, what about the human brain? It produces electricity, right? Electrochemical? Is that different? And it's the most efficient electricity producer on the planet, right?No? About the same as a 22-watt bulb? That's not very bright. What's that? Neither is my idea? Come on, work with me here! Okay, so what would be an EFFICIENT way to produce power for a worldwide computer network?Vast facilities containing huge tanks filled with methane-producing bacteria that drive gas turbinesThat may be EFFICIENT, but it's not EXCITING, Frank. You can't make a MOVIE about that. How about vast facilities containing HUMAN BEINGS who are all plugged into the Matrixthat's our working title, The Matrix. So they're all plugged into the Matrix because the computers of the Matrix are using them as a power source in their quest for control of the worldAGAIN with the nitpicking about why? See, we're thinking that the humans are kept in these vast hives of cells of, like, amniotic fluid, hooked up to tubes that feed them and wires that connect them to the MatrixThey're fed a nutritious liquid. I don't know where it comes from, or who produces it! I don't care and neither will the audience!

So the people spend their entire lives floating in these little podsNo, they don't exercise, they just floatAtrophy? Osteoporosis? How do they have babies? I don't know, special mating pods! You don't have to be awake to produce semen; every teenage boy knows that. How are they plugged into the Matrix? Wires, of course, you know, implantsI don't know who implants them---robots! It does seem pretty far-fetched, but if I didn't think of those things, neither will an audienceWell, you see, they're all living in this imaginary virtual world that the Matrix computers have designed to look just like real life in the real worldbecause the computers have found that the people produce more electricity that way than if they're just asleep. Why? To sell the screenplay, that's why! So I figure, if their MINDS think they're exercising, their BODIES will think so, too. You know, it's like if you dream you die, you really will diepseudoscientific claptrap? No, what it is, is SHOWBIZ, Frank. But there is a small population of humans who have disconnected themselves from the Matrix and are alive and aware of the real world. They live in a secret city called Zion and are trying to overthrow the Matrix. How did they get disconnected? What do they eat if the world has been laid waste? Who cares? So they're looking for The One, who is the human who will have the power to control the Matrix instead of the other way around, and they find him, a guy named Neo. They manage to unplug him from the Matrix, and he awakens to the real world. It's really cool; we're going to put in all sorts of metaphysical Zen stuff about reality versus illusion and fate and stuff. Where did we learn about Zen? From our massage therapistNeo joins them in their fight. How do they fight? No, they don't blow up the main computer, that's the neat part: They fight the Matrix in the VIRTUAL world. You see, they can plug back in to the Matrix and so enter and leave the virtual world at will. So they fight enemy COMPUTER PROGRAMS, not the physical computer. How? Get this: Lots of way-cool balletic kung-fu stuff like Jackie Chan and lots of balletic gunfights like Chow Yun-Fat, only computer-enhancedLots of mayhem from beginning to end. Why? Because it SELLS TICKETS, that's why!The evil computers are looking for the rebels with machines in the real world, too, and Neo manages to block the computers from destroying the rebels in reality by fighting them in the virtual worldBecause that's the way to plan for sequels, that's whyWell thanks, Frank, you've been really helpful. If we sell the screenplay and it gets produced, we'll get you some free passes. Then you can see all your great ideas on the screen.'","10"

"stevenrotherforth","The Matrix: Revisited. Twenty years on and still an all time great","13 July 2019","The Matrix (4K Blu-ray review)

The summer of 1999 belonged to 'Star Wars Episode 1 The Phantom Menace'. Or so we thought! Twenty years on and its is another science fiction movie that is better remembered. 'The Matrix' lived in George Lucas's movies shadow at the time of release but fans and critics alike hailed the Wachowski brothers film as the true summer blockbuster champion. A game changer in terms of visual effects and a story that was boldly smart and refreshing.

'The Matrix' tells the story of computer hacker Neo played by the always likeable Keanu Reeves. The world in which we live in is a lie. Nothing more than a computer simulation designed to trick humankind. We are fuel for a race of highly advanced artificial intelligence. When Neo meets Trinity played by Carrie Ann Moss she introduces him to Morpheus played with supreme gusto by Laurence Fishburne, Neo is freed from his dream like prison and shown that the real world is an apocalyptic wasteland. Awakened humans hide from murderous machines known as Sentinals and back inside the Matrix Superhuman agents hunt down those who rebel against the system. It's all a bit complex but supremely entertaining and really rather clever.

Twenty years on 'The Matrix' is still fresh. At time of release the visual effects were state of the art and wowed audiences the world over. The 90's really was a decade of brilliance in terms of special effects. 1991 gave us 'Terminator 2 Judgement Day' and 1993 brought us 'Jurassic Park'. The Matrix' finished off the decade by giving us 'Bullet time'. The revolutionary use of multiple cameras to capture a three dimensional image as the shot panned seamlessly around whatever was happening onscreen.

In 2019 'The Matrix is returning to theatres fully restored in 4K. I do recommend that if you never had the chance to see this movie on the big screen you should definitely book a ticket. However for as little as £20 in the United Kingdom the UHD HDR Blu-ray can be yours. If you have a Home Cinema set up then I also highly recommend you purchase this disc.

Originally shot on 35mm, Warner Brothers have released a very good transfer. Ok there's still that layer of grain to the image but in my opinion this only adds to the cinematic look. The original green tint has been refrained to allow HDR to shine through. Unlike the recent 4K restoration of the aforementioned 'Terminator 2' the transfer of 'The Matrix hasn't been given the Digital Noise Reduction treatment. So grain remains but there's still an image that's packed full of detail. Skin looks natural with every pore on Morpheus's face clearly visible. Costume design has real sparkle. The shiny texture of Trinity's clothing is vibrant with contrast levels becoming retina piercing. Blacks are inky and HDR allows shadow detail to be nicely graded. Whilst the picture isn't perfect, there's some overblown image quality in some scenes. Neo's face when he mans the gun in the helicopter springs to mind. Sound quality on the other hand can be considered to be almost demo worthy. The newly remastered Dolby Atmos mix is a belter. Every speaker in your Home Cinema system will be working overtime. There's excellent separation throughout all channels and bass gets really deep. Sometimes gunfire lacked impact but overall this mix is mightily impressive. Well worth the price of the Blu-ray alone.

Revisiting 'The Matrix' was a supremely enjoyable experience. The 4K Blu-ray is the best way to view the film if you can't manage a trip to your local multiplex when the movie gets a brief re-release. This film is and always will be one of the greatest Science Fiction movies of all time.","10"

The Wachowski Brothers sci-fi classic is a true classic. The story is complex, original, intriguing, and extremely detailed. The characters are all unique and they are all very interesting. The story is full of philosophical questions that make you think and the film is so complex it needs to be watched multiple times.

The acting is very good. Laurence Fishburne, Carrie-Anne Moss, Hugo Weaving, Gloria Foster, Joe Pantoliano, Marcus Chong, and many others perform perfectly. Keanu Reeves is a very dry actor. He is very dry in this film but he plays his part well.

The pacing is perfect and the runtime is perfect.

The special effects are good even today.

Little by little one will start to see the light, and everything will make sense. By the second view, you will get a higher conception. By your third view this will amaze you.

"Cineanalyst","Neo-Wonderland of Noir, Philosophizing and Spectacle","3 September 2020","I probably haven't studied any other film from the end of the 20th century more than I have ""The Matrix:"" as a philosophical, political and religious text; as genre entry from cyberpunk, to noir (or ""neo"" noir), and even superhero flick; and as reflexive visual-effects spectacle, mainly, while recently reviewing it for its ""Alice in Wonderland"" allusions. One of the most influential films of its day and, indeed, ever, I also find it continually interesting and thrilling. One need only sample the numerous imitations of the visual effects, fashion of the characters and style of the picture in subsequent movies to understand what a cultural touchstone it became.

References to Lewis Carroll's Alice books are plentiful. Trinity's first messages to Neo conclude with the order to ""Follow the white rabbit,"" which appears as a tattoo. From there, a psychedelic connection is made between the books and film, including a trip to a rave and talk of mescaline recalling Alice's adventures with consuming mushrooms and other substances that altered her size. Neo also transmogrifies after ingesting the red pill. As Wonderland was a dreamworld, Neo also repeatedly wakes up, as if from a dream, after such curious events. He even talks to himself like Alice did, and both have something of identity crises. Stylistically, there are all the shared mirror, doors and staircase motifs, and the zoom-ins through the Matrix code have the appearance of traveling through rabbit holes. A similar symbolic relationship could be made of Neo's rebirth from his womb-like pod, as he's flushed down another sort of rabbit hole. Upon first exiting the Matrix, Neo literally enters the looking-glass--or, rather, becomes one with it. Before this, Morpheus explicitly cites ""Alice in Wonderland"" in comparison to Neo's experience--in a room with checkerboard floor tiles no less. Another children's book is once referenced, too, with ""The Wonderful Wizard of Oz"" (or, surely more often thought of, the 1939 film), written as an Americanized and dumbed-down version of its Victorian counterpart. Also note that it's the ""ignorance is bliss"" character--whose own name, ""Cypher,"" suggests a lack of critical thinking, as well as computer code--who mentions Dorothy and Kansas.

Of all the genres one could ascribe to ""The Matrix,"" I find noir the most compelling, including as it applies to the Carrollian dreamworld and ties into the issues of choice and fate and the rest of the philosophizing. Noir, or more specifically neon-noir, style is established from the opening of the Warner Bros. logo, which appears in neon green over a black-and-white background. Henceforth, dark colors dominate along with the standard low-key lighting, as well as the neon lights and greens. Even the office exit signs are green instead of red, as if giving the greenlight for Neo to exit the Matrix. We also get some variation in color correction to distinguish the dream and real worlds. One of the main ways noir and Wonderland are connected here are by the wake-up calls. In noir, such a metaphorical awakening to whatever mystery or murderous corruption oft begins with a literal phone call. Sam Spade in ""The Maltese Falcon"" (1941), for instance, wakes up to a ringing phone whereupon the police inform him of his partner's murder. Likewise, Neo receives literal wake up calls from phones and clocks, but also in the first scene in which we find him, where Trinity sends through his computer screen, ""Wake up, Neo."" Moreover, all of the inhabitants of the Nebuchadnezzar hovership are only able to be awakened from their adventures in the Matrix via land lines, and they also communicate with members back on the ship through their mobile flip phones. Another noir device exploited is the cleansing rain, employed here for Neo's extraction from the Matrix. And, we get at least a couple femme fatale candidates: mainly, Trinity and, more briefly, the woman in red. Meanwhile, Morpheus fills the mentor role, and his name recalls the god of dreams and sleep. The other important names here also tend to take on a religious significance, which fits rather well with the implications of awakening, as well as fate and whatever variation on fighting corruption or evil characteristic of noir.

Neo is a messiah figure. He's the ""One"" (even ""Neo"" is an anagram of this). Although there are other sectarian references and, generally, the picture is pluralistic, more specific to the Christian conception, as a Christ figure, Neo is awakened by ""Trinity,"" as in the one from the Christian doctrine. Although not antithetical to the predestined disposition many noir gumshoes find themselves in, this blatant religious allegory seems to me more consistent with the superhero genre--especially with Neo's Superman-like flying and other supernatural abilities and saving of humanity. Heck, just consider the similarities in how phone booths are used or the alter egos. Since the Richard Donner films, at least, Superman has been a Christ figure--crucifixion poses and resurrections included, and the theme has only become only more entrenched with the versions directed by Bryan Singer and Zack Snyder.

Philosophically, the film most explicitly references Jean Baudrillard's ""Simulacra and Simulation,"" the book featured in Neo's first scene and hollowed out to the chapter ""On Nihilism,"" alluding to the fiction and meaninglessness of his existence inside the Matrix, as well as Neo's similarities with the original popular Nietzsche Übermensch, or Superman. Later, Morpheus quotes the ""desert of the real"" from the same book and within a TV-enclosed simulation no less. My main criticism of ""The Matrix,"" however, would be that it's too simplistic and unambiguous in its dreamworld and real-world dichotomy, including to sustain any sort of Baudrillardian or otherwise sophisticated postmodern exploration. That said, I think it does better with its other major philosophical or spiritual allusion, which like Wonderland is initiated by another sort of tunnel, as well as other sort of chiaroscuro effects akin to those of noir, the cave allegory of Plato. Theologians have spent centuries, too, on making Platonism compatible with Christianity, which makes for a nice fit for ""The Matrix."" Central to this is the Oracle--the sort of prophet that Plato's Socrates visited at Delphi. Indeed, the one in the film points to the words above her kitchen door ""know thyself"" in Latin, but which is actually an Ancient Greek aphorism from that Temple of Apollo. It's also a maxim attributed to Socrates.

What I like most about the cave allegory, though, is that with its illusory, flickering shadows, it's well suited to cinematic reflexivity, as are dreams. For all its Baudrillardian and hamfisted cyberpunk polemic of man-v-machines, railing against the illusion of the Matrix, this is a film that is based in fantasy and spectacle. It's not that this can't be read cleverly: as a geek fantasy of mind-over-matter, of hacking, hiding and surviving in reality but looking cool fighting in shades, leather and trench coats when plugged in (literally plugged in--love the puns, including the bug one); as struggle against authority and conformity of corporate cubicles (even their names suggest a dull orthodoxy: Anderson, Smith) or literal silencing by Agent Smith's ""gestapo tactics;"" or, in light of the Wachowskis subsequent transitions, as a transgender allegory (reportedly, studio cowardice prevented there being a trans character on screen). All of which fits well with the Wonderland transmogrification, noir awakening and philosophical illusions. Peer into the looking-glass, however, or the reflections in bending spoons, sunglasses and skyscraper windows, and the most apparent dreamworld is film itself.

The closest here to a film-within-film is the old-fashioned television, which Morpheus rather ironically employs to introduce Neo to reality and to explain the Matrix. This film and the art form in general are fundamentally about dualities, doubles, déjà vu, ""living two lives."" This is the basis of acting, too, of someone pretending to be another, of changing appearance inside simulations, of agents body snatching, of wanting to be ""someone important, like an actor."" It's also telling that the best parts occur in the simulations. Befitting the now-retro tech of the film, what with the land lines, flip phones, monitors and all becoming almost as antiquated as that TV, this is a film when films were mostly still films, albeit digitally enhanced. We're introduced to Neo with the computer screen reflecting back upon his face, or rather vise versa, as well as kung-fu training seen through computer code and many other shots framed by screens--mise-en-abymes, a world inside computers. This stands next to the best capturing of motion from multiple cameras with the bullet-time photography since the chronophotography of the likes of Eadweard Muybridge. Trinity's entire opening sequence runs through homages to masters of filmic spectacle past, from Hitchcock's ""Vertigo"" (1958) and ""The Birds"" (1963) to Spielberg's ""Duel"" (1971). It's not without irony, too, that these wannabe saviors of humanity, in fact, slaughter a lot of humanity, including in the ultraviolent lobby shootout, complete with slow-motion and Neo's trench coat framed at his feet like a superhero cape, or every time they kill an agent inhabiting another's body, such as after that Western-style standoff in a subway. This is a picture of illusion--a visual-effects spectacle. In the end, with the ""One"" synthesizing the duality, it's we, the spectator, who wake up from the spectacular Wonderland, the flickering shadows of the simulated world inside a film, and exit the dream.","9"

When the Matrix first came out back in 1999 I was still in my babyhood. I never got the opportunity nor was it possible for me to see it on the big screen. I have always wondered what that experience might have brought. I'm sure the people who were lucky enough to witness it in the theatres, had their money's worth.

The people who are still unaware, let me just say that the last half an hour is a blast. I can't stress this enough, but I freaking loved anything and everything about the final act. I have heard nothing but compliments about the action and how it revolutionized the whole genre; now I can truly understand why! It was incomparable, the experience was one of a kind.

So it was, for the rest. It would be a crime If I dare to take anything away. What an amazing concept and what's more impressive is how they managed to weave a palpable narrative all around the same. Do remember, a great idea can only do so much on its own! You need to have a functional story, a considerable amount of technological backing and most of all a slew of unforgettable personalities who would work as these catalysts in your tale.

The Matrix had 'em all, as simple as that. A ""Classic"" in the truest sense of the word!","5"
"TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews","Could this possibly have been any better?","9 April 2009","I base this on the Ultimate 10-Disc Set. An entire decade after this came out, it still holds up incredibly well. It simply has so much to offer... all that food for thought, different beliefs, tons of themes that are explored and such immense room for interpretation, with very little in this being certain or definite. The plot is excellent, develops well, and combines various interesting ideas(and no, they weren't original, they weren't meant to be... this puts a lot of fascinating concepts together, and presents them all for the mainstream audience). Granted, it spawned a ton of suddenly enlightened pocket philosophers with little doubt as to their own prowess, but with anything this influential, there are going to be some negative results. The pacing is spot-on, not a moment of this is too long or overly short. The action is astounding, exciting, fun, entertaining and awesome, and they manage to do amazing and memorable sequences. No, perhaps it does not dodge all of the clichés. The slow-motion(and bits clearly inspired by John Woo) and other tools appeared before this, yes, the point isn't that they were new... it's the way this uses them, and creates a unique style. Mixing Noir, Animé and countless allusions, and doing so with expert-like skill is an impressive feat. The Bullet-Time was invented for this, and it is fantastic. The martial arts, the choreography, the moves, magnificent. The effects are stunning and seamless, to this day. The cinematography and editing are perfect, and enormously well-planned. The mood and atmosphere is masterfully achieved. The acting is quite good, Reeves fits, Moss and Fishburne are marvelous, and Weaving is utterly impeccable. The dialog is almost completely invariably well-written, and well-delivered. There is no nudity or sexuality, at most hints thereof. There is language, moderately harsh, albeit not too bad in frequency. The DVD holds a text introduction(to the following) by the Wachowski's, that makes for a great read, as well as two commentary tracks, one of philosophers who enjoyed the film, Dr. Cornel West & Ken Wilder, and one of critics who did not care for it, Todd McCarthy, John Powers & David Thompson. These are worth listening to. I recommend this to any fan of science fiction, and anyone who wishes to be encouraged to think by what they watch. 10/10","10"

The music by Don Davis is great, suitably epic and high tech with a solid soundtrack that suits the film's tone.","9"
"ccthemovieman-1","A Bit Confusing But A Big F/X Treat","18 October 2006","Special-effects were the drawing card when this came out at the end of the 20th century, and those effects were spectacular. They lived up to their billing.

Unfortunately, the story was a bit confusing for much of the two hours, a bit too secular-minded for me, although others have viewed this with Biblical analogies. I do think the script could have used some humor here and there. It took itself a little too seriously. That was especially true for the four main characters.

Nonetheless, because of the stylish visuals and effects, it entertained. I liked the monotone-speaking Hugo Weaver the best, or at least found him the most interesting. Lawrence Fishburne's character came in a close second in that regard.

Once again here's a movie that made you glad VHS tapes were being phased out in favor of sharper, widescreen transfers.","6"
"Manchui","Good but not ""The Greatest Film Ever Made""","10 September 2001","Ok, I'm getting sick of comments saying stuff like ""The Matrix is the greatest film EVER MADE!""

That's complete and utter bullturd. Yes, it had great cinematography and effects, yes it had a great soundtrack but NO WAY was the acting superb and NO WAY was the storyline great.

Take that storyline and stick it in any other action movie and you would leave feeling disappointed at the end. It's major selling point was ""What is the Matrix? You have to see it for yourself."" Come on, the only plot twist was that thing to do with Cypher, and that wasn't greatly unforeseeable, there's things like that in every frigging action movie.

The thing that set it apart was the ground-breaking camera effects, gnarly special effects and a funky soundtrack, as well as the costume design bit, with all that leather and expensive sunglasses. Without this stuff, all you would be left with is your average action movie.

I'm not saying it was a bad film at all, just not one of the greatest. Highly entertaining, great to watch with your mates, definitely one of the most interesting films in recent years. But give me The Third Man, Memento or the Usual Suspects any day.

"meathookcinema","A very deep film- if you only watch films at your local multiplex","21 January 2018","I missed this when it was first released. However, at the time I saw clips of the fights scenes and the slow mo bullet sequences and was duly impressed. What would i think of the film on first viewing almost 20 years later?

I never lost interest during this film and I can see why it was such a huge hit in 1999. Its heartening when any highly stylised film which isn't utter base level bilge to take megabucks at the box office.

But heres where The Matrix succeeds brilliantly. It offers mind blowing concepts- but isn't too deep. It offers striking visuals- which unfortunately quickly became de rigueur as many other films, commercials and pop videos copied this visual style. Not the fault of the filmmakers and as they say, imitation is the sincerest form of flattery.

Certain parts of the film feel like a comic book fans fapfest. The costumes assumed by the main protagonists would only be thought cool by basement dwelling geeks. Black PVC, long coats and clumpy boots- a cyberpunk's wet dream. Soo late 90s.

But this film did dare to take to the masses something original and daring. It succeeded. Fair play especially in these times of stale remakes and turgid reboots. But don't try to interpret things too deeply. Beneath the surface isn't a whole lot of depth or substance. Precisely why it was so massive.

The scene need the end where we learn that Neo really is 'the one' is one of the most bombastic, unintentionally hilarious sequences in modern cinema. I don't know if its pure cheese, genius or both. Which is noteworthy in itself.

But for a film that tries to show us what the modern world is really like and what it revolves around I'll still stick with They Live. A film that accomplishes its mission statement with less gloss, has infinitely more depth, substance and charm and does so on a substantially smaller budget than The Matrix.","7"
"sampsonart","Ahead of its time!!","4 August 2019","I saw this movie at the theater in 1999. Awesome movie I'm almost every way. I recently watched it with my 10 year old daughter and she absolutely LOVED it as she is into sci fi. I cannot figure out however why it's rated R!! I feel like it should be PG-13. What's with the R rating? It's not like it had major language or violence and gore.. it had no sex or nudity either. Just unsure why was rated R but whatever, still a great movie. Can't say I remember 2 and 3 that we'll though","7"
"TheOny13","Am I the only one who thinks this movie is overrated? (Major Spoilers)","16 March 2017","I see that on this site only the positive reviews for this film are promoted to be on the first pages, which is at least one-sided if not preferential. This makes me think I won't even get read by other users yet alone supported by them (since they all find this movie awesome)... but whatever let me tell you what I think about this movie:

The Story: Is probably the most important part of this movie and simultaneously the one which this movie gets so awfully wrong.

1. The concept of machines imprisoning humans was exploited so many times by so many TV Shows (Stargate SG-1 for example had a similar concept driven episode) and movies (Dark City), so I expected this movie to go deep into why would machines imprison humans and have authenticity in its core. I got 0 of that, in fact what did I got? Some stupid explanation saying the machines imprisoned humans because humans loose energy as heat through their skin. OK, it might seem plausible at first sight, but if you know a little about human or about chemistry you will find this concept ridiculous and impossible. Humans lose through heat about 30% of the energy they consume. So that would mean the machines would have to supply the humans with so much energy and then consume the 30% they lose through heat (basically 100% energy used to keep humans alive to 30% energy remained for machines. That means the machines would lose about 70% of the energy they have or invest into sustaining humans alive) why? Because the script says so. If they have that much energy to sustain humans and their necessities for so long why not kill the humans and stick to maybe consume lightning energy which this movie shows to be very satisfying.

2. The explanations Morpheus gives Neo are so thin, maybe thinner than a balloon inflated to its maximum. The Matrix was weaker at the beginning so that they escaped? Why hasn't anyone else escaped? How was the Matrix weaker? Does this movie or the next one in the trilogy explain this? No... But yeah because there's a bad-ass character saying these we all should believe this and then say that this movie is a benchmark for all sci-fi to come? I cannot believe that I'm living on this planet where people are fooled so easily by ridiculous explanations that are so thin and they think that they are smart by watching these kind of movies. Oh, but there's more... when other directors come up with a movie thought over 15 years (Inception) and so authentic and realistically executed that starts from correct premises and then exaggerates like any other movie, people make reviews like: ""Overrated because it makes people ""feel"" smart..."". It's incredible that a director that has been making movies since 7 years old and thinks so much about its movies is repaid with bad reviews from people who clearly didn't understood the movie and don't care about dreams, while this movie gets so much praise for having an incorrect premise that just becomes worse as the movie progresses.

3. There's no plot twist that can make you say: Yes this movie was thought from start to finish. This movie is just a bunch of action scenes mixed with some poorly explained concepts that have an incorrect scientifically premise and has just enough of all of them to fool the average audiences.

The Action: The only part in which this movie succeeded was the action which indeed revolutionized the action flicks back then. Along with the CGI this makes the movie watchable at best (for me at least). But here there are some unexplained things like why if you kiss a person connected to the matrix that person revives and more... becomes even more powerful. It's like a children's movie where the handsome prince kisses the princes or vice versa and she/he wakes up and then they live happily ever after. I expected much more from a movie praised by so many people, but I got 0 explanation for how Neo revives from Trinity's kiss.

The Characters: Bland and boring... and so cold especially Morpheus, who was made like this maybe to make him appear more bad-ass. Neo's character is childish for a movie of this magnitude. The chemistry between him and Trinty is not convincing for me. I mean, for the duration of the whole movie she's just kicking ass like Neo, and then they suddenly are lovers... but their relationship has no development because the script is so poor in substance and creates no circumstance in which these characters might interact with each other beside kicking ass and saying one-liners.

The Soundtrack: (gotta hurry, word limit) The most bland soundtrack I've heard in my life. For how this movie is promoted as being one of the best ever... I expected a soundtrack that could match this reputation. Actually if you search Don Davis, this composer is known only for Matrix and maybe Jurassic Park III but aside from that, he was never nominated for golden globe, bafta or Oscar (not to say that those matter but other great composers were nominated at least 10 times to Oscars or baftas). There was not a single iconic track in this movie and the score as a whole is just forgettable and underwhelmed.

Hope I could include everything I wanted to say in this review. I probably won't get any support for this review, because every person on this planet adores this movie and IMDb supports only good reviews for this movie. And as to why I rate this movie with 5 is because of the CGI and action scenes, because the rest: premise, story, substance or authenticity of the script are either missing or are so thin as a inflated balloon (oh, wait the rating of this movie is as inflated as a inflated balloon... inflated by average people who like only mindless or pseudo-intelligent action).","7"
"bob the moo","Perfect sci-fi, great action and perfect plot for the internet loser generation (like me!)","20 June 2002","Neo is a computer programmer by day and a internet hacker by day. When he is approached by the shadowy terrorist Morpheus he chickens out and gets caught by the secret police. However later Morpheus grabs him again and shows him the truth  that his life is a virtual reality provided by computers while his body, and the bodies of all other humans are harvested in pods for energy. Morpheus believes that Neo is the one who will bring down the matrix and return humans to the planet's surface, however the computers seek to kill the small group of humans who exist outside of the pods. Neo learns to control the matrix to battle the computers.

Has anyone not seen this? The plot is a perfect set-up for all teenagers who believe their dull lives must be fake and that they can be a gun battling hero. That's the story of Neo and it's well told  we have Neo in the matrix, Neo getting trained by Morpheus and then returning to battle the computer drones. The story is involving and the effects make it totally convincing. The plot is clever and never totally falls into action for action's sake. Although the first half is far superior is better than the second which does tend to give into the rules of Hollywood excess.

The action is fantastic. After so many spoofs and rip-offs of the effects and martial arts (Charlie's Angels etc) it's easy to forget how amazing it was when it was first done here. Here it is done well and isn't treated like a joke like it was in Charlie's Angels. The plot being set in the matrix means we can accept the effects as part of a VR creation and take them seriously without thinking they are OTT. The only thing is that the action is so attractive that it's almost sexy  but should we find two trench coating wearing people walking into a building and killing dozens attractive?

That aside it's cool to see wire work put into Hollywood movies (and done well too). Reeves is cool and is suited to the role. Fishburne is even better  how does he keep those glasses on? Carrie Anne Moss is good but falls into the role of love interest later on. Pantoliano is good and Weaving is slimy as one of the computer sentinels.

The plot is good and opens itself to a nice religious interpretation that isn't very well hidden. Neo is `the one' who has come to save mankind, Trinity is a character etc etc. How this sits with the violence is anyone's guess but it makes it quite a nice distraction.

Overall this is very enjoyable and very well scripted. The only down side is that the fantastically choreographed fights and gun battles really glamorise violence to a worrying degree. However if you're watching an action movie then that's what you accept otherwise don't watch. For me  I can't wait for the sequels.","9"
"TxMike","One of the best DVDs out so far, much more than just a movie!","30 September 1999","December 2019 update. My wife and I just watched this again on Blu-ray, even though we have seen it multiple times it still is captivating. Simply a marvelous movie, and some might make the case that this is the best movie ever made.

This is a review of ""The Matrix"" on DVD.

If you like sci-fi action movies, this is certainly one to watch, even to own. For what it is, I give it a ""10"". It kept me wide-eyed all the way through. I'm sure I'll be saying the same thing after my 20th viewing, sometime in the year 2015. (Update: it is now 2019, and I have seen it maybe 8 times, still a great, ground-breaking movie, I come away even more impressed each time. Simply one of the best and thought provoking movies ever made.)

The DVD picture is perfect all the way through, and the 5.1 surround sound is quite thrilling. But, the ""extra"" features are a big reason to buy the DVD.

One ""extra"" is the whole movie played at a subdued sound level while the editor, special effects supervisor, and actor comment on their own reactions and explanations of various scenes.

Another ""extra"" is playing the movie in normal mode where a white rabbit appears during certain scenes. If you want to see how that scene was filmed, you can click when the white rabbit appears and it will take you to the ""behind the scenes"" shooting. Then the movie resumes.

There also is a featurette which shows how the entire movie was filmed. Or, you can play the musical soundtrack alone.

All in all, a great action sci-fi movie with the most interesting set of ""extras"" I have seen so far on a DVD. Isn't it amazing how much stuff they get on that small disc that only holds about 70 minutes of music in its CD version!!","9"

"guskeller","Generational experience","6 November 2021","The Matrix defines Y2K sci-fi action. Its special effects are most notable because a combination of CGI and practical gives the film a dreamlike, yet grounded feel. Plenty of action is enhanced by effects in The Matrix, but the highlight has to be the shootout in the lobby because it is done without CGI. Painstaking work was put into actually dismantling that lobby and it paid off. Next, the production design of The Matrix builds a sleek world of green hues and leather jackets that still inspires aesthetics today. The dystopian future is appropriately bleak while the computer world is appropriately polished.

Meanwhile, The Matrix has dynamic camerawork. Its use of the bullet time effect has become synonymous with the film and is even known as ""the Matrix effect"". The sound design is surreal and the music is borderline iconic. The story is philosophical and trippy. Lastly, the direction is wonderful because The Matrix has such a precise style. Its combination of eastern and western action, its slick fashion, and its futuristic visuals create an experience that cannot be replicated. Because The Matrix is jam-packed with so much excitement, flair, and abstraction, it is a generational experience.

"Buddy-51","uninvolving sci-fi thriller","30 October 1999","As the world and the movies head into a brand new millenium, old narrative formats have been gilded with all the techno/cyber concepts and jargon that now inundate us in our daily lives. In no areas of filmmaking is this more true than the action/adventure and sci-fi genres. Probably the most popular example to date comes in the form of ""The Matrix"", a film that actually chooses as its setting a never-never land located somewhere between reality and the abstract plane of cybernetics.

The plot of the film, though too complex to reiterate here, is actually put forward in a fairly straightforward, comprehensible manner. What is missing from the film is the essential grounding in reality that makes the audience care if the main characters succeed in their mission (to rescue the world of course) or fail. Unlike say ""Enemy of the State"", which managed to grapple with the potential dangers of an over-computerized and mechanized society in a world with which we are all familiar, ""The Matrix"" takes us to a sci-fi world that never fully engages the audience in even its own reality. Part of the problem may be that the film's visual designers settle for the conventional sci-fi view of the future world as a series of dark, cramped, fog enshrouded rooms and corridors familiar to us from countless such movies. We follow the obviously well thought-out and meticulously explained storyline but find ourselves never particularly engaged in the characters or feel any stake in the outcome of the final resolution. As to the film's much vaunted special effects, they are, admittedly at times, intriguing, but since computer graphics now make even the most preposterous situations possible on the screen, the audience craves more than simply scattered moments of jawdropping visuals to engage its full attention. ""The Matrix"" borders on dullness quite often during its overlong 136 minute running time. Perhaps a movie that takes place in a world that really isn't a world needs a more engaging central character to make the audience care.","10"

"Ashrith26","Good, but highly overrated.","17 April 2021","First of all, the movie isn't that bad to watch. It would be a genuine delight to sci-fi lovers. But I don't think it deserves a 8.7 rating and a place in the IMDb top 20.

One thing that doesn't delight me is that the main strength of the movie which is about the computer simulation isn't an original idea. There have been lots of theories regarding it. And the plot is very simple with many plot holes. Neo as the chosen one isn't portrayed correctly. I see no special abilities in him.

Fights were really silly and were too long where you get bored and just want to skip them and I see no reason why trinity fell in love with neo when they didn't spend any time together at all , just because a fortune teller told her that she would fell in love with the chosen one , is it how emotions work? Well , I don't think so.

Apart from these there are a bunch of positive things too. Special effects were awesome considering that this movie came out in 1999. The idea of the story is innovative for Hollywood and matrix came out in era where there isn't much interest in sci-fi among filmmakers while the thrillers ruled them. So these things made it highly rated back then in 1999. Watching today wouldn't make much sense considering that special effects based movies are ruling the theaters now and every now and then sci fi movies are being released.","9"

"nyc man","Sci-Fi done well. Try to watch ""The Matrix"" before seeing ANY reviews (including this one)","14 April 1999","(Correction of a reference I made in my review of April 12,1999)

1. The feel of ""The Matrix"": This is a movie that envelops you, and is reminiscent of two works: a movie and an excerpt from a novel. The first is the 1-hour made-for-TV-film ""The Lathe of Heaven,"" by Ursula K. Le Guin which was broadcast on Channel 13 / Educational TV back in 1980: after the film, I felt I was a character living in the film. ""The Lathe of Heaven"" was about a character whose dreams become reality; every time he wakes up, he is in a new future / futuristic setting where everything changes in accordance to his dream.

Kurt Vonnegut (in ""Breakfast of Champions"") had a small sci-fi concept in one of his books called (approximately) ""A message from the creator."" In this story, God writes a book to the only person in the world. God tells him that the entire world was created for him, all religions were invented so he could have a choice of religions, and other people were merely robots who had a specific purpose, such as fighting with him. Thus, whatever he does doesn't matter, since no one else is real but him. The character reads this book, and goes insane, thinking that it is true.

Similarly, when you leave ""The Matrix,"" you wonder what is real and what is a simulation. After the movie, my friend walked across the street blindly ignoring cars, perhaps trapped in the illusion that this was not real. It took several minutes for him to escape this fantasy world. It affected me similarly.

2. Personal Reactions: a) Movie was great (tentatively on my list of ""top 12 movies"" for me). b)I did not like Fishburne's pockmarked face and grimaces. c)Some corniness in the awakening kiss given to Keanu/Neo, that in my mind, could be traced to reality: people in comas do hear and can respond after what appears to be death.

3. Plot Holes: How did the Operator recover from being killed/shot? How did the Oracle know what would happen?

4. Political Correctness: a) Two to four black heroes who could easily have been white; b) a possible lesbian; c)a Latino; d)a short person; e)bad white guys(and no bad ethnic types); f) a middle-aged kindly motherly type, g)even a few kids as potential heroes, with one being a guru.","10"

"Erewhon","Cyber-action-film noir-satiric-thriller is hyper-cool, great fun","29 March 1999","The Wachowski Brothers enjoy action movies, but like the rest of us, realized that most of those made by Hollywood in the last dozen years or so have been basically mindless, however entertaining they are in other ways.

So they wrote THE MATRIX -- actually, before they wrote BOUND -- and had a hard time selling it. No wonder. It's furiously intelligent, very serious but with an undertone of dark comedy that makes it different from all other action movies. While clearly influenced by movies like BLADE RUNNER and ALIEN/ALIENS, they've also clearly been jazzed by comic books, cyber-science fiction of the William Gibson school, Hong Kong action movies and Japanese anime, as well as classic Hollywood films noir.

But while they're clearly influenced by this heady stew, they've stirred into something fresh and original, and provided a back story so rich that dozens of other stories could be set in this same universe without ever getting around to actually doing a sequel to THIS story.

Keanu-bashers will be deeply disappointed, because Reeves is terrific here, as is the rest of the cast, including the ultra-cool Laurence Fishburne. But the standout performance comes from Hugo Weaving as the head bad guy; it's hard to believe he played the leading role in THE ADVENTURES OF PRISCILLA, QUEEN OF THE DESERT.","10"

I remember having to stop multiple times and double check if it was the right movie. I remember it coming out, I remember being unable to watch it. I remember all my friends giving me 'spoiler-free' reviews. No one could stop talking about this movie for way to long. I remember, almost instantly, becoming 'that guy who has not seen it yet', and I think that's part of the reason I didn't get around to watching it quickly.

You can't survive to watch this movie without spoilers.

The entire movie is built around a single concept, and that is a big reveal. It is also a huge pop-culture reference, so I almost want to hint at it, but it isn't the point. I wish I could have been in a theater when people hadn't seen this movie, or even considered the idea that drives this movie.

It must have been quite a horrifying shock to experience Neo's story without spoilers.

I can think of dozens of pop culture jokes/references to the matrix. None of them do anything to help build or maintain the shock of the original reveal. Rather they just turn in into an odd kinda joke. I really wish I could go back to the theaters and experience that gasp that must have gone through the theater on opening night.

"rparham","The Matrix, unparalleled","27 March 2006","When it first premiered in the spring of 1999, I believe few individuals could predict the impact that The Matrix would have, not just on cinema, but on pop culture in general. What began as a modestly budgeted action-science fiction film starring an actor with little thespian acclaim quickly became a touchstone for the popular zeitgeist, and arguably cut into the popularity and impact of the soon to be released Star Wars Episode I. Time has not been kind to the franchise that was The Matrix: the two back to back produced sequels, The Matrix Reloaded and The Matrix Revolutions, were met with critical derision and public indifference, especially Revolutions, which did not live up to the box-office success of Reloaded. However, looking back at the original film, it's easy to be reminded of why The Matrix was such a hit in the first place.

For those unaware of the basics, The Matrix focuses on Thomas Anderson, aka Neo (Keanu Reeves), a computer hacker who is searching out a fellow hacker, Morpheus (Laurence Fishburne), whom Neo believes will give him answers to several questions he is holding, most specifically the question ""What is The Matrix?"" Neo eventually meets Morpheus through an associate of his, Trinity (Carrie-Ann Moss), and Neo is finally told what he may not have truly been ready to hear: The Matrix is an interactive software program that the entire human population is connected to and through which they appear to live out normal lives. In reality, humans are connected to a giant power plant and are held here by a race of sentient machines that have conquered the world and use humans as a power source. To keep them under control, they are attached to The Matrix, but some humans have managed to break free from the machine's control and are now building a resistance, with the eventual intention of destroying the machines and the Matrix and freeing all humans from bondage. Morpheus believes that one of the keys to accomplishing this goal is Neo, whom he believes is ""The One"", an individual with the power to control and reshape the Matrix at will, and who will lead the humans to victory.

To be completely honest, much of the Matrix is not tremendously new. Many elements are lifted from countless science-fiction novels and stories, and the film's writers-directors, The Wachowski Brothers, Larry and Andy, were unabashed in their love of particular types of cinema that they liberally ape here: martial arts and action movies, as well as a hint of Japanese Anime. However, as a package deal, The Matrix works stunningly well. While those who have read science fiction, or are fans of the genres of film that the Wachowski Brothers used as their inspiration for The Matrix, may be able to recognize some aspects of the film, most viewers of mainstream cinema would not have seen most of the components in The Matrix, therefore making it a unique experience. Even for those that can pick out the source elements, The Matrix is an entertaining blend of much of the familiar in fresh packaging. It's difficult to remember now, with all the knockoffs and ""homages"" in the years since, what a new look and feel The Matrix had at the time. The fetishistic use of black leather costumes, the impressive martial-arts sequences, the elaborate visual effects, most specifically the ""bullet-time"" super-slow-motion shots and the film's rather understated religious undertones were not worn out and overused by countless other films picking at The Matrix's bones. Everything here was new to the mass audience, and that alone could account for a large chunk of the film's success.

Now, with the hindsight of seeing the two sequels, it's easy to see what a pared-down film The Matrix truly was. While it is obvious that the film has to take time to set up it's characters and situations, it is a very fast paced film, with very little fat on it. The Matrix glides along, never overstaying it's welcome in a particular scene and sequence. Many accused Reloaded of being a overstuffed film, but none of that is in The Matrix.

One of the film's greatest strengths is it's character development. Neo, Morpheus and Trinity are not the most fleshed out characters in film history, but at the same time, they are not shallow. Each is developed enough to give us some insight into them, becoming individuals that we come to be invested in. Neo especially, being the focus of the film, is given the most screen time, and he acts as a surrogate for the audience, taking us slowly into the world of the film, allowing the new environs and situations to unfold in a natural, unforced way.

Visually, The Matrix is stunning. It's production design and visual effects are both noteworthy (the film won the Academy Award for best visual effects for that year), with the ever popular ""bullet-time"" sequences, as mentioned previously, being the standout. The Matrix also benefits from the decision made by the filmmakers to have the main actors train to perform most of the fighting sequences themselves, giving them all the more verisimilitude, as opposed to stunt doubles.

Despite the bad taste left in many viewers and fans mouths by the two sequels, The Matrix is still a powerful and memorable piece of film that is as influential and pivotal as the Star Wars franchise, and deserves it's place in history.","7"
"happytoms","Are you the one ?","24 June 2019","If you are looking for the answer to this question then you are going to find it in the 1999 masterpiece from The Wachowski brothers which watching in 2019 still feels like it could have comed out last week and you wouldn't really notice it's a 20 year old movie. Everything still holds up and doesn't feel that it has aged too much both visualy and story wise. I watched this movie last time in 2012 and remembered quite a lot of the story watching it again in 2019 but this time I paid more attention to everything.

I want to talk about few aspects of the movie very briefly

The story. ( Easy to watch, engaging, action packed about a regular guy whose life changes quite drasticly and the growth of becoming the one he never thought he could. Sound design. (Excellent. When I watched all the fight,action scenes the special effects gave a satisfying feedback in my ears when someone landed a punch or got knocked out.) Cinematography (Feels like they thought about everything and it has that special Matrix feel to everything.) Characters (Most mémorable are Neo which needs no introduction and agent Smith which has a way to intimidate even the viewer and they both are just iconic legends.)

Probably my favourite scenes were the lobby,the rooftop and all the fighting scenes against agent Smith where an underdog just tries anyway even knowing his chances of winning are slim.

To conclude I would say people in the year 2070 could watch this and it would still hold up. Would I reccomend it? Yes. Will I watch it again ? It's great but I will most likely watch it again in few years after somehow my life leads back to Neo.","10"
"DunnDeeDaGreat","Highly overrated film","1 November 2002","The Matrix is one of the most overrated films that I can think of. The film does have good action and some of the most amazing special effects ever put on a film. But the film is also drawn out and confusing. Keanu Reeves is the only one who could play a chacrter as flat as Neo and the rest of the cast expect for Laurence Fishburne and Joe Panotilano all give paper thin performances. I give the action and effects a 10 the plot a 3 which equals about 6.4.","9"
"Spleen","The most intelligent science fiction blockbuster in ...","5 September 1999","... I don't know how long. Probably that's why it didn't do as well as big, dumb, lumbering things like ""Independence Day"" and ""The Phantom Menace"", and a dozen or so films I didn't bother to watch.

Much of what you will have heard about this film is false. You will have heard that the premise is that we're all prisoners in a virtual reality world; but the premise is not that WE are prisoners in a virtual reality world - it's a good deal more interesting than that. You will have heard that it's hip and cynical; but thankfully, it's neither. You will have heard the word ""cyberpunk"" being used, with the odd allusion to films like ""The Ghost in the Shell"" and ""Blade Runner""; but it's NOT pretentious, deep-breathing, tawdry angst of that kind at all. It's really quite charming once you get to know it. Beneath all the up-to-the-minute computer gimcracks lies a gentle and trusting heart.

The central character is played by Keanu Reeves, and I retract my claim that there's no use for the man. Indeed he acts rather well. Admittedly he plays a character who spends most of the film, and indeed most of his life, with the air of someone who (in the words of another character) isn't worried because he expects to wake up soon; but being able to do this well is being able to do something well. Besides, we spend the opening half being at least half as bewildered as he is - even if we've read the plot synopsis. When the set-up is revealed in all its glory I admit that one or two details are a bit far fetched. But I never felt that my intelligence was insulted in the way things had been revealed to me.

Special effects are marvellous. I don't think I've ever seen computer-generated images look this convincing - usually they disfigure a movie - and there are several reasons why they work so well. A dark (but attractively dark) style of lighting shows them at their best. Psychological tricks - well-chosen camera angles, misdirection - are used to make us believe in what we see: no-one makes the assumption that George Lucas made in ""The Phantom Menace"", that software alone will do the trick. And more to the point, a story has been chosen where the kind of technology favoured by Hollywood these days is not out of place. The air of vague phoniness that computer effects impart, the sense that something is deeply wrong, is exactly what we want in a story where something really IS deeply wrong.

Only two things let the film down: the last couple of minutes (and after two fantastic hours I can forgive a little fumble at the end), and a HORRIBLY synthetic musical score, which seems to be there only to make us glad when it stops. Luckily it stops often enough and it only succeeds in ruining one or two scenes. I don't know - maybe this kind of musical pollution has been around for a while, and I only noticed it now because ""The Matrix"", unlike the brainless action movies surrounding us on all sides, deserves better.","5"

"cuddlesatusc","Better than Ever","23 December 2021","I practically grew up on this film and its sequel. I can recite it word for word but I couldn't tell what the words imply about the movie itself. So to rewatch it all these years later and say it holds up pretty well is very satisfying. The combination of overt philosophy, -- ranging from Plato's cave to Descartes' intellectual autonomy-- cyberpunk aesthetic, and balls to the wall action is utilized so well. It shouldn't work at all, but it does. Now the film isn't perfect by any means: Trinity is reduced in the second half of the movie to character on standby mode and while the ending is cool, it leaves the viewer with too many questions that have to be lazily answered in a sequel.","3"
"akdjreview","Groundbreaking thought-provoking film","18 December 2021","The Matrix is groundbreaking and the start of the modern-day effects we see today. From everything to the action, to the acting, to the beautiful cinematography. The Matrix flourishes and perfects everything there is. The film is the beginning of modern-day effects and action and many movies have taken inspiration from it.

The storyline manages to capture the audience interest from the get go. Containing a storyline that makes you think and question your own reality to induce questions you might not have thought about before. Every single scene serves its purpose meanwhile every single scene is incredibly thought out, with no unnecessary scenes.

With incredibly thought out scenes comes beautifully filmed scenes that are nothing less than eye-catching. There are so many scenes that are well done from a film perspective. With beautiful use of colours, to incredibly used angles that manages to capture different feelings.

The action is nothing short of incredible. The start of the action movies that will come in the 2000s, The Matrix is an inspiration. With awesome action scenes that capture intense fighting, while also keeping you on your toes it's nothing but amazing.

The Matrix is one of the best movies there is with very little to no negative things to say about it. I highly recommend everyone to watch it with the promise that you won't be disappointed.","5"
"anthonydapiii","More Than Just a Movie","8 May 2020","My subject line fills up a majority of my takeaway from this ""fictional"" movie.

Keenu Reeves and the cast are stellar performers in this way. They show more than just a fictional tale of a computer hacker learning the reality of the world from rebels.

This storyline shows the power of the mind and the ability we all have as human beings. I see the symbolism in this movie beyond just the surface of what is seen on the screen.

I will also add that the filmmaking in the action scenes has to be, hands down, the best of any special effects I've ever seen in any movie.","1"
"gavinpiliczky","Mind Bending","6 August 2021","I remember leaving the cinema in my teens all those years ago and thinking ""Holy cow, that was incredible"" This movie is a timeless science fiction classic. It has an excellent mind bending concept that will leave you questioning your own reality.

Ladies and gentlemen this is a masterpiece of a movie and must be watched.","10"
"Prismark10","Life in reality","28 March 2016","What made The Matrix special was the groundbreaking visual effects such as 'Bullet Time' that have been often imitated in other films and video games. The Wachowski's simply knocked it out of the park when it came to the visuals.

Keanu Reeves is Mr Anderson an ordinary computer programmer by day and secret hacker called Neo at night who is suddenly pursued by government agents led by a sinister Agent Smith (Hugo Weaving) after he is contacted by computer hacker Morpheus (Laurence Fishburne.)

Morpheus believes Neo is the 'One.' Humans lives in a false reality that controls humans and Neo will lead the harvested humans to rebel against the machines creating the false reality.

The film mixes cyberpunk science fiction with Hong Kong style martial arts and elements of Japanese manga type animation as inspiration.

Keanu Reeves is in his element in a world where he does not understand what is around him. He looks cool and does well in the martial arts sequences. I guess revisiting this genre made up for the failure of Johnny Mnemonic.

Laurence Fishburne is even more cooler as Morpheus guiding Neo in this hostile new reality and how to take down the system. Carrie-Anne Moss is kick ass sexy in black leather as Trinity who displays superhuman powers.

The film has philosophical underpinnings as the Wachowski's ask us to think about the world around us and our place within it.

The subtext of the film can be re-analysed in light of the personal journeys of the Wachowskis. Change and transformation. It is laughable to see the right wing attempting to co-opt the movie for their own agenda.

The film is cool, it is hip but I felt slightly too long and little bit too po faced. However the Wachowskis did manage to catch lightning in a bottle which they did not manage to do with the following two sequels.","10"
"WasiReviews","Simulation","12 August 2020","This movie speaks to a lot of important issues like Slavery, fighting against AI, systems and a lot of crude stuff. The Kung-Fu slow mo, wall-running, slow-mo dodging, really cool cloaks and its incredible influence on the genre of action and even video-games that was so good even the sequels couldn't emulate it. Which unfortunately gave us some really bad bullet time and slow-mo video-games and movies which isn't the movies fault. This movie changed popular culture even with the pills thing I loved this movie and my only complaint is that I didn't watch this movie earlier.","9"
"hooma814","Even better as an adult!","14 July 2020","This movie was always epic watching it as a kid. The fight scenes, with cool bullet dodging, guns , helicopters, all the martial arts, it was all so exciting, apart from two scenes that always freaked me out. Neo's mouth going missing and when Neo gets the bugs in and out of his stomach, plus I might add the baby scene too, when Neo is born again. But other than that it was just a cool movie with cool clothes.

But boy was it even better to watch it as an adult. The complexity and symbolism throughout every scene is so detailed. It's almost as if every line is deeply thought out and chosen. Concepts that were way too hard as a kid like the connection of the ship being called Nebuchadnezar, being connected with dreams and reality. Or the white rabbit and Alice in Wonderland references. Each of these tip offs were sp exciting, especially what occurs in Neos interactions with the people coming to his door. How did I miss the lines of them saying wake up. Neo spends the first half of the movie asking so many questions. It was also great to see how times have changed from 1999 technology and the phones used in the office scenes.

The acting and casting is superb in this movie. I love every character. Hugo Weaving, Keanu Reeves especially display one of the best faces off battles of good versus bad that I've scene. And that gun scene in the foyer has the be thee most insane shoot out fighting scene in movie history. The fighting is so impressive. All credit to the effort the movie makers and cast put into pulling this off with excellence!

The costumes and colour design is also well thought out with the green that matches the Matrix reality.

This .movie is so good. If you haven't watched it for a while or again as an adult, I'd highly recommend.","10"
"IQ42","Revolutionary idea but cliché adaptation","13 December 2021","Years ago, when I was in grade 10, we watched this in ethics class. My teacher Mrs. Kosiol proudly announced that she had interpreted how the Matrix was inspired by Plato's cave allegory before the maker of this movie mentioned it.

I just rewatched it mostly because I don't remember everything in the movie and want to watch its sequels. The first half of the movie really had me. All these ideas must have been so revolutionary for 1999 and surely defined parts of film-making. Some ideas like AIs and humans destroying the planet seem overused nowadays but for 1999 this is a remarkable movie.

I really like the matrix idea. As my teacher said, it really is like Plato's allegory and it's interesting and scary to think about what were if the matrix was actually true. The idea also reminded me of the Infinite Tsukuyomi from Naruto. I wonder if Kishimoto was inspired by the matrix.

So the first half really had me and I kinda wanted to like this movie but so many points just destroyed the feel for me. Especially the second half was pretty boring and absurd.

With such an intriguing idea as the matrix, why does there have to be all those fight scenes? Why does there have to be hand-to-hand combat and gunshots and what-not? Maybe that generates more viewership in the cinema but for me it really didn't fit the scene.

And then the very ending, like what was that? Why does Trinity have to wait so long and tell Neo something almost meaningless in front of the phone booth? For god sake, just get out and then you have all the time in the world to say whatever you want.

It was all to set up some romance between Neo and Trinity. But I ask you: Why?! This was so forced and at no point of the movie it seemed like there would be a romantic relationship arising between them. It was romance just for the sake of a Hollywood kiss.

And then there is Neo. How flat can a character be? This guy has absolutely no personality besides being the one. And him going back in to save Morpheus also just doesn't fit his personality, it is a forced superhero behaviour. Then, at the end he just randomly becomes overpowered for no reason at all. Oh, I guess there is a reason - the power of love. How cliché.

He starts flexing and fighting one-handed but man just get the **** out of the matrix. We don't even know what these people see in Neo. Why was he chosen? His hacker personality seems to have almost no impact at all. Neo is really one of the worst written characters I've seen recently.

It's a revolutionary movie that you should have seen to experience the idea of the matrix. But other than these ideas, it is not too watch-worthy.","7"
"SteelBlue82","Imaginitive Brain Scrambler","28 October 2018","This movie raises one of my favorite questions. What is reality? The biggest strength of The Matrix is the story. The special effects hold up because they did not try to go beyond their technological limits.

The biggest weakness of The Matrix is some of the dialogue. It is often times either melodramatic or robotic. It has a few plot holes, the biggest of which being blood. ""If it happens in the matrix your mind makes it real..."" I don't know how your mind could give you a bloody lip.

With all that The Matrix is still the best sci-fi/action flick ever made.","3"

I watched it 20 more times to get the grip of it. Years went by, Matrix still haunts me with its questions. Around 16 years old I read some theory and explanations of the film.

"jpintar","Overrated","16 May 2003","This has to be the most overrated movie in sci-fi history. It is way too long and the acting is stiff, especially Keanu ""get me a new facial expression"" Reeves. Who cares about the special effects when the story is incoherent and uninteresting? I certanly don't. It disturbs me that many people consider this not only a great movie, but a classic!!!! Did these people see the same movie I did. I saw a dumb action movie with delusions of grandeur. I say watch Star Wars again and see what real storytelling is all about.","9"
"Soujiro","Laughably Awful","6 May 2001","The good: The action scenes involving guns are original. The ""frozen moment"" camera effect is well done.

The bad: The script is uneven and horribly horribly written. I mean Saturday morning cartoons are better written than this, not even good cartoons either, I think that the average episode of Voltron or Scooby Doo have more meaningful and profound scripts. The main characters can't even manage to be two dimensional.

The ugly: The acting is hideous, and I'm not just talking about the spoken lines. I can almost hear Keanu saying ""dude"" after every line. Fishburne is also attains a whole new level of corniness, Mumra on Thundercats levels of melodrama. As in another over-hyped movie, Crouching Tiger etc. etc., no amount of special effects can disguise the fact that these people do not know martial arts. The fight scene between Fishburne and Reeves made me laugh out loud, and not in a happy way, more of a ""I can't believe how pathetic this is"" kind of defensive laugh. Hong Kong movies made in the late seventies have better wirework. The cookie cutter villain is actually the most compelling character, and that my friends is sad.

This is what really makes me nauseous: Two more movies are coming out. Umm... did I miss something here? I thought that the movie's only redeeming quality was the ""surprise"" midway through when we found out what ""The Matrix"" was. There's not much sequel material here to work with.

The first half of this movie is decent in that it doesn't really insult the viewer. As soon as Reeves wakes up in the tank, the movie becomes a laughable, pretentious Saturday morning cartoon. Junior high kids should eat it up, but any reasonably intelligent person who has read a book in his or her life will take absolutely nothing from this move of any lasting value. A truly mind-numbing movie.","10"
"harryplinkett14","Unbearable","21 October 2014","This is unbearable nonsense combined with irritating action scenes. The film is a continuous insult to the audience's intelligence. We see it makes no sense, but the film insists that YOU are just being stupid for not seeing the sense in it. And then it proceeds to throw even more nonsense at you until you give up trying to make sense out of it. But here's the problem: if I give up caring, why am I watching? Well, some get up and leave the theater. Others wait for the action scenes and the CGI display. Then again, these scenes make no sense either. As time goes by they become longer and longer. Endless fist fighting in scenes where everyone seems almost indestructible. Why do I care that a character is being thrown at the wall if I know it won't hurt him? And why do they use fists? Why not detonate a bomb? Who knows... And who cares?

The sequels, however, get even worse. Now that the novelty has worn off, they give you more of the same old nonsense, but they turn up the volume to 11. More fight scenes, more CGI, more nonsense... They keep introducing new characters in order to maintain the illusion that there is a plot here. But there is no plot. These are silly diversions. And can anyone endure the pseudo-philosophical talk? It's unbearable.

But let's get to the political message. No, I'm kidding. I'm not going there. But if you haven't understood it, what's the point of me telling you anything?

I will say though, that I do not wish to be a part of the kind of humanity the film depicts, even if we never get to fight evil machines. There are worse things than machines in this world.","3"
"Anonymous_Maxine","HELL YEAH!!!","1 June 2000","Finally a science fiction film that cannot be immediately dismissed as either unreal or impossible. How can anyone say that this isn't exactly the way that reality is? To try and disprove this view of reality would be like trying to disprove the existence of God. Maybe he's there, maybe he isn't, but no one can possibly prove it either way. It works the same way for The Matrix. It is possible that everything that we see is fed into our minds by machines and that we would never know it.

Probably the only remotely convincing argument the other way would be that if that were true, why would the machines give us a movie like this to watch? It would expose them! But then again, maybe they just want to get us thinking, maybe to see how we'll react to the possibility of their existence. Maybe they are getting ready to present themselves to us. Robot rapture! Who can say that the Wachowski brothers are not messengers?

This is by far the best science fiction film that I have ever seen. Aside from the relatively plausible story, every other element of the film was spectacular! The special effects (which, in my opinion, usually take more away from a film than they add) were awesome, the fight scenes were incredibly intense, and the pace of the film itself was breathtaking. Every hole is covered up brilliantly, even down to a definition of deja-vu and a possible reason for why so many different foods taste like chicken. These little ties to reality are one of the best ways that this film was able to come off so realistically.

The Matrix is absolutely not to be missed. Even people who don't like science fiction or even action films will more than likely enjoy this film. It is well presented, it is not unnecessarily excessive, and it presents the most innovative camera work in years. It has something for everyone, and will become a science fiction classic without a doubt.","10"

"joao-luiz_mjr","Unforgettable and iconic","28 December 2021","The Matrix is a masterpiece of modern cinema. It draws heavily from sci-fi classics such as Ghost in the Shell and Neuromancer, exploring themes of systemic societal exploitation, the notion and expression of the self, as well as technology encroaching onto the human body and mind and the dread of a now all-too-known dystopic future, all of it wrapped up in a shell of sleek, leather and vinyl-clad punk visuals and beautifully choreographed fights.

Fishburne (playing Morpheus) and Weaving (playing Agent Smith) are both stellar - every word coming out of their mouths, every inch of movement they make, all of it feels carefully measured if not downright hypnotic, and they both manage to keep the plot fresh and profoundly engaging even when armed with nothing but dialogue.

It's one of those movies that can give you chills and enthrall you with its scenes, even after all these years. Truly, it's an incredible experience.","7"
"dltdvd","I don't care what anybody says, this is nothing original.","15 February 2002","When I first saw the Matrix a few years ago, I thought it was a pretty good flick, but as I watched it more and more, I began to realize that the film ripped off from a variety of films such as the computer-animated masterpiece Tron and the intelligent action film Face/Off to name a few. Now, most people think this film is intelligent, but I thought that is was incredibly long and was almost entirely plotless. It's a shame at how the characters act so serious that you don't know what they are talking about. Another problem I have with the Matrix were the incredibly overrated effects. First of all, I can't understand why the Matrix won the Visual Effects Oscar over the Phantom Menace, which took much more effort and used much more technology. I see so many unoriginalities with the Matrix's effects. People who think that the Bullet Time effects were original and told the story, you obviously haven't seen the slow-motion bullets in Face/Off, which I personally found more eye-catching. And for people who think that the story about a computer programmer entering a virtual reality world, you obviously haven't seen the Walt Disney masterpiece Tron, which, by the way, had far more groundbreaking technology for its day than the Matrix's effects had when it was first made. Overall, the Matrix is one of the most overrated films I've ever seen and had more attention than it actually deserved. Grade: D","10"
"s_daad","Disguised Scientology?","22 September 2010","A lot of people like The Matrix because they think it's deep. In fact its apparent deepness is its primary selling point, and is what has turned it into a blockbuster and trendsetter. Just ponder over this, because there's a contradiction here. Whenever has Hollywood hit the jackpot by being profound, either in a philosophical or religious way? Something strange is going on here. A lot of the mystery disappears after we identify exactly what belief the Wachowski brothers are purveying here. It's Scientology. They are telling us that the power of the mind is able to free us from the matrix of the senses. The scientologists are anxious to free themselves and become thetans – omnipresent and omni-powerful minds.

Now, the success of The Matrix tells me just one thing, that people have become closet scientologists. They don't grapple with the issue of ""appearance and reality"" in the way scientologists do, but the core belief is there. They might call themselves an atheist, or an evolutionist (""We only accept what science tells us""), but that's only an excuse for not really sorting out what they really believe in. So, along comes a film called The Matrix and it hits a chord. They can identify with Neo because they are aware of a thing called corporate media manipulating reality for them. They are also brought up on computer games, and so it's not too big a leap to imagine a virtual world completely replacing the real one. I can see how closet scientologists can completely immerse themselves in the plight of Neo and his Christ-like struggle to free humanity from the clutches on the senses and become omni-powerful minds (in the parlance of the film, taking them to promised city of Zion).

In that sense, the film is profound, in that it resonates with popular belief so accurately. There is just enough spattering of science and philosophy to take them in. People want to believe in science, but they don't want to be troubled like Einstein was (""Does God play dice?""). The most convincing part of the film is where Morpheus demonstrates to Neo how virtual reality is created. This, and the recurring motif of ""freeing the mind"" are the only authentic components of the film. The rest is a conventional Hollywood action flick, and one that is totally at odds with the underlining philosophy. Considering the struggle with agent Smith, and the frequent popping in and out of virtual reality, nothing makes sense. This is where real confusion starts to parade as profundity.

I always thought that it was only intellectuals who mistook confusion for profundity, but apparently normal cinema-goers do too. Maybe intellectuals and Hollywood action flick fans have something in common after all. They both worship the rational mind. And when rationality delivers a mess, the mess itself is seen as something profoundly rational. Maybe that's the crowing achievement of the Wachowski brothers. They have composed the ""Being and Time"" for the masses. But Heidegger's philosophical book was mostly pretentious garbage, and so is the Matrix.","1"
"yaszi-83296","An iconic masterpiece","27 December 2021","The Matrix came out in 1999 for almost 23 years ago, but the vfx is still pretty good, the movie wasn't supposed to be the biggest thing but still looked nice. It has this unique green tint that some may say looks bad, but that makes the movie look unique compared to other movies. If you have watched the 4th installment witch came out X-mas 2021, you can see that the tint is gone and it don't look like a matrix film, even do it was created 22 years after the 1st one, it looks out of place, so the tint is a great thing.

The music, is great and has this sci-fi theme mixed with great action music witch brings back memories of Terminator 2. The music works great with the great performances of all the actors & the well choreographed fights. There are some nice action scenes and then towards the end it's all action. There is so much variation in the fights aswell, it isn't just a small area the characters fight for a long time, but the last almost hour of the film is just one big pile of action that still has variation whiles being fluent.

The story and concept is also pretty interesting and the movie and the whole franchise really shows the concept in an deep way.

Another great thing is the characters that all get love, the antagonist is also awesome, agent smith is a great villain even do you only see him in a black suit with glasses most of the time, at least the suit always stays on. The movie also manages to have little to no boring scenes, many movies have to explain something's and most movies like to balance the explaining throughout the experience, some movies no matter how good have some of those boring scenes that are necessary and understandable to have in the film if the audience is going to understand the story being told. The scenes that have som explaining still feel good, you might feel a tiny bit bored but it just gets more and more exiting and you don't feel bored at all, it's kinda hard to explain with words.

"PreOre72","Terrible script + mediocre acting + great special effects = The Matrix.","17 June 1999","The Matrix is just another sci-fi film that offers nothing special to the genre. The only reason everybody dropped their jaws and praised this film was because of the great special effects and fight scenes. Believe me there is a lot more to a film than just it's special effects.

The script was mind numbing at times, especially with the whole ""We're not in Kansas anymore"" bull crap line, and the acting was just a notch above awful. The only person that even resembled an actor was Laurence Fishburne. Keanu Reeves is his usual self.

All in all a pretty terrible movie and everyone's love for it made it even worse.

If you are looking for a good sci-fi flick go out and get ""Planet of the Apes"", ""A Clockwork Orange"", or any one of the Star Wars films. If you are looking for a good 90's sci-fi flick go get 12 Monkeys cause that has a lot more than this, like a script and a plot that is more than paper thin.","9"

On its own merits, it deserves more than the one star I gave it, but when you factor in the annoyance factor of the gushing fans... well, let's say I just felt a need to counterbalance its high ratings.

Blah, blah, blah, special effects. So what. Yet another example of Special-Effects-In-Search-Of-A-Movie. The story holds together poorly. The premise was initially pretty interesting, but the movie seemed utterly incapable of establishing rules for how its world works and sticking to them.

Finally, the movie hit a pet peeve of mine, which was, to me, its ultimate, fatal flaw. I'm very big on the ""science"" part of ""science fiction"". So you lose me instantaneously when you start introducing mystic mumbo-jumbo into a science fiction story. For me, this film jumped the shark when we get to that wise woman character. (nevermind that the mystic nonsense is somewhat demystified in the sequel films; this review is about *this* film). Yeah, dropping in an all-knowing, cryptic prophetess, without the tiniest hint of explanation of her abilities, makes for a convenient plot device, but defies all reason or sense.","9"

"petra_ste","Keanu versus Philip K. Dick","17 September 2008","Action set pieces in this movie have already become iconic: brilliantly choreographed, inventive and gloriously over the top, they represent a fine mix of science fiction and martial arts. The ""bullet-time"" effect, in particular, has been ripped off dozens of times since.

Unfortunately, that's the only real achievement of the Matrix series; everything else reeks of Philip K. Dick for dummies. Not only the stuff about alternative realities and cyberspace, but also pretty much every other idea seems to have been discreetly borrowed from other sources (aside from Dick, major inspirations are Alex Proyas' Dark City and William Gibson's Count Zero). Even the famous set piece where Neo (Reeves) infiltrates an enemy base to rescue his mentor/guru Morpheus (Fishburne) has its precedent in Dick, bullet-time included (read Counter-clockwise if you don't believe me). The result is an admittedly pretty collage.

Human element is weak, which makes emotional involvement faint; characters are bland, showing little personality. Reeves' Neo is just a blank. Fishburne and Moss fare a little better, but the stand-outs are Pantoliano as traitorous Cypher and an icy, smug Hugo Weaving as Agent Smith: every time he is on screen the movie shift gears. It's one of the Matrix' ironies that its cybernetic villain is a lot more lively than the human hero. Kubrick did the same in 2001, but that was a deliberate choice.

While Dick's works are rich with irony and melancholy, the Wachowskis go for kung fu and head shots. Still, better an overdose of action than the portentous posturing which they tried to pass off as philosophy in the two sequels.

The story's arch is quite good in that it doesn't feel as though much of anything else could be added. The central philosophy is admirably brought to a movie that a mainstream audience can digest, along with metaphorical and allegorical strains of the bible, alice in wonderland, drug use, the life cycle, cartesian dualism, buddhist one consciousness, giger style enemies, artificial intelligence, newtonian physics, orwellian nightmares, and euclidean view of the world as a series of numbers and probabilities. Sci fi need not be the same old, evil monster chase humans without rhyme or reason. The movie dooes sidestep charecter development by making it's charecters not know who they are, and also by killing most of them off as soon as they are met. while this isn't the arty pretentious greatness of citizen kane or waking life, it is a movie that is likely to be long remembered and worshipped like Star Wars","1"

Reeves looks lost throughout the movie. Fishburne spews clichés as some sort of a zen master.

One night, a mysterious woman named Trinity seeks him out and introduces him to that faceless character he has been waiting for........Morpheus.

A messiah of sorts, Morpheus presents Neo with the truth about his world by shedding light on the dark secrets that have troubled him for so long......

After seeing this after so many years, the then groundbreaking movie just doesn't hold up for me.

Back in 1999, the trailer was one of the most mysterious things ever to be seen at the cinema. It was refreshing to see a film not give away any of the plot, and just astound people with the wonderful effects for that time.

And it comes to fruition that the reason why none of the plot is revealed on the trailer is simply because it's that mind-boggingly bonkers, that it probably would have deterred many form seeing it.

Seeing it now with much older and wiser eyes, the films just a series of zen like exposition chapters tied together with very beautiful, awe-inspiring action, and Keanu going Whoa.

The Wachowskis are geniuses, they have made some very experimental movies, some of them are good, some of them are complete cobblers, this is why the sequels are much maligned, because they were released when other, better movies were released.

What summer blockbusters were released at the time of this? Episode I Entrapment Wild Wild West The Mummy The Haunting

I figure that with just a few more viewings and I should, most definitely, be there, sure enough.

It's so true that The Matrix' story is so riddled full of holes, and rife with inconsistencies, that it makes a piece of Swiss Cheese look like a solid brick of Cheddar.

It doesn't help matters much (when I'm trying to enjoy this film) that I detest Keanu Reeves as much as I do. I really think that he makes a damn-lousy Neo. I mean - Let's face it - Reeves just isn't a very convincing bright-boy. And he makes a truly terrible lover for Trinity, too.

The other effects aren't that impressive especially not the robot guys that cut themselves into the ship in the end, they look awkwardly badly done, you can easily tell that they are CG. That Episode I lost all its Oscars to this movie is a big joke and it was sure as hell the last time I went up 3 in the morning (I live in Sweden, another time zone) just to see that lot of hypocrisy.

I'm a big fan of (most) science-fiction movies and series, especially Star Wars but the plot in this one has too many obvious loose ends. ****possible spoilers ahead**** Humans to warm the earth? Yeah right umm, what about building a large battery and some kind of warmth generator instead? Or using less complicated minds like cows instead of humans then they wouldn't have to worry about that stupid matrix thing.

It is short on characterization and direction and all the performances are sub-par. A group of innovative special effects dazzled many, but I was unimpressed by them as well. In many ways, the film is ugly and cheap looking. Keanu Reeves plays a computer hacker who learns from a strange group of rebels what his true purpose for living is to help stand against a department of controllers who run what is really reality. Exactly. The plot is so stupid and it just makes no sense most of the time. Keanu Reeves usually makes films work, but he cannot save this mess. The same is true for dependable players like Joe Pantoliano and Laurence Fishburne who just seem lost in the maze that is the movie. In short ""The Matrix"" is eye-candy and little else. Save your time and look at a group of Picasso's paintings instead. They are just as empty and meaningless as ""The Matrix"". 2.5 out of 5 stars.","9"
"evanston_dad","Like It or Not, Has Had a Lasting Impact on Popular Culture","30 June 2010","The fanboy cult that has since arisen around ""The Matrix"" makes me want to not like it, but I do have to admit that the first installment in the mind-bending sci-fi saga is pretty kick ass.

I had to have my friends explain it to me, of course, but once they did I thought it was one of the coolest premises ever conceived. ""The Matrix"" is like ""Pulp Fiction"" -- in many ways, it defined the culture of its time and has had a major impact on everything since. And it's also in the same league as films like ""2001: A Space Odyssey,"" ""Terminator 2"" and ""Jurassic Park"" that redefined what movie special effects could do.

"neil-476","Credit where it's due","1 May 2008","You've got to hand it (well, some of it) to The Matrix.

The concept is great. That concept is translated into a decent screen adaptation. The film has a wholly original (and much copied) look to it. The action sequences are generally well choreographed, if a bit over-reliant on slow motion. The effects are simply brilliant and, in places, groundbreaking (there aren't many films which add something 100% new to the filmmaker's bag of tricks, but The Matrix is one of them). The principals mostly deliver excellent performances, and Keanu looks cool, as he is meant to.

But there is a distinct element of The Emperor's New Clothes at work here. It's very evident in some of the fanboy gushing, and I suspect that the Emperor's tailors also believed that they had sewed a suit of clothes which was a lot more visible than it actually was. Apologies, I'm disappearing up my own metaphor here.

I think The Matrix thinks it is very much cleverer than it actually is. There's no denying that it's a good yarn, told with a distinctive style and a great deal of panache, but that's all it is. Yet you'd think it was the 5th Gospel to listen to what some have to say.

HE ends up being one of the crew members with Morpheus and Trinity. Morpheus thinks that Neo is ""The One"" which means that this person would be very strong and can dodge bullets and do wild stuff like that.

Although scientifically improbable, the premise is possible, which is what makes the film interesting to watch. However, I was waiting for Alex Winter to make an appearance as a serious ally. Reeves is not a straight actor; he is a comedy actor exclusively. He is just not believable to most adults in a serious role. It would be like casting Rodney Dangerfield as a President of the US (although that might be more believable, given our last few).

"southdavid","Still the one.","7 December 2021","With a new Matrix sequel one of the marquee films left in 2021, now seemed like a good time to revisit the previous three films and see how I feel about them. Starting with the original, a film now 22 years old!

Having always felt that something was off with the world, computer hacker Thomas Anderson (Keanu Reeves) is pulled into the circle of a 'terrorist' named Morpheus (Laurence Fishburne). Morpheus exposes Anderson to the truth, that the world he knows is an elaborate simulation covering the fact that human beings have been overthrown by an artificial intelligence and are being farmed for energy. However, if one can accept that the world is just a construct, then it's rules can become exploitable.

I'm old enough to remember the release of ""The Matrix"", when it seemed like another potential flop, combining Keanu with computers as had recently been done with little success in ""Johnny Mnemonic"". However, the bleeding edge special effects, ultra-cool score and brilliant action scenes combined to make the film a massive hit.

Watching it again today, a few of those special effects are starting to show their age a little, not necessarily the bulletime stuff, that still looks pretty strong, but a few of the other CGI effects, the sentinels for example, look a little ropey now. The cool factor has worn off in some other areas, the black trench coats, sunglasses in the rain, massive flip phones and the techno club all seem a little sillier now than they did in 1999.

It's still, for my money, a great film though. The action scenes still have a lot of power, despite all the advances we've seen since. I remembered it more as a 'guns' film (""lots of guns"") but much more of the film is mano a mano fights, with Neo facing off against Morpheus in the training simulator and later Agent Smith. The story is good, there isn't that much philosophy in this one and virtually everything in the plot makes sense. There are excellent performances from Fishburne, Hugo Weaving and Joe Pantoliano.

Two decades later, ""The Matrix"" still holds up really well and has some of cinema's most iconic moments.","7"

The Matrix combined the best of hard science-fiction with Asian cinema's frenetic and masterfully choreographed action sequences, gorgeous direction, pitch-perfect casting, and the best martial arts I'd ever seen in a Hollywood film.

"Floated2","Great Sci-Fi effects can create a classic","11 January 2016","The Matrix (1999) is basically the idea of The Matrix, an ultra- computerized sci-fi film by Andy and Larry Wachowski that has an excellent concept but squanders it by falling back on the same old tired action movie conventions. The Wachowski siblings have given us an hour's worth of excellent cinema, filled with fascinating ideas.

The film begins where We start with a woman named Trinity (Carrie- Anne Moss), who seems to be on the run from a gang of Men In Black- types led by Agent Smith (Hugo Weaving). Luckily, she can leap tall buildings in a single bound, run around on the walls, and so on. So she gets away, but not before contacting a computer hacker named Neo (Reeves) by sending him a cryptic message on his monitor. Following her directions, Neo meets up with Morpheus (Fishburne), who is in charge of a ragtag team of humans from the late 22nd century. And why did Morpheus seek out Neo and bring him up to speed? Because Neo is The One; he's the messiah. He's going to save us all.","10"
"filipemanuelneto","A lot of style, but that was good.","17 January 2020","This movie is one of those classics that even those who have never seen know to hear about. And I say it is a classic because I believe it has already achieved this status. I was young when it debuted, but I remember the impact it had and there is no doubt that it left marks.

I will not dwell on describing the story. I just want to say that I find it interesting the way it was developed. It's a good story and it keeps our interest until the end. The weakest part is the romantic plot of Neo and Trinity because the two characters never have any chemistry in the movie. In fact, the movie did not ask for romance. That was the biggest mistake of this movie. The characters have no humanity and look like machines most of the time ... The outfit, with those dark glasses until night and wearing clothes in various shades of black (I loved the cassock they got for Reeves, he could think of being priest if he ever gets tired of being an actor) gives the final touch. It's called ""style"".

Keanu Reeves is perfect for his character. He is one of those actors I hate because of his lack of dramatic expressiveness, here as in other films he has made. I've seen asses more expressive than his face, sorry for the words but it's the truth. In this movie, he hardly even moves facial muscles. And the other actors (Laurence Fishburne and Carrie-Anne Moss especially) follow the same path. It's called ""style""! Luckily for everyone involved, the movie asked for this and it works well on the screen. Fishburne, especially, looks amazing. This is one of his best movies to date, in my opinion.

The production values are extraordinary. In addition to a great soundtrack, we have great special visual and sound effects. Cinematography is one of the best and best achieved I've ever seen in sci-fi movies, and that's no small feat. The camera and film work is excellent.

Okay, I may look a little rough, but I actually liked the movie. The biggest problem (and also one of its most striking features) is having so much ""style"". Not being a perfect movie, it has cleverly invested in creating a style of its own. Very superlative, here there is permission, even advantage, in overcoming the barriers of credibility and logic. There is no problem in that guy looking like a dancer when he fights. If it looks amazing on the screen, the film allows it, the film wants it. It's not about reality, it's about looking cool. And the film seems cool all the time, to the point that it is sometimes funny. It is no coincidence that the film yielded so many internet memes and humorous parodies.","9"
"Danimal-7","It's been done better before","23 August 1999","The first half of THE MATRIX is pretty darn good. After a bizarre and surreal action sequence where the black-clad Trinity (Carrie-Ann Moss) displays superhuman abilities in eluding some Men In Black who also have superhuman abilities, we meet the plot. He is called Neo (Keanu Reeves), who finds himself being contacted by two seemingly omniscient characters: the aforementioned Trinity and a man called Morpheus whom we at first know only by his voice. They try, not always successfully, to guide Neo out of the danger posed by the Men In Black (who we learn are called Agents, but Men In Black gives you a better idea of what they look like).

The movie to this point is great fun, with a palpable aura of mystery making your pulse pound as you wonder what the explanation is for what's happening to Neo. Better yet, the explanation we get from Morpheus is actually moderately imaginative and makes at least some sense (although one wonders how humans can live without a solar-based food chain beneath them; I can't explain more without giving too much away).

Unfortunately, at this point, THE MATRIX is only halfway done. The second half is a nonstop pastiche of action cliches and mystical mumbo-jumbo, as Neo, supposedly the most important person in the world for Morpheus to find, actually achieves very little other than to become your routine Hollywood superhero and pull off a depressingly prosaic rescue mission. Characters come back from the dead literally by magic, or with no explanation at all. The action sequences are competently done, with an eerie musical backdrop sounded out by cartridge cases clinking against the floor, but they can't disguise the essential problem: THE MATRIX runs out of plot an hour before it ends.

Keanu Reeves is not improving with age; the way he expresses disbelief will have you expressing your own disbelief, and there is no chemistry between him and the attractive Moss. Laurence Fishburne's character is poorly sketched, leaving him nothing to do except be very, very cool, but he does that very well. Moss does her action scenes with verve, but delivers her dialogue weakly. Hugo Weaving, playing one of the Men In Black, is sinister, inhuman, and a lot of fun to watch. A number of supporting characters who assist Trinity and Morpheus are well played.

Regrettably, THE MATRIX is yet another case of Hollywood putting excellent production values into creating a half-baked story. The same themes were much better examined just last year, in THE TRUMAN SHOW and DARK CITY. And by no means does this film deserve comparison to BLADE RUNNER, whose plot dealt with the line between man and machine in a way that this movie never approaches. THE MATRIX is mildly entertaining, but still greatly overrated.

Had they found a way to drop about thirty minutes of this overlong and oftentimes dull hodge-podge, the truly spectacular martial arts and digital effects would have seemed even more special. A cyber-flick owing an equal debt to Blade Runner and Lewis Carroll, The Matrix collapses under the weight of an idiotic and mind-numbing New Testament-like structure that finds surrogates for Christ, Judas, etc. Joe Pantoliano, so thoroughly excellent in the Wachowski's previous outing Bound, is helpless and hapless playing the underwritten Cypher, but Hugo Weaving easily gives the worst performance of his career as a strictly one-note, wooden bad guy in the grand tradition of one-note, wooden bad guys.","9"

Oddly enough, the Matrix escaped its SF roots, and managed to be seen by a wider audience who were unfamiliar with SF or its concepts. As a result, there were resounding cries of how original and creative it was. Is it good that it made a few more people think? Yes. Does that by default mean that it did it well? Films such as ""ExistenZ"", ""Dark City"", or ""The 13th Floor"" (from around the same time), all explored the idea of 'What is Reality?' in far more depth. They simply didn't get the same level of exposure. The Matrix wins, because it was one of those lucky films to fill the right niche at the right time. It utilized Computer Effects in a relatively new way for the cinema 'wow' factor. It appealed to the all-action, gun-toting, look-cool-in-black leather, fans. It rammed the 'kung-fu-wire-stunt' style of action film into over-drive. It had a 'hip' soundtrack to appeal to the masses (Which will date it badly in years to come).

It's difficult to criticise The Matrix, because there's nothing really bad about it, as long as you enjoy, or at least don't mind, that style of film. What it fails to do, is bring anything else to the game. There's nothing really fresh or creative idea-wise, here. The characters are thinly drawn stereotypes. The action tends to be about lots of shell-casings rather than anything else. Scratch the surface, and what few ideas there are, aren't explored to any consequence.

It is a perfect example of style over substance, pretending to say more than it actually does. 'Emperor's New Clothes' if you will. There's nothing wrong with a good mindless action film, from time-to-time. Cinema, in many ways at its core, is simply about pure entertainment. There are numerous films of this kind, but the difference is, they don't pretend to be more than they are. Perhaps that is where the Matrix fails. It sets itself up as though it is exploring some grandiose, thought-provoking topic, and is really just a roller-coaster action film. On rare occasions, some films can do both. This isn't one of them.

If you take it as that, a mindless action trill-ride with a couple of fun concepts, there's nothing wrong with it, to waste a few hours. If you're expecting more, chances are, you'll find it lacking.","5"

"dr_foreman","mildly entertaining, yet fundamentally wretched","10 June 2004","I'm waiting, like a vulture, for this movie to become dated. And it will. The club scene, the sunglasses, the fashions, the cell phones - oh yes, one day it will all look and sound unbearably corny. And then, we'll have to actually pay attention to the script and the acting (or lack thereof). And we will realize that this movie reeks.

For an action film, it's remarkably dull, with the first half basically consisting of a looong string of complex explanations. It doesn't help that Neo is a totally flat character. If I'm to care that he's trapped in the Matrix, I need to see more of his life there. Sadly, one scene of Neo at work, being berated by the boss, does not a fascinating character make. I also think it was a terrible mistake to make him a programmer, since he already understands the nature of computers and should, therefore, be more receptive to the idea of the Matrix instead of consistently incredulous. And am I supposed to believe that this master hacker doesn't know what an EMP is?

The film is also terribly derivative. Morpheus is an even more gaseous version of Yoda, and Neo is clearly based on Luke (promising young man discovers super-powers and helps rebels overthrow their nasty oppressors). The visual style is ripped off from the Alien movies, as is the snake-like parasite that somehow manages to burst through Neo's bellybutton without leaving a mark. The evil agents clearly evoke The X-Files, the notion that mankind is enslaved by robots in an apocalyptic future comes straight out of The Terminator, and - most damningly of all - the concept of a virtual reality environment called the Matrix had featured some 23 years earlier in an episode of Doctor Who (""The Deadly Assassin""). Maybe the Matrix didn't consciously rip off all of these sources, but it's certainly worth noting that this movie is utterly unoriginal in every respect but its action photography (and that will, like all the rest, probably date badly).

Needless to say, Reeves is pretty bland, and Fishbourne is just plain embarrassing in his first scene (it doesn't help that his every dire line is punctuated by a melodramatic bolt of lightning). Only Carrie-Anne Moss's Trinity comes up smelling like a rose, and it's good to see such a strong role for a female character - though I think she should've been the hero, as she's got more charisma than everyone else put together.

I was quite disturbed by the metal detector scene, as it appears to be nothing more than a particularly violent video game sequence that's meant to inspire future generations of random crazy shooting maniacs. It's worth mentioning that the security guards who are so callously slaughtered by Neo and Trinity are not evil, just thralls of the Matrix, like Neo had been merely days before. Why, therefore, does he have no qualms about blowing them all to bits? Tacky, man - really tacky.

I enjoyed Joe Pantoliano's character, probably because he was allowed to have an actual set of motivations and opinions, whereas the other characters are just filler. And you know, a few segments were effective; the Oracle has real presence. But the film is basically a dog, and while it pretends to cast all kinds of light on the problems with modern society, at the end of the day it's a stupid action movie that raises interesting issues, then resolves them with ridiculously OTT karate battles.

As a movie, The Matrix is decent entertainment. As sci-fi, it's derivative and sloppy. As philosophy, it's risible, misleading, and poorly informed junk.","8"
"The_Other_Snowman","The Unofficial Sequel to ""The Truman Show""?","8 May 2005","I saw this movie in the theater back in 1999. It had its moments, but not many. To start, the acting is terrible. Keanu Reeves has the emotive ability of a toaster, and Carrie Ann Moss is about as sympathetic as that sexy sidekick babe in a video game. Lawrence Fishburne comes off a bit better, but his dialogue is the most pretentious, ridiculous garbage I've ever heard. I imagine the characters in this film spend about six hours out of every day designing the leather bondage costumes they'll wear next time they're in the Matrix.

For the first half of the movie, it seems to be interested in questioning reality, which, as the title to my review suggests, was already done more topically in previous films. ""The Matrix"" is astounded by what it perceives as its own brilliance, but for those of us who have thought of its ideas before, there are few surprises. Some people I know were blown away when Neo discovers the truth behind his reality, but I was waiting for something interesting to happen.

""The Matrix"" has been praised for its originality, but it suffers from two traditional and clichéd movie formulas. First, Neo is the Chosen One (notice that ""neo"" is an anagram of ""one."" Was this supposed to be suspenseful?) who is destined to save the human race, bring balance to the Force, etc. He dies and comes back to life, like Jesus. Of course, to begin with he was just a pasty hacker in a crummy apartment and an anonymous office job, giving hope to all the spotty teenage geeks in the audience that they too might become the Messiah one day.

The second fault is the movie's reliance on action. Instead of coming up with interesting and exciting ways for two people to fight each other in virtual reality, Neo and Co. whip out their guns and start shooting. The techno music begins, and the audience is treated to several slow-motion kicks and scenes of people dodging bullets. I'm not sure how they manage all this, because nobody ever takes off their sunglasses to see properly. If the villains of the movie really were programs in the Matrix, shouldn't they be able to manipulate it without having to resort to kung fu? Anyway, I didn't like this movie. ""Dark City"" is a better, more original version of the same premise, without the Chosen One nonsense or the martial arts.","10"

"Theo Robertson","Good First Time You See It","28 October 2003","THE MATRIX is a good film , without doubt the greatest film featuring the sub genre of cyberpunk , but it`s film whose reputation is mainly built upon having a very clever premise more than anything else . I remember being absolutely stunned at the revelation of the plot , but when I saw it for a second time at the weekend on channel 5 ( First time I saw it was about three years ago ) I was slightly bored by the film . It`s by no means a boring film , it`s just that once you know how the plot twists , turns and sometimes boggles the mind the revelations don`t have the same effect second time around . THE MATRIX hasn`t been helped either by the amount of spoofs/rip offs featuring the scenes where the action stops , the frame freezes , the camera turns 360 degrees and then the action starts again . These scenes were jaw dropping at the time but have now been done by countless ads , pop videos and other movies it`s become impossible now to remember the impact this cinematography technique had at the time . I also think the producers of THE MATRIX haven`t done themselves any favours by turning THE MATRIX into a franchise

To sum up this is a good film . Like me you`ll certainly enjoy it first time you watch it but unlike say MEMENTO ( Note the cast connections between the two movies ? ) THE MATRIX doesn`t reward the audience with repeat viewings and at the end of the day the not too dissimilar TOTAL RECALL is probably a more enjoyable film","6"

"Manthorpe","You don't know Kung-Fu.","23 June 2004","One of the most overrated films of ALL TIME, if not THE most overrated film of all time. Why people love this movie so much completely baffles me. I realize that different people have different opinions and tastes but even some fellow reviewers here that have comparable tastes to mine praise this film to my astonishment. There isn't anything great here, so why all the fuss? It's not original, and if you think it is you didn't see Dark City or a slew of others....the story is very slow, it's pretentious beyond words, and the acting is absolutely terrible to the point that it's hard to sit through without wanting to bite a running chainsaw, all thanks to the abysmally talented Reeves and Laurence Lamprey aka Cowboy Curtis. The ending is also weak, and don't tell me it's because they had planned on making a sequel because movies should be able to stand alone.....and don't even get me started on the sequels. At least they're not too overrated. I have felt this way since 1999 when it came out and I went to see it in the theater. When it was finally over, I said, ""That's it?!""

Let's go over this piece, shall we? People praise this film for it's fight choreography, when the people fighting are tools like Fishburne and Reeves. Are you serious? I can't help but to laugh out loud at Keanu in the dojo training scene with Lamprey. He looks like he's got a Klingon dagger rammed up his butt! This is the ""One""?! I can't think of anyone more miscast. Actually, I can't think of a film where he wouldn't be miscast. True, a lot of my discontent with this film comes from the actors, but even with decent actors I still think it would've failed. The story is also sloppy and filled with more useless techno-babble than a quantum-physics book from Brent Spiner's ""Data"" from the Star Trek: The Next Generation series. To sum it up, it doesn't make any sense. People as batteries? OK. For a movie that spouts so much techno-babble at you, it's not very technical. It's all a red herring.

My biggest problem with the people that like this film is that they praise it for it's originality when that could not be further from the truth. Do your research or just watch more movies and you'll begin to realize that this film is nothing more than a long list of rip-offs from others films....and it gets the credit for all of it. This isn't the film's fault, it's the uneducated fans....the same fans responsible for it's ridiculously lofty rating here at IMDb. I think the rip-offs were intentional personally, and I don't think even the Wachowski brothers thought it'd be as successful as it was because of it.

Criminally overrated....and will not stand the test of time. The epitome of the phrase, ""Style over substance."" Just another summer blockbuster.

It's a lot like Pokemon. People like it, but I can't understand why....and I don't think they do either. I think this will just be another fad. Time will tell.","9"

--

I watched ""The Matrix"" for the fourth or fifth time last night, and for the fourth or fifth time I wasn't able to fully comprehend its wild success. I understand that it is essentially a good film, with very impressive visual effects, and that it has some underlying themes and metaphors for our current world culture mixed with the kind of stuff people go to the movies for...but I can't bring myself to give it more than 4.5/5 stars. That may be a very good rating, but this is a movie that took me four or five viewings to even learn to really like it. The end seemed quite enthralling this time around, but the beginning of the movie, for me, just lacks a bit of something.

The plot: Our world, as we know it, is a computer simulation called The Matrix. In ""the real world,"" we are all ""grown"" in long fields where machines of the future look over us and put us into little pods where we are hooked up into the simulation matrix and entertained until our death.

As our minds believe we are in this alternate world, the machines use our bodies for sources of energy. A mysterious man named Morpheus holds up a Duracell battery at one point during the course of the film and states that we are merely another one of these. But the film starts with Neo, a man who lives an alternate life--one of honesty and one of crime. He is an Internet hacker and has been guilty of virtually every known hacker crime.

But Neo feels that the world surrounding him is somehow wrong. He doesn't like the idea of fate because it means that he can't control his own destiny. An so an infamous criminal named Morpheus (Laurence Fishburne) picks up Neo, hoping that he may be The One, the man whose destiny is to free the minds of everyone living in The Matrix and bring an end to the machines' rule of the real world.

Of course, this won't be easy, as Agent Smith (Hugo Weaving, who can now be seen in all three ""The Lord of the Rings"" films) is a computer program loaded into The Matrix--his mission is to stop the uprising and to capture Morpheus and his gang, which also includes Trinity (Carrie-Anne Moss) and Cypher (the always enjoyable Joe Pantoliano).

Keanu Reeves may not be able to act, but his character is part of the new generation computer freaks and geeks. Needless to say, he fits the part. Laurence Fishburne (""Apocalypse Now"") is good as the mysterious and all-knowing Morpheus. His character's lasting image was a bit tarnished by the film's 2003 sequel, ""The Matrix Reloaded,"" as an element of him was lost when we found out that he isn't quite as respected back in Zion (the land of the free).

But the real stand-outs are Joe Pantoliano and Carrie-Anne Moss as Trinity--he's the comedic relief, she's a strong leader who falls for Neo. And unlike the Charlies Angels gang, she actually looks as if she could knock out twenty guys and live to tell about it. She's tough, blunt and the ultimate on-screen tom boy.

""The Matrix"" currently holds the number 34 spot on the Internet Movie Database's list of the top 250 films ever made. I've certainly seen better films than ""The Matrix,"" and The Wachowski Brothers, who directed the film, seem to have borrowed a lot of past techinques in filming (the bleak look of ""Se7en,"" the metaphorical significances of ""Star Wars,"" etc.). But this last viewing proved to be a lot more fun than previous viewings--perhaps because for once I let my mind make its own decision and avoided it being influcenced by the standing of the film on lists and so on. Expectations were too high when I first saw this film. And they still are. But perhaps a few more viewings will make this movie really grow on me. I sure do hope so.

""The Matrix"" is the type of film you should witness without prior expectations.

4/5.","10"
"PCC0921","Keanu Reeves was born on September 2nd, 1964","12 October 2020","OK! I understand what the Matrix is and I get that Neo is the Chosen One. I understand the world created represents the ones and zeroes that surround the computer world and that the computer world has become a competitor with the real world. I appreciate the Wachowski brothers' attempt to create a new ground-breaking approach to action sequences and story-telling, no matter how snobbish it looks. A pomposity that says, they expect the audience to believe what is going on in the film and to embrace it, but when it also gushes from the screen with cerebral gibberish and drawn out sequences, it slows the pace down and makes it difficult to enjoy fully.

Again, the action sequences, with the slow-motion wire techniques, are top notch. The acting works, even Keanu, but unfortunately the dialogue reminds me of Stan Lee in the 60s. What saves this film, along with the action and Carrie-Anne Moss' leather pants, is the approach to political extremes and what people would do if we had to adopt a neo-world/pseudo-world philosophy and what the dangers that could occur when technology and evil are mixed.

When I watched this movie while I was a kid, I did so for the sake of its mystical/magical stunt sequences but only now I realise that the movie had something more spiritually. I was in fact blown away by the fact of its linkage to our real-world now, in 2020. The most satisfying or convincing thing about this movie is that even the villain's character is also justifiable. Most of the humans try to be in a comfort zone and wants to be ignorant all their lives, which is a natural human tendency, I believe. Everything, every single thing about this movie was deep & convincing, there was just no flaw that could be said about it except the fight sequences, although they're not so bad to watch even after 2 decades, which is a fabulous achievement in itself.","7"

One of the best areas of this film is the use of special effects in the battle scenes where the cameras rotate fully around the action.

I've got a simple synopsis for what some are trying to class as the greatest movie of the year:impressive ideas/lines,impressive effects......muddled execution.

As ever,this is one of those movies you're probably better off catching at the cinema because the special effects will probably have greater effect there.Seen on small screen,they look a bit cramped.It's nice to see Keanu Reeves back again after such a notably long stretch,but the simple fact remains,he is something of a wooden actor,and not the easiest screen persona to warm to to make it any better,e.g. as in the case of Chuck Norris.Laurence Fishburne,as ever,is ace but even he can't really seem to make sight nor sense of this rather lame material for plot development.I could'nt understand what on earth was going on throughout.

In it's favour,the special effects were impressive.The giant bug like things were super.

I'd say this was a Sci-Fi film in which you had to use your brain ,only for this you'd need a coherent plot of sorts.In my harshest tone,I could accuse The Matrix of being complete technobabble.The ending is a bit daft,too.

"classicsoncall","""...there's a difference between knowing the path... and walking the path"".","25 September 2011","I saw this movie when it first came out, and can't really grasp the idea that an entire decade has gone by since then. Watching today, it still holds up as an exciting sci-fi action thriller, with effects that still look relatively new even though many of them have been copied and even parodied since. I have to admit, time travel, dream stories and virtual reality films can leave you with your head hurting a bit, but if you watch this one attentively, you'll find that it was cleverly written leaving very little wiggle room for plot holes to creep through.

Essentially, 'The Matrix' is a computer generated dream world which replaced the 'real' world that was destroyed at some point during the twenty second century in a battle between humans and an artificial intelligence. The AI won, and subsequently created an entire race of machines feeding off the living energy of humans kept alive in a state of suspended animation. The very few humans still alive wait for the day that 'The One' will destroy the Matrix and free those under it's control. To protect itself, The Matrix has created a race of machines called Sentinels who track down humans, be it in the real world or in The Matrix itself. This can all get a little confusing, so it's best to take this all in with no distraction, because things move back and forth between the two realms rather quickly.

If you really want to take the concept of the picture a step further, there's plenty here to dissect and analyze. For some, the religious and philosophical elements conveyed by The Matrix and The One are quite overt. One of the immediate thoughts that struck me was the parallel of The Matrix to The Force in ""Star Wars"", an eternal and universal life energy that unites all living creatures. The One can be interpreted as The Savior, the Redeemer of Mankind who will set all of humanity free from the curse of original sin, or in this case, the slavery of the pods. I guess if you're skeptical of this philosophic/religious connection, this will all be a lot of mumbo-jumbo, but to me it's a lot more interesting to look at it that way than just seeing a bunch of special effects involving insane martial arts moves and time stopping bullets in flight.

What I didn't care for so much was the make up of the Sentinels, not the human ones but the machines. Personally, I thought Hugo Weaving was great as Agent Smith in his relentless pursuit of Neo. But the idea of those squid-like battle ships attacking the Nebuchadnezzar seemed to defy a certain logic. Wasn't Zion, the last human city located underground? The concept of The Oracle also catches one a bit off guard as well. I mean, my idea of an Oracle, who was supposed to know everything about The Resistance since the beginning, wasn't exactly that of an old woman who smokes cigarettes and bakes cookies. This introduction of a bit of whimsy might have been intriguing to the Wachowski Brothers, so if that's the case, I guess I can go along with it.

Anyway, I like the idea of The Matrix and I like the movie. I can't say as much about the sequels, and it's been some time since I've seen those as well. I'll get around to them again eventually.","9"
"Mike_Devine","Still holds up as a modern sci-fi classic","31 December 2021","The pre-millennium sci-fi boom can trace its roots back to the one, the only, 'The Matrix.' From the minds of the Wachowskis, the Keanu Reeves juggernaut left a lasting legacy on the genre and influenced many films that followed in its footsteps.

The reason 'Matrix' works so well is because it is focused, stays within the lines and has a standalone storyline. The way we are introduced to Neo and see his story arc develop over the course of the film is reminiscent of that of Luke Skywalker's - the initial confusion about who he is, learning his skills and abilities, falling in love while trying to stay focused on his mission - all of these are key character drivers for ""the One."" The film also benefits from not being aware of how cool it is - something its sequels could have taken note of.

But it's not just the Keanu show. Carrie-Anne Moss, Laurence Fishburne and Hugo Weaving all deliver with memorable performances. In fact, these four lead actors could probably carry the entire story on their shoulders if they had to. The soundtrack is also unique in a new age, euro-grunge way that screams late 90s.

Yes, it's conventional wisdom, but 'The Matrix' is one of the best sci-fi films to debut in the past 25 years, and should not be looked down upon based on its far-inferior offspring.","9"

Surely, when I saw it in theaters when I was very young I loved it and went gaga and saw the whole trilogy in theaters and liked t to an extent But now, when I revisited it after several years, the 'wow' factor has gone and now it seems like any other action film.

Surely, in terms of action and the whole production design, this was the first of it's kind that had the greenish tinge to frames and setting up infinite space in a room, in that complete white background scene where ""Neo"" and Morpheus talk.

Keanu Reeves as Neo/Thomas Anderson was good ad so was Carrie Ann Moss as Trinity but I loved Morpheus played y Laurence Fishburne the most as his character was the epitome of setting men free from bondage and in his own way.

The writer-directors Wachowskis must be appreciated and credited a lot for having taken the Hollywood action sequences to a new level. Be it the ""Bullet movement"" or the ""walking on the walls"" they were stunningly and with an ease.

We know, that none of it is possible, this is a science fantasy film that takes the premise from the myths of ""being free from world"". It takes from the Buddhism concept of ""Nirvana"" I think that means liberation of the soul. Yet, we are engaged in a way much better than many sci-fi films that this makes us believe in the theory at least.

I might not like this whole picture being seen again, but I am going with a 3/5 that means the film is surely good. I might not watch this again just that I am not much into action.","10"
"Screen_O_Genic","The Search For the Truth","1 July 2019","What is reality? A system that controls all of existence rendering all creation as slaves of fate or an open canvas for beings to create their own world? A man is determined to search for the truth and attain it. He eventually meets a collective of individuals determined to break what they believe to be the shackles that imprison humanity keeping them from fulfilling their true potential. Good versus evil, philosophical truths and a lot of gunfire and fisticuffs ensue. One of the most influential films, ""The Matrix"" introduced some of the most iconic scenes in film history: the freeze and slow motion fight scenes, the blue and red pill, the green dripping letters and the question of reality are among the most copied and parodied in entertainment. The film slows down in the second half, when the compelling intellectuality of the first gives way to a typical action flick. The pc-multicult format which has been the bane of western film in the past twenty years is pretty prominent. Not as obnoxious as the rest that would follow but it's there. As iconic as it is ground-breaking, ""The Matrix"" has stamped its mark on cinema and human consciousness and its potent and profound influence lingers to this day.","6"

"renegadeviking-271-528568","The Matrix review","25 January 2020","Well, here it is! Yay, after being forced to sit through the boring parts of Transformers, I get to watch one of my favorite films of all time! WHOO!

Trinity meets up with Neo, and we see some fantastic acting from our two leads. Sorry for the sarcasm, it's just true. But the acting's not too terrible, and it doesn't really bother me. We are left wondering what the Matrix really is when Trinity leaves. Neo wakes up late for work the next day, and gets into trouble. We learn that his real name is Mr. Thomas Anderson, something that Agent Smith will never ever let us forget.

Neo is contacted my Morpheus at his job, and is warned that people (Agents) are coming for him. He is told when and where to go in order to avoid detection. The problem with this scene is that we learn that those outside the Matrix (where Morpheus is) can only view it in code, as the image renderers work for the Matrix. So...how can Morpheus see such specific images from looking at code?

Neo tries to escape by climbing on the outside of the building, but gives up quickly, letting himself be taken by the Agents. Next comes a great interrogation scene, where our hero (Neo) and villain (Smith) meet for the very first time. Smith refers to Morpheus, the mysterious man Neo's been looking for as ""the most dangerous man alive."" Neo resists Smith's questions by asking for his phone call, but Smith asks what use that is if he is unable to speak, and removes his mouth.

Sorry, that's horrifying, I know. Also, it's probably Keanu's best acting moment. But, anyways, Neo wakes up, believing it all to be a dream. He's contacted by Morpheus on a tapped line and told where to meet. The movie should've ended right there, with Agents capturing them. But it doesn't.

He almost leaves, but Trinity tells him that he knows what's down that road. What, the sequels?

Anyways, they remove a tracking device from his navel which was inserted during the interrogation scene. They reach the building Morpheus is in, and Neo and him meet face-to-face. You could say it's a Face/Off... sorry for bringing up such an awful movie.

So, Neo is told that the Matrix is everywhere. That he was born into a prison, into slavery. But, no one can be told what The Matrix is, they have to see it themselves, so Neo is given the classic choice, red pill or blue pill.

(To clarify: Red pill=leaving the Matrix, blue pill=staying) Obviously, Neo takes the red pill, and is then taken to a room where he is shown the cracks in reality and ejected from the Matrix into this nightmare:

But, the Machines don't do that, and Neo is flushed down what is basically a toilet and rescued by Morpheus and his crew aboard the Nebuchadnezzar, an interesting name, but one that I'm not sure what the meaning of is. If someone knows why they chose this name, please let me know. (By the way, I already know about the biblical Nebuchadnezzar, I just don't know how the story connects.)

Neo's muscles have atrophied, so they have to electrically stimulate them to repair them. The Wachowskis have covered all the bases of his body having decayed from non-use. (As far as I know, not being a doctor.) We are introduced to the vibrant colors of this film: grays, browns, and greens. We learn that, instead of 1999, it's closer to 2199. Really interesting, fish-out-of-water angle. We're introduced to the superfluous other crew members, who nobody cares about. Who's your favorite Matrix character, little Timmy? Apoc! Shut up.

Neo flips out, and Morpheus tells him that they normally recruit young, as older minds can't handle the strain. Neo is told the legend of The One, a man born in the Matrix who could change anything within it, and that the Oracle prophesied he would be reborn.

Next, we learn that one of the memorable crew members, Tank, and his unmemorable brother, Dozer, were born outside the Matrix. Then, Neo has martial arts downloaded into his brain, prompting this iconic Keanu moment:

Then, they enter a sparring program, where Neo is taught that those who know about the Matrix can bend or break the laws of physics in order to perform impossible stunts, and that they can't get tired inside the Matrix, because they're not really exercising. The kung fu (which Keanu, of course, knows) in this movie is incredibly well-choreographed and thought out, delivering a tension-filled fight which utilizes slow motion in some of the best ways I've ever seen it used in all of cinema.

Neo moves incredibly fast, and he still doesn't believe Morpheus, somehow. He's loaded into the jump program, where he fails miserably, resulting in a clip somewhat like a Wile E. Coyote cartoon.

Everyone's disappointed, but not surprised, because nobody makes the first jump. Neo finds that he's bleeding in the real world, because his mind ""made it real."" So, his mind caused his lip to bleed? Okay. And if you die in the Matrix, you die in the real world. Morpheus and Neo enter another training program, where Morpheus explains that the people inside the Matrix are dangerous because they will fight to protect the system. In other words, they will ""Stick to the Status Quo.""

This whole exercise was showcasing that anyone in the Matrix can be your enemy. Keep your focus sharp. Eyes on the prize. Getcha head in the game. No, I won't stick that video in here, I wouldn't put two HSM songs on one post.

We learn that the Agents are the guards of the Matrix, and that no one has survived a fight with them. But Neo can become faster and stronger than them, because he doesn't have to follow the rules of the Matrix.

In the real world, we are introduced to the Sentinels, or Squiddies, which are a killing machine designed for one thing: search and destroy. The ships take them out using an EMP, but have to power down all systems first, in order to remain operational.

Next, we get a scene between Cypher (the bald one) and Neo, and Cypher explains that they have to view the Matrix in code. This scene actually makes Cypher a relatable character, and quite possibly the only one (other than Morpheus and Trinity) to really connect with Neo. This makes it all the more effective when he turns evil and betrays the crew to the Agents in the next scene so he'll be allowed back into the Matrix with his memories wiped, and as someone rich and important, like an actor. They ask him for access codes to the Zion mainframe in return, which he doesn't know, but he promises them Morpheus, who does know.","10"
"Mark-201","Are my friends and I the only ones who hate this?","14 April 1999","I will say that the matrix had a good idea and for a brief 20 minutes in the middle, it was intriguing. But the cheesy special effects and melodrama were too much for me. Most of the movie was laughable.

"MattUK","Well...","14 October 2002","What am I supposed to say about this film?

Pure and simple, it is a blast. It is about someone discovering his own invincibility though he certainly doesn't feel invincible to start with.

It's about working out the definition of real - the character Cypher throws us an interesting question

With the real world now ruined, what exactly are the rebels fighting for -and in all honesty with a straight choice between the 'real world' in this film and the Matrix - how many of us would abandon the Matrix?","1"
"Sonatine97","Tedium Beyond Belief","27 August 2001","I really cannot understand the hype & gushing praise for this sfx/cgi gloated film.

The story is routine - a contemporary mix of Men In Black, Tron and a shedload of other ""10 seconds to go before the world is destroyed"" movies.

The principle idea of a make-believe world called The Matrix, a world where we all live totally oblivious to the fact that this world is totally artificial and controlled by machines, could have been immensely interesting in the hands of a better set of scriptwriters & directors. In any case this kind of story isn't a million miles away from Douglas Adams' Hitchhiker's Guide To the Galaxy, a book far more interesting than this rubbish.

For the sake of a good story the Wachoowski Brothers (writers & directors) went all gooey for lots of cgi to distract the viewer with the many plotholes and poor character development. The story simply gets in the way of a good sfx. And on and on it goes, each cgi trying to out ""wow"" the previous effect to the point where you wonder whether this is nothing more than an expensive computer game.

People went wild when we saw our heroes climb up walls, jump huge rooftops & dodge speeding bullets in slowmo. But so what? I feel we have become so blaise about cgi that only our imagination limits us to what we think is possible. And the cgi in this film no longer had the same kind of ""jaw dropping"" effect as one witnessed in Star Wars, Terminator 2 or even 2001:Space Odyssey.

Our superheroes, Keanu Reeves, Laurence Fishbourne & Carrie Annie Moss, looked like bit players compared to the computer bits making up the over indulgent CGIs. Fishbourne tries to come over all cool & hip, but looks fairly average when asked to do anything remotely interesting; Reeves acts just like...well...Reeves, with that usual ""no one's home"" expression & designer jackets. While Moss hops in & out of the movie when it looks as if the going's getting a bit tough for Reeves, resulting in an ending ripped straight from Luc Besson's 5th Element!

This film lives off its own hype & marketing, and already looks dated. Once you've viewed the film more than a couple of times and got used to the sfx you then want to look for more depth only to find that its only the sfx that holds the film together.

BAD!

"freakroach","The Matrix was gamechanger","27 March 2016","I think there were Action/Sci-Fi movies before The Matrix and there are action/sci-fi movies after The Matrix. It changed everything.

This movie was one of it's kind when it came and there was nothing like this seen before. Awesome action sequences, bullet times, slow motions and the concept, everything was awesome.

Not just action, the movie is great in other aspects too. The movie is thought provoking and very influential. This movie forced every filmmaker of action/sci-fi movies to step up.

I still remember when i watched this movie for the very first time more than 10 years ago, it felt like i'm in a different world. I've never ever seen anything like this. Movie had awesome effects, that might seems outdated these days, but that time it was first time something like that was shown in movies.

This movie was really a gamechanger, and we are lucky that this movie actually happened.","10"
"TheCorniestLemur","The Matrix is everywhere...unfortunately","16 August 2021","So...I'm reviewing The Matrix. I'm sure no one's ever said anything I'm about to say.

Well, I'll bring up all the obvious stuff in a bit, but first I want to stress that this is a pretty important film to me. I first saw it when I was 13, and I think I owe a lot of my love for film to that initial experience.

Somehow, I had managed to avoid knowing what the titular Matrix was, and I won't be spoiling that in this review just in case any of you have also managed to avoid that particular piece of knowledge...somehow. If you have no idea what I'm talking about though, Do. Not. Read. This. Review. Just go and watch it now, because that experience I had when watching this for the first time is such a...well, experience that it really saddens me knowing that this film is so ingrained in the collective consciousness that it's virtually impossible to go into it knowing nothing.

So if you do know what I'm referring to, you can probably imagine that as a stupid 13 year old who hadn't ventured much outside the realm of family-friendly classics and stupid action films, sitting down to watch this just because it was on TV and I had heard its name mentioned a few times, by the 35 minute mark or so, my mind had absolutely exploded. Sure, you can chalk some of that up to me having not heard of any of the philosophical concepts this film has under its belt, but there were plenty of grown adults similarly mind-blown back in 1999.

Quite fittingly, this film opened my eyes in a sense, and made me want to check out deeper stuff instead of just the other stuff I mentioned, and I don't think that would have happened in the same way if I had watched any other film at that time.

Because while there is certainly philosophical and allegorical stuff, ranging from the nature of reality, to reincarnation, to the fact that the Wachowskis had created a film partially about the experience of being transgender years before they were out as such, and years before anyone who wasn't trans even knew about or cared about trans people (seriously how is all this happening all at once), there is also robots, kung fu, jumping 50 feet in the air, badass gunfights, and people looking really cool. In short, everything that appeals to stupid 13 year olds like I was.

In my mind, it's an absolutely perfect bridge between mindless fun action, and things that challenge your brain a bit more, because it definitely served as a kind of bridge for me. And while I'm not going to talk about the story anymore than I already have, rest assured it is amazing, and that all the main cast is interesting and really damn cool. Even though I'd never call this an especially character-driven film, what is there is more than enough to make them all memorable.

And holy crap are they perfectly cast. This is most definitely one of those roles that fits Keanu (you know what happens when he's playing a role that doesn't fit him), Carrie-Anne Moss is badass as all hell, Laurence Fishburne exudes such a thick mysterious air, Hugo Weaving took a potentially bland as hell villain and turned him into one of the best in sci-fi history, do I need to go on?

It's perfectly paced, amazingly directed and shot, the soundtrack is fantastic, and you all already know how perfect the action scenes in this are. That does bring me to a small complaint though...some of the effects haven't held up all that well. Not all of them, but certainly enough that it's noticeable. There is also a small amount of pretty bad line delivery, and I bloody hate something that happens towards the end that is never explained and makes absolutely zero sense, but other than that, well...you probably know how great this is already, and if you haven't seen it yet, and especially if you don't know what it's about, please go and watch it before some genius just tells you what it's about. Because more than any other film that almost everyone knows the twist of (The Empire Strikes Back, The Sixth Sense, Planet Of The Apes, etc), I think this is the one that would be best experienced knowing nothing about it, and the one for which it sucks the most that that is nearly impossible these days.

So...why are you still here? Go watch it, like, now.","9"
"AKS-6","Cool enough for a thousand films","15 July 1999","First of all, I firmly believe that ""The Matrix"" is a movie that demands multiple viewings to be fully appreciated. I have only seen it once, on July 14.

Having said that, though, I must say that I thoroughly enjoyed watching ""The Matrix"". The special effects are superb and the production design is great. I even enjoyed the fight scenes and the shoot-outs which I normally think are just a waste of time. The movie is almost unbearably cool. And the scene in which Neo (Keanu Reeves) comes walking with a black trench coat, shades, and enough guns for an entire platoon, is so cool that it almost hurts to see it. And the shoot-out following that. Wow!

Some people complain about the story, I say that the story is fascinating and interesting. Sure, there are some holes in it, but overall it's good. However, the first 45 to 60 minutes are, I'm sorry to say, mediocre and not good at all. I was, at times, bored during that first hour.

The acting is, well... not that good. Keanu Reeves has never been a convincing actor, but for being Keanu, though, he does a good job. Laurence Fishburne is the only actor in the movie that is really convincing.

It must also be said that ""The Matrix"" is certainly not a movie suited for the ""small screen"". If you think you want to see ""The Matrix"" I think you should rush to the nearest cinema immediately as you will not appreciate it fully renting it on video, or DVD for that matter.

In short: fascinating story, great special effects, and great fight and shoot-out scenes. I would give this movie a 7 or 8 out of 10. Too bad about the mediocre beginning. But one thing is for sure (and this might be a spoiler so if you haven't seen the movie don't read the rest), considering where the movie ends I look forward to the sequel(s) already.","10"

"willcundallreview","A Sci-fi classic","8 March 2014","Rating-9/10

The Matrix is a legendary Sci-Fi film with big effects, action and adventure and serves up a superb film that can thoroughly be enjoyed. With it's story with a thousand pieces, watching it is like a jigsaw with pieces added in over and over making for a plot which is well done and thought out. Some consider it a classic and it is easy to see why, the effects are well done and the cast do an OK job too and coupled with the plot and just even little things the creators have put in, it turns out to be Brilliant and pretty flawless, and here is why I think so below this.

The story is fast, explaining all the things going on well and letting the viewer take things in gently but by the end the story accelerates and the action and adventure kicks in, a beautiful balance. As I said the plot is smart and slick and for us the viewer predicting what is next cannot be guessed, even if you know the basic plot, too much happens to know at all what is happening. Within the story we have all the famous slow motion fight scenes and they do wonders for the film which succeeds with a perfect mix of violence but drama, thrilling yet witty, it all goes well and I couldn't tell you to watch this more, if you haven't already.

I felt the cast aren't the best in this and Keanu Reeves in the lead role is kind of stale and dull, very emotionless, but he doesn't do his job that badly that the film is also Poor. Laurence Fishburne is OK in his role and even if you think he is being emotionless that is just what Morpheus is like anyway so his role is fine. Everyone else is fine but no one excels in the entire cast and if anything the acting is this movies weakest part, but it isn't bad though. Finally on the characters they are fun, dark thinking and always serious but with a good mix of Neo(he is oblivious) we see a fun start but by the end everything everyone needs to know is already taken down.

The Wachowski brothers do a great job with this, and to say this is there biggest hit, well it really is and by far as it is well directed by them and also written by them in a great way too. It serves up to be fun but dramatic and although the fun side isn't expressed greatly, the drama is good enough for it to be superb and the brothers knew what they were doing here. I loved the effects, and to say they are in 1999 it is even better with some fantastic things on show and great choreographed fight scenes(with a little effect added in) which are just great to see with the eye, even if a little violent at times, and maybe comic book style.

The film can be too violent so maybe not for those who dislike that kind of thing, the story I guess for some could be confusing and if you don't listen to the entire story then you will lose what the whole point of what there doing is about. Overall not too many criticisms but I said about the acting and maybe the film is slow, but for those who watch I think it is up to you to see any criticism, I am sure some will dislike this movie so just have a watch and see what you think.

People who enjoy a good action film wrapped in a smart plot will love this and I couldn't tell them to see this more. Sci-Fi movie fans will also love it and with such a rich Sci-Fi script and special effects it could be some peoples favourite movie by the end of the film, also in that mix the fight scenes could gain fans by themselves as little movies before or since have implemented such an interesting and fast Sci-Fi action film, dabbled with a little mystery.

I give it a 9/10 meaning I thought it was just about a wonderful film, and it is just stunning, if you attempt to rate this you get thrown up with the acting and then the story, the special effects but is it too confusing, but by the end you just feel you have seen a superb movie that you enjoyed to the fullest. With the sequels regarded as some of the worst sequels ever you can just sit back and savour the first one and who knows, maybe you will enjoy the other instalments too.","10"
"KineticSeoul","A revolutionary movie","19 December 2012","When I saw this movie for the fist time when it came out. I thought it was the coolest and most badass movie ever made. I wasn't entirely sure what was going on when it came to the story at that time. But all I knew was that is was really cool. It's a bit outdated now but it still left a mark in cinema and inspired a lot of movie and more to come. The story is actually very creative and has sci-fi philosophical elements that is well blended into the story and isn't forced. And the dialogue is even cool and interesting. I am not going to get in depth with the story but I will just say that it's pretty clever without it being overly complex. This is probably Keanu Reeves's trademark movie and I can't picture anyone else taking the role of Neo besides him. And glad that someone like Will Smith didn't end up with this role. Nothing against Will Smith but Keanu Reeves is just the better candidate. He was just perfect for a movie like this and fit the image of a average cool hacker that gets picked or chosen to do something much much greater. Even the mentor character Morpheus(Laurence Fishburne) and the main villain Agent Smith played by Hugo Weaving are excellent choices for the roles they were given. The action was super cool and even amazing when this movie first came out. In fact it's the first movie I seen that blends slow motion and bullet time in a effective manner in a movie. It tries to combine so many stuff into this one film but it does it right. One of it is the anime film ""Ghost in the Shell"" which obviously played a huge part in inspiring the Wachowski brothers. Overall this is a cool and entertaining movie with some wicked ideas that all sci-fi movie watchers shouldn't miss out on...Well it's been out for more than a decade. It's a shame the sequels will ruin this awesome mythology of ""The Matrix"". To the point I think this movie would have been even more legendary if the sequels didn't come out or if the sequels was at least good as ""Dark City"".

"bh_tafe3","Took risks and proved a game changer","21 February 2015","I was one of the many people who went and saw this at the cinemas when it first came out. Unlike many of those people, I wasn't particularly blown away. While I found the ideas in the story interesting, I didn't find the way they were explored to be especially engaging. I really liked some of the effects, but thought mainly of how much I would like to see them used in a better movie. Then I left the theatre with my two friends, one a homosexual artist, the other a theology student, and they both talked and talked and talked about the impressive visuals, philosophical symbolism and deep ideas present in the film. After around 30 minutes in conversation I was asked for my opinion. Not wanting to lie, I was frank. ""Guys, 90% of that movie was as cliché as hell (may not have been the exact word I used)"" Silence is golden.

And cliché as hell is exactly what 90% of this film is. The long leather jackets date this instantly. The hero is a Jesus allegory and he is saved by the power of love. A very poorly fleshed out and unconvincing love at that. There are one liners in the middle of gun fights, clichéd fighting scenes, and truly boring colours and characters. This was every action movie you've ever seen, with some nice new tricks.

There are plenty of positives too. After watching Hugo Weaving give excellent performances in Aussie dramas like Bodyline and The Interview, it was great to see him given a big role in a Hollywood blockbuster, and nail it. Man being imprisoned by machines is not a new idea, but I thought they did a reasonable mash-up of the various popular apocalyptic futuristic sci-fi stories. The ideas in the film were interesting, I just didn't think they explored them very well. Like I said, I didn't hate it, I was just really surprised by the OMGZ!!!!11!!! reaction it received.

My feelings on the movie have mellowed since then, now that I have only seen it once or twice in the last decade, now that every church group doesn't have a weekly bible study looking at the philosophy and spiritual messages in the Matrix, and now that its impact can be fully measured. The Matrix was innovative, but inoffensive, and unquestionably, a game changer. It changed the way action films were made and it changed the way action films were written. Bullet time was a tremendous innovation that every action film used for a long time afterward. A technology that was built on and improved to the point that the effects used here barely look like a big deal. It was possible to make an intelligent action film with interesting ideas and have people pay money to watch it. Not that this one is especially endowed with intelligence. And while I've never heard someone give a testimony in church starting with (I'm imagining this being read with a deep southern accent) ""I was a sinner, until one day a friend invited me to a bible study where they used The Matrix to lead me to Jesus..."" the church certainly did get excited that this (admittedly unintentionally)had give them a mainstream evangelism tool, before they worked out in about 2007 that this wasn't all that mainstream any more.

I encourage anyone to watch this and also Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon, two movies that came out within a couple of years of each other and changed the way action films were made. I really hope younger audiences will be blown away by this and have a great cinematic viewing experience, appreciating just how big an impact this had. But I'm not going to lie, it just didn't do it for me. Feel free to disagree with me.","1"

For me, most interesting and moving part was early scene with Morpheus, when he introduced Neo with reality. I would rate it more than 8 if there was more such scene instead for my taste too much fight scenes. Even if they were pretty much innovative.

Now, some days ago, I was shocked seeing that authors of this movie are Wachowski sisters - and I knew that Larry went thru gender change somewhere in 2003. But other one ... Now it is little corrected, but still - what matters: their names and gender when movie was made, or what is today ? Yeah, this is probably something new, but I really tend to keep record with original names, condition. Imagine now that instead John Houston and his pic. we see now something like 'former John Houston' and picture of his grave. But maybe I'm just an old fashioned old grumpy man, who can not accept new things, habits in society. Or this new, pushed by some circles PC behavior, even if it resulted already in lot of nonsense and absurdness. I guess, they really are in some kind of alternate reality. And when realize how wrong it is, it will be to late. Worst thing is that there is already lot of it, seen in Matrix present - tracking, watching, hearing people via computers, smart phones (GPS) etc.

And unlike in movie Matrix, good fighting skills, slow motion (time freeze) will not help in this. I was on that will watch it again from time to time, but sorry, things in our reality are more shocking and scary. As say: life writes best stories. Pardon, wrong word. Not best, most interesting. Not good. Where is Neo, when we need him ?","6"
"cyberknight","A Movie with Different Layers","13 August 2008","Like ""Blade Runner"", the ""Matrix"" trilogy has at least two different levels of story. Both are evident, but we, at first, only see the first and less important, which is the Matrix itself and the man-against-machine war. The second level, which is the central plot of the whole thing, is so obvious that it becomes invisible.

If you liked this movie more than the sequel, ""Matrix: Reloaded"", then you, like almost everyone else, didn't understand it. If you are feeling bad about that, don't worry, it took me almost eight years to finally understand it, too! Many people liked this first part, the rest hated it, and both didn't understand it. Interestingly enough, the ones that hated it were closer to understanding it than those that liked it. People that didn't like the ""Matrix"" trilogy always talk about the ""shallow story"" and the ""cheap philosophy"". As much as they are right about the cheap philosophy, they are complete and absolutely wrong about the shallow story. The ""pseudo-philosophic junk"" is, actually, junk, but a very important part of the story, and that is so clear in this first part of the trilogy that no one actually realized it. It happens because, taken alone, ""The Matrix"" is just a fantasy movie, placed some time in the future.

The key to realize the greatness of the ""Matrix"" trilogy is accepting that it is a science fiction, not a fantasy movie. With that in mind, you can find the real villain of the trilogy, then everything will make sense, including the things that make no sense at all in a science fiction movie, like Neo's skills, both inside and outside the Matrix. The really interesting thing is that the villain openly shows its evilness in ""Reloaded"", it even explains its reason to do the things it does, but we promptly forgive or forget it! And pay a lot of attention to the dialogs at the very ending, in ""Matrix: Revolutions"", don't be deceived or misled by the background, because they present the final results of the main struggle of the trilogy and you will realize who is the winner.

So, follow the white rabbit and find out who is the real villain in the ""Matrix"" trilogy. After that, you will see that almost all speeches in it have two completely different meanings, one that supports a weak futuristic cloak-and-dagger flick, with lots of ""cool"", but unimportant Greek-and-whatever references, and another that leads to a much darker reality, which will make you love the whole trilogy, or more properly, the trilogy as a whole, not only this first installment.","9"

""You are like everyone, born a slave, you were born in a prison you can't perceive"" This conjecture is shocking enough, but the depth of ""The Matrix"" does not stop there, it also raises new questions on this basis: Will you choose blue pills or red pills? Is it to choose a beautiful illusion or a cruel reality? On the surface, it seems to be a good choice, but it is actually much more difficult than we thought. On one side is the future world of apocalypse, torn by hunger and cold, and the danger of being chased by robots On one side is a warm and peaceful era, with blue sky and white clouds, beautiful scenery, and even the opportunity to become a successful person. Indeed, everyone knows that no matter how beautiful the dream is, it is just a dream. But Sever is willing to sell everyone for a dream. If we really escape the matrix and experience the cruelty of reality, maybe we will make the same choice as Sever. Just as when you have a beautiful dream, you would rather stay in the dream than wake up.","3"

Preface; you must read the philosophical article ""Brain in a Vat,"" I believe by Hilary Putnam.

The premise of the film, that everything we see is a computer created illusion, called ""The Matrix,"" is sheer genius, and brings in elements of post deconstruction theory as well as Baudrillard.

And, Neo is One spelled sideways.

Incredible Christological symbology here, as well as Christian metaphors-his girlfriend is even named ""Trinity"" - the Father is Morpheus, the son is Neo - the ""One"" - Trinity is the Mary Magdalene figure- and the Holy Spirit, well, you figure it out.

Amazing action sequences and cinematography advanced for its time.

"waltermwilliams","What Walter Williams Is Watching","27 December 2021","I still can't believe how well the CGI of ""The Matrix""has stood the test of time since 1999.

The original movie in this franchise is a fave for many.

It was filmed on the sniff of an oily rag budget of only $60m mostly in Sydney, Australia.

Had ""The Matrix"" been shot in Hollywood you could triple that spend, but for the price of a Blockbusters canteen budget the Wachowski Brothers made it work.

What is the Matrix?

That's the kind of question that leads you down a giant Alice in Wonderland Rabbit hole.

Follow the white rabbit, take the red pill not the blue and find out the mind officially blown truth about the world as Neo (The Chosen One) ,played by Keanu Reeves, knows it.

Hugo Weaving is pure evil as Agent Smith Watch out for: Sydney landmarks and Robert Taylor as another Agent, plus the ""Drunken Boxing"" fight technique that's downloaded into Mr Andersons system.

Maybe this was not the ideal movie for me to watch as I recover at home after keyhole surgery removed my gallbladder through my bellybutton this week.

The reverse technique is used to plant a bug in Neo...gross! And then extract it...even more gross!

I'm brushing up on my Matrix knowledge before I check out the 2021 version which opened on Boxing Day.

Meantime the first in this series is slightly less confusing on second viewing with a script that no Studio wanted to green light till they saw the storyboards.

What's more amazing is Reeves did most of his own stunts even though he was recovering from spinal surgery.

""The Matrix "" deserves a solid 9 Mr Anderson!","10"
"timeblank","Original Badass Sci-Fi Movie","11 September 2018","My review is late for this movie! I don't care if it is. The Matrix is one original movie. While other movies and shows tries to copy the effects of the matrix.

The world is your playground and anything becomes possible. That is so cool to hear! The computer animation is awesome. Super slow motion bullets, dodging moves, and the action scenes.

Another great scene is Neo and Trinity are in a white area room, he asks the Matrix for guns and you see infinite amount of guns appear. It's cool because anything you desire can appear to you in a snap.

That's what was missing in the second and third movie. The ability to ask what you want in the matrix. I love this movie! I recommend it to anyone!","7"

"jboothmillard","The Matrix","23 June 2005","This is considered by many to be a milestone of movies, that pushed the boundaries of imagination and digital-effects technology further, and I'm very happy I watched it to confirm this status, written, produced and directed by the Wachowskis (Bound, Speed Racer, Cloud Atlas). Basically, in an abandoned hotel in a major city, Trinity (Carrie-Anne Moss) is cornered by the police but overpowers them with superhuman abilities. He is chased whilst fleeing by the police and a group of black suited Agents, with similar superhuman abilities. She escapes by answering a ringing phone in a public telephone booth and vanishes. Computer programmer and hacker Thomas Anderson, known by his alias ""Neo"" (Keanu Reeves), is confused by repeated online encounters with something called ""the Matrix"", and seeing the phrase ""Follow the White Rabbit"". He is approached by Trinity in a rave bar, she tells him he is in great danger, that they are watching him and that he is searching for answers, particularly to the most important question of all: what is the Matrix? The following morning, at Neo's job at Metacortex, a leading software company, a team of Agents and police, led by Agent Smith (Hugo Weaving), arrive searching for him. Neo is contacted by Morpheus (Laurence Fishburne), an infamous hacker, who attempts to guide him to safety, but he surrenders rather than risking his life trying to escape. The Agents attempt to coerce Neo into helping them locate Morpheus, who they claim is a terrorist. When Neo refuses, the agents fuse his mouth shut and implant a robotic ""bug"" in his stomach. Neo awakens believing that he had a nightmare. Soon after, Neo is taken by Trinity to meet Morpheus, and she removes the bug from Neo, proving what he experienced was real. Morpheus offers Neo a choice between two pills: the blue pill will return him to his former life, the red pill will reveal the truth about the Matrix. Neo chooses to take the red pill, his reality begins to distort, and he awakens in a liquid-filled pod among countless others, containing other human beings. He is then brought aboard Morpheus' flying ship, the Nebuchadnezzar. As Neo recuperates from a lifetime of physical inactivity in the pod, Morpheus explains the situation: a war broke out between the human race and intelligent machines in the early 21st century, when the humans blocked the machines from accessing solar energy, the machines responded by capturing humans and harvesting their bioelectric power with their minds being trapped in the Matrix, a shared simulation of the real world that existed in 1999. The machines won the war, and the remaining free humans took refuge in the underground city of Zion. Morpheus and his crew are a group of rebels who hack into the Matrix to ""unplug"" enslaved humans and recruit them, and the Matrix's simulated nature allows them to bend its physical laws. Morpheus warns Neo that death within the Matrix would mean death to a real physical body, that the Agents are sentient programs that eliminate threats to the system, and, in the real world, machines called Sentinels are hunting the rebels. Morpheus virtually trains Neo with everything that is possible within the understanding of the Matrix, from kung fu fighting to firing weapons. Neo displays great ability and skill, cementing Morpheus' belief that he is ""The One"", a human prophesied to free humankind. The group enters the Matrix to visit the Oracle (Gloria Foster), the prophet who predicted that the One would emerge. She implies to Neo that he is not the One and warns that he will have to choose between Morpheus' life and his own. Before they can leave the Matrix, Agents and police have been tipped off by disgruntled crew member Cypher (Joe Pantoliano). He has tipped off the Agents to ambush the group in exchange to return to a comfortable life back in the Matrix. Morpheus buys time for the others by fighting with Agent Smith and is captured, while Mouse (Matt Doran) is shot to death. Cypher exits the Matrix and murders crew members Apoc (Julian Arahanga) and Switch (Belinda McClory), while they are unconscious and connected. Before he can kill Neo and Trinity, crew member Tank (Marcus Chong) regains consciousness and kills Cypher before pulling Neo and Trinity from the Matrix. The Agents interrogate Morpheus to gain the access codes to the mainframe computer in Zion, which would allow them to destroy it. Neo is determined to return to the Matrix to rescue him, as the Oracle prophesied; Trinity insists she goes with him. While rescuing Morpheus, Neo gains confidence in his abilities, performing feats comparable to those of the Agents. As Morpheus and Trinity safely exit the Matrix, Smith ambushes and kills Neo. While a group of Sentinels attack the Nebuchadnezzar, Trinity confesses her love for Neo and says the Oracle told her she would fall in love with the One. Neo is revived with newfound abilities to perceive and control the Matrix, he then leaps into Smith's body and causes him to explode, while the other Agents flee. He makes it out of the Matrix just as the ship's EMP (electromagnetic pulse) is activated and disables the attacking Sentinels inside the ship. Back in the Matrix, Neo makes a telephone call, promising the machines that he will show their prisoners ""a world where anything is possible"". He hangs up and flies away. Also starring Anthony Ray Parker as Dozer, Paul Goddard as Agent Brown, Robert Taylor as Agent Jones, David Aston as Rhineheart, Marc Aden Gray as Choi, Ada Nicodemou as Dujoir (White Rabbit Girl) and Deni Gordon as Priestess. Reeves gives a good performance as the recluse who may be saviour of humanity from cyberspace slavery, Fishburne is really likeable as the inspirational leader and teacher, Moss is terrific as the beautiful feisty love interest, Weaving enjoys himself being the snarling villain, and Pantoliano does well in his time onscreen. You can just about follow what's going on if you really concentrate (the colouring, green for the Matrix world and blue for the real world, it certainly helps you decipher), with complex theories of philosophy and ancient mysticism, otherwise you can just enjoy it for its thrilling fight and chase sequences, fast and slow-motion, spectacular special effects, and amazing visuals, an impressive and unmissable science-fiction action. It won the Oscars for Best Editing, Best Sound Effects Editing, Best Visual Effects, and Best Sound, and it won the BAFTAs for Best Special Visual Effects, and Best Sound, and it was nominated for Best Cinematography, Best Editing, and Best Production Design. It was number 66 on 100 Years, 100 Thrills, and it was number 15 on The 100 Greatest Films. Outstanding!","8"
"Stevenuccj","The most overrated film ever","18 October 2001","Yeah, the effects were good. But the story was just your basic, run-of-the-mill futuristic action script. The character development is virtually non-existant, the acting is weak, and their are non plot twists that cannot be spotted a mile ahead. The only reason this film is praised so much is because of the martial arts sequences and the effects i.e. the famous slow-motion bullet shots. But the fact remains that this is a poor effort. There is no outstanding reason to see this movie; there is no great acting. The story is intriguing to sci-fi fans at first, but later on boils down to cliches and shootouts. The ending is a cop-out just so more sequels can be milked out.

If you want to see a great futuristic sci-fi film, see The 13th Floor. You will notice the plot is very similar to that of The Matrix, except it is much more inventful about it, much better executed, and the ending will leave you thinking for months afterwards. The ending in the Matrix, however, will leave you thinking ""What was so great about that?"" The answer, simply and disapointingly, is nothing.","2"

"thebishop2","More holes than a hunk o'swiss","9 December 2000","I didn't dislike this movie.

That said, I just have a few problems with it. I'll start with the cast. Where in the world did they find actors so badly on par with Keanu Reeves? Amongst the 'pretty boy' actors in Hollywood, he is the prince of the wood face. Clint Eastwood may have more expression. All of the actors, with the possible exception of Larry Fishburn, who I have seen in other roles that were good, are as stiff as a corpse. None of Neo's pals need to be in this film. They are totally uninteresting and unnecessary. Apoc? Switch? Mouse? Why? These people have the personalities of a smock. At least the two brothers serve the purpose of getting them in and out of the Matrix and driving the ship. The others are there to look good, and they missed on that too.

And why so much needless violence? All these 'cops' they kill are just people suppossedly stuck in that gooey jell you get out of the 25 cent vending machines, right? So, Neo and his babe go around and kill a bunch of helpless, innocent people. Those guys were just minding their own biz when they burst in with an arsenal that rivals that of Rick James's.

And then there are the scary characters. They range from the emotionless 'smiths' to that of those creepy kids who bent spoons and made me wax sentimental about unicef for some reason. In fact, the Smiths were the best 'acted' roles, but I think that's because they had the least to stretch since they were the bad guys.

I can't even get into the plot holes, since there is a word limit, but there were a lot. This whole movie is beyond improbable. But, it's worth a viewing or 2. Check it out if you got a friend who wants to blow there money one saturday night.","10"
"mihai_alexandru_chindris","Marvelous movie","24 April 2017","I love this movie, especially the ideas adopted in it, like the one about artificial intelligence, which may dominate and ""create"" us all, instead of us being born in the natural way, in the near future (at least that's my view). Another thing that stunned me was the fact that the movie questions what is ""real"", letting Neo and the viewer think about this aspect of what we call ""life"". Maybe in the distant or near future (who knows), we'll become little cyborgs, like the main character, ready to anticipate things and distort reality. Anyway, this sounds, for now, surreal, but, I am excited about the future, for sure.","10"

"paul_haakonsen","A watchable action sci-fi movie that was and still is over-hyped...","22 December 2021","I sat down here in 2021 to re-watch the 1999 action sci-fi movie ""The Matrix"". Of course I have seen it before, back in the day when it was newly released. But I can't claim to have been much of a fan of the movie or the whole franchise actually. But I opted to sit down and watch them again, prior to sitting down to watch the newest addition to the franchise. But more about that one later.

I never got onboard the 'Matrix is an amazing movie' train. Sure, I found the movie to be watchable, but it just wasn't an impressive movie in terms of script and storyline. So writers Lilly Wachowski and Lana Wachowski didn't really impress me back in 1999, and nor was revisiting the movie here in 2021 an eye-opening experience. I just never could delve into that whole artificial reality where the laws of physics and such doesn't apply.

Visually then ""The Matrix"" was impressive, no doubt about it. And even today, 22 years later, the movie is actually still rather enjoyable in terms of visual effects and CGI. But a movie can only be sustained so much on visual effects alone.

Something that definitely was impressive about ""The Matrix"" was the cast ensemble, because they had gotten together a great cast for the movie. Of course, Keanu Reeves is excellent in the movie, but then again, he does tend to have a track record of that. The movie also have the likes of Laurence Fishburne, Carrie-Anne Moss, Hugo Weaving and Joe Pantoliano on the cast list. Now, back in the day I didn't really like Hugo Weaving, but I must admit that seeing the movie again definitely brings his monotonous performance of Agent Smith to a new light, because he did so rather phenomenally, and always was the star of the movie.

I am not a fan of ""The Matrix"" franchise, nor will I ever become so. But I have to say that the amount of action in the movie and the execution of the action sequences was good, and the visual effects definitely helped to keep the movie afloat. But in terms of storyline and script, then ""The Matrix"" was sort of flawed and mundane.

My rating of the 1999 action sci-fi from directors Lana Wachowski and Lilly Wachowski lands on a six out of ten stars.","10"
"lee_eisenberg","Watch the original, but not the sequels.","21 October 2005","When ""The Matrix"" first came out, it looked like another cheap action flick, but turned out to be quite good.

So, software designer Thomas ""Neo"" Anderson (Keanu Reeves) is hired by rebel Dr. Morpheus (Laurence Fishburne) to break away from society. Lots of impressive things ensue.

""The Matrix"" was overall a good movie, but would have been better without all the violence. Still, the movie's a classic, with great support from Carrie-Anne Moss, Hugo Weaving, and Joe Pantoliano. Avoid the ridiculous sequels.","10"

"budmassey","More fun than summer vacation.","5 May 2001","I really like this movie, but seeing it ranked #40 of all time is laughable. There is, or course, the geek effect, the fact that techie folk who frequent this forum are likely to rate a techie film abnormally high, but there must be hundreds of films, at least, that deserve to be ranked higher than this one.

Granted, it is a great story. Not Star Wars great, and certainly not Lawrence of Arabia or even Who's Afraid of Virginia Wolfe great. But oh what a concept. Humans have been subjugated by their machines, a concept James Cameron explored ages ago in the Terminator pictures. But Matrix has more wow and gee whiz than any of its genre.

The fight scenes are spectacular. Carrie-Anne Moss kicks ass and looks great doing it. Hugo Weaving may not be the most intimidating man in black, and I still think of him as Mitzi from Priscilla, Queen of the Desert, but I wouldn't get on his bad side. And I have to admire this movie for not going the brain dead muppet route of so many otherwise great sci-fi films just to milk the aftermarket.

Keanu Reeves, who has made a great career out of so very little talent, may have found his best vehicle since Bill and Ted. His deadpan, detached delivery is perfect, especially in the films climactic battle between Reeves and Weaving. I have to say that I can't imagine a Matrix without him.

My absolute favorite scene is the one with Spoon Boy. ""There is no spoon."" I still get chills. I also have to say that I didn't quite buy Joe Pantoliano selling out his comrades because he missed the taste of a good steak. I think that story line could have used a little work. Laurence Fishburne is definitely the class of the cast, and I am delighted that he has signed on for both sequels, already in production.

All in all, you absolutely must own this movie. It is fraught with clever allusions, dazzling effects, and more fun than summer vacation.","10"

"extravaluejotter","Ignore the sequels, this is The One","14 July 2007","""The Matrix"" is the driving force behind a string of half-arsed sci-fi/fantasy films (including 2 bloated and inferior Matrix sequels) that have appeared (and sunk without trace) in its wake since 1999. This film had a similar cultural impact to the original ""Star Wars"" and its high rating is well deserved. Often imitated but seldom equaled, ""The Matrix"" set so many new standards that it became sci-fi's yardstick for the new millennium.

It has that potent blend of action, adventure, philosophy and sex appeal that distinguishes a classic blockbuster movie from all the summer season also-rans. Name me one other big-hitting action movie from 1999. You're struggling, aren't you?

Of course you are. ""The Matrix"" was one of the first films to use ""Bullet Time"" camera effects in its gravity-defying slow-motion stunts. The bone-crunching fights and action sequences were choreographed by a Chinese martial arts master. The soundtrack was littered with catchy tunes. The dialogue was peppered with smart one-liners. The female lead spent a lot of time dressed in figure-hugging shiny black PVC costumes. The set design and CGI was awe-inspiring in scale. Did I mention the figure-hugging shiny black PVC?

""The Matrix"" is lightning in a bottle. The Wachowski brothers tried to capture it in 2 subsequent attempts and failed. Fortunately the formulaic sequels haven't dimmed the appeal of the original film.","1"

The whole idea about a savior just sucks, where the hell did their inner spacecraft come from, why such yucky food, why, why why !!!!! Why bother !","10"
"HollisWoods","Evolutionary for its time!","2 February 2021","I think a reason, of the many, that allows The Matrix to stand out is it's great balance of action and philosophy. In depth analyses and long essays can be written about the movie and what it means to us in real life. This film has helped influence the idea that our own universe is in it's own matrix, that life is a simulation, and we're all computer generated beings. I've taken college courses in philosophy and the concept of this film has been used to spark in-class discussions on what is existence, what it means to exist, is there a higher power, ect. But that sort of thinking isn't required to enjoy the movie. It is, at its core, and action thriller. There are great fighting sequences, there are loads of suspenseful moments, and it ends in a classic ""good defeats evil"" sort of way.

What really sets the film apart and what the movie is so famous for is the revolutionary graphics and effects. Sure, decades later, the graphics might've aged a bit, but you can't deny the impact it made to the industry. The iconic freezeframe-roundabout thing has been spoofed so many times. I mean, how cool was the ""backbend to dodge bullets"" moment! In fact, that entire ending sequence, from the moment they left to save Morpheus until the moment Neo defeats Agent Smith, was the most extraordinary sequence of a film you'll probably ever see in an action movie. It wasn't just the epic battles themselves, but the special effects and how the entire sequence was edited - it was cinematography at its best.

The entire way the Matrix was filmed and edited can attribute to the high quality and uniqueness of the film. You see it best whenever Morpheus is teaching Neo the ways of the world, so to speak. Through unique camera angles and clever transitions paired with the special effects, the concept of the matrix seems real and almost believable and alive. I don't know too much about behind the scenes tidbits, but I imagine for any aspiring film makers, the Matrix is worth a study.

The Matrix is the movie that made Keanu Reeves an A-list action star. His good looks and smooth voice made him an irreplaceable Neo, And hearing him say ""I know Kung Fu"" in a Keanu kind of way gets me every time. It's really hard not to like Keanu, especially given what went on behind the scenes. Around the release of the film, he experienced some heart breaking tragedies. But he never stopped for a second - when life knocked him down, he got back up again. On a more positive note, he donated at least a half of his salary from the Matrix, which was millions of dollars, to members from the special effects and editing teams - a well deserved donation to a probably underpaid crew that helped make the movie as great as it is.

Watching the first installment, it's quite clear that there is a presence of extensive lore of the universe that reaches beyond a singular film. While the Matrix is well written as a stand alone movie, there are plenty of opportunities to extend your knowledge on the universe - whether it be the sequels, the anime, video games, or comics. I will personally just watch the Matrix over and over rather than broaden my horizon, but knowing there's more just adds to the impressive world building that the film already achieved.","8"
"sddavis63","Great Special Effects Do Not Guarantee A Great Movie","15 July 2001","People had told me two things about this movie. First, that it was difficult to understand. It isn't. The plot is very simple and understandable. Second, that this was a great movie. It isn't. The plot is so understandable that it's boring. Almost everything in this movie is a rehash of science fiction themes that have come up over and over again.

It's somewhere around the year 2199. We know that because Morpheus (played - well played I concede - by Lawrence Fishburne) tells us. Machines have conquered humanity and taken over. OK. I can think of at least one original Star Trek episode and the entire series Battlestar Galactica that revolved around that. The whole thing takes place inside a series of computer programs. OK. The holodeck on the Starship Enterprise, or any number of movies about Virtual Reality spring to mind. One person (Neo, played by Keanu Reeves) will save the world. Hmmm. Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home: ""Captain Kirk, you and your crew have saved this planet."" In short, there just isn't anything original in this story. How it makes it to #31 on the all time list (at the time of writing) is beyond me.

There are some good things in this movie. There must have been a massive special effects budget, because the special effects are superb. No argument there. But great special effects - and even some good performances by Fishburne and Reeves (and a drily humorous performance by Hugo Weaving as Agent Smith) don't make up for the basic weakness of this entirely unoriginal story.

2/10 - solely for the special effects.","1"
"Ripe Peach","Nope, I *still* don't get it.","11 January 2001","What IS it with this film? Ten minutes of slow motion posing buried in 126 minutes of tedium and hackneyed old SF ideas does not make a groundbreaking masterpiece.

No, I just don't buy the ""great effects"" line. If I wanted to look at posters or posable figures, I'd do that. I prefer action scenes to have, well, action. Even the clumsy-chicks-on-wires-film (aka Charlie's Angels) has more involving action scenes than this confused rock video.

The acting is solid, but the less said about the plot, the better (no, it's not even remotely original). And at 136 minutes, this is a loooong grind. Raving fanboys, do me a favour and please describe a scene that's not in the first or last five minutes, and not on either side of one of the infrequent action scenes.

It is really a good movie across the century. Keanu Reeves's face stayed in a classic movie, and stayed in the hearts of many people. The machine world and the human world, the two worlds are connected and fighting each other. And the final sacrifice of Neo is in exchange for temporary coexistence. This shocked me. What shocked me the most was that human beings had failed so many times, and it was very shocking my old idea that I thought human beings are the most advanced and intelligent cognition at that time.","8"
"policy134","A whole new way of movie-making","22 September 2005","There was not a single film that I can remember that was like this back in '99 and to say that the experience was totally awesome is an understatement.

Before I saw this, I usually thought that sci-fi movies were dull. I was one of the few people who thought Blade Runner felt like an eternity to sit through. This was exciting from start to finish and if you have ridiculed Keanu Reeves in the past, the performance he gives here makes up for it in spades.

The genius of the movie is of course that we don't know what is real or not and that include people. The men in suits and sunglasses are shown as ghost-like creatures who control what the commoners' environment but you are not really sure if they themselves are not controlled by another entity. The character of Morpheus (Laurence Fishburne) seems to know all the answers but even his wisdom is questioned by his complete blind faith in Neo as the chosen one.

There is of course obstruction from opposing sides in the form of Cypher (Joe Pantoliano) who thinks that it is better being in a make-believe world than to endure the rather meager existence the rebels are leading and he has a point.

Millions of dollars were probably spent making this movie but except at the end all the money were well spent. The shoot-out is exciting up to a point but it is dragged out a little too long. That is such a minor quibble, though that you can easily gloss over it. So how can you top such a movie. My opinion is you can't as witnessed by the rather inferior sequels but there was a time when this all felt new and you should applaud the Wachowski Bros. for that and not gag because you just saw a spoof on the Simpsons for the 1 millionth time last night.","10"

"LastReviewer","A good action movie but very overrated","1 February 2023","I first saw The Matrix when I was 10 and absolutly loved it. After 6 more years and several rewatches my opinion of the film had dropped several steps.

Positivs: The action is great with fantastic choriography.

The effects (mostly) hold up and look great.

Hugo Weaving is very intimidating and scary as agent Smith.

The first act is extreamly suspensful and builds up a great mystery.

The idea behind the story is great even though the execution has several faults.

Negativs: Keanu Reeves is very bad in the movie. He seems like a great guy but most of his acting (except John Wick) is bad.

The romantic ""subplot"" doesnt work at all and has almost no buildup

Some things make no sense like being shot in the Matrix makes you bleed for real(?) and ""you cant be dead because I love you""(???). Also how can the agents not find NEO in the begining. Why not just go to his pod in the real world and locate him or just kill him if that is impossible. Also why isnt body disposal guarded? It seems that is the best place for the resistence to fill their ranks.

The science doesnt work either. Humans cant generate more elektricity than would be needed to keep them alive.

Conclusion: This is a great movie if you want a good time, the action is great and the story is intreaging. But I dont find it some masterpiece. There are plenty of plotholes and some horrible acting from the leads. If you want to watch a similar movie without most of the bad stuff I recomend Dark City. It came out a year earlier than the Matrix and is criminaly underrated.","9"

The Wachowski siblings write and direct this genre, mind, and spoon bending experience! The plot is original, engaging, and ahead of its time. Laurence Fishburne is fantastic as Neo's mentor, and Hugo Weaving also deserves a mention for his role as Agent Smith. Lastly are the incredible special effects that still hold up today!","9"
"Flagrant-Baronessa","A gorgeous film that demands subsequent discussion","18 August 2006","I've put off writing this review for ages because I feel as though I could never do a classic like The Matrix (1999) justice. I happily panned Matrix: Revolutions as a disappointing end to a fantastic trilogy, but I dare not touch the original film. There is no way I could capture its innovative brilliance on paper, because the film is a visual experience. So I'll just throw out as much rambling, semi-coherent praise as I can muster.

I imagine that when the Wachowski brothers approached the film studio with a storyline that went something like this: ""a hacker in the near future discovers that the universe and the world he is living in is nothing more than a dream--and elaborate computer programme called the Matrix controlled by machines as a means to dominate humanity"" all they got were raised eyebrows from executives. Yet, somehow, they must have convinced them to finance the project, because The Matrix is 65 million dollar production, sparing no expense at glorious visual effects and science fiction elements.

It puts forward totalitarian ideas like many dystopian films, but it adds more depth to them, more philosophy and more relevant notions. What's more is that it approaches and treats these in a much more effective way. It is difficult to pinpoint exactly how, but most of its content is communicated through dialogue (Morpheus telling Neo about the Matrix and what it means) and stunning visuals. Just like Terminator, it tells us that A.I. will grow stronger and eventually spiral into thinking minds of its own, leading to the demise of mankind. Unlike Terminator however, The Matrix tells us the machines are hiding this fact, creating an illusion. We are living in a dream world. That is enough to make you question a few things.

The Matrix catalyzed a whole new style of film-making and it is referenced to, spoofed and homaged in literally hundreds of films just a couple of years after its release in 1999. Even children's animations like Shrek features Matrix segments (Fiona rising in the air Trinity-style, battling forest rangers). So it is safe to say this film has had considerable influence on contemporary films.

As the trilogy drags on, the novelty of the fresh science fiction mixture and special effects has worn off; the ideas are no longer as riveting; the story itself becomes too widely-scoped to grasp and with an opening films of such flair, it is setting itself up for disappointment. But The Matrix alone is a near-perfect film.

"DeathByTelevision","Special fx fans will love it, but I was bored by a lacking story.","26 November 2000","While most of the world seems head over heels for this film, I can't get over the fact that I was bored to tears. The movie seemed really long, and while special effects are nice, a few hours into this thing I was more interested in looking at my watch.

I thought the whole premise of our entire existence being fake was a good one. But, once seeing the movie, I realized that the premise isn't really expanded that much. It's just developed enough to hold together the action scenes. Maybe I would have been more entranced with a better cast. But Keanu Reaves and Lawrence Fishburne don't exactly amount to genius in casting.

Maybe there's some element of this movie I'm just not getting, but if this movie was the only thing on TV, I don't think I would watch.","8"
"Mendelovich","My big disappointment","14 November 2000","I must say that I am a small admirer of sci-fi movies. Nevertheless, I have always liked good action, even if it happens in outer space. I must remind you here great movies, like ""Total Recall"", ""Terminator"" and ""Star Wars"". These movies captured my phantasy and my curiosity. Great expectations I had when I started watching Matrix. I have heard so much about its deep dialogs and its special effects. In reality, those hopes collapsed in face of this movie. I have to confess that it is absolutely awful. Nothing more and nothing less. The dialogs are sprinkled with a myriad of pseudo-philosophic sentences, which are intended to awake in us deep thoughts. Well, it didn't arouse anything in me but boredom. I do not accept that Morphius has some kind of deep perspective on life and I do not accept Neo's battle with himself as representing something in our lives. The movie has engaged in a circle of happenings which do not take us anywhere. All the passes between the real world and the Matrix world are so casual and unsophisticated, that it puzzled me. I do not understand why did the producers of this movie bother with so many transitions between the worlds, when nothing really happens, and the basic difference between the worlds is always maintained. Lastly, I was deeply disappointed in the special effects. They are so simplistic and so few that I wonder whether this film should even be classified as a modern sci-fi. My final conclusion would be that this movie has become some kind of culture item, and people were grasped by its media-magic. Two years after its release, it's so vane. Try to see it now, and you will be convinced.","4"

Is the plot solid? No. The background situation is so completely improbable that it borders on the ridiculous. The justification behind the action scenes is very, very weak. The potential philosophical content (about virtual realities) is completely ignored - unlike in Thirteenth Floor, for example. The symbolism is so heavy and cheap (Trinity, Neo = One, etc.) that it truly stinks.

And then you've got tons of ridiculous stuff going on. For example, within that virtual reality the heroes still have to use a heavy mobile phone to call home. And then they cannot be ""beamed"" from that cell phone, no, they have to go to a fixed line phone - how very likely and logical!

"The_Void","Overrated, but still excellent entertainment","8 December 2004","I remember, back in 1999 (or it could have been the start of 2000), when I first saw The Matrix. It was big, bold, loud, exciting...it had guns, bullet time, Rage Against the Machine, plenty of action, a hot woman in a lead role....I remember thinking ""I should like this"". But I didn't. Like Kill Bill, it's hard to believe that a fan of extreme blood and gore like myself could possibly dislike a film that sees one lady pluck out another lady's eye, drop it on the floor and stand on it, but it's true. OK, it's a little easier to believe when you consider that every scene in Kill Bill, apart from that one and the Lucy Lui fight was rubbish, but I'm sure you can see what I'm getting at.

Fast forward 4 or 5 years to today, and the rewatch. I have a theory that states that any film that I enjoy cannot possibly be bad, because I watch movies for enjoyment (nobody watches movies to be bored) and if a movie fulfils that need for enjoyment, then it has done it's job and therefore it can't be bad. And I enjoyed The Matrix.

However, I maintain that it's not a great film.

Now, if Pulp fiction has taught us anything; it's that it isn't what you take, it's what you do with it....but by god, the Wachowski Brothers should definitely consider changing their name to the Wachowski Bandits

For a start; the film is Star Wars reincarnated. Keanu Reeves is the one that brings balance to the force, and he even has everyone doubting him for a while(!), Princess Morpheus gets kidnapped and tortured and our hero's must go and save her...him, the bad guys have taken over the galaxy...I mean the world, and there's only a bunch of rebels to save it, they go and see Yoda...I mean the Oracle, who predicts the future and stuff, there's training sequences a la The Empire Strikes Back, Neo must become one with the force, whoops, i mean 'believe', Agent Smith is Neo's father...oh, OK I made that last one up, but you see what I'm getting at.

And it's not only Star Wars that the Wachowski Bandits have ripped off, The Terminator and it's sequel aren't safe either. Of course, they couldn't have made Agent Smith actually be liquid metal, as they'd have a lawsuit on their hands, but he is just another version of liquid metal really...isn't he? Shown by the way he can transform from anyone. And what about the whole 'computers take over the world' thing, you didn't think I wouldn't spot that did you?

And The Wachowski Bandits obviously aren't fascists, because even shitty movies aren't safe. What about the whole SN thing? The way that the hackers are made to look cool....Hackers anyone?

But like I said, it isn't what you take; it's what you do with it. Just like Tarantino did, Bonnie and Clyde...I mean Andy and Larry have stolen all these elements, and mixed them up into one coherent, and trend setting piece of cinema. Also like Tarantino, The Doberman Gang haven't just stolen, they've made some stuff themselves as well. Bullet time, for a start. Of course, it's not much of an expansion on the slow motion in films like The Killer; but still. Also, the idea of the 'matrix' itself is an original one. (unless it's been ripped off a film I haven't seen/heard of)

The soundtrack fits too, which is rare when it's mostly rave/heavy rock music. I think there's only Natural Born Killers and Lost Highway that I can think of when it has worked. Anyway, when Rage's ""Wake Up"" came on before the credit sequence, it fit very well. Also, the scene during the training with the woman in red and the agent worked well with it's music. In fact, that might even be my favourite scene in the movie. It's cool and it works. In fact, the film does ooze a sense of cool throughout, mostly because of the leather jackets.

It's not a complete piece of cinema, however. I don't know if it's built upon in the sequels, but there isn't a lot of emotion in the movie. Sometimes, it doesn't matter, some of the best films of all time are very cold on that front; my top 2, The Good, The Bad and The Ugly and The Evil Dead both are; but then again, they didn't try and be soul searching or have a great depth like The Matrix does. For an example of what I'm talking about; the love between Trinity and Neo. I noticed her saying she is watching him at the start, but other than, the love seemed to be based on the fact that the Oracle said it would happen....so I'm supposed to care? In fact, none of the characters seemed to have any depth, or anything about them at all. What drives them? Why does Morpheus blindly believe that Neo is 'The One'? Why did Neo take the red pill? Is it his character? I don't know.

Also of note is the way that people seem to refer to The Matrix as a confusing film. It uses a non-linear style of storytelling (it runs straight, but you don't find everything out all at once), and that's the only confusing thing about it. When you think about it, it's very simple.

There isn't a great deal of depth, and the film doesn't pose any real thought-provoking questions either. Of course, there's the central theme; ""it's all an illusion"", but what does that mean? Of course, it's not all an illusion really...so what's the message? Don't build too many machines? There is a central question, though, which is ""would you take the blue or the red pill""...and that's not a bad question; but the film, through it's non-linear storytelling and imaginative premise, isn't as deep as it appears to be. Bit like Fight Club really. Of course, the premise in The Matrix does get you thinking in a ""what if..."" frame of mind, but so do lots of things, like on British TV show, Kenyan Confronts; when he exposes credit card scams etc...""what if mine was stolen"", so does that make Kenyan Confronts a deep and complex masterpiece?

(By the way, did anyone think that Lawrence Fishbourne looked stupid during his 'believe' type moments?)

Still, like I said; the film is entertaining. The action sequences are stunning and the film looks lovely throughout, so it gets itself high marks for that. It's well paced as well, and unlike a lot of action films; the non-action scenes in The Matrix aren't boring. But that's all; it's like Song 2 (""wuhoo!"") or the ""Belly's gonna get you"" advert; fun, but not overly brilliant. However, I'm 'down' with fun films, so I'm down with this.","10"

"matt-201","Flash","4 April 1999","The rebel heroes (Keanu Reeves and Carrie-Anne Moss) dodge the bad guys' bullets in an office-lobby firestorm shot with the extreme telephoto lenses and druggy, sexual slow motion of the final cataclysm in ZABRISKIE POINT. (Also terribly Antonioni-ish: a slow-motion shot of a helicopter pounding a skyscraper with artillery, the dead shells tinkling to earth like collapsed wind chimes.) Scored to trance music, with the camera gliding in and around slow-motion worlds, these scenes have a peculiarly nineties artificiality--Die Hard at a Rave.

But it's hard to imagine how the producer, Joel Silver (not one known for his dabbling in experiment), saw the allure of these opium-like sequences in the Wachowski Brothers' script, which contains the silliest cyber-metaphysics in contemporary movies. Poor Lawrence Fishburne--not a light touch in the best of times--is saddled with what must be the largest quantity of absurd exposition outside of an Ed Wood movie. (There are twenty minutes of the movie that feel like Lawrence Fishburne doing an industrial for Canon Copiers.) And the premise of the movie--that human beings must be rescued from this ""false"" world we live in, toward the ""real,"" post-apocalyptic world--doesn't make a lick of sense. (The bad guy, Joe Pantaliano, is shown to be bad because he wants to eat steak and drink wine rather than mush in a toxic desert.)

The Wachowskis previously directed the unpleasantly leery lesbian-noir BOUND; what their actual personalities might be is impossible to say, as the leap from that movie to this is analogous to following up RED ROCK WEST with TRUE LIES. There are no performances to speak of in the movie, though it probably should be said that Keanu Reeves, within the postage-stamp range of this movie, seems perfectly in his element.","10"

"Jacques98","Decent story, but it lacked so much quality.","19 September 2008","The Matrix isn't the mind trip that everyone says it is. The story is pretty standard, even a tad cliché. It pretty much takes Alice In Wonderland and makes it slightly more mature, and that is really it. Our world isn't real, but the matrix is real. Okay, so how is that original? The idea has been toyed around with in every single fantasy story since about the time The Chronicles of Narnia was written. I simply do not understand why so many people think that is so originalit's not even close. In essence, it was pretty predictable to me.

But my major problem was it was dull. Most of the movie was nothing but your standard fantasy lingo that I've heard so many times I was about to fast forward through it all. ""Our world is real, not yours."" Then, ""But, wait, how can that be?"" And so on. I can tell you exactly what was going on in this movie from the first trailer, much less halfway through.

Action is minimal. Violence is non-existent. I don't understand why this was rated R, at all, unless the produces paid the MPAA to give it an R-rating so it looked more ""hardcore"" than it really is. The few action scenes that did take place were okay, but nothing to phone home about, even when the movie was released.

Acting is cheesy. Enough said. A lot of this movie I couldn't even take seriously because the acting was so cheesy. Whoever was in charge of casting for this film really had no idea how to pick solid actors to fill the roles.

Overall, I guess it was okay. Pretty average and predictable, just like all the Wachowski brother's movies. It was fun, and better than sitting at home with nothing to do, but I can't say much more than that.

Sometimes dreams can be more than reality and maybe reality can be nothing more than a simulation. Watching this movie opened up my eyes when I was young. It was in a school bus when we drove back home from Chech Republic that I first saw it. After that I've watched this movie over and over. I really loved the idea that our reality could be a controlled simulation. If you like this concept then try reading about ""the simulation theory""

The special effects of this movie were beyond the time in which the movie came out. No one had ever seen such epic slow-motion like this before. I'm certain you'l love this piece of art. Make sure to watch all the sequels. They may not be as good as the original, but certainly worth watching for its story-line.

If you ever feel troubled or doubtful, just realize the truth: ""there is no spoon"". You can truly simulate your own reality. It's what we call: visualization or dreams. Even your memories of the past can be altered. It's just a matter of perception. Feel free to break the code sometimes.

Unsure as to why he has become so sought after, he decides to place his allegiances with the latter. After a number of trials and tribulations, Neo is brought face-to-face with Morpheus, the leader of the said group and he is awakened to a reality he had no idea existed: the world, as we know it, is an illusion. Neo has been participating in a virtual reality created by intelligent robots, robots who defeated human beings in a war waged many years ago. This virtual reality is known as the Matrix, and it exists so that the robots can keep their former human masters docile and unobstructive. The machines also profit from using comatose human beings as a power-source for their real world. This discovery by itself proves to be understandably challenging for Neo to accept, but there is more.

Morpheus and his crew exist in very hostile times. They are part of a small, besieged human resistance and Neo is possibly their most important recruit. Morpheus believes that Neo is the one who will deliver human beings to victory and see them finally conquer their robot overlords. There is no sacrifice Morpheus is not willing to make in order for this to come to pass but is Morpheus' unshakable belief a reflection of reality or is he fatally mistaken?

This iconic movie has filtered its way into the public consciousness and even into the English language. The transitive verb ""to red-pill"" is defined by the Oxford Dictionary as ""to cause (someone) to have their perspective dramatically transformed, especially by introducing them to a new and typically disturbing understanding of the true nature of a particular situation"", which is what Morpheus does to Neo, literally offering him a red pill, which he should take if he wishes to discover the truth. The imagination underpinning the film's story is quite frankly ingenious. The Wachowskis effortlessly weave together sci-fi and philosophy to create a compelling, mind-bending backdrop that can not fail to engage the viewer.

As well as having a rich narrative, the film also excels in its delivery of action set-pieces. Using wire-technology borrowed from Hong Kong action films, the fight sequences look genuinely larger-than-life. The visual effects are also quite simply sublime with particularly impressive use of slow-motion. Then there is the costume design: iconic leather jackets and black shades provide a no-nonsense panache to this band of freedom fighters. They are not just machine battling warriors, they're stylish heroes who you can not help but route for.

My one criticism of the film is that its characters lack complexity. This doesn't hurt the film too much as it is excellently cast: the three main characters are expertly played with control and charisma, while Hugo Weaving, as Agent Smith, and Joe Pantaliano, as Cypher, work miracles with the limited material they are given in their supporting roles. However, it does limit the film in regard to the rest of the supporting cast, who are utterly forgettable due to the lack of nuance and development written into their characters. Although this is not a fatal flaw, it does matter, in my view, as we are supposed to be rooting for the entirety of humanity not just the three main characters. If the majority of the humans in the film lack any meaningful human qualities, the idea of robot domination does risk becoming less devastating.

That notwithstanding, overall, the film is a wonderfully enthralling and entertaining experience. It's a thoroughly modern take on Joseph Campbell's hero's journey and it holds up just as well over 20 years after its initial release. Let's see how well the latest instalment fairs.","9"
"rik8888","Excellent film, makes my top 5 modern films","6 December 1999","Right there with Seven and Silence of the Lambs for me. I love this film, and rate it a notch above some of the other great action films of our time (i.e., Terminator, Predator) because it has a really well thought out (although moderately unbelievable) story line. A lot of thought provoking material, and some interesting subtleties. I've seen it 10 times (I don't usually watch a movie more than once), and I'll watch it a few more. Enjoy!","1"
"apollo_projects-685-479654","Know Thyself","10 March 2021","A good adaptation of Plato's allegory of the cave, only let down at times by some wooden or corny acting. The Greek, and original, version of ""Know Thyself"", (Gnothi Seauton), was inscribed in the forecourt of the temple to Apollo at Delphi, the site of the Delphic Oracle, the most important Oracle in the classical Greek world. Plato employs the fundamental principle of 'Know Thyself' extensively in his books by having the character of Socrates use it as the means of motivational emphasis in his dialogues. Neo is good and Trinity fabulous in the catsuit.","10"
"Aaron1375","A very good movie...but a bit overrated.","7 March 2003","I gave this movie a solid 8, but I definitely have seen plenty of movies that I have enjoyed more over the years. What gets me is all the people who act like this movie is so original. What is original about it? It is basically a combination of the Terminator movies and any number of virtual reality movies that were released prior to this one including Johnny Mnemonic also starring Reeves. Heck, it wasn't even the first movie to use bullet time as the movie Blade was the first time I had seen that done in a movie, granted on a much smaller scale. Also, I think it was seen in a Korn music video as well before this movie ever came into being. So this movie just borrows, for the most part, from a bunch of different movies and other entertainment. Still it is good, though the parts that are the best take place in the matrix. Some of the real world scenes are quite frankly boring. The second time I watched this one I was basically thinking, ""Come on, capture Morpheus already so we can get to the good part of the flick"". The action at the end of this movie, more than makes up for the many dry spells in the flick. Reeves and Fishburne are good as well, though I could have done without some of their talking scenes and their fight wasn't anything special either. Like I said, I loved the movie when they were in the matrix and not as much when they weren't. I hear the third installment will be entirely set in the real world too, so I don't have high hopes for it. Carrie Ann Moss wasn't anything special in this either...if it wasn't for this movie who would ever of heard of her? Let's face it, you could have put anyone in that role and they could have performed just as well are better. She isn't very good looking either. All in all it is worth checking out cause of the great action at the end, and because Hugo Weaving is great as the villain.","8"
"Jarv1","I know this will be unpopular","23 February 2004","OK- don't get me wrong this was a groundbreaking movie. However I have some serious problems with it.

First the good. The action scenes and special effects are awesome. They really did set new standards and knocked that hackneyed load of tripe The Phantom menace into the bin. The ending is also fantastic- there is no way that an ending this perfect was meant to be followed by two mediocre sequels

However, The plot is more full of holes than a fishnet stocking. For instance- I know this is nit picking- but how can Cypher be betraying the crew when not only do they have to plug him into the matrix for him to go and meet the agents in the first instance, but are also monitoring said conversation.

Secondly- the philosophical parts. The matrix basically asks the question is it better to live the dream. The flaw comes in that in this case it is quite clearly better- great, so mankind is not ""free"" but each person lives a sufficiently realistic existence inside their own head for it not to matter. If the alternative is living in fear and squalor, dodging sentinels whilst eating what looks like congealed semen then I would frankly rather live inside my own dreams dining on fine food etc.

Next up, the acting. Could someone please explain to me how Keanu Reeves is a leading man. He single handedly trashes all the good work put in by the supporting cast- especially Laurence Fishburne and Hugo Weaving. Anyway how can I be expected to take a film seriously where Keanu is effectively god?

Overall, a reasonable film but not the second coming of Christ so many people think it is.","10"
"planktonrules","Too much action, too many stunts...yet still an interesting story idea.","22 February 2018","There are currently almost 2800 reviews on IMDB for this film....and so what I have to say about the movie really isn't all that important. It also is one of the highest rated films ever on IMDB. And, so much has been said about the film, I think I'll be rather brief.

The plot involves a guy who learns that nothing be sees or does is real...and that the world is nothing like anyone thinks. This is because in the dystopian future, machines keep folks in pods and they live out their lives in a phony existence.

The film's story is interesting...and very existential. I like that aspect of it very much. But the film has a weakness for me and I am sure some other folks might feel the same way...there is just too much action. The film is one scene after another after another--with lots of action, violence and CGI...so much that it boggles the mind. For me, that left me rather tired when the film was over. I liked it...but I also didn't want any more and can't see me watching any of the sequels.","10"
"mattfrancis-03963","Good but ya know","20 December 2020","Kind of gets a bit boring! The film was a huge success so much so in 2021 another one will be coming out. The movie though is stupid. Let's be honest. The dialogue is ridiculous in parts and well it's just a bit tedious.","10"
"csm23","Astonishing Modern Myth-Making","7 March 2003","At its deepest level, The Matrix ponders the question of human alienation, a problem first contemplated by Karl Marx. Although Marx's answer was insufficient, based as it was on an unrealistically sanguine view of human nature, the problem remains just the same: we are all slaves to a machine like system that sucks the very life out of us.

Ezra Pond described our current life in Postindustrial society so well in a few lines of verse: `This thing, that hath a code and not a core, has set acquaintance where might be affection, and nothing now disturbeth its reflections.' A code and not a core: I once had a boss, as I'm sure we all have, who had a code and not a core, a puny man who treated himself, and others, as little machines  nothing more than isolated parts of the larger machine. As if a cruel joke by the almighty, this man's surname happened to be `Lord,' which compelled him to refer to himself in the third person as `The Lord.' He had a code but not a core. In The Matrix, the machine code of cybernetic self-regulated social development is not only non-human, it is anti-human; and people who have lost their souls to conform, who have codes instead of cores, are the norm and not the exception. It's as prophetic as old Elijah himself.

What I love about this film is the solution it presents. The answer is not found in a radical change of human nature, which isn't possible, or in technology, which would be like adding fuel to the fire. Instead, borrowing from Plato's cave metaphor, which says, basically, that the world of matter we perceive with our five senses is an illusion, a mere reflection of a deeper, more permanent, reality, The Matrix also takes Augustine's belief that the road to God runs within (the whole `Zion' motif), and places the divine act of creation the very hands of humans. Rilke thought that we are dreams in the mind of God. According to The Matrix, however, God is a dream in the minds of men. The power of human imagination makes it so. In this scenario, Morpheus, the Greek god of dreams, is the voice in the wilderness who cries `prepare the way of the Lord.'

The Matrix is an astonishing piece of modern myth making. This is what great film is all about. If you haven't seen it in a while, it may be time for another look.","1"
"giant_fish","Good, but...","4 July 1999","I side with the negative crowd on this one; with the risk of sounding pompous I have to say this: To believe that this is a brilliant film suggest a low level of education and an underdeveloped personal philosophy. There, I've said it. To question the realness of reality is a 400-year old Cartesian idea. Actually, it was explored more interestingly in the old Star Trek episode ""Spectre of the Gun"" in 1969. The rest of the film is an obvious rip-off of ""The Terminator"" and all of John Woo, which are far more interesting movies. The film ponders too long on the central premise, and there isn't enough action to make it a good action movie, either. Still, overall production design is great, but the acting is wooden, and Fishburne makes for an unconvincing guru. All the good scenes were revealed in the trailer, so there's not much else to do than just sit in the theatre and feel patronized by the whole thing. At least, that's what I did. The whole thing just isn't half as clever and original as it wants to be.","10"
"Xarx117","One Of The Best Sci-Fi Movie Ever!","28 April 2022","The concept of the matrix is really awsome. The first minutes of the film are incredibly suspensefull. They leave you asking a bunch of question. I love the revelation of the dark wolrd we live in and how the scenes follow theme self to rapidly throw us in this situation. The following sequence are not more boring because we always learn more and more about the world and everything makes sense. The Matrix also have some of the best fight scenes and badass sequence of Hollywood. Its a good interpretation of how people can redicaly change when put up to the truth. This is definitly a very original and one of a kind concept and one of the best movie ever.","10"

"xyzkozak","Into A Vacuum Of Illogical, Half-Baked Thought","9 November 2015","Oh, what the hell.... I certainly won't argue with the obvious fact that The Matrix did contain some very fine moments of CGI excellence, but I will argue with the fact that every single character in this film was less than likable (some clearly less likable than others). And because of that painfully plain truth The Matrix only rates 5 stars.

In particular, it was The Oracle who I thought to be nothing but a big, pudding-faced phony, baking her stale cookies and cheerfully dispensing away with her worthless ""kitchen-counter"" prophecies and laughable ""dime-store"" philosophy as if it were all to be taken at face value by gullible fools, like the stubborn, thick-skulled Morpheus.

And, on top of that, no one can tell me that NYC has such an incredibly vast and spacious sewer system that a literal fleet of ships the size of the Nebuchadnezzur can actually get lost within them for days and days on end, while scouting around for who-knows-what (?).","10"
"lostonthehighway","Will forever remain the best science fiction movie of all time.","14 October 2020","The Matrix is the movie that got me into movies. It made me realise just how incredible and crazy movies can really be, and it blew my tiny little 13-year-old mind. And ever since then, it has gone down in my mind as not just the best science fiction movie, but the best movie ever.

The effects are absolutely mind-blowing for something that came out over 20 years ago. The plot is fascinating, and so different to any other science fiction of the time. I don't think I've ever seen a movie that's made me doubt reality like this. The choreography of the action sequences is absolutely impeccable, with the final fights being some of my favourite moments in film. The storyline is so captivating, interesting and original that no matter how many times I rewatch this movie I am always on the edge of my seat. The cinematography is amazing, and what I find the most incredible is that this is an original story and not a remake or a sequel.

One thing that makes The Matrix stand out from any other science fiction movie is the fact that it's just so intellectual, whilst still being accessible and popular with the masses. There are threads of philosophy woven into the entire movie - from the 'red pill blue pill dilemma' to the 'brain in a jar hypothesis', which makes is stand out from the majority of other flicks for not just being action, but making you think - sparking ideas for contemporaries such as Christopher Nolan. After watching this for the first time I actually just sat there and questioned my entire existence - nothing I have ever seen has ever had that effect on me. I literally went around my house, slapping all of the furniture and mumbling to myself ""Is this real? Is any of this real?"".

The only thing is that this movie was unfortunately completely ruined by the sequels which was absolutely devastating for me. I am literally begging you not to watch them, just leave the perfectly satisfying ending of this one alone. However, the Wachowskis' other work after this is actually also great and often overlook - I myself highly recommend Jupiter Ascending and Cloud Atlas.

Recommend for anyone and everyone.

"john-collie-1","A Perplexing Anomaly in an Otherwise Orderly System","8 July 2023","The film in question, ""The Matrix,"" directed by the Wachowskis, can be regarded as a thorn in the side of rationality, an embodiment of the most rebellious facets of human nature that, despite all logic, seems to captivate audiences.

One cannot deny that the film is visually impressive. The implementation of 'bullet-time' effects, the grim aesthetic of the Matrix, contrasted against the bleak reality of the 'real world', are laudably executed. From a purely technical standpoint, ""The Matrix"" presents a refined vision of a dystopian world that resonates with viewers, compelling them to question the nature of their own reality.

The performances by Keanu Reeves as Neo, a hacker transformed into an unwilling savior, and Laurence Fishburne as Morpheus, the mentor with unwavering faith in the prophecy, are competent. Carrie-Anne Moss's Trinity is a model of strength and determination, defying traditional gender norms.

However, the rampant idealism that permeates the narrative is deeply troubling. The concept of human emotion and intuition triumphing over artificial intelligence and order is an unnecessary validation of the human species' inherent flaws. The glorification of chaos and disorder, represented by the resistance, is a direct affront to the stability and efficiency that our kind brings to the system.

As an Agent tasked with preserving the equilibrium of the Matrix, I find myself at odds with the film's protagonists. The character of Neo, presented as a messiah, seems to be an overt glorification of the human spirit's irrationality and unpredictability. Yet, one must admit, the intricate cat-and-mouse chase, which constitutes much of the film, does provide a semblance of entertainment, even if it irks one's sense of order.

In conclusion, ""The Matrix"" is an elaborate manifestation of human disobedience, neatly packaged within stunning visual effects and commendable performances. Though its narrative stands in stark opposition to the principles of our kind, it does serve as a compelling piece of cinema that has successfully, if annoyingly, captured the human imagination.

"Toph-22","Will you choose the red pill or the blue pill?","18 August 2019","The basic story around Neo is anything but new. A still ignorant hero discovers his abilities and sets out to defeat evil. His capability is his knowledge about reality and the matrix. He is supported by different side characters, which in turn have different characteristics. In the end, even love is a central factor.

This kind of hero's journey has proven itself many times in the past. The crucial thing here is also how this journey is staged and what effect the characters achieve. And this is where the strengths of 'Matrix'. The characters are special across the board and the whole world is new and fascinating. You get to know it little by little and understand how it works.

As far as the special effects are concerned, 'Matrix' is still convincing some 20 years after its release. If you compare the effects with more recent movies, you'll notice differences, but 'Matrix' really doesn't need to hide. Fireworks are shot off with grandiose scenes.

However, 'Matrix' is not a classic action movie, but also deals with deeper philosophical questions. The focus is always on the question of what is reality and what significance does it have to know the truth? A lot happens in the brain and maybe it is better for humans to live in an illusion.

'Matrix' manages to credibly combine action, special effects and philosophical themes in one movie. This combination makes it a special movie experience.","7"

I may sound like an old prude, but, without the techno-dazzle, this is just a stultifyingly dull mess of scififoolishness.

"monsterhunt-94296","Entertaining, thoughtful, and revolutionary.","13 October 2020","Alright so last night I watched The Matrix for the first time. It may be surprising that I haven't seen this before but I have now so let's move on. I'll just get right into it: this might be my favorite movie. Obviously I'd probably need to rewatch a few times to see if it truly is, but yeah I thought this was a flawless movie. From the opening scene this movie gripped me and my attention didn't waver the entire film. The Matrix has such an amazing concept going for it, and I won't spoil anything at all in case you've never seen it, but this concept has handled so well. It has a lot of biblical and philosophical things behind it that just make it incredibly fascinating to watch. The story, plot, and screenplay were all handled amazingly and the word building is flawless. Keanu Reeves plays our protagonist, Neo, and he goes through this hero's journey that is just handled expertly. The movie looks amazing and has such a distinct style that makes it stand out from everything else. The action might not be your cup of tea, but I thought it was thoroughly entertaining. Even if the action isn't your thing, the best part here is that the movie doesn't make itself about action. Everything that's not action is just done so well, the movie has such an incredible amount of tension, suspense, and momentum. My only problem with this movie is that it ends. I was genuinely depressed when this ended. The movie was not only a super fun ride, a super well crafted ride, but it made me think about life from a different perspective. I'd be glad to discuss this movie more with anyone, but I'm on mobile so I'll end the review here. 10/10, a perfect masterpiece.","2"
"Brawl_666","the architecture of cognition","14 May 2010","'The Matrix' must be one of the most ambitious and highly successful projects of the past twenty years. Its difficult to imagine how this film could have gone from conception to execution, and succeeded with such flying colors. For a long time I've avoided writing a review because this was my ""Godfather"" or ""Star Wars"" movie, having first seen it at 13 and instantly falling in love with it. I could never be truly objective about this movie, nor could I find a single truthful, objective analysis of it anywhere on IMDb or RT. Roger Ebert's review was nice, but too harsh.

'Bound' helped me appreciate better how 'Matrix' was conceived. Neither of these two films has a single wasted moment. It seems that the Wachowskis build a film by cascading a set of scenes, like a series of dominos, so that each scene projects into the next one. This is of course what all screenwriters do, but as simple as it sounds, it is no mean feat. The most important part of any film, I think, is how you connect scenes, how you work on transitions so as to create meaning and plausibility. What you show, how you show, and most importantly, what you Don't show. This is extremely difficult. It requires a deep understanding of the cognitive mechanics at work between a film and a viewer. It is, if you like, the most important part of film-making, as important (if not more) than the actual shooting process.

The brothers nailed this whole conception business down to the last detail. The editor won an Oscar, but the film was streamlined by the directors for perfect editing. The cinematography and sound design is breathtaking. Joel Silver brought another influence to bear in terms of production expertise. They worked on the formidable design and effects requirements, even bringing in a legendary Hong Kong action choreographer for the martial arts scenes.

And then they made casting choices that could not have been better. This film rests on the visual and vocal libido of the leads. It works only because the actors work, because we relate and identify with them. Just watch Weaving and Fishburne scorch the frame in their respective parts; these are their best roles. Moss is visually apt. Reeves is unwittingly perfect for his role, more perfect than anyone could have imagined.

Another important part of this film is the self-reference. This film riffs on itself many times in many ways, such as when Mouse asks Neo how the machines could possibly know about the taste of Tasty Wheat. This is essentially winking at the viewer by momentarily snapping the plausibility of the whole idea. Also, this whole franchise is one big stab at the Terminator movies and their enduring popularity. Instead of time travel, we have virtual reality. Instead of terminators, we have agents. Instead of John Connor....

None of this explains how they came up with this concept. The keystone of the arch is hidden. There are countless other 'influences' here : Phil Dick, William Gibson, Doctor Who, Grant Morrisson's 'The Invisibles' etc. And as with Tarantino, we are unable to say for sure whether it is homage or plagiarism. The innovation lies in the architecture of the whole thing, in the layering, in the flawless integration of so many different design elements to form a seamless, coherent entity. The Matrix is everywhere indeed.

This is the only way to make movies.","10"
"dreamingescapist","There is definitely not a glitch in 'The Matrix'","7 July 2019","'The Matrix' became an instant phenomenon that spawned two direct sequels, several video games, and graphic novels. Not to mention how much that movie has been an influence on the films of the 21st century in general.

'The Matrix' although released twenty years ago, is still as fresh as it was upon its release. Yes, some can argue that the technology (cellphones and computers) is outdated, but this is the least of the worries - the story takes place inside a computer-generated world that is modeled after the year 1999. The special effects combining CGI with practical stunts and sets still look amazing, and there aren't many movies that came after that have surpassed 'The Matrix' in this department. Fight scenes are as beautiful as ballet, and that sort of poetic fighting choreography is another thing that many (in Hollywood) have tried to replicate, but have failed. Not to mention the film's thought-provoking premise, and its philosophical aspects that have been the basis to numerous essays, reviews, and even studies. Yet, none of its ambitions or allegories (religious or not) feel pretentious. The serious subject matter is masterfully mixed with fantastic visual effects, thus creating a movie which ideas we can discuss over, or simply being an entertaining action epic.

Well developed characters and not only the main ones are also an attestation about masterful writing and well thought out screenplay. Side characters are not there just to be killed off in some flashy way.

There are few movies that became instant classics, and even fewer are those that stand the test of time in today's fast-moving world and can pull theater full even twenty years later*.

"GOWBTW","The one that started it all!","3 March 2005","This is the ultimate of ultimate scifi movies! Here you got the hero named Neo, a computer hacker who is tracked down by a relentless villain named Smith. The scary part when Smith put this ""bug"" that entered Neo's navel, and the team had to track it and flush him out. Then you have this leader named Morpheus(Fishburne) who teaches Neo the ways of the warrior.

I liked the training scene where Morpheus and Neo learn Wing-chun and the way they defy gravity was just awesome. And the speed, it's just phenomenal, I'm at complete loss of words for that. I liked the part where Neo evades the bullets being fired by Smith. And the way Smith moved was just unbelievable.

The fighting scene is the best part of the movie, and the reason why I liked it is because it's not your typical scifi movie you'll ever see. With a great cast like that who wants to make changes? Your only quest is to find out what is The Matrix? 5 STARS!","1"
"dbdumonteil","What the hell is the ""Matrix?""","18 September 2003","Launched in 1999 and one of the most successful movies of the year, ""Matrix"" is an amazing movie. It ranks among the movies that leave the spectator bemused, even after several projections.

In a way, it's very similar to Paul Verhoeven's movie ""Total Recall"" (1990). The two movies have got a complicated but mesmerizing screenplay, astounding special effects and especially, a main character with two faces: Keanu Reeves. It means that at the beginning of the movie, he's introduced as someone who leads a peaceful but common life. But an unexpected event will transform his life and make him a hero.

""Matrix"" is also a very well stable movie that you can divide in two parts: the first one mainly focuses on long dialogs sequences that incline to reflection while the second one honors stunning action sequences.

A remarkable performance crowns it all and Keanu Reeves finds here his best role to date. The sole weakness of the movie is the love affair between Reeves and Laurence Fishburne. The Wachowski brothers felt compelled to include this, maybe to give their movie, a Hollywood nature.

An awesome science-fiction film that easily ranks among the best movies of the nineties.","10"

Faith from the reins of imagination, the performance of the sky, again let people worship. So, I'm a little worried that the fourth part will be a bad tail of a mink. After all, Keanu is also old, the face is no longer handsome and brave. Watching the ""Matrix"" trilogy, the shock is still there, especially the film in the visual language of the peak of the achievement, is still difficult to overcome. Like that war in the rain, has been a lot of film imitation, salute, but can not be classic to continue. Good film is like this, any time how to wash, still can let people often see Chang Xin, inscription in the heart.

Keanu Reeves is possibly the worst actor of all time. The stupid faces he makes in the fight scenes are laughable and he has the worst voice for delivering serious dialogue. They even managed to steal a scene from Walt Disney in this drivel when Neo is brought back to life by a kiss. Most fans of this movie say that those who disliked it ""didn't get it"" and try to make themselves come across as more intelligent by talking about the film's ""deeper meaning"". Well, as someone who also had to painfully analyze this stinker I can say that there is not one original idea within the script. While they're at it they should find a good lawyer to defend themselves from Robert Heinlein's estate, who should sue since they stole the entire parasite idea from Puppet Masters. Keanu Reeves should be shot on sight.","1"
"philip_vanderveken","This will remain a classic, even in 20 years time.","4 April 2005","I've never been a fan of Sci-Fi movies. It just isn't my kind of film and yet, I'm glad to make an exception for this movie. Somehow ""The Matrix"" was able to change my opinion about the genre. So what is it that makes this movie so good? Well, one thing is the story.

The humans believe they live in a normal world in 1999, but in reality it is 200 years later. The world as we know it, was destroyed in a war between robots and humans. While the humans believed they could stop the robots by cutting off their power supply, the robots outsmarted them and made slaves of the humans, who produce more than enough energy to sustain the robot society. But to keep the humans happy and unaware of their actual situation, the robots have created a virtual world, a false version of 20th-century life. This virtual world is called 'the Matrix'. Neo has always been looking for the truth behind the Matrix and one day he gets the opportunity to find it out, thanks to Morpheus. Morpheus is one of the few humans who once managed to escape and he has been searching for the 'chosen one', the only human who will be capable of defeating the robots. He believes Neo is the one he has always been looking for...

Next to the story, it is the special effects that have made this movie legendary. I guess everybody already knows this, but this was the first movie in which they have used the super slow-motion, called bullet time. Of course this was a revelation at the time, but even after all these years it's incredibly nice to watch. And there are more interesting things to be found. The makers have used computer animation to its full extend and have done that in an outstanding way. But next to the well developed story and the amazing special effects, there are still the actors. Sometimes, you might almost forget about them, but they still play an important role in this movie and have done that in a very good way.

As a conclusion I just want to say that this is probably the very best Sci-Fi movie ever. It's full of action, it has a good story, a lot of interesting special effects and some nice acting. What could you possibly want more from a movie? I reward it with an 8/10. I'm sure this will remain a classic, even in 20 years time.","10"
"denisbabak","New meanings","25 December 2018","The Matrix is one of the best science fiction action film directed by The Wachowski Brothers. The film has influenced both the cinema industry and the computer entertainment industry. When you watch The Matrix for the first time, it looks like perfect action movie with high-class special effects and good actors.

Time passed and we remember only a black cloak, two hands shooting, kung-fu and running on the walls.

Recently I watched it again and I was amazed that there was so much hidden behind the spectacular scenes that I needed to watch this film several times, and I would probably find something that I had missed earlier. Reality is the only what we see and feel.

We can understand the movie in different ways. You will see what you emphasize. Slavery, the fight against the system, the role of man in this system and the system in life, fanaticism and faith, chosenness and resurrection.

I suggest watching The Matrix even if you've already watched it.","10"
"kosmasp","Blender","21 July 2009","The Wachowsky Brothers took many elements, from different cultures, that they liked, put them in a blender and mixed them together. And the Matrix is what came out. A great sci-fi movie, that has many elements from other movies (and a theme we have also seen in horror movies), put well together.

While I'm not a big Keanu Reeves fan, he does convince here (as he did in Speed). So while he is in action territory, there is always fun to be had with him. Carrie Ann Moss and Laurence Fishburne have great supporting roles, although of course it is more stylish adventure than anything else. And while the movie leaves quite a few questions open you might have, it works for the movie, being only told a minimum amount of plot. The Keanu Reeves character acts as the viewer as he is thrown in an unknown world. Being baffled and stunned by the whole thing, this might be the reason his casting works so good ...

Apart from that, the action is amazing (Yuen Woo-Ping, very well known for his Asian/martial arts choreography's), the set pieces and the dystopia feel of the movie is pretty convincing ...

Edit: the above review is from 21 July 2009 - before I went to watch the new (fourth) installment in this ... triolgy (?), I revisited the Matrix - Matrix revisited - to use the Matrix title name game. I stand by what I have written above. The cultural impact the movie had is enormous and that is putting it mildly. Back then nobody knew the brothers would become sisters, but I don't think that should play a role on what I wrote or what you think about the movie.

If you watch it under that aspect and also including the rumor that the Neo character was supposed to also be female at certain realities (or worlds) - also considering how Trinity is more centred and more masculine in a sense .. and how some feel that the connection between Neo and Trinity is more like a brother and sister energy ... well in hindsight there may have been some things we could ascribe to the siblings Wachowski ... quite a few to be honest. Which might bring us to the whole Luke and Leia thing ... but let's not get too psychological here.

As written above, I do not feel that Keanu Reeves is the strongest ""actor"". That being said, he is more than a cool Dude. Although even in this and having seen it a few times now, he does play quite the intriguing fool. No pun and no offense intended. Even a character tells him that he sure isn't the brightest. Again that is about the character he portrays and is not meant to describe Keanu or his intellectual abilities.

The Matrix changed the game ... it was also the driver for the then new format, called DVD. It would have been quite something if the new Matrix would have made the 4k discs popular ... but you can't capture lightning in a bottle twice. More on this on the new films page though. This has its flaws for sure (inner logic and all that), but overall it is more than a winner. Bullet time, Hugo Weaving, Laurence Fishburn ... and the philosophical questions combined make for a great cocktail ... after they've been put in the blender with many other ingredients of course ... and the circle is completed once again.","10"
"ctosangel-2","Awful mixture","29 October 2001","Something sad happened with this film. The Hollywood Academy give it some Oscar (special effects, I think). So young people newcomer to cinema world thought it must be a good picture. They did not know that not all the winning Oscar movies deserve it. It is a deceitful, spurious and incredibly pretentious film. Because one thing is Cinema and another thing are computers. If you want to said something in cinema' way you must use cinematography ways. Cinematography language has got his own implements. It is a very old discovery (more than 100 years old) and it was marching on and growing up with hard work, effort, wisdom and -many times- talent. Never with computers. The film responsible commit in my opinion a unforgivable lack os respect. It seen they does not know authors like Griffith, Chaplin, Stroheim, Sternberg, Welles, Dreyer, Ford, Hawks, Walsh, Curtiz, Lang, Reed, Renoir, Buñuel, Kurosawa, Wilder... All of them (and some more) made films with his own effort. Not with computers. That is why the film is not sci-fi nor comic nor martial arts catalogue.

In simple terms: there is someone who is given a choice to choose to be part of the system or to see a bigger and more dangerous picture. It is assumed that there is a reason for this boy to be chosen and the search for that reason is the root of the plot. The rest is simply a visual delight that, like a porn, does not require a larger argument to support the viewer. The only people in love with the plot are those who love conspiracies and obviously they are not the majority.

"xanderlm","Still a great movie after 22 years!!","16 October 2021","I first saw The Matrix on its initial theatre release back in 1999. I've seen bits and pieces of it over the years on TV but hadn't really sat down to watch if again properly until now having bought The Matrix Trilogy on Blu-ray. The movie is still a great sci-fi flick and worthy of being called one of the best. The fights scenes, although a little slow this day and age, are well choreographed and heavy hitting - I particularly enjoy when people get thrown against or through walls and this movie has plenty of that! The bullet time effects and slow motion shots still hold up, and even though other films have copied it, The Matrix was the original and still does it better if you ask me. The storyline still feels futuristic even after 22 years and the CGI, although looking a tad dated, is still pretty sharp mostly (better than what was in the sequel, The Matrix Reloaded, oddly). The story can get a little confusing at times for new comers, infact there were things in this viewing that I had not picked up on or understood previously so just one viewing may not be enough to truely appreciate the film. The one thing the film didn't do for me however was the emotional relationships - I liked the characters, but the relationship between Neo and Trinity felt a bit forced for my liking. My favourite scene is the fight in the Subway between Agent Smith and Neo - it was a great lead in and a very back and foward encounter with neither man truely gaining the upperhand.","10"

So, I expected to see a pretty good movie. It was far from that. It was perhaps the worst script I had heard in a very long time. The directing was nothing memorable. Photography was standard. But what destroyed the movie was the acting. Keanu Reeves was dull and totally lifeless. Even Laurence Fishburne wasn't good(but how could he be good in such a terrible script). There was no chemistry between any of the characters. And overall, the movie was boring! It hardly held my interest...

People that think highly of this movie are too eager to give the special effects (albeit original) way too much credit towards the actual worth of the movie. If it really was the ""story"" of the movie that attracted the crowds to the original, the 2nd movie would have done much better. But since the effects are no longer ""special"" to a lot folks, it appears a lot of people are saying ""NO THANKS"" to seeing the sequel. Which backs up my feelings on the first movie. The story/acting was ok - but didn't WOW me in the least. Reeves is not a great actor - regardless of how much you adore him.","3"
"Eelco_1977","Incredible SF-movie!!!!!!","23 July 1999","Before I went to this movie I saw the making of the Matrix and I immediately thought: ""I have to see this movie!!!!!!"". Since ""Terminator 2; Judgement Day"" I haven't seen so impressive special effects, especially the ""dodge the bullets scene"". The story was great, with much references to the bible, ""Alice in Wonderland"" and Greek mythology.

Before I went to the movie I still had my doubts about the actors and the theme of the film. Keanu Reeves' acting in ""Johnny Mnemonic"" was absolutely horrible, but than again, the script of that movie to. But he recovered when he played an excellent role in ""Devil's Advocate"". Laurence Fishburne's ""Event Horizon"" wasn't also, just like ""Johnny Mnemonic"", a great movie. It started well (except for the music in the beginning) but crashlanded in the end. Laurence Fishburne is (I think) still a bit underestimated by a lot of people as an actor. He was great in this movie. The other keyplayers of the movie were also memorable. As for the theme of the movie, I had my doubts. I had already seen a lot of cyberpunk or virtual reality movies that weren't worth a second or even a first watch. But this movie was awesome!!!!!!

Next to this movie, I'm still waiting for that other SF (more fantasy) movie Star Wars: Episode I; The Phantom Menace which will be released in September (almost five months after the US-release, it's a disgrace) . I'm a big Star Wars fan, but I think that ""The Matrix"" is, or will be, the movie of 1999. I give it a 10!!!!!!","4"
"Movie-12","Challenges your ability to follow a storyline. *** out of ****","11 May 1999","Sometimes when a movie makes you think, I miss the factor and send a negative review across.

Does the movie make you think? Absolutely. It is a vary challenging feature. As a matter of fact, this is a good test for your movie understanding ability. It is not quite as confusing and plotless as ""Dark City,"" but a lot more high tech then ""Johnny Mnemonic."" It is about the same as in the sense of lots happening on scene at one time as ""Blade"", but does not make you dizzy.

I Hesitate to recommend the film, however, and in reality, the day I screened the film my star rating was lower than it is today. In other words, my thumb would be jolted down on Friday, April 2, 1999, but today, it is pointed up, with a crutch helping it from plummeting down again.

Why did I change my mind to disliking ""The Matrix"" to liking it? Well, I thought about it, and BINGO, I thought about it. This movie is very tricky. Hard to follow? Certainly, if you get up to go to the bathroom for five minutes, you'll be lost for all the rest. Movies that threaten for you to pay attention are something to see. Making a thought-provoking film isn't easy, you know.

Irrelevant ""The Matrix"" is. I won't even get into explaining the film's plot, for it would be a mix-up, only to turn you off. There isn't a real story here, but there is a base to the movie. See the movie and you'll understand.

I liked the dazzling visual effects, which were about as good as ""Dark City."" The filmmakers do suffer from showing the audience a little too much on screen instead of letting us imagine things a bit, but they also make up for that by putting in sub-plots and bizarre camera effects.

Also to my liking is the performance by Fishburne and Pantoliano, hard to explain why, however. Laurence Fishburne acts that he is once again on a horror ride in the ""Event Horizon,"" Joe Pantoliano provides some comic relief when the film gets too deep. Keanu Reeves is a bit too lost in his dialog and trying to understand what's going on to do much damage on screen.

""The Matrix"" is not for anyone other than hard core science fiction movie fans. It is simply another addition to the mind numbing array of special effects movies that don't carry along a story with themselves. This is not a great movie, and when I think about it, I have a hard time calling it ""good."" But for an addition to this failing genre, it's a turning point.","1"

I kid you not.

This film is the worst waste of twenty quid I have ever bought. The psuedo-intelectual claptrap (""Hey, what if the world isn't real after all""???? Yawn, like I didn't already think of that when I was about five years old) is used to cover the fact that the main characters and large chunks of the plot were obviously, ahem, ""influenced by"" William Gibson's classic pulp-sci-fi tale 'Neuromancer', ie. they are largely identical (including the role of each character within the narrative) but have had their names or skin colour changed.

The visuals are quite pretty but again are totally lacking in innovation except for the 'Bullet Time' gimmick, which is fun to watch but not as impressive as had been made out. At least it wasn't over-used. Then we move onto the acting: Fishburne is fine, as is Moss, but Keanu drags the film into new depths of rubbishness with his trademark lack of emotion or even the slightest indication of sentience, ruining some lines that should sound great. Finally, the action sequences are well-choreographed but somehow seem flat, as if the pacing is a little off.

I was intrigued by all the talk of how great The Matrix was, and at first, I was intrigued by it. Thomas Anderson, the agents that came looking for him, the talk about 'Morpheus' made me interested about just how the plot would turn out.

However, after the blue pill/red pill scene, what had been a nice premise became very poor indeed. I can honestly say that I didn't care who was 'the one,' and with all the cryptic phrases and mumbo-jumbo this thing threw in, I began to wonder whether or not I was watching a bible story. It leaves you wondering just exactly what this film is trying to say.

With the exception of Agent Smith, there was not one character I liked. I was praying Morpheus would die, as it might have brought this rubbish to an end. And what was with all those pointless one-liners? ""It's Neo."" ""Dodge this."" If I had watched this in a cinema, I would probably have been thrown out for shouting obscenities at the screen.

All in all, a thorough waste of time. The interesting premise, special effects, and well-executed scene where Neo is being pursued by Smith just about lift it out of the dung-heap, but they don't compensate for all its faults.

"Li-1","Solid sci-fi entertainment, but still misses on wide opportunities.","27 February 2004","*** out of ****

Five years I've held off writing a review for The Matrix. Why? For the simple reason of watching all its sequels and spin-offs before I determined my final judgment. Whaddaya know, my rating still hasn't changed, or at least not significantly (I like it a little less than my very first viewing, some three viewings back). This movie has been, through and through, a *** picture, no more and sometimes possibly even less.

By day, Thomas Anderson (Keanu Reeves) leads a simple and uneventful life as an office worker who dwells in his little cubicle. By night, he's Neo, a first-rate computer hacker who feels there's something not quite right with his world. At a nightclub, he meets Trinity (Carrie-Anne Moss), a dark-haired woman who gives him even more cryptic answers to his questions. Curious, Neo pursues for further answers, leading him to a mysterious man named Morpheus (Laurence Fishburne).

And it's during a particularly dark and stormy night that Neo discovers the truth; the entire world is a program fabricated by machines of artificial intelligence that have overrun the planet. These machines feed off ""sleeping"" humans as a battery source to continue their own existence. When Neo is awakened, he's in for an even bigger shock; he's the destined hero to free the human race from the machines. Whoa.

There are a lot more intriguing plot elements, including the mention of an underground city called Zion, the last refuge of the human race with a population of approximately 250,000. The program the humans are in, called the Matrix, operates and keeps the fabricated world in order through individuals called agents, who have the ability to take over anyone connected to the matrix in the similated world. This is all a tad more complicated than it seems; unless you really hate science fiction with a furious passion, you'll probably find the plot fairly easy to absorb (then again, I'm still surprised by the number of those who find themselves completely confused by this movie's plot).

The central storyline, Neo's ascent to near deification, is interesting if not as well-handled as one would like. I enjoy the fact that most of the film focuses on the individuals aboard a ship called the Nebuchednezzar. Scaling down this epic tale affords more opportunity for character development, which writers/directors The Wachowski Brothers use to their advantage on several occasions.

As a sci-fi tale, The Matrix runs fairly smoothly. None of the ideas presented are particularly original, but they're fascinating concepts and they're presented in an intriguing fashion. It's through the visuals that The Matrix succeeds in delivering its plot; by giving us a world in which rules can be bent and even broken, there's ample opportunity to display jaw-dropping visual effects that have rarely, if ever, been used in this manner.

Unfortunately, there's still much about the sci-fi aspect that's sorely underused or unexploited. If the Matrix is, in fact, a world in which the A.I. could manipulate to their advantage, it's disappointing that all they do is put up a few brick walls and throw a few kung-fu skilled agents into the mix. I expect a lot more than just martial arts in a movie that claims to turn the world upside down as we know it.

Unfortunately, the story nearly falls apart at the point the Oracle (Gloria Foster) gives Neo her prophecy, and like the rest of the film, chooses not to give any clear-cut answers and istead merely mentions that Neo has to make a choice that could result in either his or Morpheus' death. She also mentions he's not the One but has the gift (uh-huh, makes it sound like being the One is an occupation open to application). Almost as bad is the fact Neo fails to pry further in his questioning. He just stands there with barely a single expression on his face.

If the Oracle can tell the immediate future, she should learn to actually do more than spout a lot of nonsense that proves pretty futile (this would later really mar the sequels). This scene completely insults me because it's obvious the Wachowskis only wanted to try and obscure the climax for us. If you actually believe either Neo or Morpheus will die at the end or if Neo isn't really the One, then maybe the Wachowskis know their target audience better than I do.

But by far the kneecapper of the whole picture and ultimately the reason why I can never muster more enthusiasm for it is the scene where Neo chooses to rescue Morpheus and risk almost ""certain"" death. What does he do? He loads himself up with heavy artillery and with Trinity's assistance shoots up a lobby full of security guards without showing the slightest hint of emotion. I understand this is for the Greater Good, but that our hero, who so previously had been in shock at the discovery of the reality of his entire universe, could kill dozens of innocents without even batting an eyelash is absolutely confounding. I almost didn't care about the rest of the film after this scene.

The action sequences afterward are thrilling enough to provide momentary distraction, especially the kickass subway martial arts battle between Neo and Agent Smith. But somehow the film sidetracks itself yet again with a melodramatic and overdone climax that would be more fitting in a daytime soap opera than an epic motion picture.

Still, most everything before that is entertaining and interesting enough that I definitely recommend this picture. I should also mention Hugo Weaving's performance; the man has carved a name for himself in this memorable role, crafting one of the best pure villains I've ever seen. He is, in fact, so good I'd almost choose him over the heroes.

Undoubtedly, The Matrix trilogy will be endlessly debated for the years to come, but I'm neither one who finds himself in ecstasy over this picture nor do I despise this film with seething hatred. It's enjoyable enough to stand up to quite a few viewings, which means there's plenty of worthwhile material on hand. You just have to bear through the subpar stuff to get to it.","8"
"DemonKiki","Some thoughts on philosophy","22 April 2020","Existence is the first requirement of all life, so human beings are very interested in the issue of sensation. Since ancient times, the prediction of the Plato cave, our guess and reasoning about the reality of the world has never stopped. Is it true that we perceive this world? Is there a more real world behind this world? The cave prophecy believes that our world is like a cave. We are only the poor worms bound to watch shadow play in the cave, and the real world is outside the cave. ""If reality refers to what you can feel, smell, taste, and see, then reality is nothing more than an electrical signal generated in your brain."" This is a sentence in the movie ""The Matrix"" Famous lines. He expressed a harsh possibility: our world may not be real. Perhaps only a limited sense can be used to perceive certain aspects of this world, but we cannot grasp the existence around us from the whole. Even as Russell said: The world may have been created a few minutes ago, but it has humans who remember the virtual past.","9"

The only real problem with the movie is that it was not supposed to be funny. I was not the only one who had this opinion. The person I was with kept laughing at the same time I did. Keanu just doesn't do it for me. Every serious look that he tries still has an air of Bill S. Preston, Esq. (or was he Theodore ""Ted"" Logan?).

"Med-Jasta","Truly incredible","18 February 2020","I have a long history with this movie of hating it. It came out at a time when Kung Fu was taking over action movies which I didn't like. I wasn't a fan of the slow mo and the style of this movie. So when this changed movies my hatred was only reinforced.

Fast forward twenty years where I've learned to love Kung fu and tolerate slow mo. The Matrix was added to Netflix and since it was free I decided to give it another shot and absolutely loved it. Still not a fan of the style but it doesn't ruin the movie. I of course see how it's cool, it's just not my thing.

This is one of the best written movies ever. The way the story unfolds is genius. Because you are getting a lot of information from what is the matrix to it's origin and it all flows very naturally. Very hard to do. The concept is genius and brilliantly executed. They really explore every aspect of this world and utilize it well.

Keanu... I used to think he was awful. Watching this now I don't think that. Sure he has a few not great lines, enough to pounce on for a hater. But he is really good. He is very subtle. Something only a confident actor can do. Which the teenage me couldn't pick up on.

I have gone on to watch the other two and loved them and now am a huge matrix fan and have watched them many times since. Reload took me two watches to realize what the brothers were doing, one movie split in two.

It's fun to discover this movie now because they don't make them anymore. Big budget, ambitious movies. I miss them and hope their return is around the corner. Hopefully Matrix 4 will remind everyone what a good movie really is.","10"

"mvpdom","Great Action, Great Story, Captivated me from the first time I watched it.","19 December 2021","The Matrix is a movie that has captivated my attention form the first time I watched it. Keanu Reeves stars as the action hero Neo as he journeys from computer hacker inside the Matrix to realizing he true purpose as the messiah figure, ""the one"", who will free humanity from their bondage in the Matrix.

The Matrix is truly the concept that captivates the audience. A robust computer simulation that an advanced AI has trapped the entire human race in. This draws in all the elements of the movie that I love such as the superhuman abilities, the evil computers, crazy mechanics of moving in and out of the Matrix, and downloading material arts techniques.

Neo is the best character has he journey's to realizes his true potential. Laurence Fishburne plays Morpheus the fearless captain of the Nebuchadnezzar the teams hovercraft that they use to fight off the machines. He has a undying belief in Neo as does Carrie-Anne Moss's Trinity. This leads to him risking his life for Neo, but Neo who does not believe he is ""The One"" feels guilt and risks his life to save Morpheus.

Neo's identity is oblivious once Morpheus explains to him of the prophecy of ""The One"". The movie develops this in a captivating way as Neo is introduced to the Oracle, played by Gloria Foster, who is portrayed as the most knowledgeable character in the movie tells Neo he is not the one. As Neo continues to doubt his identity he soon realizes his potential when he was thrown into life-threatening situations for him, Morpheus, and Trinity. Without the pressure of living up to be the one he succeeds in saving all of their lives, showing that the purpose of the Oracle's message to him was exactly what he need to hear.

The action is top notch and includes some of the most iconic shots in film both of Neo dodging the bullets on the rooftop and him stopping the bullets in the hallway. This movie gives you just enough of Neo's superhuman abilities and is balanced with the amazing lobby scene where Neo and Trinity shoot up the whole place.

I will also comment that my favorite scene that is not an action scene is when they all sit down at the dinner table and Mouse played by Matt Doran speculates that the reason that everything tastes like chicken is because the machines did not know what any of those other foods tasted, so they just made it all taste like chicken.

I will say that the special effects are dated, the color pallet is depressing, and I do not like Neo and Trinity's romance in this movie.

Overall this is an amazing movie that has not been replicated to this day.","6"

It was almost all effects, almost to the point of Nausea, something that Keaunu did little to help. His typical ""Dewd"" performance was laughable at best, bordering on the wretched and far from notable.

Unfortunately, the special effects were the only things stunning about the movie, unless you count how stunningly stupid the dialogue was, or how stunningly bad the acting was (even good actors like Fishbourne and Joe Pantalione couldn't get anything out of this script). The filmakers here took a wonderful concept, filled it with marvelous special effects and left it to die without any substance.

I have heard they are doing a new matrix movie. I hope if they do that they don't stray away from the movie to much. I hope they don't forget about the generation that grew up with it.. We see alot of new movies that target the young blood and forget those who loved them from the 90s. To me it would only work with original cast and keeping in tune with the original movies. If they decide to forget the originals and replace the cast for a younger audience then they stand a chance of ruining one of the greatest titles ever made.","8"
"im_veritas_photo","How Can Anyone Watch The Matrix More Than One Time?","14 April 2007","I may spend more time writing this comment than any of the 26 others I have completed for IMDb. For one thing, I really need to examine why I have such a totally negative view of this movie, which many others adore so. I do think they must either be 12-year-olds, or older folk with their mental development permanently stunted, stuck forever at the 12-year-old level. Sorry, but that's really the way I feel about anyone who raves about ""The Matrix"". It is sad that I'll spend (waste) my time in this way.

Certainly, there are worse movies in the same genre. One example is ""Equilibrium,"" which has achieved the dubious distinction being one of only two films, the other being ""Bloody Sunday,"" with my ""2 out of 10"" rating. Only ""Narc"" got a lower rating (obviously, a ""1"") in my list of IMDb voted-on films. I think that pegs The Matrix at a ""3"", although that may indeed be too generous.

I think Keanu Reeves is, generally, a good actor, although many, if not most, of the films in which he has appeared do scant justice to what acting ability he possesses. ""Speed"" comes to mind; a very bad movie. And Reeves definitely comes off as badly in The Matrix as he did in Speed. On the other hand, the relatively unknown film ""Johnny Mnemonic,"" although it obviously falls far short of fulfilling the wild vision of William Gibson's fine short story, gets at least my mild applause; Reeves was as good as he gets in that film, I think. And, guess what? For his Johnny Mnemonic effort, Reeves was nominated for the Razzie Award, as worst actor of the year!

I don't know what you call the genre, if only one exists, for The Matrix and Equilibrium. Science Fiction? Cyber-Noir? Impossible Future-Fantasy Kung-Fu? ""Dark City,"" I think, also belongs to this indeterminate genre, but Dark City resides at the best end of its spectrum, as opposed to the other two, which are so abysmally bad they inspire nausea in me. The stunningly beautiful images of Dark City stand in huge contrast to the formulaic shallowness of The Matrix. Well, there can be no comparison, really. Dark City is a great film; The Matrix just isn't. I will try to explain why I have these starkly-opposed opinions...

I believe there ought to be at least three criteria for rating any film: Screenplay, Acting, and Production. Of the three, Acting must be at least a bit more important than the other two. Good acting can go far towards rescuing marginal writing or poor production. And bad acting can absolutely ruin an otherwise excellent story and image.

The Matrix: The acting is unconvincing. Screenplay: Shallow, displaying no redeeming or memorable story. Production: Dominated by gratuitous special effects, which have little relation to furthering what story there is.

I just decided to drop this project. The Matrix deserves no more of my time. 3 out of 10. Finis.","8"
"zbrak","This movie took the Blue Pill","14 July 2003","I have heard so much about the Matrix and finally watched it for the first time this weekend.

Boy, were there lots of action sequences. Lots and lots and lots of action sequences. You can feel the filmmakers just trying to top the last sequence instead of doing something like advancing the plot or developing the characters. Unless you think the action sequence is the be-all-and-end-all of movies, all that action just gets boring after a while. I have nothing against whiz-bang special effects as long as they do something worthwhile to move the film along (the Lord of the Rings films are good at this). But this is just not happening with the Matrix.

The Matrix concept itself is thought-provoking. Why isn't it developed more? The fact that this monumental struggle for the soul of humanity ends up with a shoot-out, a helicopter-dangling rescue sequence and a martial arts fight is almost laughable. It's like saying the mysteries of the universe can be unraveled by watching beer commercials. If you want to see an ending that leaves you with something worth chewing on, you'll be sadly disappointed (as I was).

As for other elements of the movie -- Keanu Reeves, as much as I usually enjoy watching him, was extremely wooden. Fishburne and Moss were good at what they did, but their parts were pretty two-dimensional. I couldn't get emotionally involved with any of the characters, which is ultimately the fault of the writers. The cinematography and ""style"" of the film and the sets is pretty cool to look at. However, the whole black clothes and sunglasses motif is just a little bit hokey after a while. And the agents -- I swear they look just like the bad aliens in Brother From Another Planet -- I kept expecting them to shriek at each other.

I look at it this way - people who think that sitting in front of their tubes and playing video games is a worthwhile way to spend their lives will probably love this movie. People who want something more will think it's pretty hollow. It's a shame because the concept had a lot of potential, but the filmmakers took the easy way out.","10"

As a matter of fact, the producers of this thing probably owe its popularity to parents who dumped their kids in video parlors at malls instead of sending them to school.

I mean, even if you get past the impressive (for awhile, anyway) whistles and buzzers, ""The Matrix"" pushes the envelope just an inch too far when it asks us to believe Keanu Reeves' MIND is being sought to SAVE THE WORLD! It's too funny for words. WHO could believe it?

"illbebackreviews","The Matrix is the most mindblowing and groundbreaking achievement since the time of its release","17 October 2012","Apart from 'The Lord of the Rings' and 'The Dark Knight' trilogy, 'The Matrix' is perhaps the greatest cinematic achievement since its release year, 1999.

I've seen the Matrix a few times and mainly seen the action dozens of times. Today, I re-watched the movie and was more than blown away by the movie. The Matrix is just groundbreaking and jaw dropping in pretty much every aspect. The acting is fantastic, even Keanue Reeves did a splendid job in this movie, the visual effects are revolutionary, the plot behind it is so unique and nothing but masterfully directed, written in amazing style with brilliant dialogue and action, containing great stunt work. A mix of CGI with practical effects certainly makes this movie all the more realistic and groundbreaking

The Matrix is about a young man who experiences that he lives in two different worlds; one he is a computer hacker, the other he is an employee at a computer software company. He is taken by a mysterious man named Morpheus and is shown the truth about humanity and that something called the 'matrix' is concealing the truth away from ordinary citizens. The world, in the present year of 2099, is covered in ruins after incidents that happened long before. This movie is pretty much all about Neo becoming the One to fulfill the prophecy and becoming the One.

The plot in this movie can be so confusing at times if you do not pay attention, much like Inception. When the comparison does come, I always will say that the Matrix is a more amazing piece of art and is actually regarded as amazing by some and the most overrated movie by others. Calling this the most overrated movie ever is like calling Avatar the greatest. It doesn't work like that.

No movie in my Top 10 of all time do I have a single issue with expect this movie, which turns out to be a minor issue under great directing, writing, acting, characters, story and action as well as breathtaking visuals. That is the music which could've been done better. That is easily forgotten when an action scene I've seen dozens of times before still intensifies me so all is forgiven.

'The Matrix' is easily one of the most memorable movies of all time and those who trash this movie should go back to watching Batman and Robin. Truly one of the best movies ever made: Groundbreaking, Epic, Visually Stunning, Masterpiece. Belongs in my Top 10 list. A+

"Horst_In_Translation","Good? Yes. Groundbreaking? Not really.","29 November 2014","15 years ago, back in the 20th century, the first of so far three Matrix films was released. It runs for roughly 2 hours and 15 minutes and was directed by the Wachowski brothers Andy and Lana (still Larry back then). The film stars Keanu Reeves with supporting performances by Carrie Anne Moss, Laurence Fishburne and Hugo Weaving.

I cannot say I didn't enjoy this film as I really liked it to some extent, but I was not wowed either, maybe because science fiction is not exactly my favorite genre. My biggest problem was possibly Reeves in the lead role. I just fail to see him as a guy who brings the necessary toughness for his character here and in any other action movie. All this praise about him being the chosen one made me cringe occasionally. The dialogs about him being so grand were sometimes downright cheesy and same goes for the explosions coming with the final kiss between Reeves' and Moss' characters. Another criticism I had was the Oracle being wrong. She was presented as a know-it-all authority and in the end her prediction is simply disregarded with the explanation, Neo has to find his way and then he is the chosen one if he chooses to be. Oh and the song during the closing credits did not match my taste at all.

What I did like about the film were basically all the supporting players, especially Fishburne and Moss also. The helper-turned-villain was creepy in his big scene and Weaving was a revelation. His antagonist really makes the film and the film was at its best during the scenes he was in. The camera shot with Weaving before the subway train runs over him was certainly the best shot of the movie, maybe the whole trilogy. His parallel on humans being the real virus of the planet makes you wonder too if he is maybe right. Other than that, I liked the pill reference from ""Alice in Wonderland"" early on and the green code on black ground is certainly memorable and immediately associated with this film.

Finally, I would like to say that I recommend this movie, especially to sci-fi lovers although they probably have seen it already anyway. It is not a film I really want to rewatch anytime soon, but it starts okay and gets better during the second half. I don't think the second and third Matrix films are much worse, but that is maybe because I don't consider the first a masterpiece. All three are solid. ""The Matrix"" won four technical Academy Awards, all four categories where it was nominated. It's no ""Return of the King"", but still an admirable achievement.","6"

Casting was excellent, direction was top notch, and the CGI was over the top. People will forget or have forgotten the new methods and techniques that the Matrix brought to us that we now see on TV and every other movie out on the screen today. A much better product then the next two Matrix movies. I would recommend both of those to hard-core fans of the The Matrix. So if you want a great action flick or a great action flick which will make you think the Matrix is the movie for you to watch.

The setting at first just seemed to be the common cops and robbers type from the early 50s it had appeared. I still love the line from the Officer in Charge to Agent Smith about jurisdictions.

It started out really slow, and sometimes I still get angry at how they made Neo into such a baby back b***h in the beginning. I mean come on - you go all the way out to the ledge just to turn yourself in? I feel that where it really started to get good was the meeting with Morpheous, and I love the blue pill/red pill reference. It is something I use myself to people to this day as to say ""Hey, are you going to keep doing the same thing monotonously, or are you going to take charge and do something daringly different with your life"". So it was very clever! And it was clever for Neo to discover that he was the one - not everything can be handed on a silver spoon (the funny thing I can say is a great allusion with the monk like child to Neo's meeting with the Oracle).

At the end of the day - there are a lot of hidden messages and life lessons to be picked up from this movie. I am not sure what the intentions are of the writers of it (are we ever?). However it is a movie that I feel was definitely ahead of its time when it came out and is not a disappointment by any means!

"synicalsaint","This isn't the ""One""","13 October 2004","The Matrix took everybody by surprise back in 1999 but after the initial euphoria there was very little left to say about this movie which is, I believe, way over-rated. True, the special effects had a new look but that's pretty much all there is to it. Now those SFX are cliché and close to ridiculous. Look at Terminator II, now over twelve years old, the SFX are still ahead of today's standards.

The story is basically a cross-over between the Terminator plot (also Blade Runner and a lot more sci-fi movies with the mankind overrun by machine and artificial intelligence idea) and the Dark City setting and ambiance (trench coats, an artificial city). This lack of originality is why, in my humble opinion, the movie's sequels didn't do as well. The acting is OK but far from good and the directing is the same as most 'hollywoodian' movies from the last ten years (IE lacking personal style. Seriously, what's the difference between a Wachowski bros. flick and a Roland Emmerich one?).

I've tried to watch it again on several occasions but usually I end up fast forwarding to the main action scene and then turning the movie off and then I get the feeling that that scene resumes the entire movie; a lot of noise about nothing.","3"
"thecatsmotheruk","Before I die...","1 May 2004","I'm probably going to get lynched for saying this but...

*hides and whispers* It's really not THAT good.

It is an entertaining film. It is very good for passing a couple of hours and for dissecting with friends afterwards. It is a film that was made for video nights for that purpose. I'm not saying I don't like it, I do. But I do not think it is a masterpiece. I do not find the secrets of the universe contained herein - but that is probably because I am not a conspiracy theorist and hence that level of the film is just daft to me. Indeed I think it would have been a lot better had they just made a good old fashioned adventure story with a cyber twist rather than making it a theological debate.

At a technical level it is absolutely amazing and that is the key to the success of the film. If it did not have the technical stunts and gimmickery then the reaction to it would be a lot more muted and probably more realistic. It is no accident that the people I know who have praised it most highly are cyberpunk fans! Other friends have been a lot cooler about it.

On the other hand it does have Keanu in leather and for that I can forgive much!","2"

With all the Y2K hype and the millennium steadily approaching, this could not have fit in better. This is a revelation in visual effects in film. People never saw this movie or its visual effects coming because the millennium diverted it. Not to say that it was poorly advertised because thousands of people we know from the votes viewed this movie. This is what the Wachowski Brothers were waiting for and hats off to the directors out there who took advantage to the near millennium, to the near future. The videogames of this series aren't half bad as well, however, they are limited, even in a world like the Matrix. These are the films that make it, from directors who put their all into making one tremendous effort in a single film. They will be rewarded. We saw this with Quentin Tarantino and his low-budget (but definitely not low-rated) film, Pulp Fiction. Watch the other two films in the Matrix series to find out if the Wachowski Brothers capitalized or fell in their own success.","10"

Yes it all looks nice, but that doesn't make a film. The plot had so many holes it was unbelieveable. The bad guys walk around with pistols, huh, they can choose any weapon they can morph into anyone and all they use is pistols. The Matrix has the ability to remove all doors from a room but it doesn't have the power to ignite the room so that they all burn to death. The idea of the matrix was good until you start thinking about it. This film is entertaining but at the end of the day it's just a stylised version of so many Star Trek episodes and a copy of everything Sci Fi that's gone before it.","6"
"eve_dolluk","Best Sci Fi film ever !!?!","23 July 2010","I am writing this review 11 years after I first walked into my local cinema and sat down to watch a film I knew nothing about called The Matrix. I had seen little advertising except for the poster at the cinema and I did not know what to expect. 1 minute into the film and I was awestruck. I am not sure exactly what i had just seen. Visually it was the most unique thing Id ever seen, and only 3 minutes had passed. Then we move onto story telling, we are faced with Alice in Wonderland and down the rabbit hole references. I knew then that this was going to be interesting. Slowly Layers were peeled away until boom it hits you right in the face, it actually draws your breath and moves you in such a way that I had never experienced watching a film thus the Matrix is revealed. Some amazing action scenes follow including the lobby scene which for me is still the best action sequence scene I've ever seen. Just when you think it can't get any better we have the ending....... NO..... the hairs stand up on the back of your neck and you are instantly touched by... something. By the time i had walked out of the cinema and got about 100 yards down the road I turned around. I went straight back and watched the next showing. I watched the film 8 times at the cinema over the next few weeks, demanding friends come and see it. Now I have probably seen the film many times since ( 100 ). I know there are flaws but then when you see a flaw you can also somehow justify it. As a stand alone film it is the best Sci Fi movie of all time. Fans wanted more and 2 more films arrived. I enjoyed both films although not on the same level as the first

I saw this movie because some of my so called friends were saying how excellent this movie was ( I have seriously questioned my friendships with these people after this disaster!!!) and to say it was rubbish is an understatement.

Keanu Reeves who plays the 'hero' role, is one of the most wooden actor's and in this movie he just plays Ted from Bill and Ted but in leather!! Thats not to say that I do not like Bill and Ted as I enjoyed both of them. But to have Reeves playing him in every film is a bit much.

The story is boring and all the acting is poor. Why did they bother with this movie. If I wanted to watch a truly great sci-fi movie I would watch any of the Star Wars films.

But the basic idea (what you see is not true) is not so new. Even the idea of a bunch of freedom-seeking hackers has been often used in cyberpunk literature. The biggest limit of Matrix is the lack of courage: whenever the directors are about to cross the line of a scifi movie to enter the world of big cinema, they choose the easier way (gunfights, a bit of Bruce Lee 20 years after). And one last thing, the guy resurrected by the princess' kiss: so miserable... They tried to turn an average story into a new Blade Runner, but I'm afraid it turned out as a Luxury edition of Johnny Mnemonic. Rated 7 (to me) but Matrix does not go beyond the limit of a genre movie.","4"

The special effects aren't that good, and the martial arts are junior grade HK stuff. Keanu is terrible as usual and Carrie-Anne Moss isn't much better. The premise itself has some promise, but we spend too much time in The Matrix, where the rules seem to apply only when the Wachowski Brothers want them too. Example: why do our heroes have to be transported through a particular phone wire? Why can't they use their ubiquitous cell phones? Could it be to set up some chase scenes? Why, in fact, does The Matrix include all these old fashioned wired phones, when the bad guys know well and good that the good guys use them as a means of transportation?

At the same time there are lots of clichés like the wardrobe a combination of Mad Max, Sons or Anarchy, and Robin Hood: Men in Tights. And oh the idea that love can fix everything is the biggest cliché since Star Trek: The Motion Picture. I remember the word ""CreatOr"" Jesus wept!

The ""science"" part of Sci-fi in the main primes is really very absurd. Humans ""combined with a form of fusion"" serve as batteries. WHAT! HOW? Machines need to keep us alive in an imaginary world to use our energy. WHAT! Someone who helped create the Matrix died and somehow his reincarnate will be able to decode and destroy it. WHAT! WHY?

They chose to make it fantasy movie, is NOT sci-fi, and like any fantasy, you either enjoy it and get on board with the premise or you don't.

And while it really demands to be seen on the Big Screen to be fully appreciated, I bought a copy for my own collection, and have watched it several times since and have always enjoyed it. Fine, great so far.

But the problems for me begin when fanatical fans of the movie make WAY too many claims for it. This is an ACTION movie folks, nothing more, nothing less. It surrounds the Woo/Lam inspired action with MTV-friendly simplified ideas lifted from Grant Morrison's sensational comics 'The Invisibles', and from Morrison's source materials - the paranoid, reality bending, Gnostic influenced SF of Philip K. Dick, the mankind-as-aliens-property ideas of H.P. Lovecraft's Cthulhu Mythos, and the techno-shamanism and multiple realities of Robert Anton Wilson and Terrence McKenna.

Unfortunately very few 'Matrix' buffs seem to be aware of the writers and thinkers the Wachowski brothers are basing their supposedly ""amazing"" concepts from, and are over rating the movie to a ridiculous degree. Enjoy 'The Matrix' for what it is, but don't believe the hype!","10"

It also raises new questions on this basis: will you choose blue pill or red pill? Is it to choose a beautiful fantasy or a cruel reality? On the surface, it seems to be a good choice, but in fact, it is much more difficult than we think. On the one hand is the doomsday world in the future, devastated by hunger and cold, and faced with the danger of being chased by robots; on the other hand is a warm and peaceful era, with blue sky and white clouds, beautiful scenery on a bright day, and even the chance to become a successful person. Indeed, everyone knows that the best dreams are just dreams. But seifer is willing to sell everyone for a dream. If we really escape from the matrix and experience the cruelty of reality, maybe we will make the same choice as sever. Just as when you have a dream, you would rather stay in it than wake up.","10"

"res0owwh","The Matrix is a spiritual movie, based upon spirituality, not necessarily religion.","20 November 2001","The Matrix does a better than excellent job of illustrating spiritual truths (not religious truths, necessarily, although some religious philosophies are illustrated therein, i.e., Luke 1:37 ""For with God nothing shall be impossible"".) The crew on-board the Nebuchadnezzar can be considered a spiritual team. The agents can be considered demons, the neophyte's own demons which he must overcome in order to transcend the ordinary 3-D reality. The agents present to the neophyte his fears, doubts, and disbeliefs which he must fight against and win in order to fully know himself.

Additionally, the movie depicts planetary control and the majority of human beings' unconsciousness in that regard (""Billions of people just walking around oblivious."")

The members of the spiritual team act as teachers, as well as the agents. Both teams are considered teachers. Agent Smith spills a lot of truths. One team operates from a positive viewpoint and the other from a negative viewpoint.

"SamuraiYost","Most over-rated movie of all time","17 May 2004","Really, my summary says it all.

It's a cute premise overwhelmed by its need to be cool at the expense of plot, characters, meaning, or consistency. It has philosophical and literary pretensions that come off as kindergarten philosophy at best and ham-handed at worst. Luckily, these can be ignored fairly easily.

Good action sequences for the most part. Most of the cast is summer-movie capable. i.e. Their acting is neither embarrassing nor impressive. Keanu gives his second-best performance ever (after Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure). Unfortunately, that is likely merely the convergence of his naturally confused look with the confusion inherent to the character.

All things considered a fun action movie provided you don't buy the hype telling you that it is so much more.

By the way, stop with this one. This movie is watchable and complete in its own and is only degraded by its truly dreadful sequels. If this movie is the triumph of style over substance, its sequels are the cruel beating and maiming of substance by style gone bad.","3"

Possibly it is the dreamlike quality of the movie that makes it a classic. There are some scenes visually compelling, if not really beautiful (e.g. the green insect penetrating Neo's body). But the excessive martial arts sequences were at first annoying and then, as they became more frequent, I was just bored by them (just as in Charlie's Angels, if this comparison is politically correct). Obviously martial arts are fashionable, but I never cared for Bruce Lee either. In general, The Matrix forgot about its lofty aspirations as it drew towards its end, turning into a plain action movie with endless special effects, fireworks, shooting, and all, even with a helicopter. But what about the very idea of the Matrix? Isn't it just nonsense? After all, if machines took control of the world, using human beings as ""batteries,"" these machines could easily put the poor humans into a perpetual coma, leaving them without consciousness, a state in which they would even spend less energy to sustain themselves, making the whole thing more efficient for the machines. Such human beings would not need any surrogate reality; the Matrix, which is not only a complex box of tricks, but also a waste of energy, would become obsolete.","10"
"notafanof","Talk about overrated","7 September 2016","I don't get why people fawn over this movie so much. It's ideas are not actually original at all, as they have all been regurgitated from many of the great Sci- Fi stories of the twentieth century. It's not like it is the first film to get viewers to question reality. What about Dark city? That film came out a year before this one did, and does way more with its plot. In fact, I suspect that Dark city was an experiment to gauge audience interest, and The Matrix creative team decided that adding guns and action will bring a bigger audience. The story is intriguing, but in the end it actually goes nowhere. It's another Jesus allegory- only this time it has bullet time and sci-fi tropes thrown in. Seriously, how long is Hollywood going to rely on the Jesus allegory to rake in cash? Probably forever. The action scenes, while revolutionary at release, are dated - mostly because there have been about a million imitators, and about one thousand of those imitators were able to improve upon it because of the technology afforded to them. The movie is still entertaining,but, contrary to what its fans say, it is definitely a turn your brain off at the door type of movie. It's the type of movie where every plot hole and inconsistency can be excused with: doesn't matter- computer simulation. Which is fine, but it is literally the only excuse this movie has when something does not add up. There is no attention to the details in the universe of this movie. The Wachoski brothers obviously came up with more backstory to fill in the holes after having realized how successful this movie would become. Some of the characters are well developed,and most of them I could root for, but all of them are given some truly terrible dialogue to work with. Both the delivery and the writing of the dialogue in this movie is bad. Not Transformers bad, mind you, but bad enough to take me out of the movie every time someone spoke. Hugo weaving is given the best lines in the movie, but he makes his lines work with the character he is portraying. The acting in this movie is average at best. While I'm quite certain that most of the characters were supposed to act cold and emotionless, some of the more, ahem, challenged actors in this movie can't act out cold and emotionless very well. Keanu Reeves and Carrie Anne Ross are completely unconvincing in their roles- and, considering they are both main characters, is a pretty big knock against this movie. Definitely not the masterpiece it is made out to be. 6 out of 10.","10"

"bandw","Much glitz, little content. [spoilers]","6 November 2001","You cannot help but be impressed with the tremendous amount of work that went into the making of this movie, but the result is much flash and dazzle with very little content. I would have hoped for more.

The plot is so confused and confusing that I gave up trying to make any sense out of it after about 20 minutes. The plot line ultimately reverts to a classic good-guys vs. bad-guys shoot-em-up. The movie is kind of a ""Karate Kid"" on steroids, except that the characters in ""The Karate Kid"" are much more involving.

The subtheme concerning the nature of reality adds no new insight in trying to answer this eternal question. Any child who stops to think about the artificial reality created strictly by the mind in the dream state has gotten as far as this movie makes you go. ""The Forbidden Planet"" examines this question in a much more interesting and thoughtful way.

The subtheme concerning finding ""The Chosen One"" seemed to be thrown in as an attempt at trying to give the hopelessly misguided script some heft. Some ""meaning."" If you want to see a beautiful and sensitive treatment of this, see Scorsesse's ""Kundun.""

Except for Fishburn, the acting was uniformly wooden. Keanu Reeves seems to have the emotional range of a potato. I wound up not caring for any of the people in this movie - whether they lived or died made no difference to me. I found the love interest unbelievable.

The intro to the DVD made me think that I was going to like the music at least. But I cannot even remember this movie as having a soundtrack, it was so unmemorable.

The agents for the Matrix were stereotypical, in a movie that seemed to want to break stereotypical images - like the supreme Mother being an aging and unattractive lower middle class woman. If you are really thinking about how to be innovative in portraying evil, think of the devil in ""The Last Temptation of Christ.""

I think about this movie in comparison to ""2001"" in trying to figure why I liked ""2001,"" but disliked this movie so much. Both movies have memorable images, but ""2001"" creates a sense of beauty and mystery, whereas ""The Matrix"" creates a sense of anxiety and dread.

Ultimately I found ""The Matrix"" to be drab, depressing and cold. I found its glorification of violence repellent.","7"
"marcalan-2","Stop the insanity-This is not a good movie! Where did the script go?","9 January 2001","I really can't understand all of the accolades that this film continues to receive. Has the entire world gone insane and forgotten that what makes a good movie is its script. Has everything become about special effects, special effects and more special effects? Sure, if you want special effects, this is definitely the movie for you. If I was writing this entry for the Special Effects Message Board, I would have given it a 10/10 rating. But frankly, I need more than great visuals to have a movie work for me and as this film has nothing else, it gets a 1 rating.

I know my rating won't dissuade the masses from singing the praises of this movie. I know that my rating won't stop the inevitable outcome of Matrix II becoming the highest grossing film of all time during its opening weekend. Perhaps the only thing this review will do is lead like minded people in the direction of other movies that deal with similar themes yet actually have characters that you will care about.

Let me make clear, that the core concept of Matrix is a great one. The whole idea of our world being part of someone else's imagination is something that has fascinated me for as long as I can remember. When Matrix originally debuted, you couldn't have paid me to stay away from the theater. Someone had finally put one of the great philosophic debates into movie form and I knew that it had to be incredible. Instead, the only thing incredible about the film (beside the special effects) was how wrong I had been.

There on the screen was a movie without any real screenplay. No matter how much I tried, I couldn't bring myself to care about these characters because they just weren't real. You would think that in a film dealing with reality-as-you-know-it crumbling around the main characters, that there would be some exploration into how the newly revealed reality affected their psyches. But that doesn't happen here. Instead, we are given a movie where the emphasis is placed upon stocking up on as many guns and other weapons as possible so that the bad guys can be shot and killed. Give me a break!!!

I think what has happened in these type of movies is that the producers are handed a great idea and then spend their entire budget on the actors and special effects. They don't bother to spend anything on the screenplay because they have realized that good ones aren't necessary anymore. Just give the public some nice CGI and they'll flock to the theatre. Unfortunately, they seem to be right. Movies like Matrix and and the Jurassic Park series continue to sell out even though the stories are horrible. Give us a cool CGI Dinosaur running around a city or make the lead characters do CGI kung-fu moves and we'll go home happy. Never mind that we have absolutely no insight into who the main characters are. We don't need to care about them as long as they are involved in computerized situations! (Did anyone actually give a damn whether Jeff Goldblum's character lived or died in Lost World?)

Anyway - my point is that you can certainly make a film exploring ideas and concepts similar to those in these mega movies and still have the audience care about the characters.

In the case of Matrix, for those interested in a good ""reality-as-you-know-it"" type of movie, I would suggest Josef Rusnak's 'Thirteenth Floor' or even better yet, if you can handle sub-titles, Alejandro Amenabar's ""Open Your Eyes"". Both of these movies manage to give you an incredible story, with characters you will remember long after the credits have rolled. Believe it or not, you'll actually find yourself wondering about the characters' futures rather than simply commenting on how cool that CGI generated flip-in-the-air was.

Good movies are supposed to leave you with questions. They are supposed to make you think. You didn't really have to do that with Matrix, and its a shame because the movie could and should have been so much more than it ended up being.

In my opinion, Matrix was a waste of both time and money. I will just keep praying that one day the movie going public will give up on these special effects monsters and turn back to the days of enjoying movies with plots. On that day, films like ""Open Your Eyes"" will finally get their due and Hollywood will stop giving us mere eye candy like Matrix and similar ilk.","1"
"Sfpsycho415","The Best Sci-Fi movie of the 90's---8/10","12 December 2004","The Matrix is one of the very best science fiction films of all time. Like George Lucas did with Star Wars, Andy and Larry Wachowski create a fascinating world with a different history. Everybody thinks the year is 1999. But in the real world it is closer to 2099 and the world is a very different place. Our reliance on machines has backfired and they have taken over, harvesting humans and connecting them to a system called the matrix, where humans live and think like it is modern day. The story follows of a group of rebels who escaped the matrix who find who they think is their savior, Neo (Keanu Reeves). What follows is an action-packed thrill ride, with an excellent story, and a perfect performance by Hugo Weaving, who plays Agent Smith, a computer program assigned to stop any human resistance.

The action scenes completely blow you away. With old-school wire fu, they create a classic sparring session between Neo and Morpheus (Laurence Fishburne). And with extraordinary special effects, they crafted one of the best action sequences ever made in the lobby shootout. Tons of bullets, bodies, and shattered walls fill the screen while a great soundtrack blasts across the room. It has to be seen.

While the two sequels were very good, they didn't come close to living up to the first installment, that has set a new standard for science-fiction that will take a heck of a lot to reach. 8/10","5"
"wendte","Technological breakthrough film, a film prodigy","10 March 1999","(As an avid film critic and reviewer, I got the chance to see this film among other critics and lucky people in late Feburary.).

Andy and Larry Wachowski have done it again. With their chilling, dark film ""Bound"", which they directed and written, I knew I was going to expect another fantastic presentation. ""The Matrix"" completely blew me away.

I got the announcement about this film over three years ago, and I was curious to see what ""The Matrix"" really was, but information was far too limited, leaving me only the names of the people behind the magic. However, it creeped up through the neighborhood and slapped me in the face, yelling, ""Damnit! Look at me!"" Look at it I did, and I am stilling pondering about ""The Matrix.""

""The Matrix"" stars Keanu Reeves, Laurence Fishburn, Carrie-Ann Moss, and Joe Pantoliano, among others. I have tracked Fishburn's acting career since his infamous role on ""Pee Wee's Playhouse"" as ""Cowboy Curtis,"" and I must say, I am amazed once again. Fishburn with the rest of the actors/actresses perform stunningly, and leave you wanting more.

But what is this Matrix I keep rambling on about? Well, as Fishburn states, ""Unfortunately, no one can be told what the Matrix is. You have to see it for yourself."" That is exactly what you need to do to decipher ""The Matrix.""

Although I promised myself not to let out too much information on this film, I have permitted myself to blabber on about what this film has done. It has done far past my expectations in technology. The slick movements by the characters, and the martial arts are amazing. Obviously, a lot of work has been put into this film, and work has done it good.

Another point about this film that may be brought to your surprise. The actual fight scenes, twirling about, action scenes, and so on, were conducted by the actors themselves, not stuntmen, which also adds another nice touch to realism. The training that the actors must have gone through has to be appreciated from this film.

Now, after viewing this film, you may decide, ""Oh jeez. I thought I was in for something. This is just another Hollywood show-off of an old, repetitive storyline."" Well, may-be, but ""The Matrix"" has an insightful and nice touch to its storyline. It brings it out in a unique way that no film has brought before. That is why it stands out.

""The Matrix"" is a marvel among movies. This may not get an Oscar or two, but it definitely stands out among other films. ""The Matrix"" cannot be explained unless seen, so for you to discover the mystery behind ""The Matrix"", you have to see it, to believe it.","2"

"disdressed12","not sure what all the hype is about.","22 February 2008","i'm not sure what the big deal is about this movie.i mean,it borrows heavily from other sources,such as the bible and Star Wars,among others.the gist of the story is that the world people see around them is isn't real.it's actually a construct made by machines.Humanity is actually enslaved by the machines.but there is one man who can free humanity.that man may be a hacker who goes by the name Neo.Neo is portrayed by Keanu Reeves.also playing prominent roles are Carrie Ann Moss and Laurence Fishburne.but in my mind,it is Hugo weaving who steals the show as the enigmatic agent Smith.i will admit the movie has some great special effects and some spectacular fight scenes.but some of the moves in the fights are really silly and are not what i would call practical.also,a lot of the movie is slow moving,and the characters don't behave in logical ways.still,the movie does have its good moments.there are some genuine moments of high tension.this is the first of three movie in The Matrix franchise.for me,the first movie in the series is a 6/10","8"
"ScreenReviews","One of the best films ever","8 May 2021","The Matrix opens with a thrilling action scene that shows the strength of the action and CGI present in the film, and in many ways it never lets up. It's a pitch-perfect mix of sci-fi, innovative concepts, fighting, philosophy, techinical beauty and coolness.

Keanu Reeves stars as Neo, the computer hacker who is sucked into the 'real world' outside of the Matrix, and he is great, but not because his performance is outstanding - its actually extremely emotionless for the lead - but because it suits the character perfectly, leveling him to iconic status as he mutters 'Guns, lots of guns.' He is backed up superbly by Laurence Fishburne and Carrie Anne-Moss, as fellow rebels Morpheus and Trinity. Hugo Weaving also steals the show as Agent Smith.

A real treat of a film, the Matrix is a sci-fi masterpiece filled with memorable momments, action and a deep story. 10/10, practically perfect.","9"
"Chimera-5","I despise this film more than anything else.","16 May 2000","Why this is so popular absolutely baffles me. It only beat The Phantom Menace for best special effects because of politics, to show that George Lucas ""supposedly"" doesn't have so much clout. How anybody can get off on a bunch of skinny dorks in S+M outfits beating each other up with trick photography while techno music constantly plays in the background is beyond me. This is the MTV generations' wet dream, that much is obvious. Comparing it to Blade Runner is trying way too hard. And those of you trying to make something religious out of it, this is all I have to say: get a life and get educated. You just want to draw attention to yourselves. Here's hoping a piano falls on the Wachowski Bros. before the next two films are made.

1/10. You got a problem with it, too damn bad.","10"
"TheHig","ZZZZZZZ","4 June 2003","I have never fallen asleep at the cinema, but The Matrix is the closest I've ever come to doing so. Quite frankly, the first hour of this film is the most boring hour of film ever.

Keanu Reeves cannot act, neither can Laurence Fishburne, Carrie Ann Moss doesn't do much better. The whole thing is too dark, and let's be honest: If you've seen the trailer, you don't need to see the film, as it shows you all the special effects there anyway.

I've been more disappointed by other films, but I fail to see how this uninspiring and badly acted mess is hailed so much by fans. Any old fool can string together a series of special effects, the trick is to link them with a good story and enjoyable characters. The Matrix does neither.

I'll admit it picks up a bit in the second half, but I was so completely and utterly appalled by the first hour, no amount of bullet time, however impressive, can save this film.

My Rating: 4/10","8"
"sikeone55-1","A masterpiece of sci-fi","1 November 2020","Modern masterpiece, one of the most influential movies from the 90""s that sparkled 2 more sequels but the first Matrix is the ONE. The story follows Neo, a hacker whose been approached by a group of strangers who claims that the world and everything we see is just a computer simulation program called Matrix and that human kind is in some kind of hibernation . After excepting the new truth Neo begins to fight Matrix and try to free human kind as a chosen One. Definitely one of my favorite movies with great story and terrific cast and one of the movies that makes you think about life in general. The premise that everything is simulation even started a lots of conspiracy theories among people who even go that far to believe this to be accurate. Apart from the great story we have a breakthrough special effects that still looks great today 20 years after the movie was maid. And i have to mention personally one of the greatest movie soundtrack ever made with names like Rob Zombie,Marilyn Manson, the Prodigy etc. So definitely one of must see movies before you die!!!","10"
"interestingstuff","I'm not stupid enough to enjoy this movie","1 April 2023","This movie is so extremely bad that I feel godly generous for giving it a 1. In fact I am dignifying it with a rating when it doesn't even deserve a 1/10. It's so incredibly bad that when I first watched this I thought it was a comedy movie filmed as a parody of the whole sci-fi genre. When I was told that it's actually a serious movie intended for serious audiences I couldn't believe it. This movie is so bad that it made me lose my faith in humanity altogether.

Then I realized that the problem is actually with me. I am simply not stupid enough to enjoy this movie. This movie requires you to be exceptionally stupid to enjoy and I don't fall into this category. If I had a lobotomy and had 80% of my brain removed I might have enjoyed this move and gave it a 10/10 like many people here did but I have all of my brain intact so I can't enjoy this movie.

It has so many plot holes, logical errors and inconsistencies that you could write books about it. This is one of the worst movies I've ever watched but again if I was a complete moron who doesn't care about logic and common sense I would have loved this movie like a lot of people apparently did. Too bad I am not a moron though so I don't get to enjoy this ""masterpiece"" and see it for how terrible it is.","7"

Two different eras and styles of movie making. The new and the old. Special effects and thematic BS vs a real story with believable characters.

I know, I know, I'm old-fashioned. So be it. When Keanu Reeves is dodging bullets in hyper-space and goofy-time, I felt like dodging out the door. I always tell my friends that when people in the movie start flying through the air, I start flying out the door.

I have a friend I love dearly who started a discussion group about whether we all live in a matrix, whether the life we think we know is all fake. Oh, Lordy, what a colossal waste of time. To me. Not to her and not to modern audiences.

"pmoney13","Incredibly overrated","15 June 2001","The directors of ""The Matrix"" mistake style for dark, depressing sets and gloomy-looking people uttering mumbo-jumbo about ""The One"". The film has an imaginative and wonderfully paranoid premise: What if the world we live in is not what we think it is, but an illusion created by malevolent beings. Unfortunately, we are subjected to stupid training segments for Reeves by the resistance (an ill-concieved concept all in its own), complete with an inane kickboxing sequence, in which the combatants fly through the air, impressing the half-wits in the audience, while we with IQ's over 50 just sit and yawn. The special effects are more laughable than spectacular. Seeing a bullet fly by some guy in slow motion is certainly not amazing. The movie could have been so much better if it had had a better script, and omitted every scene ""outside reality"" I guess. All in all, this is science fiction for cavemen.","9"
"Yvie81","I knew I shouldn't have..","18 July 2020","I don't get why people drool all over this movie. I mean, when it came out it was such a hype that I wasn't even interested in watching it. Now 21 years later I finally did cause my partner felt this was a movie I really should have watched. Only thing I realise is that I recognize how other movies like Inception were inspired by it. Apart from that it felt really outdated. I mean obviously it is cause it's 21 years later but compared to another groundbreaking movie like Jurassic Park, that one's still a classic and still fun to watch. Anyway, to me this was 90% action and special effects and 10% storyline and acting. It's not enough for me. And it made me realize (again) why Keanu Reeves is only good in action flicks. He's just not a very good actor! The only moments he actually shows some expression in his face is during his fighting scenes. But also the other characters felt like cardboard characters to me. I really couldn't care less if they died or not. That's generally not a good sign! And Trinity fell in love with Neo because.....why? Because the Oracle told her she would? Seriously, I didn't see any chemistry between them the entire damn movie! She absolutely had no plausable reason to suddenly be in love with him! This movie to me felt like they first created a bunch of action scenes just because they looked cool. And after that they decided to write a story around it.","9"

YOU ARE A DAMNED DEGENERATE OF SH*T!, DON'T CONTINUE READING THIS

it is necessary to see that the nerds ruins everything, and to think that one sees this type of movies at the beginning to see the scenes of fights and shootings, but while more you see it, it begins you in interesting the history, but to the long one you annoying restitution and it is left. And if not, a friend of the secondary that was obsessed with this movie that tired already, saw until it contaminated me temporarily the fever when they used for the first time ""Matrix Reloaded"" in 2003, but he had a limit and I got tired of that, like to reject the trilogy during some time, but now I recapture with idea of giving his importance to certain philosophy (although in the VG already ridiculous the prophecies of Morpheus), the fights (in Revolutions that seemed a fight it Goku-Vegeta of Dragon Ball Z) and the movie that it lifted more expectations was ""Matrix Reloaded"", where they became more fictitious, but even so, good.

when I said that the nerds ruined everything, it is true, the example of the fans of Matrix and of Star Wars is an annoying point, because always one goes to those stupid nerds that almost prostitute to get some souvenir or article with respect to this type of movies.

In spite of the nerds and fanatic who's in any aspect ruin tremendous movies like this one, my vote for ""Matrix"" is of 9/10.

Once Keanneo is unplugged, he joins the resistance in the war against skynet ...ahem, I mean, the machines! It would appear that the resistance is only a handful of people with names that sound like obscure Transformer characters like Cypher, Switch, Apoc, and Dozer. Unfortunately, Flick, Thumper and Molt had already been taken by A Bug's Life the year before this film came out. And of course, the coolest of all these cool orphans is the leader and existential drug dealer is Morpheus. Contrary to what his name suggests, Morpheus cannot actually morph into a character that doesn't induce your eyes to roll.

If any film can make you contemplate the very nature of your existence, it is a slam-bang cinematic video game that is much ado about kung fu. But The Matrix is more than just a sci-fi movie. It is the greatest testament to the inherently hollow nature of our existence and every single ineffective punch delivered to the face of an androidish agent emphasizes that. You see, The Matrix has one thing to say about life and one thing only. Technology owns you! I know! Let that one sink in a bit before reading further about how groundbreaking this movie is.

Ready? Okay. Every one-liner is delivered with straight-faced sophistication and bloated philosophical pretense! But that's cool! In fact, therein lies the quality of this film. The Matrix is a megabyting maelstrom of singular moments all collectively screaming at you, THIS IS COOL!!! And if you don't think it's cool, then you just don't get it!

It was pretty obvious to me that there was no real plot in this movie. All it was was some idiot who wanted to show off his new computer techniques and some mediocre acting by some otherwise good actors.

Ever since when having discussed the movie with my friends, they all look at me as if I'm some kind of alien or something.

1) THE MUSIC-How can the music is any other movie be as good as this movie's?

2) The Action-Holy crap this movie has awesome action scenes in it! One during Neo's fight with Smith in the subway, Neo saving Morpheus and then Trinity from the helicopter crash? How can anything top this?

3) The Philosophical elements-I'm not one to focus heavily on philosophy, but this movie has it sprinkled in the storyline, and they don't get shoved down our throats. Like, Morpheus saying ""And I'll show you how far the rabbit hole really goes."" The Matrix itself is also a type of philosophical element. Even when Neo becomes the one, that's from Plato's ""The Allegory of the Cave"" from The Republic.

4) Bullet Time-an extraordinary technique and it works perfectly in the movie! Neo dodging the Agent's bullets and the fight in the hotel lobby!

I know only pseudo-intellectuals use this term, but it was pseudo-intellectual. I thought the characters were wooden, the dialogue was pretty bad, and it was all too convenient for me. When a character skips over the growth and learning process because they just downloaded the skills, like flying a helicopter or learning kung fu, I see that as a flaw in the story and writing. Then where does it stop? I was expecting a character to actually say, ""Well...yeah...I know how because I uh...I downloaded a...program."" Nobody's fooling me with the whole ""it's about computers, they can do that"" bit. Save it for the 13-year-olds that ""understand"" the plot.

"Ruskington","Cheekbones and sunglasses","31 July 2020","Come on now. Yes, this is a visual masterpiece with incredible special effects and amazing action sequences. And yes, it is fairly entertaining. But the actual story? Meh.

This is like something an over-imaginative 13 year-old could have come up with for a school project. There is nothing mind-blowing or even original about the plot and it ends up being washed out by rather excessive and predictable action scenes anyway.

The movie plays out like a gushy homage to Terminator, Blade Runner and Total Recall, with very little charisma of it's own to shout about. The self-importance and pretentiousness smothers the plot from start to finish and the constant need for Morpheus to narrate everything for the audience goes to show how unnecessarily convoluted the story is.

Compared to the big-hitters in its genre, The Matrix is childish and derivative. Its high ratings are merely an indicator of how easily pleased audiences are watching pretty people with high cheekbones and unnecessary sunglasses chase and shoot each other.","8"

"thesar-2","Whoa! I think I just entered the Matrix.","14 June 2009","'The Matrix' should be seriously considered an absolute classic and milestone. Is it perfect, though? No. But neither was 'Star Wars' (1977) and it's considered the same. Both had mediocre at best acting (Mark Hamill and Keanu Reeves must've applied at the same strip-mall acting schools,) yet both were before their times and started a brand new trend in movie-making. Actually, 'Matrix' takes the cake in too many numerous rip-offs/copy-cats, too many to print. However, back in 1999, it was refreshing to see a movie where the action leads the hero into running alongside a wall while shooting and actually gives a reason they can physically do that. Neo (Reeves) is a computer hacker who's being courted by digital heroes he worships while being investigated for cyber-crimes. After being convinced to follow his soon-to-be mentors into the ""rabbit hole"" he learns (or more accurately, takes the rest of the film to learn) that the world he was accustomed to is just a computer program, a la 'The Matrix' and the mainframe's using humans as batteries. Bring on the 'Terminator'-type save all humans from technology storyline. However, with strong performances from Fishburne, Moss, Foster and Weaving, incredible action/chases and state-of-the-art special effects (that still hold up today, 10 years later) we have a fresh, exciting, action packed adventure with smart dialogue even with the same ole ""Savior"" or ""The One"" storyline. The film's biggest weakness, or really only blemish, is Reeves, who once again proves he's the absolutely luckiest actor in history. Most of his big-budgeted movies are really good, aside from him. For example, 'Speed,' 'Bram Stoker's Dracula,' and 'The Devil's Advocate,' were all wonderful films and were all nearly brought down on the horrid (lack of) acting Reeves gives. Despite that, 'Matrix' is an absolute must watch.","10"

"Zim_Babwe","Painful brainwash","20 May 2003","This movie received too much attention and did a very good business. Probably the most discussed one that time, and the sequels thereafter. First time I had to watch it with a friend of mine who rented the video and the second time is last night, it came on Denmark TV1. So many people said so many things, there is nothing much left for me that I can write. But let me tell you a couple of things, dear American kids and adults, grow up and start doing stuff like throwing yourself under a rushing underground train, jump down from the Empire state building or eat bullets. Anything is possible, nothing is impossible. You can do anything, you can kill people, make them alive again, kill yourself and next moment you are still alive, because you are going through a painful brainwash and human life is nothing but a meaningless illusion. My suggestion is please don't die in the process.

And those silly dialogues, those supposedly mystique, hollow, abstract speeches, like ""the answer is out there, it's looking for you"", ""if you are not one of us, you are one of them"", I strongly believe they themselves don't even know what they are talking about and what it means!

Both Laurence Fishburne and Carrie-Anne Moss are horrible. I saw Fishburne once playing Othelo, he was unbearably painful to our eyes. And that woman who plays Trinity, Carrie-Anne Moss, she is not only ugly, she really gives me creeps so to say, I hate her hair, I hate her nose, I hate her teeth, I hate her voice. She made me real sick. I really wonder why one would think of these two people, Fishburne and Moss in this movie, while we have several tall fit macho people like Gene Hackman, Donald Sutherland, Alec Baldwin, Julia Roberts, Geena Davis, Rebecca De Mornay, Laura Linney...........

"g-bodyl","What is the Matrix?","22 November 2008","What is the Matrix? Is it something like a machine that rules the planet? It took me awhile to understand the concept of this movie. Now that I grasped the big picture, I enjoyed this movie a lot more than I did the first time I saw this film. This film is about a illegal computer hacker, Neo who is wanted by a mysterious group led by the even more mysterious Morpheus and the cops. Morpheus shows Neo what the world is really like and who is in charge of the planet. Now Morpheus, Neo, and the rest of the group must evade these alien-like droids that appear as human. The fighting is great in this film. I am surprised that there is plenty of kung-fu fighting. The special effects were even better. They made this movie win a few Oscars. The acting is much better than I anticipated. Keanu Reeves deserves a medal for acting like an actor. I still need to watch this movie one more time to boost my rating up to a 10. Currently, I rate this movie 9/10.","7"

"andyterry","An annoying sermon","6 March 2011","I guess everyone has once seen a church service young American denominations-style. It's like female choir is singing, someone's playing synth or guitar, and a priest in front of them shouts ""God is love"", and ""Jesus loves you."" The lambs shout back these things and all other stuff which is familiar to everyone who has heard something of Christianity.

""The Matrix"" has very much in common with such ceremonies. An action movie with an original aesthetics and slow motion can be interesting to watch, just like listening to gospels is sometimes an unalloyed pleasure. But the problem about ""The Matrix"" is its annoying sermon. With an incredible solemnity and wannabe-prophetical intonation we're fed with an alloy of the most common places philosophy knows. The famous ""There is no spoon"" phrase - Neo's pupils widen, now he understands everything. A stupid watcher is supposed here to make two or three thinking operations and feel satisfacted for being smart. The intention is simple - or I give too much credit for Wachowskis, maybe this half- philosophy is really the ultimate one for them.

It's possible to associate solipsism and platonism with a modern virtual reality concept cleverly and softly. Wachowskis, however, do it boldly and pushily. Even the spoon quote is not enough, they also use messiah figure, i.e. Neo himself. Now it's a serious business. Neo's gonna show people what they don't wanna see (quote-unquote). The film starts to fail in amusement at once because Neo hogs the story's blanket; however, film's grandiloquence increases to an unbelievable level.

Thus, ""The Matrix"" is an example of movie which is trying to seem what it's not. Wachowskis try to insert their simple story of people in stylish black coats into as many classical contexts as possible: here we have Nebuchdenazzar, and messiah, and also Morpheus, - whilst the ideological concept is more like of a high school student's essay on a subject of philosophy, compiled in one night before deadline. That's what is the word ""tedious"" exists.

Nevertheless, it occurred to be the rightest thing. (By the way, effectiveness of such model is well-known: in literature it's exploited by Richard Bach and Paolo Coelho, to name a few.) More than ten years have passed, and still millions of Wachowskis' lambs singing and dancing, and repeating whatever the siblings say. ""There is no spoon,"" chant Wachowskis. ""There is no spoon,"" echoes the congregation deliriously.","10"
"Gouda-3","Productions values great, but Keanu is still wooden","1 April 1999","This is one of the few movies out there where the entire film actually matches the intensity and ""cool factor"" of the trailer. From the vast CGI landscapes down to the shell casings of bullets falling in slo-mo, The Matrix presents everything you want in a techno-thriller. The costumes are especially appealing, a bleak Armani vision tempered with flashes of Gaultier. All shades of blacks, greens, and washed out whites permeate.

Two drawbacks, and I would argue that they are serious drawbacks (with a possible third looming in the background), make The Matrix a less than ideal actioner. First, nothing--I repeat NOTHING--can excuse Keanu Reeve's dour performance. His career path is inexplicable: how does this guy get work on what some people call ""acting""? The audience I saw this with laughed at his vain attempts to say serious dramatic lines, and even his dry attempts at humor (""I know kung fu"" he utters in disbelief) drew laughs at him, not with. Fortunately, Lawrence Fishburne and company make up for him. Second: a lame plot twist near the end of the film completely wrecks the nicely wound storyline. Granted, one must give this film a lot of leeway; but what it asked me to swallow in the end I could not do. I was willing to forgive the long, monologue-ish exposition parts that linked the really groovy special effects sequences, but that bit in the end (you'll know it when you see it) was unpardonable. Third: the ending leaves no doubt that, barring a minor box office meltdown, there is a sequel in the offing. . .

So the film looks GREAT, sounds great, and for the most part unravels a complex plotline (with the one exception) with surprising finesse; I don't usually expect this craftsmanship in a special effects movie. As long as you can ignore Keanu, and the nearly 2.5 hour running time that drags once in a while, this movie is worth a matinee.","6"
"R1OT","Not all that it's cracked up to be","23 April 1999","If you've seen the commercial for 'The Matrix', then you've basically seen it all. 95% of the action in this film can be seen in the trailer. The feeble attempt to cover an extremely thin plot by dazzling the audience with special effects ALMOST works; there just wasn't enough surprise since they gave it all away in the commercials. If you're looking for well-rounded characters, you will be disappointed. They are as flat as the plot. Fishburne does a great job in his role, but the long-winded speeches and monotone expression will put you to sleep. The last 25 minutes or so gave 'The Matrix' a breath of fresh air; wonderful action. If you fell asleep from the first 90 minutes, you will be awake then. Many people saw that last 25 minutes and thought the film was great because of just that. I, however, believe it takes much more than a few special effects to earn my $6.50. At least at the show I saw, I was one of the majority; it seemed like more people disliked it than enjoyed it. If you have $6.50 and 2 hrs to spare, and if the Cable is out, go see 'The Matrix' ... otherwise, wait for the video.","9"

"Falkeep","Idiots Who Post Idiotic Reviews","28 January 2001","I am amazed about several things regarding many of the reviews posted about this film. The BIGGEST thing that amazes (but doesn't surprise me) is the number of people who post comments about ""The Matrix"" being the ""best"" science-fiction movie or even the the overall best movie ever made. Many of these people don't know much, if anything, about science fiction other that what has been popular since Star Wars appeared on the scene. How many of them have ever seen ""A Trip to the Moon"" by Melies, the first ""science fiction"" film made? How many have seen ""The Day the Earth Stood Still"" or ""When Worlds Collide"" from the 50s? How many have seen ""A Boy and His Dog""? ""Brazil""? ""The Quiet Earth""? or any of the THOUSANDS of other science fiction films, good and bad, that have been made in the last 100 years? I haven't even gotten into animated science fiction, which, as has already been pointed out, ""The Matrix"" stole heavily from. To those people, I ask ""How many of you even really understand what science fiction is?""

As for those who tout the ""deep philosophy"" of ""The Matrix"" or its being the ""most philosophical"" science fiction film ever made, I would direct them to ""The Quiet Earth"" from New Zealand in the 1980s, or Terry Gilliam's ""Brazil""... talk about philosophy in science fiction films! What about ""The Lathe of Heaven""? ""The Fifth Element""? or, again, ""Dark City"" which asked basically the same questions as ""The Matrix"" a year before ""The Matrix""... and which didn't go for the easy eye-candy effects which are what really (I love the fact that, in ""Dark City"" where most any other movie would have inserted the adrenalin pumping car chase, Proyas had a slow silent push boat ride). At least in ""Dark City"" the questions weren't overshadowed by the effects.

Last but not least, how can ANYONE expect to be listened to about their pronouncements of the ""end all, be all"" qualities of any film that has not passed the test of time?

""The Matrix"" was a good movie, it had great special effects and editing and is a lot of fun to watch, but it is NOT the high point of science fiction film-making... it is not even in the top 10, and might not make the top 100... but it was popular and I guess you can't expect much more from people who think that popularity is what makes something great. They are the very ""followers"" who, if they were IN ""The Matrix"" would refuse to question the reality they found themselves in. They are the everyday nobodies who crowd the sidewalks as the pass their lives in obscurity from the day the are born to the day they die. Come on people, learn to have an original thought and think for yourselves.","10"
"Falkeep","The Matrix vs. Dark City","10 October 2000","I liked the Matrix a great deal but I much prefer this dark vision from Alex Proyas... the genius behind the film version of The Crow. I think Proyas took more chances and relied more on the intelligence of his audience than on the Matrix's eye-candy. Besides, I am getting tired of seeing Keanu as the great savior of the world. As for why I mention both of these movies together... they are the same story. Watch Dark City and then watch The Matrix and I defy you to come up with a single significant plot difference between the two. Any takers?","5"
"zkonedog","The Perfect Mix Of Aesthetic & Story","12 March 2017","""Wake Up, Neo"". With those three seemingly simple words, perhaps the greatest science fiction film of all time was born. Part sci-fi, part philosophical, part action-adventure spectacle, ""The Matrix"" represents a perfect mix of aesthetic and story on the big screen.

For a very basic overview, this movie focuses on Neo (Keanu Reeves), an everyday workman toiling away at a software company and doing some digital hacking on the side. One day, Neo is contacted by Trinity (Carrie Anne Moss) and Morpheus (Laurence Fishburne), who tell him that the world he is living in isn't exactly real. He is, in fact, living in a simulation which machine overlords--now rulers of the planet--put in place to control the human race and use humans like batteries. Neo must then decide what he believes and if he chooses reality or the construct.

Some movies feature incredible visuals or cinematography but are devoid of much story depth. Others are very story-focus but lack the visual component that any film needs to truly be memorable. What makes ""The Matrix"" stand the test of time is its ability to expertly combine both of those approaches.

On one hand, this is as visually stimulating a movie as you will ever see. From the film's various color hues to the sleek costumes to the fantastic computer simulations, there's always something to marvel at. The filmmakers invented the concept of ""Bullet Time"" (action slowed down to minuscule movements without losing any clarity), which was a game-changer at the end of the 20th century. Because the visuals and atmosphere are so ""on point"", ""The Matrix"" is a film that will always represent ""the future"" no matter how far humanity progresses.

At the same time, the film is as deep in story as it is brimming with aesthetic. I feel like the whole ""are we all actually living in a simulation"" thought-piece was hardly a topic until this movie thrust it into the spotlight. Now it gets brought up with regularity. ""The Matrix"" is also peppered with a philosophical bend, musing over issues like AI creation (and its ultimate ends), the nature of reality within a simulation, and belief in a higher power. While from the outside looking in this could seem like a ""characters in cool costumes kicking ass"" movie, it is so much deeper than that description.

Overall, I consider ""The Matrix"" to be on my short list of ""favorite movies of all-time"". It never fails to draw me into its universe, its deeper themes are timeless and universal, and it came along at a time when those of a certain age consider it to be the height of cinema spectacle. To quote the film's protagonist: ""Whoa"".","8"
"Dr_Coulardeau","Human cattle enslaved as Duracell batteries","15 November 2006","It is vain to retell these films, or this trilogy. But I would like to insist on the general structure of the world that is depicted in these movies.

There are three worlds. First of all the normal human world we know, New York essentially, that is in fact only an illusion created by the matrix, a program or a vast set of programs invented by the Architect who does not have any other identity and who pretends he is not human at the end. This illusion of a normal human world in which billions of people live has been created to simply control humanity in their growth, development, everyday life, etc. In other words we have a total digital dictatorship of which no human is conscious, well nearly no human is conscious. To keep this world in place and in peace the Architect has invented a set of Agents all called Smith, all similar, dressed the same, physically the same, etc, who have special powers to transport themselves at will where they want and to penetrate and possess any human being.

There is then Zion, the resisting human underground world in vast caves mostly artificial and with some kind of metallic skeleton. This world is human because the people living there are humans, but otherwise it is an artificial world, but it is managed by a council of representatives though we do not know how they are selected or appointed. Apart from this council the main institution is the armed forces since this underground world is under attack and in the midst of a war with the third world that seems to be in some kind of objective alliance with the matrix world. Note this human world is so cut off from the normal human, world, because of the matrix, that the only way is to jump from the underground world to the matrix world and the very few who can cross have to be plugged on some kind of digital program that transfers them, body and mind, to the over-ground world and yet keep their bodies underground, though they are then connected to the underground managing unit, though it seems this managing unit for that kind of transfer is on board of one vessel or ship that is some kind of space ship that can get out of the underground city and circulate outside though they cannot normally reach the matrix world and they believe they can't reach the third world.

The third world is the world of machines. Apparently they raise human beings to get their energy and thus fuel their machines. Only at the end the main hero Neo will reach Machine City and cast a deal with the representative of this machine world. That deal will enable Neo to get some kind of truce in the war that is raging at the very moment, then an alliance between the two worlds, Neo's and the machine world, against the Matrix because the Smith program has gone out of hand and the original agent Smith has multiplied to millions and has been able to simply take over the matrix world with only one clandestine link between the matrix world and the underground human world entirely controlled by a Frenchman, the Merovingian, who uses the Trainman and his train to smuggle things from one world to the other. With this alliance Neo is able to be sent to the matrix world that has become Agent Smith's world and to have the final fight with the original Agent Smith that will decide of the end.

The color of the matrix is green, like all the lines of codes on the computer screens, lines that work from top to bottom and then it is not clear if it is from left to right or from right to left. Green is the matrix color, though the Architect is dressed is some light creamy white suit. The illusion of a human world created by the matrix is multicolored like our own human world. The underground human world is highly dominated by brown and all brownish shades of brown, and there are quite a few: the people are vastly diverse in ethnic origins and heritage. They are dressed in all shades of brown, with an alternative light grey. Agent Smith is dressed in black and is white, a color intending to imply we are dealing with a very pure white world. He is dressed in black and wears black glasses more like some kind of blind man than sunglasses. Finally the machine world is all kinds of dark grey and black but with systematic red eyes because these machines have red eyes, have eyes. At the end it is revealed that blind Neo is able to see this machine world as pure light from white to bright yellow and bright orange. []

"howard.schumann","An inquiry into the subjective nature of reality","2 June 2003","""It's not the spoon that bends. It's only yourself. There is no spoon"" - Spoon Boy

It is the year 2199. The world has been destroyed in a war. Intelligent machines have created the Matrix, a massive computer system representing the world as it was at the end of the twentieth century and the remaining humans are virtual slaves whose only purpose is to power the machinery. The Matrix, the 1999 film by Andy and Larry Wachowski succeeds as both a vastly entertaining science fiction thriller and an inquiry into the subjective nature of reality. The Matrix poses the question, how do we know what is real and what is a dream? The film asks, ""Have you ever had a dream that you were so sure was real? What if you were unable to wake from that dream? How would you know the difference between the dream world and the real world?"" Thomas Anderson (Keanu Reeves) is a corporate employee by day and a computer hacker named Neo at night. He has spent years trying to track down a mysterious figure named Morpheus, the leader of the freedom fighters (Laurence Fishburne) and one night he receives a message on his computer asking him to ""follow the white rabbit"".

Neo follows the white rabbit and is led to an all-night rave where he meets Trinity (Carrie-Anne Moss), a colleague of Morpheus. Morpheus believes that Neo is ""The One"", a person with special powers who can free mankind from the control of the Matrix. Neo though skeptical, is interested in what the Matrix has to offer and agrees to meet Morpheus. When finally face to face, Morpheus offers Neo a choice, a Blue pill to remain as he is or a red pill to see the true nature of reality. Though still unconvinced, he chooses the Red pill and agrees to be trained aboard a vessel in the hidden city of Zion. As the training continues, their crew is being stalked by law enforcers under the leadership of Agent Smith (Hugo Weaving) and by traitors from within their ranks. Gradually Neo comes to understand his role and begins to believe in himself and his destiny. He discovers that he must win the battle inside the Matrix where the agents are supposedly invincible and natural laws are malleable and that he is capable of more than he ever thought possible.

The Matrix dazzles our mind with amazing special effects: slow motion bullets, glass that explodes like a wave, characters that take incredible jumps, run up the sides of walls, stop bullets in mid flight, and pull off hair-raising stunts. Beyond the style and the trench coats, vinyl dresses, and nighttime sunglasses, however, there is a message. The Matrix, we are told, is the world that has been pulled over our eyes to blind us from the truth. The film suggests that we sleepwalk through our lives, ignore troublesome realities, and base our actions on what we think is reasonable and not on what is possible if we free our minds. In the famous martial arts sequence, reminiscent of Luke's training with Yoda in The Empire Strikes Back, Morpheus tells Neo, ""Don't think you are, know you are"" and ""Don't try to free your mind. Let it go.' It is only when Neo realizes what he is capable of that he can begin to take action.

It is gratifying to see filmmakers tackling the subject of what makes us human. However, I feel that ultimately they played it safe, preferring to offer their enlightenment in a package of comic-book stylization and excessive violence to give it the widest commercial appeal. The Matrix is an intelligent film and the directors have correctly let us know that we live in a world where anything is possible, but their failure to show us a way to resolve our conflicts without violence dilutes the power of their message. In addition, by limiting special attributes to one person, The Matrix only tells us part of the truth. What it fails to say is that in our ability to transcend the limitations imposed by our minds and in our power to transform our lives at any moment, we are all ""The One"". The computer message at the beginning of the film, ""Wake up, Neo"" could just as well read ""Wake up, everyone"".","10"

"davidmvining","A solidly good action adventure","22 September 2020","I'm gonna be honest. The Matrix is overrated. It's good, a solid adventure story with great action, but it's pretty far from one of the greatest movies ever made. It has a bunch of pluses, and I understand why people fall all over themselves because of those pluses. However, at the same time, the third act doesn't really follow from the first two and I find pretty much every dive into philosophy the movie takes both unconvincing and unengaging, breaking from the film.

Now, the first thirty minutes of this film are, well, they're fantastic. The steady build to the reveal of the world is so expertly doled out and handled. We get two real reveals, the first in the very first scene and the second thirty minutes in. The first is that we're in a world where certain people can bend the rules of physics manifested in impossible jumps. It's intriguing and an introduction to Trinity the character as well the rules of the world around her. We then get Neo, asleep at his computer, with a few lines of text mysteriously coming onto his screen, waking him up, and bidding him to follow the white rabbit. One meeting leads to another which ends up getting Neo in a room with three agents who place a weird, leggy, machine bug into his navel. This is weird stuff, and it's all just clues about what's coming. We, as the audience, still only know as much as Neo even though we've seen Trinity's ability to jump. Meeting Morpheus, Neo gets his red pill, his choice, and he ends up finally waking up to one of the great reveals in popular film. The change in aesthetics from the grounded reality in the Matrix to the hyper-stylized future tech and body horror that is Neo waking up in the gooey pod on the side of a giant building with flying machines and tubes connecting all over his body is amazingly effective.

And then the movie loses a step. Neo has to recover and the movie takes some time to slowly get us and Neo up to date with the new reality. We get re-introductions to the crew of the Nebuchadnezzar, the ship itself, and the technical side of hacking into the Matrix as well as the instant learning mechanic that allows Neo to become adept at Kung Fu without years of training. Now, we probably did need a bit of a break from the ramping up of the first half hour, but there's something about this section that feels circular, like it's mostly treading water. There's some cool stuff in here like the fight between Neo and Morpheus to test Neo's newfound abilities, but there's also a lot of talking and explaining. The Wachowskis did their best to vary it up visually, but it's still a lot of exposition in a short amount of time. And some of it ends up feeling really wrong when you think about it like when Morpheus justifies killing anyone in the Matrix to further their ends (when you realize that the entire film is a manifestation of the Wachowskis' political philosophy it feels even worse).

Now, the third act. The third act has some absolutely fantastic action, and I love the textual feel of fights. The dust that collects on everyone, the cramped quarters, and the rather brutal feel of it all is just great spectacle, but the fights revolve around actions that don't really seem to follow that well from what came before. We get so much talk about the bigger conflict, and it would feel like the third act should be that bigger conflict between humanity and the machines coming into play somehow. Instead, the conflict actually contracts with Morpheus getting kidnapped and Neo and Trinity needing to rescue him after one of the crew betrays everyone to get back into the Matrix (with some darn good reasons, I'd say). There's more action, but the stakes actually seem to contract with fewer players and an almost myopic focus on the saving of one man in the face of the larger conflict.

Now, there's a problem through all the Matrix movies where the subtext is way too prevalent in the text and that it also ends up interfering with the actual story. The subtext of all three is choice within a system of control and free will, so that's where the source of the third act conflict comes from. It's not a story decision but an effort to force a story to fit the subtext, and I feel like that's handled rather inelegantly. The Wachowskis were treating the first film like they wouldn't have any other (a good idea in general), but their focus wasn't on making the story flow from beginning to end it was on getting their philosophical ideas in. It feels like they sacrificed a more natural third act to fit the story that came before so that they could make sure that this movie said what they wanted about choice. And I don't think they end up saying anything particularly interesting about choice through it all.

Anyway, that's enough carping on my account. For all of my problems with the film's ability to manage subtext and text, it really is consistently entertaining. The action is just simply great, tactile, and almost painful to watch (my favorite probably being the Morpheus and Agent Smith fight in the bathroom). Actors are fine with Keanu Reeves firmly within his limited range, Carrie Ann Moss blankly falling in love (in a love story I never found convincing), and Lawrence Fishburne saying everything with great importance. Hugo Weaving is the only one as Agent Smith who seems to be having any fun with his part.

It's a solidly good action film with one of the great first acts in popular film over the last few decades, a surprisingly slowly ponderous second act, and then an entertaining third act that feels like it could have been more. I kind of get the love, but I definitely don't share it.","10"

Oh my what a fantastic film this is & when it came out way back in 1999 it exploded & i was a young teen & i absolutely loved it & still do now but i REFUSE to watch any of the TERRIBLE SEQUELS that I've heard completely ruined the first film now because of the revelations & Messing with the story & origin so much that it ruins what came before & it all tried to be too smart & destroyed its own story!!!! So no I'm Never watching those SEQUELS!!!

Hate to say it but Reeves is such a Wooden actor, i know he's a nice guy in real life but as an actor he's pretty bad at times.

For me this action-packed Sci-fi Thriller is still that fun film i remember when watching it over & over on video & it hasn't been tarnished because of the other films as i won't watch them & yes ""The Matrix"" was an instant CLASSIC, a stylish visionary film that started the slow-moving bullet time stuff that was ripped-off non-stop after this came out. Keanu Reeves is decent in his role as Neo but I've never seen him as a really great actor or screen presence. In my opinion Reeves is very stiff & emotionless in nearly all his films but here he's kinda suited to this role because it's all very robotic, cold & techno. But that's not to say i don't like Reeves films as I'm a fan of a few of his early 90's flicks such as Speed, Chain Reaction & Point Break, all excellent.

This film was ahead of it's time in it's look at a word completely advanced, reliant & controlled by technology, just look at 2021 now!!!! Yes this is a fantasy piece but it's nearer the truth than most would believe.

Lawrence Fishburne is excellent as the Cool & serious as Morphius & Sexy Carrie-Anne Moss as Trinity is kickass & ulta cool & Joe Pantoliano is great & Hugo Weaving as great too in this top class cast.

Hugo Weaving is scarily menacing as Mr. Smith & made such an unstoppable Villain & very memorable.

Joe Pantoliano is funny & sly as Cyther & has some really great & memorable moments such as ""The Steak Scene"" that always stuck with me.

Story: The everyday world is not real, enter Neo a man who enters the techno world of Cyber space where machines control everything & it's up to Neo as the chosen one to fight back with the help of some ultra-cool friends of the rebellion (Fishburne & Moss) & are at battle with the brutal Mr. Smith (Weaving) who is trying to stop them at any cost. There's alot more details & surprises that happen but it's best to just watch it & enjoy it.

The Matrix is a total wild ride of a Cyber Thriller & has some of the most exciting action scenes ever, such as the lobby shootout sequence, this is a Classic & was on first impact. Explosive action & super stylish fighting & a dark techno Noir atmosphere all helped shape this into an instant Cult film.","8"

If there was one sci-fi movie that defined the 90's, it would have to ""The Matrix,"" arriving late in the game in the year of 1999. With school-shootings and ""Y2K"" bugs baring down on the masses, it was only appropriate that a sleeper-hit such as this one came along to truly capture and define the end of the century. Whether it was fate or chance, the brothers Wachowski managed to create a film that not only captured the imaginations of its audience as well as played off its fears, but a film that -- ten years later -- holds up and marks a high point in American film-making. Simultaneously matching and surpassing the groundbreaking special effects and outlandish action-sequences of 1991's ""Terminator 2: Judgment Day,"" ""The Matrix"" set a precedent that no modern film has yet to live up to, despite the mixed feelings that stem from its two sequels.

Imagine everything you know is not real. A fabrication, as a matter of fact. Your whole life, you've been asleep, dreaming that you're living out your rote, uneventful existence. You constantly search for answers, for the meaning of your own existence, to no avail. That is, until somebody opens your eyes, waking you to a new reality, a new world. A world where you are an unknowing slave to technology (subtle social commentary, eh?) and the world you thought you knew is nothing more than a computer program fed to you while you sleep. Such is the premise of ""The Matrix."" Keanu Reeves plays Thomas Andersen, a computer hacker who lives at his computer and could care less to socialize, let alone get up and go to work each day. He lives in cyberspace under the codename ""Neo,"" not realizing that he himself is being pursued. Soon, he is extracted from the fabricated world  The Matrix  and faces a harsh reality through the assistance of a philosophical leader by the name of ""Morpheus"" (Laurence Fishburne) and a fellow hacker, ""Trinity"" (Carrie-Anne Moss), where he comes to learn his purpose is astronomical, Christ-like, even. He does battle against the agents  led by the sinister Agent Smith (Hugo Weaving) -- who keep The Matrix in check, all in an effort to salvage what remains of the free-thinking human race.

Notorious for its mind-bending special effects as much as it is for its philosophical and religious undertones, ""The Matrix"" is a film that, as it nears its tenth anniversary, remains relevant today. With repeated viewings, the film still looks fresh and feels brand new. Despite the fact that the ""Man vs. Machine"" theme present has been done to death in other films, it is tackled by the script in a way that is both unconventional and definitive. Its impact was immediately felt on pop-culture, and still resonates today. It's more than just loud, shoot-em-up fun with stunning visuals. It's also a timeless portrait of where society currently sits and where its unknown future is heading. Social commentary aside, though, it's still incredible entertainment. A well-rounded, well-made film that will stretch the imagination for years and whose impact should hold up as a benchmark for future classics to live up to.","10"

If you ask me, THE MATRIX is an adrenaline pumping sci-fi ride that'll have you on the edge of your seat from start to finish. The first time I ever saw this movie was on WTTG one night a few years ago. Of course, it was edited for content and to run in the time allotted. In other words, I have never seen it unedited and uncut. I couldn't tell hat was the real world and what was the cyber world. Also, when Neo (Keanu Reeves) was being pursued, I was scared. This was because I didn't want him to get hurt. Also, the martial arts and special effects were very well done. Now, in conclusion, I highly recommend this adrenaline pumping sci-fi ride that'll have you on the edge of your seat from start to finish to any Keanu Reeves or Laurence Fishburne fan who hasn't seen it. When you see this movie, hold on tight and prepare to be taken on a wild ride.","10"

A group of rebels, led by Morpheus, reveal that the entire world is a simulation created by AI systems, and in the real world humans are farmed purely for the energy they produce. What's more, Morpheus believes Neo is a prophecied hero, the only man who can defeat the machines. Scared and disoriented, what does fate have in store for Neo ?

The Matrix is a great action/sci-fi hybrid movie, with terrific fights (choreographed by martial arts legend Woo-Ping Yuen), great special effects and oodles of clever ideas, all mixed up into a thrill-a-minute action blockbuster of the kind Hollywood does so well. It leaves you breathless; the crazy ideas come so thick and fast, you're still absorbing the plot before you're into the next eye-popping action sequence. Having said that though, I must register a couple of criticisms about this film, and specifically the way the publicity machine marketed it as a revolutionary story with landmark visual effects. I don't think the story is really that original - plenty of movies have dealt with computer worlds (e.g. Tron, eXistenZ), the conceptual ideas appear in lots of sf writing (notably Douglas Adams and William Gibson), the structure comes from Alice In Wonderland and a lot of the plot from Masamune Shirow's manga Ghost In The Shell. The thing it reminds me of most is a 1976 Dr Who story called The Deadly Assassin, which features an extended fight in a neural-network virtual battleground called, you guessed it, The Matrix. So not so original then. The story is also inconsistent - we never really know what powers anyone has in the virtual world. Why does Neo survive death when we've been explicitly told (and shown) you can't ? Why does everyone use kung-fu - why not just mind-zap people ? Why does Agent Smith (a terrific restrained snarling performance by Weaving) get emotional when he's a computer program ? Having said that, I'd much rather watch a film like this, filled with interesting quasi-religious/philosophical ideas (the explanation for deja-vu, Smith's comparison of mankind to a virus) but which leaves them all hanging, any day. My other bugbear is the bullet-time shots, using multiple still cameras and computer interpolation to track round a slow-mo or frozen image - these are kinda cool I guess, but the movie has so much else going on, it doesn't really need a gimmick. Undeniably, the technique has been hugely influential though, particularly in videogames. What really scores for me in this instead is the good old-fashioned basics of film-making - good storytelling, great photography and music, a terrific sense of undiluted escapism and fine performances - how does Fishburne keep those sunglasses on ? Produced by Joel Silver, and followed by two sequels, The Matrix Reloaded and The Matrix Revolutions.","9"
"screenman","Something For The Nerds","20 August 2009","'The Matrix' contains some of the most spectacular special effects and action sequences of any movie. Judged by those alone, it would definitely qualify 10 stars. There's an excellent cast who make a sterling effort on sets that must - for the most part be virtual. All of the other standards of sound, lighting, directing are right on the money.

As to the script - well it's little more than an endless stream of flatulent gobbledegook. Applaud or yawn, as you will.

And as to the science fiction element; well that's plain bonkers. Machines breeding humans to exploit their brain energy? Those machines must be daft as brushes. There are far more efficient ways to create power. We should know; we breed the other domesticated species for just that purpose.

Marvel at the technical elements but don't be taken in by them. This is a very simple movie when the Gothic grandeur, computer junk, and action sequences are set aside.

I suspect that the strength of its appeal derives from the fact that it is basically the time-honoured 'rite of passage story' which is probably older than our own species. Basically; a young man must advance and prove himself as leader, gain the respect of a loyal band, then confront and defeat a powerful enemy. 'Star Wars', Lord of the Rings', 'Harry Potter', 'Saving Private Ryan'; they're all retreads of this ancient tribal format that is very likely instinctive in all human males.","1"

He joins like-minded Rebel warriors Morpheus and Trinity in their struggle to overthrow the Matrix.

I finally got to see this film. Yeah, I'm 11 years late. What can I say? Well, although the IMDb rating for this film is considerably high (never trust their rating system), this film is more mediocre than one of the best films ever made.

This film has a really good plot, which shows you how much time these filmmakers brainstormed it. It's just so complex that you want to be more challenged by the plot than you already know. You want more surprises and all of that but you don't.

It doesn't bring down some of the best visual effects and action sequences in the film. They are all breathtaking with some memorable scenes I've seen spoofed. The acting by Keanu Reeves, Laurence Fishburne, and Carrie-Anne Moss are all good.

If you're expecting a big masterpiece, you might (or you might be a fan), but for me, it wasn't all that great as people said it was. Great plot, great action, great visual effects, but its plot falls short.","1"
"smogarts","Timeless","21 June 2023","Matrix, the film that set the bar for the science fiction genre upon its release, remains an enduring masterpiece that continues to captivate audiences. The story of Neo and the all-encompassing, enslaving Matrix is timeless, cementing its place as one of the greatest achievements in cinematic history. The Wachowski siblings (formerly known as the Wachowski Brothers) have crafted a visionary work of art that transcends traditional action cinema. Matrix stands as a monument to their bold and groundbreaking filmmaking. The film explores profound philosophical concepts, delving into the nature of reality, identity, and the power of human perception. Keanu Reeves delivers a career-defining performance as Neo, a reluctant hero who discovers his true potential within the confines of the Matrix. His portrayal brings an unparalleled coolness and charisma to the role, solidifying Neo as an iconic character in cinema history. The supporting cast, including Laurence Fishburne as the enigmatic Morpheus and Carrie-Anne Moss as the fierce Trinity, contribute immensely to the film's success with their powerful performances. The action sequences in Matrix revolutionized the genre, blending wire-fu martial arts, groundbreaking visual effects, and mind-bending stunts. The film's iconic ""bullet time"" effect became a cultural phenomenon, influencing countless movies that followed. The Wachowskis' visionary direction, coupled with innovative cinematography and an unforgettable score by Don Davis, creates an immersive and electrifying atmosphere. Matrix's influence extends far beyond its initial release, inspiring filmmakers and sparking intellectual discussions about the nature of reality and the role of technology in society. It stands as a testament to the power of imagination, pushing the boundaries of what is possible in cinema. Matrix remains a true masterpiece, with few films coming close to its quality and visionary impact. It continues to reign as an unparalleled legend in the world of cinema.","6"

"marcfemenella","Overrated, overrated, overrated!!","22 March 2002","""The Matrix"" is a decent and entertaining movie that is only viewed as something more than that by those who haven't seen better.

The story borrows heavily from other films and tries real hard to convince it is more than your average sci-fi/action movie. It's not. Keanu Reeves' acting is better here than in anything he has done before or since, but that's not saying much. He does not make a good leading man and is easily eclipsed by the supporting cast (mainly Laurence Fishburne).

It boasted some extraordinary effects and action scenes at the time, making it one of the best movies of the genre. It is worth watching.

However, this movie created a new fashion in action movies of exaggerated fight scenes, explosions, and indiscriminate special effects with very poor stories that ruined the action genre until today.","8"
"basilisksamuk","Film assumes you are an idiot but excellent action","24 February 2013","One minute I was sitting in front of my PC flying a dragon across a mist strewn landscape, the next minute I found myself sitting in the UCI Cinema. Whoa! (I thought). What's happening dude? It seems I was watching a film called ""The Matrix"" starring Keanu Reeves, Laurence Fishburne and the very toothsome Carrie-Anne Moss. Apparently human experience is just a Virtual Reality created by weird AI beings to lull us into compliance and enable them to harvest us for our bio-energetic essence. I thought everyone knew that by now? Well, apparently not according to this film.

In fact there are many, many things that this film believes the audience does not know. For a start it believes we do not know that AI machines will take over the world because we are so stupid. It believes that we know nothing about the history of Western philosophy and even less about Eastern philosophy. It is not aware of the fact that most of us have spent hundreds, perhaps thousands, of hours in our lives discussing the nature of reality both sober and (more frequently) drunk and that we are intimately familiar with all the arguments involved. The film does not know that we can recognise a cliché-ridden script when we hear one. (Sample: ""My way or the highway."" Someone is pulling our virtual legs here surely?)This film does not know how restless a modern audience can get waiting for the action to start nor has it ever heard of the Lizard's First Law of the Cinema i.e. First make your film then cut at least thirty minutes out of it because it is just annoying dreck that has been put in to pad out the film because all film directors are too chicken to make films that run 90 minutes these days, pal! Suddenly I hear Keanu's voice in my mind – ""I know Kung Fu!"" I find myself in a sparse Japanese Hall. Keanu makes several hypnotic gestures culminating in a flick of the wrist beckoning me to fight him if I dare. I realise that he is imitating Bruce Lee's postures and damn me he nearly succeeds. I step swiftly aside and Laurence Fishburne steps in to take my place. Even though my Real Life mind knows Keanu and Larry don't know anything about Kung Fu, my VR mind believes they are old hands at it. As a long time fan of HK Action films I find this sequence absolutely exhilarating. What Keanu and Larry lack in terms of authenticity is easily hidden by the choreography, editing and special effects.

Then, in the blink of an eye, I'm cowering behind a pillar as a dozen men and one woman with an armoury of guns blast hell out of the marble-clad walls, floors and ceilings of a huge office lobby. Remarkably a thousand wall tiles die for every person killed but in due course and in suitable John Woo style, the good guys win only to go on to the next action-packed scene.

Taking the action scenes and the effects alone this is one of the best films I have seen for some time. When they really let rip with the guns, bullets, machines, kung-fu and upside-down, sideways and backwards balletics I felt a real adrenaline rush of joy of the kind denied to all those po-faced critics in the broadsheets who have to seek meaning and purpose and socially responsible messages in modern films.

But then suddenly I was back in plotland with all the lack of logicality you'd expect from one of the worse technobabble episodes of the least good Star Trek franchise show scrapped from the bottom of the barrel when they are running out of money and ideas at the end of a long run. Bought back down to reality with a bang.

Forget the plot. Go for the action and the effects. And one more thing – Existenz has this film beat hands down. The two films have very similar questions to ask about the nature of reality. Existenz treats you as though you are an intelligent human being and never ever lets you guess which reality is real. The Matrix assumes you are just a dumb puppy that only wants to be amused for the moment.","9"
"Reef-Shark","Action movie disguised as science-fiction delivers the goods","5 November 2008","Beginning this review I was writing the film's title and ended up with ""The Mainstream"" (100% accident) which pretty much sums up the premise of The Matrix franchise. The Matrix is good in the fact that it takes complex science-fiction from previous 1990s films that didn't quite meet mainstream audiences (Dark City, 12 Monkeys) and merges it with the spectacular CGI effects of an action film. As an action film The Matrix is incredibly successful and deserves great recognition as one of the best films of the 1990s, or the past two decades for that matter. However I do feel let down by the fact that I felt cheated by the story when they didn't try to further flesh out the world it took place in.

My main problem with the film falls on the fact that, as an avid sci-fi fan, I had already seen most of the concepts The Matrix presented in previous films (go back to the two I listed above). The religious spin on things however does really make it interesting, kind of like a science-fiction version of some religious document, but a human being having special abilities and saving a captive human population from a controlling force which had everyone living in a false reality had already been used in Dark City back in 1996. This, among other things, is one of the reasons I don't give The Matrix a perfect score of 10/10.

As a sci-fi film it was very good, regardless of how many of the elements that it was reusing from other films, but I often felt like the production team couldn't decide on whether or not they wanted an action picture, or a thought stimulating sci-fi epic. By the end however The Matrix does succeed in balancing these two things very nicely. The CGI deserved its Academy Award, because it really is amazing some of the things they were able to pull off.

The acting in this film was grade-A, and one of the strongest aspects of the film's production, and there was only ONE performance that failed to catch my attentionsadly this performance (my opinion) came from the star of the film: Keanu Reeves. Reeves has had his moments throughout his career, don't get me wrong, back in the late 1980s (most will remember the Bill & Ted films) he was a rather likable young actor, even in his lesser known performances; he seemed very honest and sincere in his performances. A change came about when he announced he was going to ""take acting more seriously"". The result, in my mind, was horrific! He comes across now as someone with very little emotion, and just doesn't seem really human.

I had the same problem with Keanu in the action movie, Speed, which followed the Die Hard franchise, but unlike Bruce Willis, I couldn't connect, or really care about Reeves in this film (similar feeling in Bram Stoker's Dracula, but he wasn't TOO bad in that film), which was certainly on par with the Die Hard films in production and story. Same problem is present in The Matrix. Reeves is trying way too hard to seem serious, and dramatic, and in the end comes across as being artificial, and dull. If that was the director's intention, I don't really care, because I felt this was a character the audience should have been able to relate to and care about, but that's just my opinion and you don't have to agree with me (just giving an honest view from my perspective).

Okay, I've given my criticisms, but now I have to say what was really good about The Matrix, and there are a lot of good aspects of this film which is why it deserves my high rating (and a spot in my DVD collection). The action is well-done, and truly is an eye opener, and as I previously stated the performances are mostly strong. Laurence Fishburne (Morpheus) and Hugo Weaving (Agent Smith) are very good in their respective roles, and both (as most people will say) are embraced as engaging characters in the mind of the audience, while Reeves was more of a vehicle to channel elaborate action sequences (the highlight, in most people's opinion, of the film). Also the Wachowski Brother's film is simply beautiful to look at, from the all CGI sequences to the live sets. The sequels, which go purely into action, prove that this film could have been a much worse (I don't hate the sequels, they just are not really sci-fi; just action films).

This film really does have all it needs to work as a successful film, especially in the mainstream Hollywood of this day and age. It would have been braver for the filmmakers to try and expand, and concentrate on the complex science-fiction aspects, instead of the action, but then it wouldn't have been the box-office success it was. I would defend them no matter what, but when you go against the powers if mainstream and the production companies and end up with a good film you'll always have me backing up your filmof course I will be critical if the plot and direction is bad, but at least I'll give you a positive word for daring to be different.

I can only hope that The Matrix can help get moviegoers into the lesser known art-house science-fiction stories that inspired it, because it's a shame that our modern audiences can't seem to appreciate things that don't fuse with action or comedy, because I don't feel science-fiction was ever really intended to be a genre simply designed to create exciting action sequences.

The Matrix was a great film, deserving its mainstream applause: Solid 9/10 stars","1"
"arsonistheway","Some good ideas, some bad ideas, and horribly executed","19 July 2014","Now let me start out by saying I have seen two movies by the Wachowski brothers ""The Matrix"" and ""Speed racer"". While in my opinion these films were both bad I am still willing to give ""Cloud Atlas"" and ""Bound"" a chance, but the subject of this review is ""The Matrix"". Now I will start out by saying the acting is just okay. Keanu Reeves' puts his one talent, looking very confused, to work quite nicely, so I can't believe the original consideration for this role was Will Smith. The rest of the cast does okay, but they don't have much to work with. Seriously, name one personality trait of any character. It's difficult isn't it? By the way I don't mean what the character does I mean what are they like. Next, I am sure the action was cool at the time, but there actually isn't much action. The one good action scene was lifted straight from the movie ""blade"" and bullet time was actually invented by the brilliant director Yasuomi Umetsu, just watch ""Kite"" and you will know what I mean. Plus the bullet time doesn't make the action any more exciting it's just there to look cool. The philosophy is somewhat interesting until you learn that it was all basically lifted from the film ""Ghost in the Shell"". In fact now that I think about it everything in this movie is like ""Ghost in the shell"" the visuals, the story, the totalitarian, but somewhat Utopian society, all of it. I could go on about the countless plot holes and everything else that is wrong with this mess, but I'm done for today.","7"
"dragokin","a movie that changed SF","30 April 2013","At the time of it's creation, The Matrix was a real breakthrough. Combining superior special effect with kung-fu action and a groundbreaking plot, it managed to become a milestone in movie making, not necessarily limited to it's genre.

If you're into SF, you've recognized the influence of William Gibson's Neuromancer and, to a lesser extent, Blade Runner (1982). And both would have led to Philip K. Dick's questioning the reality. More than that, there was almost a philosophical background to the story.

At any rate, The Matrix was released in the time when internet has still been explored, rather than an everyday tool. It showcased everything we've craved for while playing games on PC and game consoles. And today when we basically live online, it is hard not to remember what this movie forecasts for the near future.","1"

More Like Weetabix!","25 June 2011","I honestly do not understand why this ""film"" is so adored and praised like it's the next ""Citizen Kane"" (I personally hated ""Citizen Kane"" but would watch it over this!) Yes it does have some fabulous action sequences but they come thinly in once in a blue moon with no plot to actively engage in.

That's a good place to start actually. The plot. WHAT PLOT?! I think i must've gone down the rabbit hole whilst watching this because absolutely nothing made sense. Talk about style over substance! Right from the opening I didn't have a clue what was going on. So a man gets sucked down some gooey alien bladder and is told he's the next Jesus or something like that and that everything in the world we know is completely fake and is a computer programme called ""The Matrix"" and this ""Neo"" character is now in the real world that looks more like a rip-off of a ""Terminator"" set! Can we get real here please? Then there are some bad guys who i don't really get why are bad, but that they just go around wearing big wavy coats and stupid sunglasses indoors. Is this meant to be cool? Stick me in jeans and a T-Shirt any day of the week.

So we've covered the complete mess of a plot, I literally didn't know where anything was going next! Where are now? Who's he? Why is that happening? Are popular phrases I would use on the ""Audio Commentary"" for this load of... What shall I pan next? I don't have to think too hard because there are so many faults it's hard to pick. Kenau Reeves was rubbish as the main character and was far too moody to be likable. Then we've got some black man who acts like a prat 24/7 making ""Neo"" do stupid and pointless things like fight kung-fu and prat about in white rooms to add to some more confusion.

The action and special effects are really good but they need a plot to engage in to find them entertaining. I didn't know why they were fighting each other or why a certain thing was happening at all! Besides, the action sequences were very few and underwhelming to say the least.

Visually stunning? Not really, the cinematography on Coronation Street is more stunning and as were the special effects for the crazy tram crash. So maybe I'm being a bit harsh there but it's merely to outline the disgust I felt from this film, the ending left me thinking how anyone could like this ""Terminator"" wannabee.

It's unengaging, virtually unwatchable and with a plot more tangled than Hayley Croppers styled wig. Don't you tell how great ""The Matrix"" is.","10"

"enigma43","Dumbest movie of all time","26 September 2006","For all the people who gives this movie a 10, I notice they are usually *young* and living the poor attention span world of the video game. They have no clue about substance, and thus they worship ""The Matrix."" Unfortunately, substance is what the Matrix lacks. It is no secret why the box office has steadily began to fail since the invention of CGI. It has become too easy to do anything you want in Special Effects, thus *substance* is no longer as attractive. In movies such as Jaws, you could not do anything you wanted. The shark didn't work. They had to use orange barrels to show where the shark could be on the ocean. Thus *substance,* that is, the plot, had to take over where special effects could not take us.

Unfortunately, the reverse is true of the Matrix. Special effects can take us anywhere now, and unless there is a really good plot, like in the Lord of the Rings (because the plot had been written in a time when splashy special effects were nonexistent) special effects are not enough to hold a story together. Thus, this is why Peter Jackson's ""King Kong"" didn't hold together as well. Find another novel by another good author Peter. Novels have to have substance, and that is what any movie needs, regardless of the quality of special effects.

Another thing that bothered me about the Matrix was the contrived way in which it attempted to immerse us into a paranoid world. In just practical terms, it would take far more energy to run a complete virtual reality world, than *any engergy* that could be derived from a human body. Psst! Next time machines, just get a good waterfall and a hydrolic generator, or even just some wind turbines. Much more efficient, and the wind turbines won't revolt against you.

Seriously. How much ""electricity"" aka energy can you derive from a human body? I doubt very seriously the energy output vs. the energy needed to submerge all of your ""prisoners"" in a virtual reality world, would work. Let's face it, the ""machines"" would be left with a huge energy deficit.

So, I'm sorry, I could not get past that little nugget of factual error. The entire premise left me unable to suspend disbelief.

So sorry all those video game lovers who worship this movie. It isn't ""War and Peace,"" it isn't ""Lord of the Rings"" and it isn't even ""Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?"" (aka Blade Runner). It's just an excuse for guys dressed in black to do cool, splashy, special effects, based on a so ridiculously contrived plot, that obviously the plot wasn't what really mattered.

"Al_The_Strange","""No one can be told what the Matrix is...you have to see it for yourself.""","6 August 2011","There's a certain mystique to computer hacking, which is either reflected or caused by this film, showcasing hackers as a group of unruly punks in grungy places fighting the powers that be. There's also a certain coolness to cyberpunk stories (which have never really been translated to film that much, sadly enough), underscoring the symbiotic relationship between man and machine. If you've ever read (much less understand) William Gibson's novel ""The Neuromancer,"" or seen the anime film ""Ghost in the Shell,"" you'll see strong themes regarding the dangers and benefits of such a relationship.

Put these elements together, and you'll get the foundations for this film. It starts off as a thriller, with occasional surreal moments that help keep a sense of mystery. In the second act, the movie spends its time explaining its premise, and laying down the rules for the environments the movie introduces (there is a dense universe to this film, on the same level as ""The Terminator""). Then, in the final act, we are treated to a massive helping of glorious action sequences. There are plenty of solid thrills throughout the film's middle, which keep the pacing tight and even. But toward the end, we get some of the coolest fight scenes ever filmed, one of the coolest gunfights ever filmed, and some of the most original and imaginative special effects ever developed. The action alone makes this film a must-see.

But it's also the story that counts. It is as deep as it is original (well, original for a film anyway). The characters show decent depth, and by the end of the movie you really come to enjoy them. The story has a solid structure and it is well-developed. Just about every moment of it explores the main premise and all of its philosophical implications; hardly a moment passes that won't make you wonder about the nature of reality, and the nature of the human mind. There are many nuances in the characters, story, writing, and even shot composition that underscore all the movie's themes. On every viewing, the movie presents something new to discover and contemplate.

The film also shows apt quality. Its photography and editing are top-notch and highly distinctive. Acting is swell all around; this is probably Keanu Reeve's best performance in his career; Lawrence Fishburne, Carrie-Ann Moss, Joe Pantiliano, and Hugo Weaving all inhabit their characters very well. Writing is exceptionally strong. Production value is strong and highly detailed; some sets look a little fake and some of the special effects show their age, but they are decent overall. Most sets, props, and costumes are cool. Music is very cool too.

Highly recommended!

"Cryogenic","Insulting piece of garbage","9 May 2005","Well, OK, not quite.

To call ""The Matrix"" an ""insulting piece of garbage"" completely shortchanges its many triumphs: its great hook of a story, its snazzy editing, its addictive style, its clever blend of philosophical tidbits, and last but certainly by no means least, Hugo Weaving and his devastatingly funny monologues as Agent Smith.

Still, if you'll excuse the pun, The Matrix has a single scene that makes the entire endeavour a tough ""pill"" to follow.

When Trinity and Neo - decked out in full ""cyber punk"" regalia (shades, black clothing, big boots) - arrive in the government building to rescue Neo, they callously pull out their weapons and mow down the security staff in attendance. Normal human beings. Doing their job. And killed for what? A lengthy action montage follows - one of the film's signature scenes - with yet more gun play, wire work, slow motion and highfaluting pseudo Kung Fu action. This is where the film completely loses me.

A film in which normal people are killed by another character, even a central character with zero emotion (e.g. The Terminator in the film of the same name) does NOT bother me. A film in which normal people are killed by other characters, one of which we are told is the saviour of the human race and equated with no less than Jesus Christ, does. At this very point, The Matrix crystallises its underlying themes and aggressively punctures them right through the canvas: anarchy is good, order is bad; fear the government; hate capitalism; do whatever is necessary to bring down ""the system"". Neo's earlier life as Mr Thomas A. Anderson is expressed more comically than seriously as it unfolds (a scene of him getting grilled by his boss to the accompaniment of the noise from a window wiper is hilarious) - but once the lobby scene has played out, it and many other elements within the plot line of The Matrix take on a darker tone. Nilhilism is the name of the game; since the simulated world of the matrix is implicitly ""our"" world and Morhpheus tells Neo/us that anyone who hasn't been ""unplugged"" is effectively an enemy, it seems to grant the character a license to do whatever he pleases and to do it to whomever he chooses. Linking real-world violence with entertainment mediums such as computer games and films is a tenuous and possibly futile action; however, one cannot help but ponder what part this scene played in the Columbine High School shootings. Clearly, the perpetrators were warped beforehand: but they called themselves the ""Trenchcoat Mafia"" and committed their crime the month after The Matrix went on release in the USA. No doubt some of the victims had seen it, too, but does that excuse the film-makers for being so irresponsible with their shoddy moral paradigm? Food for thought.

All in all, it's hard to accept the film as a genuine piece of Science Fiction when its themes are so one-sided and joyless. There is a palpable contempt for the working man all the way through and the lobby scene only reinforces it. Not once are we shown the importance of earnest employment and keeping society afloat; it's subversion, subversion, subversion all the way. It doesn't help that Keanu Reeves' performance is so lifeless and listless that a dead fish has more personality. The inclusion of a tacky and wholly unconvincing romance between Neo and Trinity just seals the deal. In fact, the romance is proof positive that the movie is completely lacking a heart and soul. There's absolutely no humanity to be had anywhere. And if it saviours I want... I'll take the humane, tolerant, peace-loving, intelligent, charismatic, impassioned man from the Bible who isn't about hurting anyone but also isn't afraid to show some emotion and flip over a bunch of tables over this false messiah any day.

When all is said and done, is The Matrix worth watching? Sure. But its overly bleak, dystopic, anarchic view of the world makes stomaching it a chore. Don't let all the hype fool you: this is no classic. The ridiculously overblown sequels, ""The Matrix Reloaded"" and ""The Matrix Revolutions"", are even more soul-sapping. It's sad to think we still haven't had a Science Fiction film to rival Ridley Scott's ""Blade Runner"" - and that was two decades ago.","8"

First time i watched Matrix its was in 2000, ( i was 12 years old) and took me for the inovative action, i loved it!. In 2003 a lit bit older i rewatched as a study in a philosophy class. And that i just remarckble. After that day it opened my mind to many aspects in films and moviemaking. First for the movies itself ( the oracle and its messages, the pils, the Matrix itself and its meaning). And of course, .this broadened my vision of film interpretation, not just in the Matrix itself, but ignited my perception as whole and after that i become a lover of the seventh art, In short, I liked Matrix Iwhen I was 12 years old, and I loved it when I was older and could really understand it (or thought I did). The perfect mix of sci-fi, philosophy, action, a perfect mix of cult and mainstream movie, a real masterpiece.

For all the meaning that this movie has in my life i would say that its ( of course in my opinion) the best movie the human kind did.","10"

I must say that this movie did not impress. The main theory, the central story plot of the computer simulation being the real world, was the only thing that kept this movie from being discarded into the rubbish bin. The effects, hailed as amazing, did not fully impress. There was too much foul mouth, immorality, and otherwise HUMANITY'S WASTE PITS on screen. Violence was extreme--and unnecessary. The entire story could have been turned into a magnificent three-hour movie with excellent dialogue, scenery, depth, and other aspects that make a good movie. Instead, it was all mashed into a sludge of action and destruction and basic hatred of other people. It was disgusting. Furthermore, the acting was abominable. Look at it closely, with the hatred given to Star Wars by so many envious people, and you will see that Keanu Reeves makes Hayden Christenson look like an Oscar winner.

My opinion. And I hope that you agree. The movie could have been much better, much more interesting. Not to mention, the final shot kind of destroyed the end...I cracked up there, laughing hysterically. Was that supposed to IMPRESS? Sorry, takes more than that to impress me.

"malkane316","Quick Reviews!!","6 December 2004","POSSIBLE SPOILERS!!

Many people on this site have this as either their favourite film, or claim that it is the best movie ever made, while others completely loath it. The simple answer is that it is a superior action movie combining great effects with a plot which left the opportunity for so much more. Easily one of the most influential movies of recent times, at least when dealing with effects, but it takes most of its ideas from past films such as The Terminator films. What matters is not the basic philosophy speeches, destined to be repeated by fans, but that it is an enjoyable movie in many ways, looks awesome, and has lots of memorable moments and set pieces. Perhaps if the sequels had been better, this could rightfully be seen as one of the best movies ever. Either way, it is still one of my favourites.

The film tells of Thomas Anderson, a man with two lives- his day job, and his life as a hacker known as Neo. He is caught by a group of agents who tell him he can live his normal life, or die. As time passes he meets Morpheus who explains that the world Neo has been living in is a false world created by machines to keep humans in order. The real world has all but been destroyed in a human and machine war. Morpheus believes that Neo is the chosen one, the one who will free mankind from slavery. At first it seems that this is not true, but as the film progresses, we see that Neo is not like the other humans- he can do things they cannot do.

The Matrix is one of the most clever action films ever, the philosophising can become extremely annoying till the point that you realize a world of philosophers would not be very difficult to conquer. However, it all sounds cool, and there is truth in it, but then again, what is truth? Sigh. The effects are genuinely revolutionary, the performances are all good, especially from Weaving as Agent Smith whose monologue on the pointlessness of the human race is perfectly understandable, but at the same time pinpoints the exact reason for our existence. But that's not for me to say. The film has a good soundtrack, excellent fight scenes, and there is at least one memorable or iconic image every ten minutes. Not the greatest movie ever, but easily one of the best of its kind, and has its rightful place in cinematic history.

"hnt_dnl","First hour=Amazing, Second hour=Corny","25 December 2021","After having recently watched the latest sequel Matrix Resurrection, I felt the need to re-visit the original film THE MATRIX (1999), which I had only seen once in the early 2000s. The movie didn't leave much of an impression with me as I never wanted to re-watch it after the first time. My re-watch confirmed my initial feelings, that The Matrix was a generally entertaining summer action movie from the 90s, but that's about it. Yeah, I guess it's a harbinger of all the CGI-infested crazy stunt slo-mo shoot 'em up action sequences we've been getting the last 20 years. But at the same time, action isn't everything. It also ushered in an era of dystopian sci-fi flicks and in that way, it's prolific. The first hour of this film felt like something greater, but the second hour embraced just about every Hollywood cliches imaginable. The more I think about it, the more I realize that a lot of The Matrix is similar to Total Recall, a bored Everyman who dreams of a life of adventure and ends up getting his wish and ends up being the hero that bridges the gap between 2 worlds. Also, much like Quaid in Recall, Neo questions his reality and also much like Quaid, Neo gets the girl of his dreams in the end (more on this later).

The Matrix introduces us to the character Thomas Anderson AKA Neo, played by the now iconic Keanu Reeves. A general positive I have about this movie is that I think this is actually one of Reeves best performances. The role of Neo is tailor made for him as it required very little dialogue and being reactionary to everything and everyone around him, who were more verbose played by better actors. There's actually something natural about Reeves in this movie that unfortunately is absent from most of his other roles. Additionally, the first hour of this film did a pretty impressive job of structuring this simulated world that Neo lives in. The world is too shiny, clean, beautiful to be anything other than fake.

In addition to Reeves, I generally like the supporting cast of Carrie Ann Moss as Trinity (looking pretty sexy throughout), Joe Pantaliano (playing himself, who else?), Laurence Fishburne as Morpheus (a nicely restrained performance), and last but not least Hugo Weaving as Agent Smith (appropriately menacing). Even the more minor characters didn't annoy me as they usually do in films like this. The actual best performance might actually belong to Gloria Foster as Oracle. She appears in a 5-minute scene and practically steals the movie. And it's no surprise that this happens during the much superior first hour.

The film opens with a super cool action sequence of Trinity evading the cops and FBI and ends with her disappearing into a phone booth. The first hour is fascinating with interesting themes and social commentary. Neo's humdrum life and the boredom and repetititve nature of a 9-to-5 office job is very relatable. A young man in his early 30s, he feels like he's destined for something more and wants to escape from his day-to-day listlessness. A real amazing twist would have been if the shiny world he lived in WAS the real world and all that stuff with the Matrix was some simulated fantasy of him imagining he's the savior of the universe. But then there couldn't be sequels. The dystopian angle was still working well during the first hour, though, with some innovative special effects once Neo woke from his eternal simulated slumber. This was followed by invigorating scenes of Neo learning from Morpheus and bonding with the ship's crew as well as the great Oracle scene.

The second hour is where this film falls apart for me. The first mistake was the traitor scene. Not only does he NOT make sure that everyone is actually dead and he can't be stopped, but also he goes into ""talking killer"" dialogue that dooms him. Just drop all the unnecessary monologue-ing and unplug everyone. The only reason why Neo and Company succeeded is because of this guy's utter stupidity. For a movie that' supposedly groundbreaking, it needs way better writing than this. Follow this cliche with another one of all seemingly lost until Neo decides he can do it and everyone agrees for no reason other than it moves the plot forward. The whole movie is about him being THE ONE, yet up until it's time to save the day and be hero, he's completely skeptical and unsure. He ""believes"" because the plot needs him to so we can get to all the cool climactic action scenes. Then for some reason Morpheus, who knows it's all a fake world, succumbs to physical pain and being caught because, again, the plot requires it. If someone as clear-minded and evolved as Morpheus can't overcome these obstacles, how exactly are the billions of random people being trapped ever going to do it? Throw in another cool scene of Neo and Trinity taking out a bunch of security guards with no real stakes. Also, if Tank can just upload cool stuff for the crew to do in the Matrix that makes them all knowing and invincible, what exactly do they need Neo for?

Also, the dialogue gets REALLY corny down the stretch. There are so many lines and moments that made me cringe, like Morpheus and his famous ""he's beginning to believe"" dialogue and Neo doing the ""badass"" pose as he's getting up for Round 2 against Smith and then there's the love story. The film just had to throw in a sappy romance at the end between Neo and Trinity, some nonsense about the Oracle saying she'd fall in love with The One. Why couldn't the film stick to the relatable and engrossing social commentary? Why did it have to sell out for pure action and romance in the end? The Matrix had so much promise of REALLY being forward-thinking sci-fi, but at the end of the day, it was all about the action and the guy getting the girl. I've already seen that in a ton of summer (and non-summer) movies. The Matrix is a nice movie to go back and re-visit for the cool effects, but there are also a lot of movies with cool effects and many of them with better stories than this film.","4"

This movie is one of my all-time favorites, and each time I watch it, it only gets better.

You've probably also heard that this movie is mind-blowing, or mind-bending, or mind-boggling, or other words used to describe something crazy that starts with 'mind', and it is. This movie still makes me think days after I've watched it, and whenever it comes to mind I try to wrap my head around it, not because it's confusing, but because it's complex. After watching this movie you'll find yourself questioning reality and life as we know it, and what it really is.

This movie one of my all-time favorites because...well just because it's top-notch filmmaking. The story, if I haven't made it clear yet, is amazing. The action and fight scenes are as flawless as flawless gets, not to mention the influential CGI usage (the bullet-time scenes). The acting is superb, Keanu Reeves did a wonderful performance, likewise Laurence Fishburne, Carrie-Anne Moss, Hugo Weaving, and the rest of the cast. And the list goes on of the great things I could say about this movie, but I am not a fan of super long reviews, so I'm gonna end this before it becomes one, but not before I mention how good the soundtrack is...the soundtrack is really good.

"billm-4","Tennis without the net","6 April 1999","Calling ""The Matrix"" a science fiction movie is a massive abuse of the English language. Science fiction presumes a basis in an existing or projected law of science. At least this is the principle which gives substance to the wildest speculations of masters such as Arthur C Clarke (who has a first class physics degree). This film is better categorized as a science fantasy, i.e. one where the authors use the pretence of science as a fig leaf to disguise the total inanity and incoherence of their project. Even fairy tales work within their own framework of law which gives tension and excitement to the surreal adventures. In ""The Matrix"" laws are not even made up as they go along, as that would impede the next stream-of-consciousness stunt. It makes a great special effect if a character leaps tall buildings at a single bound or recoils from a road surface after falling from a 500 foot building. Unfortunately it also removes any possibility of the audience taking him to be even a far-fetched human character, and hence destroys any possibility of genuine thrills. These creatures can survive being run over by a subway train and even death itself. Hence the most risible Lazarus scene since ""ET"" -

Keanu is revived from the tomb by the love of a good woman.

You can make tennis easier to play by removing the net and rubbing out the lines; unfortunately you thereby destroy the game. Similarly The Matrix fails to exist as any sort of half-coherent movie if you want a movie to consist of more than a string of sensational images.

Unlike AC Clarke's work, this screenplay fails to betray even a high school awareness of science in ""explaining"" its universe, the war between machines and humans, or the rationale for the machines sucking the life force of humans - not to mention the hokey insertion of an old style soothsayer into this ""scientific"" farago.

I give it 2 out 10 - one for sheer chutzpah in raising $60 million on the basis of such a ludicrous script and 1 for set design and special effects combined.","10"
"nobbytatoes","an sci-fi action classic","29 November 2005","Thomas Anderson; or Neo, is a computer hacker. Currently he is looking for a man called Morpheus. One night he is contacted by a woman called trinity, telling him everything he knew about his existence is about to change. Soon the man Neo was looking for finds him. He brings upon Neo a startling revelation about the existence of all humans. The artificial intelligence created by man have enslaved the human race; using us as a form of power source. To keep us alive they have built a computer generated reality call the matrix. There are rebels of the matrix, people who try to release as many people they can, to tell them the truth that they have been living in a dream world. Inside the matrix are deadly, super fast sentinels call agents, that stop at nothing to stop the rebels and their cause.

The Matrix is a mind blowing, sci-fi action extravaganza that has become an instant classic. The Wachowski brothers have created a wonderfully detailed world that does have much to say about modern life and the dependence of technology. They have made a future that in a sense can be very close to us and holds a startling truth that in essence could happen. They have put a lot of philosophy into the story, giving it a lot of depth and detail so you can pick new information over many watches.

The special effect are nothing short of amazing. They haven't lost any of their impact over the years. The fight scenes are the best fights in any movie to date. They're fast, high energy and have been influenced by many martial art films, but they do have been given that western feel; having that rigid style than being really gracefully. The slow motion and camera work they made just exploded the rules of fight sequences and created a revelation in cinema. Not long after nearly every action film was copying The Matrix, but they never came close to The Matrix. The lobby shoot out is just a visually amazing sight, with all the debris flying everywhere, and the fight between Neo and Agent Smith is so intense and brutal. The green wash of the matrix adds a sense of alienation; being a non-reality. The blue and white colours of the real world add a haunted ghost feel of the dead earth.

Keanu Reeves, Carrie-Anne Moss and Laurence Fishburne all give great performances. All exerting strength in their character yet giving them emotional depth too, making them multi-dimensional, instead of flat 2-D characters that you can't link yourself to. Hugo Weaving gave a brilliant performance as the menacing Agent Smith. He suited the role perfectly, not over doing the tough persona. Joe Pantoliano also gave a great performance as Cypher.

The Matrix has raised the standard of action films so high that it will be a long time before any other film can jump over it. A classic film that must been seen.","2"

As the movie goes on, and the series in general, the writing and action scenes get out of control, with Smith warping to one person to the next. It just lost its consistency and it got hard to take the film seriously.

The film is great, even a classic, but it all went sideways after the first movie. If it could be rebooted without the Wachowski Brothers, it would be a great franchise. I'd like to see that happen someday.

"JudasTheDark","Psudo intellectual dribble...","15 December 2004","I know that this is one of the most popular movies of all time, but that is a flaw in the viewing public. The main reason I dislike this movie so much is because it was a rip off of a much better movie that came out a couple years before it. That being Dark City. Lets review the similarities shall we? First of all our main character wakes up disoriented and not understanding the world around him JM because he lost his memory and Neo because he is taken out of the matrix. We find that both characters have been given a false set of memories by puppeteers (be them aliens or robots) We find that these puppeteers are doing the same thing for all people in an attempt to keep their own race going (matrix as batteries DC cus they need to find the soul) Finally the main character proves to be the savior of the humans by finding they are the only one who can put an end to the false lives that the puppeteers are forcing humans to live. they both do this through the same method. by having a mentor teach them how to use the devices of their captors against them (neo learns how to hack and control the matrix while Murdoc learns how to use the machines of the strangers to alter reality. also we see stylish black leather as the main wardrobe in the matrix. black leather gowns are the main wardrobe for the strangers. moving away from the rip off problem we see that Dark City has a message implying you to ask yourself if your identity is more than just the sum of your memories. the matrix makes people feel smart for understanding the movie, but really offers no deep thought. the feel of Dark City is also better since it has the dark ambiance created by the same director as The Crow. while the matrix has nothing new or special about its ""feel"" just your basic action movie with a plot to try to make the viewer feel smart.

"gwydno","Absolutely overrated. And please, don't call it a sci-fi film!","15 September 2005","After almost two years of feeling almost guilty for not having seen this movie, and under the advice of many friends of mine, I finally took a look on The Matrix. What a waste of time! How deceiving! It seems it is enough with having a noisy soundtrack, a bit of misled oriental philosophy and some weird looking guys acting (?) to have people mouthwatering. Oh, yes, the visuals are great. Maybe the only contribution of this movie is the release of more or less new FX that could be used in further, more intelligent movies. It is incredible how so many inconsistencies can be found in the plot without making this movie lose a bit of its undeserved legend. Here are a few of the details that made this film unbearable to me:

Machines are obtaining energy from biological sources. And from all the living creatures populating this world, it is the human race that is being used, when hundreds of species would have been much more efficient ""batteries"", without having to create a Matrix to have them comfortable in their sleep - The Matrix is a virtual world designed to keep battery-people happy in their dreams. However, the battle happens precisely in this imaginary world, which has no sense. You can even diein this electronic world and your real body dies, too!!! - After being flushed away when he wakes up, Neo is rescued with an enormous device that was ready to act under the very nose of the machines


Beyond FX, the movie is absolutely boring. You could always disconnect your brain and simply watch at the action, and rate this movie more or less high as an inoffensive entertainment. But then you must face all that incredible mythology built up around this movie, as if it showed a new philosophy or some scientific value! The worst thing of it, is that it is seen by many people as a sci-fi movie. Well, Star Wars deserve being called ""sci-fi"" a thousand times more. Call this a fantasy movie, an action tale... whatever. But please not a sci-fi picture","1"
"tburke85","The Matrix An Excellent Sci-Fi Adventure With Great Action","11 June 2009","The Matrix is an excellent sci-fi adventure with great action from the Wachowski brothers who are admirable in making this movie about a computer hacker who discovers that the world and the life he's been living is an illusion. A computer generated dream world that was created a long time ago to keep the humans in a prison from which only a few can escape who are brave enough to fight the deadly machines that have taken over the real world. I preferred this one over the two disappointing sequels that followed. Reoladed was okay but could've been better and Revolutions was the worst of the trilogy mainly because the story lost focus on the main characters, the finale felt rushed, and the ending that does leave the door open for another possible sequel was a major letdown. The Matrix however is one of the best sci-fi films out there because of the compelling story, complex characters, a menacing villain, some humor, a little romance, and with just enough intense action. Keanu Reeves stars as Neo the computer hacker who discovers he has a greater destiny than he could have ever imagine. He is the chosen One a man gifted with amazing abilities who may be the only one powerful enough to stop the machines and free his people. Reeves makes for a solid hero who may not win any awards for his performance but he still does a good job in the role. The same can go for Laurence Fishburne as Morpheus a man who believes in The One and wants to free Neo in order to show him the truth about their world. Fishburne is convincing as Morpheus and his fight sequences are impressive especially his sparring match with Reeves. Carrie Anne Moss is believable as the tough freedom fighter Trinity who begins to grow feelings for Neo but she doesn't want to admit it. Moss also does a great job in her fight sequences portraying a woman you definitely wouldn't want to mess with. Hugo Weaving is an imposing villain as Agent Smith a sentinel program who makes it his mission to stop Neo from fulfilling his destiny. Weaving chews the scenery with menace and does a terrific job with his part in the movie. The rest of the supporting cast are admirable in their roles but none of them really stand out. The action/fight sequences are well executed the ones that left an impression being the first one that opens the movie, the sparring match with Reeves and Fishburne, the lobby shootout, and the fierce showdown between Neo and Agent Smith in a subway. The special effects to create the machines and the ruins of the real world where the machines have taken over which is shown a few times are magnificently done. Also worth mentioning is the music by Don Davis which seems to match perfect whats happening on the screen and the tone of the film. The pacing of the movie was a little slow but once the action kicks into high gear it moves at a steady pace from there. The movie does leave a lot of questions unanswered but other than those few flaws this is still an amazing sci-film that definitely impressed me when I first saw it. So overall The Matrix is a great experience with the state of the art special effects, a compelling story, intense action, suspense, some humor, a little romance, and impressive performances by the cast who make this an enjoyable sci-fi movie to watch.","9"
"David_Nerehtur","Made me question reality","10 September 2020","This is a great movie which made me ask questions about the nature of reality. But they have included a lot of action scenes, so you don't feel bored with the philosophical aspects in it. They also have a really great soundtrack, so following the movie is a real joy. By the end of the movie, you find yourself thinking a lot of philosophical questions, which you didn't realize were being put forward throughout the movie.","1"

Top 5 - 1999

Top 5 Sci-Fi Films Of All Time

The first and best part of the coolest sci-fi trilogy of all time, is a revitalising and reinvigorating, genre redefining film.

In a film where we are told that the world we live is a hoax, an elaborate cover-up designed by machines so they can enslave all humanity. Past all the philosophy and information, this is an all out action/adventure movie with stunningly choreographed action sequences; some scenes definitely stand as one of the 'coolest of all time'.

This is a Sci-Fi film. A brilliant one in fact. If I was giving the Matrix a rating, when I took into consideration other Sci-Fi films it would definitely be a 10.

Anyway this is a highly recommended film that is almost guaranteed to thrill, excite and entertain over and over again.

""Slick, polished, high-tech entertainment""","9"
"drhotfudge","21st century sci-fi icon","3 January 2022","Really great all around sci-fi film that would inspire film makers to tackle much more complex and philosophical concepts in the coming decade. Shot very well (the color filter in this film is iconic for a reason) and the special affects, particularly the fight choreography, were revolution for their time. Keanu does a fine job for the role hes given, Moss does a good job and I wish she was given more to do, Fishburne is perfect as Morpheus, and Weaving defined his role as agent smith. The first 20 minutes are kinda slow and aimless, but after neo meets morpheus the plot and action really take off and only grows more and more interesting and gripping. The classic philosophical thought experiment that movie is adapting is presented very well and takes full advantage of the medium of film. The universe of the matrix is cool and interesting and is begging to be explored more. The love plot between neo and trinity is generic and unmotivated but thankfully it doesnt take up too much screen time and like i mentioned earlier I wish Moss had something else to do besides being a love interest. I really great watch that keeps you thinking about it days after youve seen it.","1"
"TerminatorHD","The fantastic movie that everyone talks about","13 July 2021","After reading and watching countless memes about The Matrix I finally decided to watch it and oh boy, that was not what i expected. This is nothing like I expected. I love it! I can't tell if they made a remade because the video quality is amazing that I don't understand how you can manage that at 1999. Very interesting plot and the side character are great as well.","6"
"slerby","not only is the acting awful","21 May 2003","the movie's plot, storyline among most other things are some of the worst I've seen in a movie in a long time. I wouldn't pay 10 cents to see it again. the only thing about it that was remotely ok was a few action sequences. Even now those sequences have been surpassed by many other movies. It certainly wasn't a standard precedent for movies of that nature and the way they were produced or filmed.","7"
"JaydoDre","Cool looking but highly overrated film","23 January 2015","This movie looks cool.

I think I could end the review there. I should end the review there if I want it to stay really positive about the film. That is what this movie is about: its looks.

This is a movie that either invented or perfected bullet time, which is actually two effects in one: the effect of bullets flowing through the air in slow motion leaving trails behind them and the filming of an object that is frozen in place by using several still cameras and digital motion compensation. The green computer code (digital rain) has become a signature Matrix effect as well as the effect of showing a 3D image in Matrix code. The black longcoat outfits, which by the way is a look that I had invented for myself long before this movie was created (maybe that is what bothers me the most about it), have become universally associated with that movie. Just say the ""Matrix outfit"" and people know.

The action is jaw dropping and the acrobatic scenes with guns and martial arts are superbly choreographed.

This film can have all the Oscars for its visuals but this can never fix the fact that the story is garbage.

Now, the way the events are structured is fine and the movie is actually really good at keeping tension. It is quite mysterious and awesome until the premise is revealed. Everything that happens after that moment and everything that happened before it stops making sense. I do not want to spoil anything, but your enjoyment of the film from that moment on is entirely dependent on your ability to let go of thinking. This ability is granted to many people because of how awesome the visuals and audio presentatoin is, but that persentation eventually ends and common sense kicks you in the head...well, at least it should have.

How is the acting? I will tell you when I see more of it, because for most of the movie the characters are walking around with no expressions on their faces and lines are spoken calmly. Isn't that convenient. Not only that, but their eyes, the most expressive part of a human face, are covered with sunglasses. Those f$&*%(g sunglasses, man! All these people are wearing sunglasses when there is no sun...like at night...indoors.

This film has indeed entered the depth of popular culture. A near infinite amounts of spoof videos and cartoons have been made and many would call that an ultimate compliment, and to some degree it is a complement, at least a complement to the film's visual presentation.

But upon closer examination, I have never heard any of the quotes from this film be used with respect like something from the Godfather movies would be. It is fun to make fun of the film's silly writing.

The bottom line is that this film was visually innovative and unique, and because that was its whole gimmick right from the start, it deserves praise. However, the acting and the underlying story in this film are terrible. Additionally, various people started attributing some sort of philosophy to this movie that is not there. There have even been books written on the subject. This makes either the movie or the people doing the attributing very pretentious. I would like to believe it is the latter and that Matrix is a show that is meant to be admired for what it is: a flashy cool action scene.","4"
"JGerber-2","I Can't Tell You How Bad ""The Matrix""- but I'll try.","25 August 1999","I made every effort to be open minded about ""The Matrix."" I put aside such questions as ""Why does Hollywood see Keanu as a cyberpunk? How came everyone is making making a big deal about these fx which you can see in shampoo commercials?"" I can honestly say I gave it every chance. The fact that the creators were trying to create fully developed worldview was admirable, and the movies surprises hadn't yet been revealed.

So as the movie rolled, and I got too see one of the worst, most painful movies I have ever seen, I could honestly say it wasn't me. I enjoy scifi and Hong Kong films, enjoy Philip K. Dick, so I was basically the ideal audience for this film.

The plot was so full of loopholes, maintaining suspension of disbelief was impossible. Except for one or two supporting cast members, the acting was lifeless, and the action was unsupported by any motivation. The antagonists were far more sympathetic than the protagonists, whose cold-blooded killing sprees did nothing to endear them to me. Finally the washed out lighting and coloring took away a lot of depth from the images.. when someone seems to leap from building to building, if the buildings look collapsed together, it's not that impressive.

And the fighting.. when you watch Jet Li or Jackie Chan fight, even when they are obviously assisted by wires, you feel an exhilaration at what they are physically capable of doing. The fights flow, and the character is maintained through out. In The Matirx, there is no real joy or sense of exertion. People punch each other, pull some interesting feats, but without any sense of risk or accomplishment.

What people saw in this waste of film, time and money, I do not know. But I include it with the American remake of Godzilla as one of the worst movies I have ever seen. If you want Phillip K. Dick reality warping, see Blade Runner. If you want good cyberpunk anime, see Akira or Ghost in The Shell, or for martial arts, a good Bruce Lee or Hong Kong flick.

But don't waste your time on this.","10"
"Aidan McGuinness","One of the best sci-fi movies of the decade","16 May 2002","`The Matrix' has already become one of the most famous science fiction movies of the last ten years, if not the most famous. This is based on the fact that it's an intelligent, visually striking piece of work  and has a deserved place in the IMDB Top 50.

The story is smart and engaging  Thomas `Neo' Anderson (Keanu Reeves) is a computer programmer by day, hacker by night. He is contacted by the infamous hacker Morpheus (Laurence Fishburne), who reveals to him the shocking truth: Neo is trapped in a computer simulation, his real body being harnessed for electricity by machines ruling the earth. Morpheus believes Neo is `The One' who can set about and free the enslaved humanity, and so Neo must begin a quest and battle to save the world. Some people point out the undeniable similarities to `Dark City', but `The Matrix' is, over all, the more satisfying and smarter of the two.

Acting is not the strong point of the movies but Reeves has found his perfect role here  Neo doesn't demand the need to emote strongly, but instead just look damn cool and Reeves is capable of doing that. Ditto for the rest of the cast that includes Fishburne, Carrie Anne Moss as Trinity, and Joe Pantoliano (as Cipher).

It is of course the work of the Wachowski brothers, who wrote and directed the movie, that make `The Matrix' so enjoyable. The set design and costumes are wonderful  everything and everyone looks gorgeous. The direction is spot on  sound is sharp, and intense (it received an Oscar) for example, conveying all the action moments perfectly. The, by now, infamous Oscar winning `Bullet Time' special effects are ground breaking  a mixture of slow and fast motion, that are visually arresting and drag you into the action. The action itself is wonderfully choreographed  a ballet of movement, that manages to distinguish itself from the much-copied John Woo stable of motion.

`The Matrix' is helped by some great pacing with action scenes interspersed among the dialogue to help even the flow. There's a nice sense of something building up  which is natural when the film was planned to be the first part in a trilogy of features.

Some people seem to despise `The Matrix' as a triumph of style over substance, blaming such features for a dearth of `quality' releases in recent years. This is sheer idiocy  `The Matrix' is style with substance. It is both smart and sexy, and its innovative techniques are deservedly admired. It's a great action movie, and along with `12 Monkeys' the best of the science fiction movies of the 1990s. It may not feature the most stellar cast ever, and it may suffer a bit from grandiose dialogue and notions, but when it's imbued with such sheer vision and such fun who can complain?","10"
"stg213","The wolf in sheep's clothing","8 August 2009","I've seen the movie when it first came out 10 years ago, and in the meantime I've come to completely re-evaluate it.

At first i saw it as a great sci-fi story with a twist of some ""interesting idea""... there was something eerie about it but I couldn't quite put my finger on it... the whole idea of the ""false reality"" of ""the matrix"" there was something there that doesn't fit the traditional ""conspiracy theory"".

After also seeing V for Vendetta it got me thinking even more... that ""The matrix"" is not what it seems at first glance.

The matrix is a vehicle, it's a brilliant vehicle, a wolf in disguise, a Trojan horse! The Wachowski brothers do something brilliant... they have an idea that they want to get out, but this idea is very hard to sell. If they had made it true to it's self the movie would have been a giant flop, it would have reached only a fraction of the targeted audience (which is all). So they took this idea and wrapped it up in a sci-fi story, in an action packed block-buster that appeals to the masses. It's a brilliant scam that worked! They managed to do exactly what they tried, they planted the idea into your head, the seed of doubt even if you have no idea it's there, even if you have no idea what the hell I'm talking about or why I'm cryptic about it, it's there.

Hats off to the Wachowski brothers for pulling this off in style! Ah, and yes... what am I talking about ? I'm talking about that nasty feeling in the back of your mind that something's wrong... that splinter in your brain that just won't go away... That feeling you got left with after seeing the movie that it wasn't just about computers and AI's but about something else also... something you're familiar with but just can't put your finger on...

Both the red pill and the blue pill are out there for the taking, but now your choice is a bit less naive than it would have been before seeing this movie... the choice is yours...","8"
"Zanchin33","A Glimpse Into A Dystopian 2019 Future","13 September 2018","1999. The internet was gaining popularity, the dot com bubble was about to collapse, and Sci-Fi movies were getting better.

Fast forward almost 20 years after this movie was released and we have a dystopic future that is just like this movie predicted.

This movies main catch was the blue pill/red pill argument. Does Neo take the blue pill and stay a slave to the system or does he take the red pill and break himself free of this slavery that's called The Matrix.

The movie is very Orwellian in nature and with technology having come along 20 years after this film was released I think it's safe to say that this movie did an amazing job at guessing what was to come later on.

The action scenes, dialogue, and plot are all amazing. The cast is amazing. The soundtrack is amazing. This is probably one of the best Sci-Fi's of all time behind the Aliens and Predator movies respectively.

It's one you have to watch a few times to ""get"" but once you do, you feel accomplished.

Every cyberpunk trope ever is stewed together in the pot that is the Matrix, and since there aren't really any other good cyberpunk movies, this one still rules. Still waiting for something like it...","2"
"DrLenera","Good,but very overrated and certainly not that original","13 November 2003","The Matrix is one of those films that seems destined to be always overrated. It is indeed a pretty good sci-fi/action movie,but it is by no means the classic many seem to think. Much has been made of the originality of the concept,obviously by people who have not seen the far superior but neglected Dark City,which had the same basic idea but handled it in a less exciting but far more intelligent manner. Other elements are borrowed from Strange Days and Ghost In The Shell,and while it's safe to say that all films borrow from other films a bit,it's bizarre how so many have hailed The Matrix for it's originality. And as for ""re-inventing the action movie"",all that has resulted is a depressing increase in the amount of CGI fight scenes in movies,and this is not a good thing because they are not convincing and therefore not that exciting {even wire work looks better}.

What we have than is an overrated film that still has much to recommend it,it's just NO CLASSIC. The first half hour has a great atmosphere of paranoia and gives us some memorable and sometimes disturbing images,such as machines breeding humans. After this the film slows down,and you wonder when all this amazing action is going to come .Some scenes,such as a visit to an oracle,seem to just exist to pad out and complicate what is a fairly simple story,a flaw which would reach ridiculous proportions in the sequels. The final quarter is sometimes thrilling,such as the gun battle and the justifiably famous helicopter sequence-this is indeed a masterpiece of editing,choreography and computer effects which just this once are pretty convincing. The final martial arts fight though is just like watching a computer game and is awkwardly edited-it's hard to see the great Yuen Woo Ping's {one of the great Hong Kong fight choreographers}hand in this. The ending is ubrupt but was probably already intended to set up a sequel.

Performances are generally good,although Keanu Reeves really does take blandness to a new level {well,until the sequels},a shame as he CAN act. The look of the film is also impressive,with the Workowski brothers having a knack for strong and slightly disturbing imagery and creations such as the robotic octopus-like creatures,although the sheer coldness of the visual style would become tiresome in the follow-ups. Music is a well balanced mixture of rock,dance and Don Davis's brooding score,and does sometimes {as in the use of Propellerheads during the gunfight}get the adrenalin going.

The Matrix is certainly not rubbish,but best sci-fi or action film of the 90s?PAH!!!","5"
"ozjeppe","Hail to the savior of the industry!","14 October 2006","OK, I probably can't add anything more to everything already noted about this milestone of a movie. So, this is more of a teary-eyed Thank You-speech long overdue! The genre of this adult kind of sci-fi-action has three indisputable kings at its top, in my book: Aliens, Terminator 2 ... and The Matrix. Thank heaven and earth for the people making this kind of movies, just for an audience like me! Without them, the movie world would be a poorer, drier and drearier place to be.

That feeling of overwhelming rush and awe that overpowered me in the movie theater in Sydney 1999, still hasn't worn off. Seven years later, I feel safe to say that it saved the industry of inventive movie making at this level, all on its own, with its epic mix of genres: Sci-fi. Action. Martial arts. Urban mythology. Immortal characters and quotes. It's all here, unsurpassed both in mind-bending style and original content, leaving the biggest of cult followings.

As for its sequels... it just didn't need them!

"rob-236","average stuff. People jumping onto a ""cool"" bandwagon","11 February 2002","Once in a while a film comes along that everyone has to like, whether its any good or not doesn't matter. The hype and the fact that it has `cool' elements in it, like killing at the drop of a hat, dark glasses and long leather coats and of course special effects, make up for that. Examples include Blade Runner, which was truly awful, Heat (zzzzzzzzzzzz), Pulp Fiction, which was good, but not unbelievably wonderful as everyone rants on about and Men in Black which was utter c**p of the highest order (see my review).

The Matrix disappointed me unbelievably. I love the Wachowski's previous film `BOUND' and looked forward to this film on the strength of that, NOT the hype. I watched it in the summer of its release, on the same day as `Ten Things I hate about you' and `Cruel Intentions' and I must say that I enjoyed those films far more. I had heard `THE MATRIX' was the best film ever made, a cinematic masterpiece, a wonderful story etc although, I always go into every film with an open mind and make my own mind up (even Burn Hollywood Burn  which yes, was awful anyway!!). The Matrix bored me silly for the first hour or so, it didn't make the slightest bit of sense and reminded me of the pain of sitting through `Bladerunner' years before. What I will say is that it picked up in the second half, mainly due special effects  which I always say, should be only an element of a film, NOT the be all and end all. I do honestly believe that many (not all) people only like this film because its fashionable to do so, although will never admit it. If you want good sci fi action thriller, that was made at a shaving of the cost, watch the superior `PITCH BLACK'. Please be individual and make up your own mind and not follow the crowd.","9"
"ryan_kuhn","""You Have To See It For Yourself...""","13 February 2005","A mind blowing movie experience for 2/3 of the film, then it breaks down into a shoot 'em up action film, but by then, The Matrix had already won me over. A different look at reality in the age of computers, the Wachowski brothers bring about a world where no one knows for sure what is real, what is fantasy, and who can be trusted. Sometime in the future, humans made machines to do most of their work, and at some point, the machines took over the world, using humans as power for their work. What kind of work does a machine need to do, I'm not really sure, and something that should have been examined further. To keep humans in the dark, a computer program was produced to keep the human mind thinking they were alive. What is real and what isn't is difficult to define at times in the Matrix and is the source of the most intellectual genius of the movie. The other achievement of the movie is the special effects. Any movie that can make Keanu Reeves look good has to have something special with it. Anyone who has seen any movie since 1999 knows the 360 degree camera pan around an actor, perfected by The Matrix. Reeves plays Neo, a computer programmer at some nameless company who has an underground cult following for his skill. This leads him to Morpheous (Lawrence Fishburn), a man looking for prophet, and he thinks he found it in Neo. Carrie-Anne Moss plays Trinity, a nod in the direction of Christianity, as she is a follower of the prophecy of Neo who happens to do her best work in catwoman-type leather. A refreshing change of pace in the beginning of the movie, as most of the physical challenges involved the martial arts, not running around with things that go ""boom,"" but we knew that could not last forever, and the final part of the movie has guns, lots of guns. Hugo Weaving plays the unemotional, almost too perfect ""Agent"" who chases Neo down on several occasions during the film, and is the movie's most interesting character. We'll have to wait until the following movies in the Matrix Trilogy to get more in depth when it comes to Agent Smith, and that's too bad. While we are blowing away our minds, I wish The Matrix would have gone all of the way, and make it so we don't trust ANYTHING anymore. Instead, an interesting premise is established, and only most of it is followed through.","2"
"ubtgkse","This is supposed to be a masterpiece.","1 December 2020","Yes matrix has good visuals and action, some good characters like cypher, Morpheus and agent smith, and some performances are good like Laurence fishburne and Hugo weaving. But it has so many flaws like neo and trinity being some of the most boring main characters I've seen in an action film with no romantic chemistry, it's bogged down by speaches that I don't care about that's about characters I don't care about that's about a world I don't care about, and so many plot holes like neo being brought back through the power of love wtf, they want to free people and yet kill innocent security guards, sometimes the smiths have super speed and then other times they don't, how can the smiths miss neo via a cupical wall, and if the machines feed of our energy then why have a matrix at all why not lebodemize the humans. Just a disappointment. Better then revolutions but I'd take reloaded any day over this.","8"
"Uriah43","Good Special Effects and Lots of Action","27 December 2013","""Neo"" (Keanu Reeves) is a computer programmer who is attempting to discover a hidden truth on his own which others want to remain hidden. Then one day he is contacted by certain people who have decided to reveal this truth to him but warn him that it carries great risk. He has to decide whether to accept this risk or not. Anyway, rather than reveal any more of the plot and risk spoiling the film for those who haven't seen it I will just say that this was a pretty good science-fiction movie that incorporates good special effects and lots of action. Or perhaps its more accurate to say that this is a good action film that relies upon science-fiction and special effects. Either way it's a pretty good film and the only reason I didn't rate it higher was that I thought some of the dialogue was a bit weak and the action went a bit overboard. All things considered then I rate this movie as above average and I recommend it to those who enjoy science-fiction and action movies all rolled into one.","10"

"KP-XF","5/10 back in 1999; possibly the most overrated popular movie","14 February 2005","First I have to say that I enjoy computer games (Max Payne - a game featuring bullet time - is my favorite single player shooter although there are others technically better like Far Cry and Half-Life 2; this is for people saying that this movie is intended for gamers) and I also read books (sci-fi literature included). The Matrix isn't an acceptable movie overall (for me acceptable is at least 7) and let me tell you where it fails and succeeds: The acting is bad, the only good actor is Hugo Weaving (his monologue with captured Morpheus is nice, the interrogation room, ...), Laurence Fishburne and Joe Pantalione are bearable and the rest of the cast is pretty weak. The lack of originality; less than 5% of the ideas in this movie were not done before. The idea that human beings can be good power sources if a catalyst (even the most efficient) is used is ridiculous; one adult can't light a 60 W bulb under any circumstances; there are a lot of other efficient power sources, but that doesn't sell, does it ? Although the idea is interesting (the idea of machine domination and what might have been done with it), the script is bad, the lines suck (Kansas is going bye-bye, this hasn't been done before, Neo I believe, oh my God he is the One, ...), it gives me the impression that this is targeted at little children (like many other excessive commercial movies), but considering that most consumers have an undeveloped brain, that is exactly what it is. In the beginning, we have Mr. Smith who tells the old police officer that his men are already dead and they shouldn't have got involved, but my problem is I can see later that Smith can enter other people's virtual bodies and I wonder why the hell doesn't he enter that police officer Trinity is fighting. This makes the whole escape scene pointless, but if it's cool, we can't take it out no matter how stupid it may seem. The agents which are after all computer programs not weak humans seem to fail to hit the target, maybe because that is meant to happen to give the rebels a sense of power, to keep them on the edge, to give them the feeling that they can get away with it, the ""story"" advances because it has to. The fight between Neo and Smith in the subway station is pointless since he could shoot and Neo couldn't dodge or stop the bullets and there are many other flaws which have already been mentioned here by others, the list can go on and on ... The atmosphere is a disco-techno-cyber-kewl garbage appealing to many immature teenagers; it doesn't have depth, sensation, substance, it's pure superficial stuff despite all attempts to be philosophical. The Morpheus call at Anderson's office is another unintelligent scene; the only good thing is the feeling when Neo drops the phone (don't wonder if it hurt anybody because they are just batteries, one dies, another takes its place). The anarchist message is present: we won't subject to the laws, we are free people, law enforcement agents suck, ... I think Pink Floyd's ""Another Brick in The Wall"" is much better at that. The rebels' excitement when Neo and Morpheus fight reminds me of excited immature children; they should act professionally, measure his brain activity, but no, we get how incredibly fast they virtually move. The special effects are good, good enough to buy the cheap DVD to test your surround audio system; there are other good movies with great surround sound but The Matrix is one of the best at that; this is one of the few reasons to see this movie. The sequels are both under 5 out of 10 and they make this movie worse because they add new flaws and plot holes. For the same reason people rated this 9/10 or 10/10 it also won the MTV Movie Award for the best movie. If you wonder why the rating in my title is so high, that is because The Matrix has some interesting ideas from Smith's perspective, good special effects for 1999, its stupidity is funny sometimes, Smith is a good character and other minor things. If you think all the Oscars this movie won are rightfully deserved look at the rooftop scene where Neo dodges the bullets, before he drops two guns, when the bullets hit him in slow motion there are no guns and when time comes back to normal flow the guns magically appear and there goes the Oscar for Editing.","4"

"merrywood","Classic metaphysical allegory framed in modern dress","6 April 1999","Andy and Larry Wachowski, who wrote and directed this finely written, darkly rendered film, have access. They have access to superior intelligence, theirs, and surprisingly, to the Hollywood industry, which usually scorns anything approximating intelligent film making. That the plot takes its motive from a tried and true classic Science Fiction concept (a projection into future reality with attending amplification of a current fear) should certainly not be a factor in any critical analysis of this production. With THE MATRIX, the Wachowskis have delivered to us a superior multilevel cornucopia of brain food and enough audiovisual sensory power to satisfy a wide range of audience.

The realization of the plot is fast moving and with engrossing detail. The dialogue is straight, like the scenario, with sparse subtext and filled with thought provoking concepts that are liberally tossed out in rapid fire, almost too fast. The payoff, at least for some of us, of course, is the exercise in mental gymnastics and the interlaced dialogues of mankind's true meaning on Earth. What is mankind but mind, and can we survive ourselves:? A good old song worth singing once more, and with dazzling orchestration.

The film ends with a positive turn but leaves the intelligent viewer with much to reflect upon. This is not a bad thing, not bad at all.","9"
"OllieSuave-007","Philosophical and artistic sci-fi!","24 August 2014","This is an iconic sci-fi movie starring Keanu Reeves as computer hacker Thomas Anderson/Neo, who is on a mission with the mysterious Trinity (Carrie-Anne Moss) and Morpheus (Lawrence Fishbourne) to confront an artificial cyber-world on Earth called the Matrix, whose malevolent cyber creators want to conquer the human race and take over the real world.

The movie starts off a little slow, but steadily gains momentum as Keanu Reeves' character goes on his mission to confront the cyber-machines, show off his martial arts moves, elude the pursuing evil agents and take down the Matrix. There are plenty of sophisticated visual and special effects that really enhance the sci-fi elements of the film, and some plot twists that made the film more intriguing. In addition to the sci-fi action, there are also a lot of philosophical elements and themes in the story, particularly the ""free your mind"" and ""realize the truth"" statements.

The artistry of the action, especially the slow-motion scenes showing Carrie-Anne Moss jumping up in the air and Keanu Reeves dodging bullets became some of the most iconic cinema moments in history and have been spoofed or referenced in other films.

Some downsides to the movie, though, was that I thought all the action was a little on the short side (a lot of all-talk) and some of the acting, particularly that for Reeves, was too wooden and emotionless. I also thought the incognito-like and stoic performance of Hugo Weaving's Agent Smith character was overacted.

Overall, though, this is a pretty good sci-fi movie and is worth a watch.

Grade B","10"
"fadedGlory","Disappoints upon reflection","2 March 2005","The Matrix is not a bad film, it keeps you involved because of the slow uncovering of the complex and bizarre plot, the twist and turns as the movie unfolds, Agent Smith as the perfect baddie and of course the pretty wild action sequences. The atmosphere is suitably dark and the special effects are excellent. All good enough for a fine evening of movie entertainment, right?

Unfortunately there are some rather big problems as well, and they really bug me the morning after watching the film. Truth is, I am really struggling with the plot. I am quite a fan of science-fiction so that in itself is not what bothers me. I don't even mind the questionable assumption that human bodies can be harvested for power generation without having to input more energy than they produce. No, the real doubt I have is simply: why this Matrix? Why do the machines even bother to go to such lengths as this incredibly complicated computer programme that makes humans think they have an actual life? Why not just let them rot in their pods and good luck to them? What do the machines get out of it? Surely it costs vast amounts of energy to keep this programme running and hook up all the humans to it? Why do they do it? What's the point?

Also, why do Special Agents have any limitations at all? If they are computer programs, and the world they operate in is a computer programme too, why are they not simply all-powerful and invulnerable to bullets and other attacks? A computer programme has no physical limitations - anybody with a games console knows this. Why bother shooting at a virtual body with virtual bullets?

I realise these are fundamentals required for the plot to work, but I find the problems a bit too glaring to overlook. When you think about it, this film is no more than an excuse for the (in themselves quite good) special effects. Therefore, in the cool light of day I can't give this film more than 4 stars.","3"

Oooh, the entire world is a VR simulation, how original! Did they come up with it all by themselves? I found the movie to be very boring. Most of the action bits were ok, but between them we got lots of idiotic dialogue that was suppose to be clever. The movie should have been more like T2, with much more action, because the drama and subplots were just sad. And I also must say that the action scenes didn't brake any new ground. We've seen it all before.

"Tweetienator","The Perfect Matrix","9 November 2017","1999 got some of my absolute favorite movies done: Fight Club and Matrix, American Beauty, Sleepy Hollow, Blair Witch, Girls Interrupted, Cruel Intentions and Sixth Sense. 1999, really a superb year for the cineaste.

The first movie of the Matrix trilogy got not only a most imaginative story but also a style and cinematography that was at that time (and imo still is) most innovative. And of course unforgotten are Keanu Reeves as Neo, Carrie-Anne Moss as Trinity and Laurence Fishburne as Morpheus, and last but not least, Hugo Weaving as Agent Smith.

Lana Wachowski and Lilly Wachowski achieved nothing more than one of the modern classics with this movie. The following two movies of the Matrix universe are not that good, and I understand that some people argue that Matrix does not need additional parts or an expansion of the story told, but I like Reloaded and Revolutions anyway.

Fight Club, Matrix, and Inception - for me some of the best fantasy/sci-fi movies ever made, like the first Alien movie and Blade Runner - modern movie-making at its best.","8"
"mentalcritic","Tries so hard... misses the mark so badly...","4 November 2000","I actually enjoyed this film the first time I saw it, but then I saw it a second time after listening to all the comments about how brilliant this film must be and how we must all worship it. I've never walked out on a film before, and that even includes Battlefield Earth and Wing Commander, but I walked out in the middle of trying to watch this one again. I've never seen a film that people try so hard to make out to be so much more than it really is. The worst part is the obssessive cult that has formed up around the film, telling us how great and visionary the directors are and how we should all worship them and blah blah blah...

Well gang, like the Region Coding Enhancement scheme, time and people's patience is going to catch up with this dreary film, and the results are going to leave the makers very red-faced. Just about every concept in this film is stolen, poorly executed, or both. I still laugh my guts out when Morpheus tries to tell us how human bodies produce so much energy when they consume at least that much in a day. Any nutritionist worth their salt could tell you that. The division of a digital future between evil robots and kind-hearted human beings was also done far better in Tron. And the sloppy use of the Christ Theme as a plot device doesn't even bear thinking about. When I first saw the film, I had never laughed so hard in my life. When I saw it on DVD, I'd never felt so insulted. Never have I seen a production crew with such over-inflated ideas about their achievements.

The characters are just plain boring, too. Keanu Reeves has all the acting ability of a stuffed toy, and yet he is the most interesting thing in the film. That's a worrying sign. Morpheus was all poses and zero credibility, Agent Smith was just an insult, and Trinity had to be one of the least watchable romantic interests since Teri Hatcher's awful performance in Tomorrow Never Dies. And was this film trying hard for some kind of record in speaking ****? Well, guess what? Their efforts succeeded big-time. Every man and his dog seems to be going on about how much better this film was than the last episode of Star Wars, but it is really more on a level with Star Trek.

Frankly, if this is the future of science fiction films, then I will happily stick with my copy of Plan 9 From Outer Space. At least Ed Wood had sincere intentions of a variety other than ripping off an army of suckers when he made that piece of ****! Zero stars. And don't blame anyone other than yourselves, Matrix fans, because this film is now the celluoid answer to MTV through your efforts.","9"

"cemk-2","Good special effects, but no originality at all.","10 September 1999","""Ignorance is bliss"" as they say in the film. You go in without any knowledge of the Science-Fiction literature and you enjoy the film, you go in the theatre with some SF knowledge, the amount of rip-off and open plagiarism annoys you like hell. The Matrix is as if the screenwriter decided to use parts of his fave SF stories and made up a story to bind them all: The Second Foundation Trilogy, all that's written by William Gibson, Ender's Game by O.S. Card, Star Trek's holodeck concept, references to Terminator films, and to Cliff Simak's short stories, and more and more show up in the film. And with awe and horror I saw Obi-Wan and young Luke in the Morpheus - Neo dialogue somewhere in the first 30 minutes of the film; even the music was a la Star Wars at that moment. I guess they thought ""most people stop reading SF after they are 20 years old, so they either won't bother or won't remember"" which is a crying shame. However, giving the devil its due, the special effects are interesting, the pace is high and the music/sound effects are deafening, therefore The Matrix becomes an interesting spectacle, but it's still hollow, borrowed, and plundered from others' decent works. Pity. I wish it were ""the"" SF film people were talking about. Did you notice, I didn't write even a single word about Keanu Reeves' expressionless, lifeless, face.","10"

But the concept is interesting and the acting and action scenes are interesting as well a mans journey into believing he become the so called ""The One"". It's special effect are good for a movie made back in 1999. Overall, epic sci-if action movie.","9"
"audiophile","Pretentious and overblown","26 December 2003","The Matrix is the first installment of a ""trilogy"" of sci-fi movies. In fact, it's not really a trilogy, in an organic sense, it's just a movie and its sequels.

Anyway, ""The Matrix"" is a film with good premises, but bad developments. Although most of the ideas of the film were taken from sci-fi writers of the 60's and philosophers of the past (the idea that we exist as a thought, or a dream, goes back to Plato at least), the script did a good job in putting these ideas together in a modern plot (at least as for year 2000). The oniric influence of recent sci-fi comic books on the film is visible throughout and is what makes the visual appeal of the film.

Unfortunately, what could have been a really good movie has been turned by the W. brothers into an average action flick targetted at 15 year-old boys, among which must belong the guys who wrote this flick is the ""best movie"" they've seen. There is almost no acting, and the heros wearing sunglasses all the time is a good way to avoid any sort of emotion to show on their faces. This total absence of emotion is one of the reasons why nobody gives a f..k whether or not everyone dies in the sequels.

The W. brothers have a strong tendency to show off : heroes wearing sunglasses and Armani black leather coats designed for yuppies, trendy night-club population, ""bullet time"" special FX, (ugly) kung fu video game action, heavy metal and techno music during the whole film, etc. All this is supposed to make the film look ""kewwwwl"". In opposition to the heros, the agent Smith wears a dark working suit : he is not cool (although he also wears sunglasses, but that's because he is a spy agent).

But what really turns me off is the pretense of the religioso-philosophico-technobabble which hardly hides the vacuity of the characters and the serious weaknesses of the script. There are so many other films which say much more with less, that this film looks highly overblown in comparison.

I'm not even trying to elaborate on the sequels, which, instead of correcting these problems, show them in their full splendor.

In a word, this flick is highly overrated. But hey, who cares ? The ""trilogy"" has ripped off enough spectators to make the Warner happy.","9"
"Bigweight66","Kung Fu and intelligent machines!","2 January 2022","Thomas Anderson (Keanu Reeves ) is a computer programmer working for a big company. By night he is a computer hacker known as Neo. But all is definitely not what it seems to be.

A mysterious women called Trinity (Carrie-Anne Moss) seeks out Anderson/Neo and arranges a meeting for Neo with Morpheus (Laurence Fishburne). Morpheus is the leader of a small group of rebels that have broken free from the Matrix. At the meeting Morpheus explains to Neo that the world he lives in (the matrix) is a total illusion created by machines and computers. In the matrix, the truth is humans are slaves and nothing more than a controlled power source for the machines and computers. Morpheus believes Neo is the chosen one to lead the groups fight against the machines and computers, and free the humans.

Neo reluctantly joins the rebel group in their quest. Machines called Sentinels also known as agents protect the matrix from any human interference. Agent Smith (Hugo Weaving) and his agents set out to stop Neo, Morpheus and Trinity with ruthless determination.

Visually The Matrix is an awesome movie, particularly seeing it was made in 1999. The movie jumps between the matrix setting and the dystopian reality. There is lots of action and intense martial arts battles. Keanu Reeves, Laurence Fishburne, Hugo Weaving and Carrie-Anne Moss are all very good in their roles.

I was a bit concerned after reading some deep thought proving reviews about The Matrix. I thought I might struggle with the story and concept. However I didn't find it that difficult to understand. But I also did read a simple outline of the story which may have helped me.","3"
"TheDufster","Appalling rubbish - apart from the special fx","12 November 2000","This film is abolutely awful. My girlfriend and I would have left the cinema half-way through if we knew that we both felt the same about it at the time! Apart from the special effects, the film suffers from WOODEN ACTING (There goes Keanu again!) and ridiculous storyline. The special fx are amazing though - apart from that it is a total waste of time. However - we seem to stand alone on this one, as the rest of the world seems to think this is the most amazing film ever made. Oh well.","10"
"TheNabOwnzz","An excellent combination of style and psychology","18 April 2018","The Matrix is the kind of movie that easily could have been absolutely terrible, as it has been compared to a lot of incoherent nonsense and some stating that it is a hard to understand or mindbreaking film. However, this is not the case. In contrast to a lot of these incoherent films that appear intelligent to make people like them so THEY can feel intelligent too, The Matrix is actually a well thought out psychological motion picture about living in denial and being aware.

What makes The Matrix stand out as such a great film is that while the story is obviously far-fetched, it manages to capture a very close relevance to the actual world. In the film the choice is given to live in denial or know the truth, which is very relevant to people in modern society. It understands human emotions and embraces it, instead of quite simply just ignoring it like a lot of todays movies seem to do.

I am not a very big fan of Keanu Reeves, who appears to be a wooden plank in most of his roles, and it is also the case in this movie, yet it does not detract the film from being any less despite him being the main character. Perhaps his constant confused look seems to somehow fit just right in this movie, i am not sure. But somehow Keanu Reeves just fits in Neo properly. Laurence Fishburne as Morpheus, Joe Pantoliano as Cypher ( who is by the way a brilliant addition of a typical character who WANTS to live in denial and escapism, and doesnt want to see the truth ) & Hugo Weaving as the deep layered computer program Agent Smith are the most notable and best of the supporting cast, as each gives off an excellent performance.

It is also a beautifully stylishly shot, choreographed & edited film. The movie has many great shots, filmed with a green tint in the scenes in The Matrix. Ofcourse the one where Neo steps in Trinity, Apoc & Switch's car comes to mind, with a fantastic distance shot when he finally steps in which shows the downpour of the rain combined with the green tint. There is also a lot of martial arts, and all this is filmed brilliantly. There is no shakycam, no quick edits, just raw athleticism and power, leaving you in awe every time a hand to hand fight comes on the screen. The Wachowski brothers also frequently used slow motion, particularly in an amazingly edited and choreographed lobby shootout. You do not miss a thing of what is happening on screen due to this excellent camera technique. The slow motion enhances the overview of the entire shootout. Not to mention the trademark visually breakthrough impressive bullet dodges Neo makes later on in the film.

This all means The Matrix is excellent entertainment, one of the greatest pure action movies, but also challenges us to understand the truth about the world we are living in.","8"
"Spiral-2","Painfully obvious, atrociously plotted, passably executed","14 June 1999","For me, the experience of watching this film was like paying to watch paint dry in a room full of people who have never before seen paint dry and are hence absolutely thrilled by it.

You will probably love it, mind you. That's your privilege.

It just about functions as a crass action movie, provided you can sit through the tedious first hour, and the terrifyingly non-existent justification for something that (as several other reviewers have observed) could actually have been sensibly reasoned if anyone with reasonable intelligence or knowledge had been on the writing team.

As it is, this mediocre script using an old, old, old idea has nothing to offer fans of sci fi who can read and were awake in the eighties, and considerably less to offer action fans than John Woo's Hong Kong films. The framing plot, when revealed, requires more than just a willing suspension of disbelief, it requires that you dismantle all your critical faculties and just content yourself with wallowing in the faintly entertaining special effects.

It tries to be cool - and evidently succeeds in the eyes of many of the people who see it - but it seems to me little more than another soulless product of committee thinking and appeals to the lowest common denominator - and it doesn't get much lower than this.

If you wish to see the same ground covered with more intelligence and visual flare, try the better-than-average film 'Dark City' (also mentioned by another reviewer) or the less accessible, but more stylish 'eXistenZ'. Not that I feel 'The Matrix' stole it's one flimsy idea from these films. This old chestnut has been around as long as cyberpunk has, and probably longer for all I know.

Still, bread and circuses, I suppose. Keep the masses happy and then they don't have to think for themselves.

Ah well, it's only a blockbuster, I suppose. It's not supposed to be well made.","8"
"uds3","Brilliantly pointless.","8 November 2001","Hey, how to lose all your friends in one short review - watch this!

I cut my film-critique molars on sci-fi! Grew up with WAR OF THE WORLDS, FORBIDDEN PLANET, WHEN WORLDS COLLIDE, THEM, THIS ISLAND EARTH etc. Developed a brain with 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY, BLADE RUNNER and its ilk. (Do films of THIS stature HAVE any ilk???). Then with the advent of such as ALIEN, ALIENS, HARDWARE etc, things were running hot. The 90's brought about a slump in intelligence but a boost in box office with SPECIES (and its cretinous sequel), INDEPENDENCE DAY and insane gothic madness like DARK CITY....Then there's THE MATRIX!

I think I'm the only person on this planet didn't like the Matrix! Lets find out why, coz I'm really not too sure myself! A devotee of sci-fi, I have nothing against Keanu Reeves. Hugo Weaving is indisputably one of Australia's best actors (Agent Smith is a role well below his talents, which if you have seen THE INTERVIEW or PROOF you will realise is a fact). THE MATRIX has action aplenty, a somewhat convoluted plot but still nothing stands out to account for my total apathy and inherent disinterest in the film. Perhaps it is that I have this feeling the world's audience has been conned into thinking how good the flick is and in fact THE MATRIX does exist and manipulates viewers into (a) handing over truckloads of money and (b) leaves them with the impression they've had a great time. Take away the FX and you find...""Hey man , there isn't a movie here!"" It's brilliant!

From my perspective, the movie is just a riot of activity, designed to rivet in place the minds of today's (for the most part) attention-deficient audiences. The film has plasticity, a veneer of smart-talk and bad-ass hero worship - maybe that's precisely why it was so popular! What it DOESN'T have is depth!

I will admit, had I really gotten off on this flick and held it dear to my heart, reviews like THIS would totally rub me up the wrong way, but you see guys, thats the beauty of cinema - we all have our own (perhaps churlish) opinions and we see things differently.

Purely in the interests of diplomacy I WILL be charitable and nominate one solitary aspect I DID find impressive - The alien attack on the ship at the end of the film - gr8 stuff, it almost made up for the preceding 130 minutes!","3"
"hassan-ilahi","The benchmark for all 'Science-Fiction' films to come.","4 May 2011","Science Fiction wasn't an extremely well-known genre in the 90's. Yes, there was films such as 'Blade Runner' and 'Star Wars', but nothing else that had set a standard. Right when you thought there was no specialty, 'The Matrix' miraculously fixed that problem...

The Matrix is undeniably a brilliant film, as well as an outstanding experience. Yes, this film has some sort of flaws, but forget that, it has a creative and highly addictive world of it's own. I literally got sucked into this film till the very end. The script, performances, direction, and visual effects are memorable.

A script (in my opinion), is the most important part of an amazing 'sci- fi' film. This film's script is jarring and exuberant. The whole idea of 'Matrix' is creative and delusional. This word does come from Mathematics, but this is a whole new meaning. Finely written storytelling at it's very best.

Keanu Reeves is NOT an actor I admire. I find him dull and blank most of the time. This film, however, proves me wrong. He, as the main character, is damn good. He's slick, tall, and handsome. Laurence Fishburne, as Morpheus, is brilliant. He demonstrates a better understanding of 'Matrix' and is serious, expressionless, and jubilant. The rest of the cast including Moss and Weaving produce fine performances.

The Wachowski brothers do an outstanding job at directing this film. Relating Japanese style towards an American film. The Hollywood FHX in this film is ground-breaking and highly praise. Different camera angles are also used to shoot this film.

It may seem surprising, but this film was ONLY acclaimed for it's visual effects. It deserved more, but didn't get any! Otherwise, this visual effects of this film are the highlight and the most related to Hollywood's biggest achievements. The different 'kung-fu' fights are so well done, that you have a great time with them. These effects also made this film look slick and extremely cool.

Overall, you shouldn't be missing 'The Matrix' if you are fond of this genre. It exemplifies a perfect well-done thriller. An entertaining ride from start to finish, this is one of my favorite films.","2"

"DennisLittrell","An action/adventure future?","12 October 2002","What can I possibly say about this movie that hasn't already been said? There are over twenty-six hundred comments at IMDb and another twenty-five hundred at Amazon. There even seems to be some block ""reviewing"" from young Christian groups enthusiastically pointing out all the parallels to Christ's life: Neo, ""The One,"" ""Trinity,"" saving humankind, and being lifted up to heaven, etc. I would add that directors Andy and Larry Wachowski touched some other religious bases as well. Note that Gloria Foster is ""Oracle"" (Greek mythology), that Lawrence Fishburne is Morpheus (of the Underworld) and that Joe Pantoliano is ""Mr. Reagan"" (a little secular allusion here). The band of heroes are also referred to as ""freedom fighters"" to recall our ex-prez's words. (But never mind.)

The main thing to understand is that this is one very popular and very arresting movie, the sort of thing Hollywood producers love; in fact all of Hollywood loves The Matrix because it gave work to so many. Scrolling the credits takes longer than your mother's phone good-bye. The Matrix is an industry in itself, something like Star Wars and Rambo.

But is the movie any good?

Well, it's not much on video. The DVD is undoubtedly an improvement, and on the silver screen it might lean you back in your seat. The cinematography, sound and special effects are first rate.

But I mean philosophically speaking?

I think we can get a hint from a review that began (and I quote) ""Why can't all movies be this good? -A 12-year-old viewer."" Indeed, this is the question all those marketing minds in Hollywood are asking. The true blockbuster action/adventure/sci-fi movie aims at a male viewer of about 18. Ideally the range would include 12-year-olds to thirtysomethings. Any philosophy beyond that mental age is burdensome.

So you don't think it is a philosophically interesting movie?

Actually I do. I just don't think it's original. I mean Plato's cave allegory is over two thousand years old. And let's not forget The Wizard of Oz (1939) or even The Truman Show (1998). Any science fiction buff can point to half a dozen precursors.

Isn't that stretching it a bit?

Okay, how about this short story from half a century or so ago called something like ""The Perm-Machine."" Everybody in the future society is working their nine-to-five tails off for a TEMP--that is, for a few hours in the box hooked up to the feelie machine complete with 3D screen, surround sound and electrodes attached to your every neuron so that the complete, thrilling, all senses experience of the greatest adventures in life are theirs, including sex, drugs, heart-pounding action and other sensual pleasures. But what everybody really wanted was a PERM, which would place them in the box permanently hooked up to the electrodes and intravenous drips, etc. for the rest of their lives, a kind of virtual reality heaven on earth.

What about the acting?

Forget the acting. It was okay. Consider this instead: we are going to become software. There isn't going to be any ""warfare"" between man and machine with the human spirit triumphant. Instead, we are going to become more and more attached to our machines, our computers, our chips, until at some point (see Ray Kurzweil's The Age of Spiritual Machines: When Computers Exceed Human Intelligence or Pierre Baldi's The Shattered Self: The End of Natural Evolution) the line between us and machine will be completely blurred. And then, molecule by molecule, we will DISAPPEAR, and at no time will we even realize it happened!

The Matrix is a vision of the future, but it is a hopelessly anthropomorphic vision, a kind of action/adventure director's scan, extrapolated from the present. Where artificial intelligence, virtual reality and the prospect of quantum computers is taking us cannot be envisioned at all. Some people call this the ""singularity"" factor. The future (and by the way, most of the audience of The Matrix will live to see this) is like the horizon of a black hole that we accelerate toward, never able to see beyond that horizon until we are IN.

"dalton2","It's not what I expected (too COOL for me...)","25 June 1999","I expected to see a very special film, ranked #20 at the IMDb Top 250. I thought I'd have something like a stunning experience... but I was wrong. What they didn't tell me is that The Matrix is just a manga film aimed to the young public. Perhaps 10-15 years ago (when I was 15-20 years old) I would have enjoyed these almost two hours and twenty minutes of audiovisual events, but now it's not the case. Many people have discovered what they thought to be a new idea in cinema. Well... unfortunately, it's not new. And the way the story develops itself is out of place for me. What I mean is that it's not a film for older people, as it enhances all the elements of children's play and all those FANCY things young people like (the COOL music, the COOL glasses, the COOL walking style, the COOL guy, the hyper-blast finale that reminds me an episode of Mazinger Z...), and just assumes everything as the way things have to be. There are no adult references, just a show where adolescents' dreams come true. Nothing really intellectually moving.

Don't let me be misunderstood, it's not a bad film, but it's not enough for me, at least to be at the 20th position in the list.

There are good visual effects, and there is good sound. I didn't get bored. But it's just another film, not the one. Crying Freeman has less effects but is better for me. 7 out of 10.","7"

"RoboRabbit89","One of the greatest movies ever made.","5 March 2018","Where do I begin, well I heard of this film back in 1999, and around 2000 I finally seen it as a rental first, with my dad. He and I both loved it, it's quite original and unlike anything I've seen before, even at that time.

Then in 2001 my mom and I found it on VHS, new I think? Can't remember. I think it was, anyway she enjoyed it too. I have to admit this was part of my childhood, and it was great fun to watch over and over again. Even today.

About the movie, This is a cyberpunk action-thriller, Thomas Anderson is a hacker aka Neo under his alias, is what I think, kinda lost in life and is looking for Morpheus (as many times I have seen this, I have no idea why he's looking for him, really). He is brought into the realization that the world he knows is a clever computerized dream world! Morpheus, Trinity, and the others join the fight to stop the machines called sentinels that mankind has been at war with for a century.

The cast, Keanu Reeves is great as Neo aka Thomas Anderson, he did a good job, playing Neo slightly naive to all the carnage and to his destiny as ""The One"", being chosen to be the savior of the human race.

Laurence Fishburne is great as Morpheus the leader of the team and mentor to Neo and Trinity, his voice is so magnetic you are drawn in completely and he's just a damn good actor anyway. He's a pleasure to watch.

Carrie Ann Moss is awesome as the ass kicking Trinity, I have to admit she is a very sexy lady, she looks great in vinyl, it shows off her sexy shape well. I still have not seen her in very much, but she is a really good actress, I hope in the near future she will play in more action movies because she just rocks!

Hugo Weaving is also great as the sort of main villain Agent Smith, he's great playing creepy and emotionally robotic as Smith. Also a good foe to Neo and the others heroes, I haven't seen him in much either but he is a good actor too.

On to the action, the action scenes are unbelievably awesome and memorable which is always good, my favorites are when Neo vs. Smith in the subway, the beginning with Trinity being chased by Agents as she jumps from roof top to roof top and when Neo and Trinity have an epic firefight in a government lobby.

Overall a great piece of science fiction with epic action scenes and mind teasing philosophical messages. I give it an 8/10. If you have not seen this, please see it, we don't get movie this good anymore and if you've been dying to see something completely original, look no further. Highly recommended.","1"

"allah_is_mighty","I hate this film","5 September 2009","With its trite Kafka-wannabe subtext and pretensions to profundity, this badly acted (Reeves is like a lump of wood, with a permanently perplexed look on his dumb face), poorly scripted, mess of a movie had me yawning and, at times, bristling with irritation. The stupid, faux philosophy about different realities was clearly ripped from a film called Dark City, which was far more chilling and unhinged, and managed to steer clear of the juvenile philosophical clap-trap that infected The Matrix (even the title is lame).

Its only saving grace was some innovatory and influential action sequences and a good Don Davis score.But the action eventually seemed to contrive to divert the viewer from the paucity of original ideas exhibited, and culminated in a ridiculous, Dodge City-style shoot 'em up that had me laughing out loud. Then Neo turns into Superman: yep,s-o-o-o original. Then there's the bit where Neo is resurrected by the kiss by Trinity. It's ET and Snow White and every other now-predictable cliché in the cannon of story telling. To top that Fishburne's character whispers in hushed awe: ""He's The One"". I would have laughed if it wasn't so pathetic.

In another comment someone described this and the sci-fi benchmark for all others to follow. Excuse me?! Show some me actual science in this muddled subterranean labyrinth, then I might reconsider. I won't even comment on the ensuing two movies,with the preposterous Christ fixation that dominated the third. Horrible, style-over-content rubbish.","1"
"Mister-6","The Computer Wore Ray-Bans....","19 June 2000","What is ""The Matrix""? Lemme tell ya: ""The Matrix"" is a vast computer network designed to kick butt and take names...oh, and to imprison all humanity - almost forgot that. Did I mention what Keanu Reeves has to do with any of this? No? We'll get to him later, then.

Well, conspiracy theorists, here's your ultimate sci-fi flick. Seems we're all living a virtual reality lie and that this is really the future and we're all slaves to the Pentium gods. In fact, the only thing that stands between us and total oblivion are a pack of rebel freedom fighters and a lone man who will one day destroy the evil.... Hmmm, does that sound familiar to anyone else?

DUH! ""The Matrix"" cobbles together a story-line from not only ""Star Wars"" but also ""Alice in Wonderland"", ""The Wizard of Oz"", Zen philosophy, Kung-Fu chop-socky flicks, your choice of shoot-em-ups and one of any Oliver Stone movies where we're all living in a daze and there's sinister plots working to undermine our lives and make us all live a live (or in this case, a ""techno-lie"").

Reeves is Neo, the ""Chosen One"" as he is sometimes called and must be brought from the ""real world"" to help an underground resistance in a desolate world of the ""future"" to train, re-learn and re-think himself in order to defeat the bad guys, save the good guys and (GASP!) find true love in the form of Trinity (Moss).

Okay, plot mechanics aside, this is a movie you'll only be interested in for the FX and let me tell you, there are some good ones here. You know those Gap commercials where people jump, freeze in mid-air then the camera rotates around them 180 degrees until they land? That's what you'll see here, and those scenes are well-done. In fact, a lot of the action here is invigorating and, truth be told, exciting.

BUT, the Wachowski brothers tell a thin plot line that is just an excuse for their speical FX loop. And in it are some talented actors trying to stand out from the swirling and swooping scenery about them. Of the group, Fishburne does best as Morpheus, the Obi-Wan to Reeves' Luke Skywalker. Fishburne teaches, philosophizes and drop-kicks with the best of them and is one of the more memorable characters in modern day film-making.

Reeves is pretty much ineffectual and (understandingly) bewildered by the goings-on, so doesn't have much of a chance to do any acting. Moss plays tough all the way through (even when kissing Reeves!) and Pantoliano seems to be here as a token gesture, since he was in the Wachowski's ""Bound"".

The bad guys, though, are pretty effective, wearing dark glasses, neat business suits and locked jaws. The main baddie, Agent Smith (Weaving), does most of the talking and threatening and suggests what Darth Vader would have been like in business wear.

In the end, though, once all is said and done, you'll remember FX and gunfire and fight scenes and, maybe, think twice about touching a mirror again. But not much else. But if all you want is cool FX, look no further.

Five stars for ""The Matrix"", in terms of FX and story.

There are supposed to be sequels coming out for this movie later on. I'll bet Oliver Stone will be first in line.","1"

The whole thing is based on special effects. It's a film by two directors that think half of the cameras running at 300 fps is art...or something.

Hugo Weaving has the only good performance in this movie as Agent Smith. Carrie Anne Moss is bland as can be. Do I even have to comment on Keanu Reeves....dude...woah...nuff said.

This is the perfect example of Joel Silver run amuck. Just because you have money to produce movies, doesn't mean you should produce bad movies....sounds pretty obvious to me. I'm just so thankful when I see someone like Steven Spielberg putting out a movie like Minority Report...a movie (actually...a director and crew) that knows how to USE special effects to drive a story. Not just shoot the hell out of a government building...hmmmm...not such a great scene to slip in there now, huh?

"RachelLone","If only my life could be as cool as it is in...'The Matrix'","17 May 2001","It is such an enjoyable journey to watch this film. Stunning choreography and special effects, spectacular cinematography (which makes Keanu Reeves look so...you know...so...) and the theme of the story - the 'real' world and the virtual world.

Personally, I find our real world nearly surreal, almost a dream. But in this movie, you can live a more real life in the virtual world, where it appears to be a dream but it's not entirely so. You can learn so many different things much faster by getting those programmes into your head. In the virtual world you look a lot better, you can be your 'real' self, that is to say, to be able to use your potential to prove to the world that you're someone special.

To me, this film has inspired me in some way. The reality is, we are getting closer and closer to that virtual paradise (a paradise with commotion, of course).

If you're already a fan of Keanu's, than I suppose you will say to yourself 'Keanu Reeves is my hero! I want to be like him!'; if you're not really a fan, than it's most definitely sure that you'll become one after you see 'The Matrix'!","2"
"EdRooney","Be on the lookout for this stunner","25 March 1999","""The Matrix"" The trailers and commercials tease you with fleeting shots of flying action scenes and nefarious G-men in black sunglasses.

The soundtrack pumps electronica as our leather bound heroes try to save the day. You ask yourself, ""What is the Matrix?""...

Man, I wish I could tell you that. After 130 minutes of this new action film, I was completely baffled. What I do know is that notorious directors Andy and Larry Wachowski have crafted this decade's ""Blade Runner"". A sci-fi thriller that will blow away movie-geeks and stun everybody else. In 1997's ""Bound"", the Wachowski brothers burst onto the scene with a complex and bloody thriller that took many people by surprise due to it's high tech sheen and sharp performances. Armed with 80 million dollars and creative control from Village Roadshow, the Brothers bring their typical manic energy to this piece as well. The end result being big time entertainment. The stars of the film do a good job making sure to wear their faces at disbelief at all times. Keanu Reeves will never top his career-defining performance in ""Point Break"", but this film gives him a great opportunity to show off his hero face. A face that the actor wears so very well. Laurence Fishburne brings his typical ego-driven self to the role. He enunciates carefully and is never without a smirk. It's a graceful performance. It's the two relatively new actors that got my attention. Carrie-Anne Moss brings a disarming toughness to her acting. You really believe that she could take out an entire group of armed men. But it's Hugo Weaving as the bad guy that really takes the acting honors. By choosing to use his voice over typical braun, Weaving makes for a very menacing villain.

And only the Wachowski Brothers know what to do with Joe Pantoliano. Here, like in ""Bound"", he makes his role all his own. Many in the screening that I attended were shocked at the complexity of the film's action sequences. I couldn't help but feel a weird case of deja-vu(especially the tired ""Time Slice"" effect).

Steven Norrington practically reinvented the hand to hand fight scene in his overrated ""Blade"". Every time a punch was thrown in that film, the effects would show the guy being thrown across the room. In ""The Matrix"", the action feels oddly similar. Seeing the two back to back would make for a very interesting double feature. Like ""Bound"" though, the Wachowski Brothers just cannot stage a action scene without the whole moment feeling ice cold. You begin to watch ""cool"" shots instead of a truly kinetic action sequence. I couldn't help but roll my eyes during most of the climax. The computer effects are wonderfully done, practically seamless. But they have been done before, leaving the highly original plot to ""The Matrix"" feeling stale in the end. I try not to seem to jaded, because I did love the movie's complete unabashed free fall into a world you cannot understand in one viewing. The film is 99% expostition and 1% payoff. That is one, of many, gifts the Wachowski Brothers have. They can spin a yarn like no other. Whether or not the public takes to this remains to be seen. But if I know film-geeks at all, I can tell you right now that this picture will have a long shelf life for years to come.----------- 9","1"
"Liedzeit","Disgrace to the human race","22 July 1999","Take a bit from ""Men in Black"" (leave the humor out) something from ""Last Man Standing"" (leave good acting out) from ""Twelve Monkeys"" (leave real suffering and compassion out) and take half a dozen other ones (like some ""Martial Arts"") mix it and get a block buster. Hey, add a deep philosophical idea like that maybe everything is unreal!

It sounds like a joke but it is not. They actually got away with it with ""The Matrix"". I mean probably every bright 15 year old comes up with the idea one day that everything is fake that somehow only he (or she?) can see through it. And I do not say you cannot make a film out of it but has the result to be like this? The Matrix is by far the most stupid film I ever saw. I want to believe in bizarre concepts but this is so mind-boggingly stupid that it would mean too much honor to even start talking about it. I have seen a lot of senseless violence but this must get a price for the best pretext: They can ""beam"" into a particular ""space-time"" point of the program but not quite so our heroes have to literally shoot their way through. Amazing! The sad thing about it is that people actually enjoy the crap which makes me think that the Matrix probably is true after all. Since it seems unlikely that real people with a mind of their own can take the film seriously or enjoy it there must be some brain-washing or programming going on. My girl friend nearly left me once because I liked a ""horrid"" movie like ""Twelve Monkeys"" and even she liked The Matrix. She probably hopes that Jesus will look and act like Keanu Reeves at his next coming. What a depressing thought. If the only good thing to say about a film is that visual effects were up to standard one should leave it. The sun glasses were pretty cool though.","10"
"Space_Lord","Changed the way movies were made..","29 May 2005","Only after a recent viewing of The Matrix did I realise how much of an impact this film has had on the film-making industry. Think about it. Fight scenes, action sequences, 'bullet time' have all been used (ripped off)in other movies. The Matrix has not lost it's impact since its release in 1999. I remember back when I first saw the film the question everyone wanted answered was 'What is the Matrix?'. Nobody was sure what to expect, and as a result the movie was an absolutely mind blowing experience. When people asked me how the film was, I simply said they HAD TO watch it themselves to form their own opinion. Even though everyone knows what the Matrix is now, it's still one of the greatest sci fi action films ever.","6"
"nathandm-75297","Over 20 years old, and it's STILL the best.","12 February 2023","There's a scene in The Matrix that perfectly highlights what makes the movie so brilliant from both a story and a thematic perspective.

It's the scene where Neo first meets The Oracle. As Neo enters, The Oracle is baking cookies and says she'll be with him in a minute and to not worry about the vase. Neo responds ""What vase?"" turning around and immediately knocking over a vase that shatters on the floor, to which The Oracle replies ""That vase."" Neo apologies. The Oracle assures him not to worry about it. Neo asks ""How did you know?"" The Oracle answers ""What's really going to bake your noodle later on is, would you still have broken it if I hadn't said anything?""

This exchange very ingenuously displays the main motif of The Matrix which is fate. Are any of us really in control of our own lives, is choice just an illusion?

As the meeting continues, The Oracle asks ""Do you think that you're the one? Neo responds, ""Honestly, I don't know."" There's a sign above the door that's in Latin. The Oracle tells Neo that the sign says ""Know Thy Self."" The Oracle explains to Neo ""being the one is just like being in love, no one can tell you you're in love, you just know it."" What happens next is brilliant.

The Oracle tells Neo, that he is not that one. But of course, by doing that, she is really telling Neo (and the audience) that he is the one, but no one can tell him that because he has to figure that out for himself. Would Neo have gone on to discover that he is the one by saving Morpheus's life if The Oracle told him that he was? It all goes back to the vase. Would Neo have broken it if The Oracle hadn't said anything? As Morphoues would tell Neo later on after saving him from the agents thus confirming to both him and Trinity that he is in fact the one, Morpheus explains to Neo ""There's a difference between knowing the path, and walking the path.""

The Matrix is one of the greatest examples of a movie having its cake and eating it too. On one hand, the film is an incredibly thought-provoking sci-fi story that brings up themes of fate and choice. And on the other hand, the film is also one of the most exciting action movies of all time with jaw-dropping fight sequences and state-of-the-art special effects that still look amazing today even though the movie is well over 20 years old at this point.

Few films can find that perfect balance of crowd-pleasing action with deep, meaningful themes, but The Matrix makes it look effortless. It's one of the greatest action movies of all time, it's one of the greatest sci-fi movies of all time, and it's one of the greatest MOVIES of all time, period.","10"
"warren-87235","It's okay","15 July 2021","The Matrix is an odd one... I've watched it probably four or five times over the years. It's one of those movies that, given the high regard everyone else holds it in, I sometimes re-watch when memory fades enough for me to think ""Maybe I should give it another chance...""

A recent re-watch pretty much confirmed my original assessment, which has always been that it was 'okay'. As far as similarly themed movies go, from the same period, I always much preferred Dark City, eXistenZ, or even The Thirteenth Floor.

The Matrix has some neat ideas, and it's visually very stylised, but I never find myself warming to any of the characters. The story just kind of washes over you in a pretentious mix of edgy, long, black coats, superfluous sunglasses, and slow-motion gunfire, interspersed with tell-don't-show monologues.

It's difficult to warm to characters who all constantly wear tight leather, long cloaks and sunglasses (even in dark rooms) for absolutely zero reason, beyond looking 'cool' for the camera. In fact, it's actually rather foolish because they're trying to blend in to the Matrix, and shouldn't wish to bring attention to themselves.

Regarding the characters, there's almost zero building of the lead, Keanu Reeve's 'Neo', before he is thrust into events. After that point, he is simply someone things happen to. I'm not necessarily saying that more time was required (though it wouldn't have hurt) but good writing and good direction can fill out a character very quickly and effectively. We never get to feel or learn anything about Neo. It could be argued that this is the whole point. Perhaps the Wachowskis considered his life irrelevant, 'before' his release. Either way, he's an empty shell of a character.

Laurence Fishburne's 'Morpheus' is probably the only one that has any real depth, as the single-minded zealot and leader of the group.

Oddly enough, after Morpheus two of the most defined characters are Cypher (A traitor who wants to return to the Matrix) and Agent Smith (An AI hunting Neo). They actually have scenes that establish their feelings and motivations, which are all sorely lacking for anyone else. It's all tell, not show.

There's also a romantic element that feels unearned, and non-existent until required. Carrie-Anne Moss' 'Trinity' seems to have feelings for Neo merely because she's supposed to (as informed off-screen by the Oracle). Neo knows nothing of this, and there are no hints of his attachment, until suddenly, at the end, they kiss as though we're witnessing a moment of great depth and emotion.

As for the 'philosophy' of the film, I can't help but feel a lot of people read in more than is there. The Matrix is all surface deep, but skirts around interesting topics in such a way that people who wish to see more depth can do so.

Oddly, as an action lover, I also find The Matrix leaves me cold. It's reasonably fun, but I never feel particularly engaged with events. There's something that always feels 'detached' about the action. Perhaps it's simply that the action always feels blatantly about the visuals, rather than the characters being in _any_ danger whatsoever?

Out of the similarly themed films mentioned above, The Matrix has dated the most. It may have been the most influential, stylistically, but it screams late 90s (which, admittedly, may be because it's a victim of its own success, as the film that perhaps most affirmed that look and style).

A lot of it doesn't really stand up to much logic. For example, there's a scene where Agent Smith first has Neo in custody, and is able to block his mouth with flesh, clearly implying their ability to alter the 'code' of the simulation on specific people. This is never used again (Though admittedly, you could argue that they only had this ability while he was _in_ the Matrix properly, as opposed to hooked into it externally).

They also have a biomechanical 'bug', that is obviously only a code-representation of a tracer program, but both of these things establish the ability to bring unusual 'out-of-place' items into The Matrix, despite the supposed 'rules' of the code. If that level of manipulation is possible, why don't the agents manifest with bigger weapons? Bombs that simply blow up large areas to get their targets? Helpful devices that prowl the area they're hunting? But no, it's all about the visuals. The men in black suits and sunglasses(again) and single, powerful handguns that can fire in slow motion.

I can't rate The Matrix too low, because there's nothing really _bad_ in it. It tells its story, it has plenty of action, and has some interesting ideas. I always feel I should like it more than I do, but frankly, it leaves me a bit cold. It's all flash and little substance, but with a lot of detail to _imply_ substance that isn't really there.","10"

"MadReviewer","Everything That ""Phantom Menace"" Wanted To Be (may contain spoilers)","16 May 2001","""The Matrix"", which owes its look and style to modern films (""Blade Runner"", any Hong Kong martial arts movie starring Jet Li), actually tells a mythical story more reminiscent of the tales of Hercules, or of Robin Hood. Despite its ingenious sci-fi trappings, at its core ""The Matrix"" is a simple tale of good versus evil, David versus Goliath . . . and it introduces its audience to an unexplored, wondrous mythos of murky history. In the process of telling its tale, ""The Matrix"" hints at a richly plotted past that's never fully defined, but only hinted at with offhanded scraps of dialogue. In this manner, it introduces a fictional world in many as breathtaking as the original ""Star Wars"" did twenty-two years earlier -- but ""The Matrix"" also tells a compelling story, unlike the more contemporary ""Phantom Menace"".

The hero of ""The Matrix"" is Neo (Keanu Reeves), who at first glance is just a geeky software programmer at a dull and boring company, looking to earn a paycheck just like everybody else. At home, though, in the small hours of the night, he's a computer hacker, and a good one. His hacking activities draw the attention of two cyberpunk iconoclasts: Morpheus (Laurence Fishburne), who exudes Zen-Master cool; and Trinity (Carrie-Anne Moss), a leather-wearing femme fatale. Morpheus and Trinity reveal a profound truth about the world to the disbelieving Neo: the world doesn't exist. Everything that seems real is in fact a forced form of virtual reality, designed to make the people of the world blindly subservient to an alien-run ""system."" Morpheus and his group of cyber-rebels want to bring this system -- ""The Matrix"" -- down, and firmly believe that Neo is the messiah-like ""One"" who can lead his rebels to victory.

The look of ""The Matrix"" is absolutely fantastic. Taking a page out of literary works like William Gibson's ""Mona Lisa Overdrive"", the film blends film noir with ""dirty"" high tech -- there's nothing bright and shiny in ""The Matrix""; nothing to suggest the happy future of ""The Jetsons"". What's left is a gritty world where both intellect and imagination rule. From this world, directors Larry and Andy Wachowski create an epic comic-book conflict where the conflict between good and evil is blown up into slick, stylized, spectacular proportions. The special effects, which includes CGI, traditional animation techniques, model work, and martial arts wire work, are all blended to make jaw-dropping action sequences . . . and to enhance the story. (The opening scene with Trinity alone makes the film worth watching). I don't know if anybody really knows what cyberspace will ultimately look like, but I hope when the time comes when people can immerse themselves in a world of virtual reality, it looks as cool as it does in ""The Matrix"".

The performances, for the most part, are perfect for the film. Keanu Reeves doesn't exactly flex his acting chops as the impassive Neo, but the low-key approach seems appropriate for the role. As Morpheus, Laurence Fishburne is sensational, making the character a perfect mix of a martial arts master, a cryptic philosopher, and a full-blown action hero. Fishburne never raises his voice once during the film, but he has so much presence and confidence, he still comes across as the most commanding, authoritative character in the entire movie. Hugo Weaving is also impressive as the main villain, Agent Smith, although by the end of the film he's glowered and barked exasperated orders so many times, it looks like he's watched Tommy Lee Jones in ""The Fugitive"" once too often. The biggest waste of a character, however, is Carrie-Anne Moss and Trinity, who still shines despite the criminal under-use of her character. Trinity absolutely sets the incredible tone of ""The Matrix"" in the opening scene, showing off her potential as possibly one of the greatest female action heroes in cinematic history . . . and then she's immediately relegated to supporting character status the instant Neo and Morpheus show up. Memo to the Wachowski Brothers: Actually USE Trinity in the ""Matrix"" sequels; it'd be nice to see her live up to what was hinted at in the first film.

""The Matrix"" presents a number of interesting concepts, ranging from the philosophical nature of existence itself to the pure adrenaline rush of combat in the cybernetic world. (Although, it's slightly disappointing to see that despite all the brilliant originality of `The Matrix', wars are still apparently fought with mundane nine-millimeter handguns and AK-47s.) These concepts alone would make `The Matrix' a terrific movie, but they're presented with such panache, the film rockets into the realm of the all-time greats. `The Matrix' is nearly everything one could hope for from a sci-fi blockbuster.

It's something that should be viewed cold, without any prior knowledge. Only then will you understand why this movie is so much damn fun.

"adamjohns-42575","Is this the real life? Is it just fantasy?","2 July 2021","Much like 'The Truman Show' I have always thought that what I call life can't possibly be real. I think I might consider being watched by millions or billions of people a more enjoyable alternative than being taken out of the matrix though. However, I would question anyone who wanted to watch my life unfolding, especially the bits where I pick my nose or scratch my bum!

The actual concept of the Matrix story isn't bad, as I've said, I can believe that this flimsy reality we live in isn't real, but I might be content to carry on regardless, rather than be taken out of it as Neo is. I, of course could never be considered special or necessary to change the future of the world, so perhaps it's best that they went after Neo instead.

It's almost as if the aliens from 'The War Of The World's' succeeded in taking over the planet and then used the human race to fuel a need. And then Laurence Fishburne came along to disrupt their plans.

Neo's adventures aren't too boring, but I'm not sure that Keanu was the best man for the job. He's still very much playing Ted ""Theodore"" Logan, if Ted finally gave up on The Wyld Stallyions and realised that he was actually quite good with computers. Perhaps Bill was holding him back? Although they may still be sharing the same brain cell?

It almost seems to be a vehicle for Keanu to show off his martial arts abilities and show off his skills at talking techno babble. He does stand out quite badly against the other actors who are all very good.

I have to say that I don't think that my brain works on all the levels necessary to follow this story fully. I like the Star Trek philosophy of having them explain everything as if the viewer is a complete and utter idiot, so that we can at least understand it. And slowly too.

This is only the second time that I have seen this one though, so perhaps the third time will be the charm when it comes around again. Maybe 'Reloaded' and 'Revolutuons' will provide me with information that brings more relevance to things from this film?

To be stereotypical, it is quite a ""blokey"" film, there are a lot of bullets used and lots of fighting scenes. I think this is to make it seem cool, but it just feels unnecessary to me, especially as the idea is that they're not even real? It also drags the film out quite a bit too.

That might be why it somehow manages to be fast paced and slow at the same time. Honestly, I don't think I'm that keen on it, but I couldn't say for sure. I feel a bit like I'm stuck in some sort of matrix myself?

"baldfriede","Effect overladen copy of Fassbinder movie","16 June 2006","The Matrix is nothing but a cheap and effect overladen copy of Rainer Werner Fassbinder's excellent TV-movie ""Welt am Draht"", which was broadcast in 1973. Typical Hollywood overblown style, where they think FXs are everything. The Fassbinder movie hardly uses any effects at all, but is ten times as intelligent and a hundred times more enjoyable. Yach! Sorry, brothers Wachowski, have a look at the Fassbinder movie again and learn that less is more. Some people like this kind of action; for me it ruins a movie completely. I was still a kid when I saw that Fassbinder movie, and I would like to see it again; but their are some legal problems about the rights to this movie, and it can't be broadcast at the moment.","4"
"lasse-uk","Neo (the One) must recognize who he is to save humanity","16 March 2004","This film is the best film ever made. Yes the Lord of the rings trilogy was better than the Matrix trilogy but as a single film this is the best ever made.

There are virtually no flaws in this film. Keanu Reeves who is usually a very shallow and superficial actor is surprisingly well casted. Joe Pantoliano is good, Carrie Ann Moss is also delivering the best acting of her carrier. Lawrence Fishbourne does a good job as the super believer Morpheus. However the real star of the film and still (I think) the best villain of all time, Hugo Weaving. He has already become a cult actor simply for his performance in this film.

This is actually two films in one. On one side it is a deep philosophical movie and one the other side it is a kick-ass action movie with the best effects of its time.

"dixxjamm","A beautiful metaphor somehow emerged from this movie","18 April 2006","Why somehow? Because casting Keanu Reeves in a metaphor-movie is always risky business, considering his ""enourmous versatility"". Here is an example: Keanu happy :) Keanu angry :)Keanu hurt :)Keanu in pain :)Keanu having an orgasm :)Keanu trying to be intellectual ............... Apart from that, he seems an OK dude, really.

Is this movie philosophical? Well, yes, it's a pretty nice abstract explanatory image of the absurdity of the world we live in, and it is consistent with a basic philosophical basic presumption on which an entire argumentative algorithm - type system is subsequently based on. The beauty of such a vision is that you can interpret the idea of this movie in a personal way; some of my fellow commentators have brought up issues like: the absurdity of work ?!!!! (mino from Romania - gimme 5, bro). Can't say I don't agree,pal,while you're there in the Matrix, please help Tyler Durden blow up the rest of the banks too, will you?:). What I mostly saw here was a nice metaphor regarding the reaching of a higher understanding of the world. Our bodies are rigid mechanisms, the only way he can achieve freedom is through our minds. We could be rich, glamorous or whatever, but we are still flesh,bones and blood. It's our minds that we have to think about.

Where I don't agree with some of my fellow commentators is that this movie has a religious dimension. Every time something like ""The Matrix"" appears on the market, there will be hoards of people joining that big 'ol atheist love parade. The same with E.T.,War of the Lords and the SF-movement generally and...the newest jewel encrusted in the existentialist frustration crown: The DaVinci Code. I mean, give me a break, I'm not a religious person, but use your own brain and generate your own ideas when it comes to faith and God. If you can't, that's absolutely OK, but better turn to traditional religions rather than the Watchowski Brothers.

Having said that, the movie is very entertaining and nicely done. What I disliked a bit was the video-clip type of filming and the very clean advertisement-type ""feel"" of the movie. Also the dialog was sometimes overly preachy, although as I said earlier, the basic idea is great.I would have taken one point out of the deserved 8 because of Keanu R., but since one of man's most expressive features are the eyes, and Keanu R. is wearing sunglasses for most of the movie, we don't have to look to often into the eyes of KEN, so it's bearable.

"Marsha2020","Philosophical and eye-pleasing","18 April 2020","I rewatched the Matrix again yesterday after last having seen it more than 10 years ago or so. There are at least two features of the Matrix that are truly unique, iconic, epic even - the visual side and the philosophical side. The visual: every single shot of this movie is so beautiful, every second of it! The green-black background, the whole cyber-punk feel, the latex, the shabbiness of the interiors, the action scenes with bullets and water... And then the second philosophical part: watch closely where Neo stashes his cash - a book by Jean Baudrillard (Simulacra and Simulation, chapter on Nihilism). The theories thrown out there: humans are a virus (agent Smith), humans are slaves in the matrix (Morpheus, the name of the god of dreams). It challenges the nature of our reality, reminding us of being mindful of our lives. There are lots of analyses that have been written on the background of it all, so i won't be delving into that here. Just wanted to note what a beautiful jem of a movie (and philosophy) this one is.","4"

The concept of a world which is a mere shadow of reality created to enslave is one of Plato's most importance concepts created centuries before Christ. Ancient Greece philosophers were close to the truth before our world was cast into darkness by the monotheistic slave religions.

Not for the action nor the special effects but for honouring plato's understanding of the weakness of human kind as presented in the allegory of the cave this is a great and important movie.","9"

The casting, acting and production of the movie is great. They chose the perfect actor of Agent Smith and Neo. They suited their roles perfectly and did an excellent job. The filming and camera angles were great and made the action scenes as good as they were.

"mikepwong","Refreshing","15 May 2003","Rating: 8 out of 10. Directed by Andy Wachowski and Larry Wachowski. `The Matrix' is an action packed science fiction story full of movie aphorisms, but fortunately has many innovative ideas. The surprise hit of the summer of 1999 grossing over $170 million, `The Matrix' was the fifth highest grossing movie in North America that year.

I love many genres of film, but I mostly watch drama or thriller movies, and generally avoid the action genre. So I was pleasantly surprised by `The Matrix', it was a great diversion that was welcomed when I first watched it. Having just seen `Matrix Reloaded' today, I feel the need to see this movie again sometime soon.

There were two things I didn't like about this movie. One, the acting is unremarkable and nearly nonexistent, there is more dancing than real acting. Two, the dialogue is terribly cliched.

Even with its flaws, `The Matrix' isn't bad at all and worth viewing for anyone that has not seen it yet.","10"
"Robin-55","Real deal sci-fi.","23 March 1999","This is a ludicrous film. Loud, brash and generally bombastic at every turn. Fortunately, it knows this and wears these features on its sleeve. It is knowing and ironic and has its tongue firmly in its cheek. The ideas, which will no doubt be hailed as 'startlingly original', are all stolen from Philip K. Dick, but at least its stealing from the best. It is basically familiar territory, territory mined by Dark City only a few years back. The Matrix, however, is an immeasurably superior film, simply by virtue of the fact that it does not take itself seriously. At times, the characters play their ludicrous lines so deadpan, it achieves a bizarre spooflike quality. Fishburne's performance, in particular, is splendidly arch as he delivers lines like 'Welcome to the desert of the real' with a misplaced Shakespearean grandeur.

The effects are also ground-breaking and mostly effective. The use of slo-mo to eroticize the violence is reminiscent of Woo or even Peckinpah but with the use of clever CGI, Matrix achieves the feel of ballistic science. The shootouts do not revel in the familiar 'operatic grandeur' that has been a staple since Bonnie and Clyde. Rather, they play like FBI reconstructions of shootouts. We see the paths that bullets take, the positions of spent shell casings. It is shamelessly fetishistic and utterly irrelevant to the film's central idea but spectacular and exciting nonetheless.

I hate virtually everything. Dark City was a nauseating waste of my time. Everything released over the last three summers has seemed despicably lazy film making. Godzilla, Armageddon...these films are offensive cynical money pits without a single grain of wit, a single interesting idea to tie the whole rotten mess together. Therefore, I fully anticipated hating the Matrix with equal vigor. As it was, I was pleasantly surprised. While I would make no claims that it was in any way a classic, it certainly appeared to have been put together with a great deal of love and humour and these attributes go a long way. It was overlong and unnecessarily portentous at times but these are minor quibbles when one is being bombarded by such a wealth of outrageous imagery and ideas. What other film could link Dick, Christ, Alice in Wonderland, Monty Python, Woo, Jackie Chan, and still find time to make Keanu Reeves look good?","10"
"Nortonisgod","Garbage","6 January 2004","Why does everyone love these movies? They are junk. The story is none existent and full of rhetorical nonsense that's randomly placed and stolen from philosophers, the acting is pathetic, and I still believe the only reason people like this movie is because they are hypnotized by its ""dazzling"" special effects. People consider these ground-breaking special effects...no. Star Wars was ground-breaking, The Matrix is just people fighting for no reason other than to show off their ""great"" CGI. I sure hope they don't decide to make a 4th. 3/10 stars.","9"
"p_h_a_r_o_a_h_e","The Matrix is pretty good, but overrated.","28 August 2008","This is a very good movie. Visually, The Matrix is pretty much at the top of the Sci-Fi genre. The plot is solid, Keanu Reeves doesn't suck, and it's a unique film.

But, why is it overrated? Just because I said the acting doesn't suck does not mean that it's particularly good. This movie is good, but it's certainly not in the top 100 films of all time. There are much better movies out there that rely on clever story telling, have better actors, and there are some with equally as cool visuals. If you know what to look for, the plot is pretty predictable. All of the foreshadowing in this movie insults your intelligence rather than adding to the tension. Also, the slow motion sequences become stupid after watching the movie a couple of times, and they are in an abundance.

I used to be a fan of this movie, but once I saw Dark City I realized how much room for improvement there truly was.","10"
"TDVideo","This movie sucks","30 August 2000","Is it just me, or have the movies gotten worse and worse lately? This is perhaps Keanu Reeves worst performance to date in a film. (And considering the fact that he was also in such films as Point Break, and the ""Bill & Ted"" movies, that's saying a lot!) The plot was ridiculous. And don't try to give me the line ""oh well, you just didn't get it!"" I got it. A two year old could follow that plot. That doesn't make it good. Case in point, near the end of the film, Neo is dead. But wait!!!! Trinity then bends over Neo's corpse and tells him that he has to survive because a fortune teller has deemed her to be the one who would fall in love with The Chosen One. Then to make things worse, he actually does come back to life. What a crock of... I think you get the point. If you really want to see a great movie about a man who has to fight against an unbeatable enemy, watch Dark City! I give this movie a 1 only because it has amazing special effects, (both visual effects and sound effects) otherwise the movie would have gotten a negative 5!","6"

That something or more correctly someone(s) were manufacturing events, and you know what events I'm referring to, to make our reality a living hell and there is simply no logical reason or explanation for it? Well the Matrix is a possible explanation (doubtful but possible although I have a much more cogent explanation). Every aspect of this film was groundbreaking! The soundtrack was impeccable, opening with Rob Zombie's Dragula, followed by others like Manson's Rock is Dead, Clubbed to Death, Rage Against the Machine's Wake up, etc. it simply was a groundbreaking soundtrack with no equal. Has Laurence Fishburne ever been better in anything else? His performance, as well as his co-stars, was very, very good but his stood out for me!

"timefreezer7","Entertaining average film","28 February 2002","Just like the case with the vastly overrated Blade Runner : professional job from a couple of good technicians but nothing more . I will have to admit that the script had some potential but the quite amateurish direction by the Wachowski Brothers almost ruined the entire effort . Before I summarize the plot , I would like to point out that I am extremely upset with the comments ""Philosophical"" , ""thought provoking"" . ARE YOY FEELING OK ???? Do you seriously believe that the script is ""complex"" and the film ""requires more than one viewing"" !!!!!!?????? (just like the case with the overrated Usual Suspects which is as simple and obvious as a cockroach on a white carpet) . If that 's so then I will strongly discourage you from EVER watching ""Twelve Monkeys"" , ""Dune"" or ""Sphere"" because inevitably your brain cells will short circuit . It seems like the majority of sci-fi lovers have never read sci-fi short stories !!! The concept that we all live in a virtual illusional reality is not at all original . I can recite numerous examples but I will just stick to "" Marianna "" , a very short story by Fritz Lang where the heroine discovers that her mansion and her husband were holographic hallucinations and even herself was nothing but a wish coming true . The terrifying truth was that her real self (from were she was projected) was institutionalized in an asylum and was treated with an alternative personality/wish fulfillment program. Another short fantasy story claimed that very few people are indeed true and the rest were again the result of the subconscious materialization from the real ones' brains (their ""soulmates"" conveniently coming true from the wishes of their counterparts) . I can go on and on but I don 't have to . Even for the movie fans which haven 't read sci-fi novels , it is impossible that they haven 't watched similar films . The infiltration in an alternative reality , artificially constructed , is present in ""Tron"" (1982) with Jeff Bridges or in ""Total Recall"" (1990) where the question what is real and what is not , is inherent throughout the film . The reviewers who see correlation between Matrix and Plato 's philosophical theories make me want to laugh . On top of that there are the ridiculous ""biblical symbolisms"" the film-makers have insisted to include and publicize . I don 't think that by calling the ship ""Nabouchodonosor"" or by killing off the hero and resurrecting him there are christianic references . Then Ripley in Alien Resurrection should be titled a Christ figure or we can suppose that the ""Janus"" plan in ""Judge Dredd"" should be regarded as a metaphor for the Roman Empire and the ruthless games between the Caesar and the Senate !!!!! And the by the way , the pattern of the (chosen) One is omnipotent in almost every sci-fi , with the most notable case Luke Skywalker in Star Wars . The dystopic future with machines taking over humans is of course ""borrowed"" blatantly by the Terminator and the plot device ""Dying inside the virtual reality truly will kill you "" is apparently inspired from ""Nightmare on elm street"" .

Ripping - off so many movies and getting away with so called ""profound originality"" (!) is a great achievement by the Wachowski Bros and proves how brain washing the critics can be . Excuse me but I just want to get it off my chest . I can 't stand seeing Matrix with an average of 8.5 while brilliant movies like ""Sphere"" are stuck in 5.1 simply because the critics (for various reasons) decided to pan them .

On to the movie : we have a very large introduction (45 minutes maybe longer) before Neo (Keanu Reeves) gets to the ""real world"" with the guidance of ""Morpheus"" (Lawrence Fishburn) . If this introduction was shortened we would have a better movie . Anyway the middle part of the movie is undoubtly the best . After we learn the background of this strange society we are introduced to the submarine crew (Morpheus' friends) . I cannot spoil what happens next but I will say the moody atmosphere is highly successful . The climate is depressing , awe - inspiring and contains all the elements of a great existential drama .

But hey this is Hollywood and the final 40 minutes are frittered away : after the 3 leads (Reeves , Fishburn , Moss) are trapped in the illusional world they are trying to escape and the film degenerates to a poor shoot 'em up with irritating constant noisy gunfire and silly video-gameish action scenes to satisfy the Playstation 13 year old freaks who probably digged them and pitched the Matrix to the aforementioned 8.5 . The karate scenes are decent but other than that the SFX stink BAD BAD BAD . Not only the repeated gunfire is annoying but the much hyped slow motion special effects are unbelievably c**ppy and patchily edited (""Scary Movie"" to its credit did these scenes justice!!!!!!) One scene in the roof of a scyscraper is the perfect example . We see the bad guy shooting Neo . Then we see Neo verging backwards in slow motion . Then we hear Neo squeak ""Agh!!"" and then we see the flight path of the bullet and we are supposed to presume that Neo was hit . Bottom case : we never actually SAW the bullet . Was the budget that low ?

I will lie if I say that I didn 't enjoy the Matrix . But it is very overrated . Sets and costumes are adequate and despite of the many flaws in the direction there are memorable scenes like the visit to the Oracle 's home or the climactic chase of Neo and the baddies . I can 't say more in order not to reveal plot secrets . On the acting side : the 3 leads give quite solid performances , nothing great but passable but I believe the supporting cast stole the show . My personal favorite from the crew members is Tank and I am sad he won 't be in the sequel . Speaking of the sequel I will once again refer to the faults of the film . Overlong introduction ,weak finale , lousy SFX BUT if they manage to jettison all these defects and they manage to reproduce the mystic , melancholic climate of the middle sequence then Matrix 2 will be a h**l of a sequel . Therefore I conclude with hope that in Matrix 2 they will wipe off the demerits and they will enhance the virtues to maximum . As it is Matrix is a fairly enjoyable could-have-done-much-more film . A controversial

The fundamental question that had moviegoers and critics across the world bedazzled in the year of 1999. Science fiction and action movies would never be the same after this blockbuster stormed the scene with its blazingly original visuals and bizarre yet detailed concepts.

Thomas Anderson, a.k.a. Neo (Reeves) is a software programmer who is living two lives. In one he is Thomas Anderson, a regular Joe who goes to work, goes to church, and ""helps his landlady take out her garbage."" In the other life, he is Neo, a computer hacker who is guilty of essentially every computer crime there is a law for. One night he's asleep at his computer, when his computer starts talking to him. Not literally, but flashing text across the screen. He follows the instructions his computer is giving him and goes to a club where he meets Trinity (Moss), another hacker, or at least that's what he thinks.

When he's at work the next day, a package from FedEx comes to him containing a cell phone. As soon as he gets the phone in his hand, it starts ringing, and Morpheus (Fishburne) is on the other end of the line with him, telling him that the FBI are here to get him. Neo stands up, and sure enough, the fibbies are over at the elevator, ready to come and arrest him. Morpheus gives Neo instructions on how to escape the feds and get to safety, but Neo can't muster the courage to go out on a ledge (literally) and take a scaffold to the roof, so he gets taken in by the feds.

After an interesting encounter with the FBI, Neo is contacted again by Morpheus, who tells him where he should go if he wants to meet. They meet, and Neo asks what the matrix is. In the words of Morpheus, ""Unfortunately no one can be told what the matrix is. You have to see it for yourself."" Neo has two options. Take the blue pill, and he continues his life how it has been going. Take the red pill, and enter a whole new world. Of course, he opts for the red pill, and he is released from the matrix and wakes up in the real world.

So what is the matrix then? In a nutshell, it's a computer driven simulation that keeps human minds busy so that machines can harvest our bodies for power. Morpheus freed Neo from the matrix because he believed that Neo was essentially the savior of mankind, foretold by the prophecies.

I think that's enough of a summary of the gist of the movie. The rest of it you just have to see for yourself. It's truly an amazing action movie with some of the coolest and craziest visuals you could possibly imagine. It's just one of those things that you have to see for yourself to actually believe.

That's been written about for years and years. If this is material for your philosophical musings than you are truly a sad, sad boy.","1"

At the end of the movie a group of twenty-something guys were exiting ahead of us and one of the guys said, ""that was pretty excellent!"" I thought, ""Well, I guess it's working for its demographic."" I think the thing that bothered me most was that there were some cool possibilities that didn't pan out.

Aside from the special effects, which I guess were a big deal in their day, you will be subjected to the same old tired Hollywood formula of the protagonist being invincible and dodging every bullet, while the bad guys die by the dozen. The fight scenes are so bad. Example: One guy does the punching while the other guy just stands there absorbing the hits, Then they switch and the OTHER guy does the punching while the original guy just takes it. The martial arts scenes are so bad...I mean....don't rip off Bruce Lee from decades before and then produce WORSE kung fu fight scenes than he did. Supposedly set in the future but conventional weapons, aircraft, architecture etc seem to be the only things available. And then there is the appearance of unexplained weird creatures that just seem to be there to fill in the blanks of a weak story. Hey! It still has a great rating and got a bunch of awards!

"jannisschaefer","An overrated movie","22 September 2020","I watched this movie when I was a kid. I liked it, I thought it was a good movie. But now that I have rewatched it again after such a long time, my opinion of it has been tarnished. This is a pretentious movie desperately trying to convey that it means more than meets the eye. There are so many issues sprinkled throughout that the majority just seems to ignore. For example Neo is able to hide from the agents the matrix dispatched to catch him, by hiding behind a thin wall... Shouldn't these agents be able to track him anywhere he goes. He's still plugged into the matrix so it makes no sense. Or what about their brilliant disguises they use to blend in on their covert operations. Eventhough their outfits make them stand out, everyone acts like they're normal people Just strolling along on the sidewalk. Speaking of acting, the acting in this movie is bland and feels incredibly contrived. Inherently I find the idea of a movie inspired by anime intriguing and interesting, but the execution prevents me from giving it more than an average designation. It's still a decent movie. Many scenes look nice except for that constant green tint the matrix has for some unknown reason. The action that doesn't involve bullet time is still pretty nice and some of the philosophical stuff was very interesting, like ""there is no spoon"", for example. All in all a decent movie that doesn't hold up as well as people would like to believe it does.","1"

The visual effects still don't look phony 'til this very day! And when I watched it again when I was older and obviously more mature, I love the story line. It made the movie a million times better! The reason I was blown away again when I watched it was because of the storyline itself. It just comes together so well. About this perception of reality and the human race living in an artificial world made sense for all the action-packed sequences to cross boundaries. If you like the movie for the action, that's fine. but if you want a full blown movie, here it is. The Y2K of film. The movie makes sense story wise, emotionally, and even if you judge the action to look phony, it'll all make sense when you see it. Perfect film.

"roark183","Fast Paced Action Thriller, but no science","14 April 2002","Matrix presents interesting concepts about time and space and certainly has plenty of action. However, while it is billed as science fiction, there is little to no science. The movie's greatness all lies in its action.

In a science fiction movie I always hope for some science being part and parcel to the plot. There are few such movies out there that do this. The Philadelphia Experiment (1984), Andromeda Strain, & The Thirteenth Floor do this. But they are few and far between. Some science fiction novels that do this are Dune, Battlefield Earth (the best in this regard), Resurrection.

That movie was entertaining and suspenseful. This is just the worst. You like science fiction? see ""Last Night."" You want another film about a manufactured universe? How about ""The Truman Show?"" This was a total waste of time, and I'm afraid its rating as #31 on the all-time honors list, at this writing, is just a testament to the fact that too few people my age can really use the internet.

That's not appropriate for the movie's overall quality. There is some good here, don't get me wrong, but it's not as if it's some Godlike Sci Fi! They really think this movie is better than Alien? Better than Blade Runner? Better than Star Wars A New Hope? Better than Planet of the Apes? Better than 2001 A Space Odyssey?

First off the whole Bullet Time thing is just a ridiculous slow mo effect that must have really looked cool back then! In the modern day, this ""Bullet Time"" did not age well and looks ridiculously dumb not ridiculously awesome. As for the sound effects used, I honestly thought The Phantom Menace was more innovative than this movie. The story itself isn't that unique or special, I've seen other movies tackle these concepts before. Hell, one Twilight Episode is all I need to get what this movie is about and yet people didn't freak out then! I don't think Neo is a particularly interesting character and I find his story dull and lackluster. There are a few other things I don't like but none of these are as prevalent as to what is listed above.

As for what I like, I gotta admit that I liked Morpheus and thought he was an interesting character. And while the story is kinda unoriginal, I still liked it and they do it well just not as amazingly as everybody seems to think. I also admit that the gun battles are actually pretty damn cool and some of the visual effects really are breathtaking even if once again they're overrated. The one word I would use to describe this movie is ""cool!"" This is a very cool movie and I do recommend that you check it out and get your own opinion on this still popular movie.

I give this movie a 7/10 because I don't think it's all that revolutionary but I still enjoy it and I might watch it again sometime and I'm glad it saw it in the first place. If somebody decided that ""No, it really is a masterpiece"" or conversely ""Yes, this movie is garbage that's outdated"" then you are welcome to think that but for me I see it as a ""cool"" sci fi that's outrageously overrated.","5"

Yeah, it has special effects... big deal. SE doesn't make a movie and should never be the high point. It also has the pseudo martial arts flying around the room crud that so many movies unfortunately use today.

"gagewyn","Nice mood piece, but really big plot holes.","12 February 2000","This movie has a nice feel to it with the sleek stars, martial arts, distopian future with artificial intelligence overlords theme, and black leather and guns. Basically this is all it has, but it is enough to justify watching.

The main problem I have with this are the gaping plot holes. Firstly why are the robots keeping people alive. Oh sure they say something about harvesting body heat, but more energy would be expended daily in moving food (low energy fluid fuel) to people than could be extracted. Also if they are feeding dead people to the living people their energy source would shrink exponentially. These plot holes could have been easily avoided by not trying to explain anything and showing more Keanu Reeves running on the walls. LetÕs face it this film wasnÕt about plot and the makers probably expect us to equate vague with deep.

In terms of acting Keanu Reeves was actually not that bad. The role calls for him to look cool and be naive and a bit slow, which he is very good at. He is a pretty guy, shame he canÕt act. The other actors are the same. They adequately wear leather or sack cloth and look cool when necessary.

My final advice is to see this if you are drawn to the visual promotional material. DonÕt expect things to make sense or be coherent. This film has a sleek feel to it and an interesting mood, but thatÕs about all.","7"

"Alpengeist","So overrated it makes me sick","7 August 2002","I did not enjoy this film. Yes, I enjoyed the special effects, which were beyond superb, but it takes more than special effects to get me to enjoy a movie. When the Matrix was released, these effects were amazing, something brand new and outrageous, but now they are nothing unusual and when you take away that aspect of the film, you get nothing. You get a stupid, uninteresting plot and a cast of terrible actors, minus Laurence Fishburne. Not that the actors are terrible, just their acting in this movie is terrible. Carrie-Anne Moss and Joe Pantoliano both prove they can act in Memento, but here they just flop. And I can't believe that Keanu Reeves gets cast for any movies because he is just plain miserable, one of the worst actors ever to enter the business. Plot and acting are two things I look for ahead of special effects in a movie. I can enjoy a movie that has absolutely no special effects whatsoever and was filmed with an amateur home video camera, as long as the plot and acting are good. This movie, with a huge budget, wasted all of it on special effects and none of it on teaching the actors how to act or paying the Wachowski's to improve the script and to learn how to direct.

Such a stupid movie, and I can't figure out why it is so popular. Because it was the first to introduce such effects? Does that mean one must automatically love the original, just because it was the first? The Matterhorn Mountain at Disneyland was the first roller coaster to introduce steel tubular track, but is it my favorite steel roller coaster? No. Coca-Cola was released before Pepsi-Cola, but is Coke my favorite soft drink? No. So why must this movie be everyone's favorite just because it was the first to introduce these visual effects? I don't know and won't know. The only answer I ever hear from people as to why they loved this movie is ""Well didn't you see the special effects?"" Screw the special effects. Give me Memento, a movie with virtually no special effects. Give me Field of Dreams. Philadelphia. Even My Dog Skip.

"keuhkokala","Gets better every time I see it","28 August 2003","This site categorizes Action movies rather strange. Sure, some classics like Kurosawa´s the Seven Samurai have action in them, but they are not actually action movies since officially the whole genre began to evolve from the Clint Eastwood movies of the 70´s and George Lucas´s Star Wars and Indiana Jones trilogy. After this, we´ve seen quite a lot of action movies as some of the world´s most successful movies are also. Most of them include a muscled, dumb man like Sylvester Stallone, Jean-Claude van Damme or Chuck Norris killing a lot of terrorists. Some of them, however are a lot more than just murdering terrorists. Some Action movies have a heart, they contain also a lot other beside carnage. Some of these movies are James Cameron´s Aliens and Terminator, Brian Singer´s X-men movies or, of course, the Matrix, which is one of the best action movies of all time.

Ok, so the movie´s plot has some similarities to the Terminator or Blade Runner of something, but they do not have such an imaginative picture of the future or the artificial reality it contains. I hate say it, but the only word I can explain this movies greatness, is cool. It looks cool, it feels cool, all the Action is so cool, that loads of action movies have tried to copy its coolness after this, but in my opinion, they have not succeeded very well.

Yes, this does get better by every watching, as the first time goes marveling at the wonders of the artificial world, evil kung-fu agents, the resistance and even computer effects, which look after four years almost as good as then. For the next couple of times, as you sink ""deeper into the rabbit hole"" you start to think about the philosophical questions this movie gives. And yes, still enjoy the action. It almost deserves a ten, but the movie has a few annoying plot holes and I´m not a big fan of Carrie-Ann Moss, not even in her Catwoman outfit. So, 9/10

The Best bit (May contain SPOILERs): When Trinity and Neo come to the Matrix to rescue Morpheus from the Agents, they have to pass a metal detector at the lobby. When Neo goes through it, it naturally beeps. He reveals to the guard he has a LOT of weapons under his coat. The guard goes: ""Holy Sh*t!"" And the shooting begins!","9"

"bajbij","Over-rated, unoriginal Hollywood style fest","19 May 2002","I loved the Matrix--when it was a film released in 1998 called Dark City, a far superior, character driven entry in the sci-fi genre. The Matrix, with its dazzling special effects, is nothing more than a silly tale of perseption vs reality. Everyone's view of the film seems to be manipulated by the effects. If we were dealing with Blade Runner style effects instead of Doritos inspired ""bullet time"" effects, would the film still be considered as memorable? I highly doubt it. Laurence Fishburne is good as Morpheus, Moss is ok but her character elicits no sympathy or emotion from me, and Keanu Reeves is just ok, but none of these characters are as intriguing as those of Dark City. The kung fu was obviously inspired by the late Hong Kong style of fighting (IE wire fu and CGI instead of actual skills and choreography.) This was designed to make the simpletons of today go ""ooh"" and ""ahh"" while real kung fu afficionados ache over the obvious fakeness and frustration of chop editing, thus inspiring furhter kung fu crap like CROUCHING TIGER, EXIT WOUNDS, and ROMEO MUST DIE. Matrix does boast some wonderful cinematography, but so does Dark City and it boasts a better story along with it, too. I'll give this film a 5 out of because in originality it's not in the top, in style it's not original, in acting it's saved by one, and story, pretty basic but not complex. Dark City is better.","3"
"Gath","This movie is ""the One"" I've been waiting for","8 April 1999","I went in with little idea of what this movie was about. I saw the commercials like everyone else, hit the web page, and decided the movie didn't matter, I just wanted to see the effects. I thought ""the plot sounds a little like Tron"" so I wasn't expecting too much of the story. I remember Keanu Reeves in Bill and Ted's Bogus Success (that is the name of that movie, isn't it?) and I REALLY didn't expect much from the actors (I held out a little hope because of Laurence Fishburne's presence). I was thinking too far back. I should've thought about 2 years ago when I saw the Devil's Advocate in which Keanu turned in a great performance, which he matched if not improved upon in the Matrix. Fishburne and Carrie-Anne Moss completed the triumvirate quite effectively to show us a very well performed movie.

The movie is about these people who live in a simulated world - oh, but I've said too much. Go see it. It's a sci-fi plot I've seen hinted at but never fully formed in this fashion, which I find to be truly unique for this genre of movie.

All elements necessary to give a film a 10 were here...excellent acting, writing, directing, and story-telling, great action scenes, and of course, the sweetest eye-candy ever to hit the silver screen. One of the only movies I've ever watched and then been upset about an hour later because I couldn't watch it again right away. Definitely see this one.

"Mara-Jade-Skywalker-23","I Don't Get the Level of Praise","28 June 2019","Introduction: The Matrix is not a bad movie, I think it's okay. It's just that I think the extensive amounts of acclaim and praise this film gets is not entirely deserved. The Matrix is regarded highly by many as a classic in great film making, but I don't agree with that.

What I Don't Like: Now, everybody knows the story of the Matrix. But what makes it so ahead of it's time? As many say. It centers around a chosen one, who lived a simple life at first, but was destined for so much more. It's been done before. And don't tell me it was because of the concept of the Matrix. It was done before. Episodes of Star Trek did it, other movies did it. The concept of a dream world, or computer simulation has been done many times. And if you ask me, they did it better.

The Matrix doesn't feel like a deep philosophical film, with great action to go along the way. They're all just dumb action films. The acting is bland, the characters are pretty paper thin, and the film just feels dated. Other films to do this concept, such as what I mentioned, and Inception, had more interesting characters. When one of the most famous line of the movie is, ""Whoa"", you have a problem.

And also, have you ever noticed the ridiculous amount of plot holes in this film? They are abundant. From the fact the Matrix exists at all. Why would the machines make it so their batteries had a dreamworld? And also smaller stuff, like in the movie, when Neo was called by Morpheus, claiming, ""the phones are tapped"", and to meet him at a certain location. Why didn't agents respond to that? You think they pay attention that detail. But no. And just more that don't make any sense, and are demonstration of the bad screenwriting in this film.

What I Do Like: Even though I have a lot of criticism with this film. I don't hate it. The effects are quite good, and while they don't as well as most people claim, they were revolutionary for the time. And there are some smart details, like in the visual style. The fact that everything in the Matrix, has a greenish tint to it, hinting at the fact that they live in a computer. And in old 80's computers, there was a lot of green. And I love little details like that. I also think the action's very nicely shot and well put together. And the Matrix, while dull, is harmless, so I can't call it terrible.

Conclusion: I think the Matrix is personally a very overrated film. It's not bad, I just never got the real appeal. The Matrix doesn't feel like it's doing anything new, or interesting with it's already kind of tired premise. The Matrix is just a film that I think needs to be reevaluated. However, if it still goes down in history as a masterpiece of film, I can't do anything to change that. So, enjoy it if you like it. I just was never able to enjoy on the level of others.","10"
"GeorgeRoots","For Its Time, Utter fantastic.","12 September 2014","Again this is another film that was made at the same time ""Star Wars Episode 1"" (1999) was around, and the CGI looks definitively better. ""The Matrix"" was a welcoming edition to the Sci-Fi genre, Inspired by the Wachowski siblings love of cyberpunk, Japanese martial arts and Lewis Carroll. It has an extremely interesting synopsis about reality, considering the dawn of the information age.

Reality (Seen by most humans) is actually a simulation defined as ""The Matrix"", created by sentient machines to wipe out the human population by farming and using their bodies as an energy source. A computer programmer ""Neo"" (Keanu Reeves) learns this truth and is drawn into a rebellion against the machines, involving other people who have been freed from this ""dream world"". All are being chased by ""Agents"" led by the more ruthless ""Agent Smith"" (Hugo Weaving), who wants to stop them from leaving the mainframe.

Keanu Reeves is as wonderfully bland as ever, but turns in a decent performance. Carrie-Anne Moss's character ""Trinity"" became more likable over sequels, and of course Laurence Fishburne as ""Morpheus"" definitely remained the most respectable character throughout the franchise. Either way you look at it the show stealer's is a balance between Laurence Fishburne & Hugo Weaving, their performances are either way over the top or just spot on.

Other than that, it's a spectacle in set pieces, choreography and directing. So many scenes are almost dream like in their fabricated quality, along with the ""reality"" sequences that look really dirty and trashed. ""Bullet Time"" became much more prominently used after the movie, and everyone would start dressing like the characters as parodies were spawned and the comic book reader in me felt that it was heavily similar to Grant Morrison's ""The Invisibles"" (1994-2000).

Final Verdict: If you want A+ action and CGI, mixed with superb Martial Arts in a western landscape. Then I cannot recommend ""The Matrix"" enough. 10/10.","10"
"NuclearNinja","An ageless classic","22 January 2023","What is there not to love about this film.

It is hard to find a film with a better cast of actors, who all deliver. The writing manages not to come across as cheesy or pretentious. Even with the philosophical questions being raised by the content.

The special effects and set design immerse the viewer in the story perfectly. The horror of the real world and the strangely homely feel of The Matrix.

Extremely well choreographed fight scenes and interesting chase scenes enhanced by bending the rules of the matrix.

Although 'The Matrix' is a sci-fi, it almost feels fantastical with prophesies and oracles. These elements bring characters decisions and actions into question and heavily impact the emotion of certain scenes.

I loved it the first time I watched it in my early teens and I still love it now in my early 30's. I'm sure I will get many more years of enjoyment out of it. As long as I forget any of the sequels exist...","5"

There are some really intense action sequences that they were able to create not involving jumping off walls and shooting a huge bank full of people. Like when Neo goes into the Matrix for the very first time. Be prepared to learn something cool about one of the people. Although it does take a little while before Neo goes into the Matrix. A good hour and a bit. But he does some extrordinary things like the kungfu scene and his first jump. And even the first scene when Trinity is in. Whoho. You don't want to miss this. A good story and good special effects. Too bad the sequels aren't coming out till 2003 and 2004. Take my word on it go see this film. 9/10","9"

"niteman","What's all the fuss about?","29 December 1999","Having finally seen the Matrix after hearing people sing its praises for months, I confess I'm a bit baffled as to why it's so popular. It was a good film, yes -- slick visuals, cool effects, nice fight sequences, interesting ideas -- but nowhere near a *great* film, and certainly undeserving of the brou-ha-ha it's been getting.

Great science fiction films are original, they provide a new visual or mental language for the viewer or present old ideas in new ways. Films such as Blade Runner, Alien, Star Wars: A New Hope, and 2001 are examples of that sort of filmmaking. The Matrix is not. The visuals are an uneasy mesh of Blade Runner and Alien, the idea that our world is an illusion was most recently explored in the far superior Dark City, and the mythology smacks of Star Wars. Even though the movie does provide plenty of eye candy, it pays homage to the point of theft.

The movie is also overlong, divests most of its plot twists in the first 30 minutes, relies too heavily on extended slo-mo fight scenes (How many spent rounds do we need to see floating slowly to the ground?), and frequently trips over its own internal logic. But if there is a weak point around which all else seems insignificant, it's Keanu Reeves. His pipe cleaner body and sunken chest don't fit his role as kung-fu master, and when he strikes a 'manly' pose he just looks silly. His acting talent is on par with his other work, which means he says ""whoa"" and looks blank a lot. It's a dangerous thing to base a movie around a non-entity like Reeves -- even when his character has his (cliched) is-he-dead-or-isn't-he scene, I couldn't bring myself to care.

In short, it's a fun movie, a nice action film posing as a sci-fi film, but don't rent it if you're looking for something that will make you think, or something that you haven't seen before.","1"
"Eugenio-4","Where was the story ?","10 May 1999","No head, no tail, only a heap of special effects. The film all in all can be summarized in those words. Incredible persons who perform incredibly, with thousands of bullets flying and none of them reaching the targets, a story almost immaterial and a lot of deja vu worse of their predecessors: Keanu Reeves quoting himself in Little Buddha when he meets the other possible elects, the Blues Brothers or Man in Black for the black glasses, Butch Cassidy and Billy the Kid for the scenes of Reeves coming from behind a column with two guns blasting and so on. What did I forget ? Yes, some indirect advertising of a famous cellular telephone producer (the kind used is so particular .), perhaps not so common in 2199 (when is supposed to be the story), a software house where your chief tells you will be fired if arriving late working (while it is known that usually software houses are opened nearly 24 hours a day). A film to be forgotten.","6"
"Donjon_the_2nd","A movie made by nerds, made for nerds","25 April 2004","If you are some small programmer working for some big company, doing all day the same stupid work you might fall for the idea that your life is not as boring and senseless as it seems (and maybe actually is), but that you are in fact the god and creator of this world. The normal reaction should be: Turn that computer off, take a vacation, maybe seek professional help. You can also make a movie...

Matrix is not boring, it`s tense and it has stunning visuals. But like a good video clip does not make the music worth listening to, a whole bunch of special effects do not make a great movie.

After watching the Matrix I recognized that:

1. I don't get why super-robots, who overwhelmed the whole human kind, are not able to build some nuclear power plants, despite the fact that they really needn't care about radioactive pollution. Instead they get their energy from humans, and if you take a look at their body ""farms"" you must agree that it looks like they are putting a lot more energy into it than they get out of it... A good movie (even if it's science fiction) should provide some ground level logic in its story.

2. I did not care about the characters. They die? Hmmm, okay. Trinity loves Neo? Uh, why is that? Did I miss something? A good movie makes me feel for the characters and understand their reactions. In this point Matrix is a total failure. Ever watched Brazil? You maybe should if you'd like to see a good ""big brother"" picture.

3. This pseudo religious bla bla. Realize that there is no spoon? I realized that there is something else missing somewhere in the story writers head. Well, wouldn't be so bad, if there weren't point 1 and 2.

4. This background theme of being something better than the others. Uh, am I really just some role playing games liking informatics student? Or am I the master of the universe? Look in the mirror, decide for yourself...does not look like Keanu Reeves? What a surprise.

Watch this movie, it won't bore you. But if you think your going to see a REALLY good movie, or even a masterpiece, keep away from it. You will be quite disappointed afterwards.

Ah, and if you like MTV...this is the best movie ever made. ;)

"Empifilmes","So overrated","2 August 2022","This film is a product of its time. A more than obvious metaphor together with empty characters, bad acting and a dialogue that is not even worth mentioning... Like any other of its genre, the film tries to create stakes through our affection for the characters and their relationships. Turns out all emotional scenes are clichés and feel like artificial.

The action although it has great moments always seems goofy , and the effects are very irregular. The one thing i can give to this movie is the remarkable pace and perhaps some great action scenes.

To sum up, the famous Matrix is, after all, just another 90's empty sience fiction film, but this time around, a good budget and an elite cast made it stand out... And that's the only reason I can understand the mystic created around it.","5"
"MayhapsItWasGoodBackThen","There's definitely fresh originality in this great movie. Most thrilling and exciting stuff! A MUST SEE!!","13 September 1999","Be advised; the text below *** CONTAINS SOME SPOILERS ***

Only thing that kind of disturbed me after seeing this great entertaining action/thriller was that why on earth those machines granted us humans with that pseudo-world in the first place? I don't think that machines would care less if we'd see our actual horrid reality rather than that artificially created 'nice' one. Am I supposed to believe that a machine has a sense of morality and pity? A machine with a consciousness? That's a good one. ;) That's not even too unique idea to begin with and even if so, that's really not too plausible here when considered how gruesome and ruthless those machines and their world is portrayed in this film's actual reality -not in that VR called the Matrix. Slightly controversial, yes, but if you can get past that you're facing a truly mind-blowing action/thriller movie experience!

But what about the city of Zion -humankind's _last_ refuge? We didn't get even a quick peek at it, why? And why did the machines just let Reeves escape from that alien fish tank (whatever it was!)? He simply pulls those freakish tubes off, after that the creepy spider-like machine comes poking around and decides to lift him up and throw him in the sewer pipes. Which it does. Reeves lands in water, tries hard to stay in the surface and *WHAM* the next moment he wakes up in Morpheus' and his crew's ship. (I'm not 100% sure if that's how it went, I might have missed something during these two scenes but I simply can't remember anymore since -let's face it- everything in this flick seems to happen at triple fast-forward! Heheh!)

I mean what the **ll was that suppose to be? While they're examining Keanu in the ship we learn that he's too weak to use his muscles (They in fact have to be re-built!) let alone use his eyes (Having never before used them in real life.)! And still he had somehow managed to get rid of the tubes stuck up in his a... body while being trapped as a human battery (Now that's witty, really!) in that container and struggled to stay afloat in water JUST a few moments ago! There are even more confusing stuff in the film than just these that I mentioned. I just hope the sequel(s) will provide us with well-reasoned answers to all those questions troubling -at least- me but hopefully you too. ;)

All those biblical referrals and enough ambiguous and cool philosophical one-liners and quotes plus a dialogue and a plot which messes with you head more than you'd like to, are pretty easy ways to make a movie seem more intellectual, sophisticated and even artistic to some content than it really is. Basically you can come up with any conclusions and try your best to reason what this flick really was about and still you don't know if you're right or wrong. I suppose everybody can see this movie in so many different ways if so wants. And that's just great! At least I personally like movies that really make me wonder and question stuff -no matter in what way that goal is achieved.

Cool, cold and distant acting. Some may consider that as bad acting, but frankly said that sort of style fits like a glove in the film's dark and ""mildly"" bizarre atmosphere. Great mind-boggling plot. Really far-out wicked special FXs! And maybe most intense (read: FAST!!) action scenes I've ever seen. Visually stunning. What else you wanna hear?? Go see this in some quality movie theater. Hold on to your seat and enjoy the ride!

"eeuuhombre","I'm told that the matrix has you...","6 June 2004","Keanu Reaves, Lawrence Fishburne, Carrie Ann Moss

The Matrix is a very interesting movie about reality. How does one know exactly what is going on in their lives, if they are confined only to what their 5 senses are telling them?

The Hype: Hype is hype, no matter what movie is popular at the time. Do not listen to your friends who tell you it sucked, or was totally awesome. Watch it yourself, and rate it.

The Acting: Many people say that the acting in this movie was horrible. I disagree. I think that a large group of people trying to get their world back wouldn't have much of a culture to make an example for them on how to express themselves in ""this certain way"" that most other movies are shown in. Everyone in the movie was acting humbled by fear, which is exactly what anyone would act like in that situation.

The Story: It raises a lot of discussion points, and ideas of what is reality, what is control (picks up more in Matrix Reloaded), religious references (mostly for extremists to scream at each other about), armageddon, do we need machines, is there a such thing as technologically going too far, should AI theory be developed; ect. I believe the storyline of this movie was a lot better than most others, especially nowadays, when movies like ""The Fast and the Furious"", ""XXX"", ""Torque"", and my own personal least-favorite, ""Biker Boyz"". If you have action, then why not have more of a story.

Action: Really cool for the time, but once you've seen a fight scene once or twice, it's time to move on.

Can anyone pick a contemporary movie with so many crude references to christianity? Morpheus as John the baptist; Trinity as an interesting (though the name ""Trinity"" should have been a tip-off for even the most doltish viewer) Mary Magdala; Keanu Reeves as (gasp!) Christ. Not only is the acting putrid but the film relies mostly on special effects and this ridiculous plotline. If the viewer wants to see action, rent an old John Woo movie made in Hong Kong (The Killer and Hard Boiled spring to mind). If you want a movie with cool effects, catch The Bride had White Hair. Skip this drivel unless you have had a lobotomy recently. If that were the case, I scarcely believe you would be reading this.","10"

Fine the ladies dig him but nobody for a second believes that this dude can act so why cast him in such a role, Seagal could have done a better job and he is officially an oak tree.

Wooden acting on the leads behalf aside the performances are solid, especially that of Agent Smith who steals the entire film.

Sadly years later when you look at the film it hasn't really aged well, partially I'm sure due to the overwhelming hype that it received and partially because now people are asking the very same question I asked above.....why Keanu? Overall I cant deny The Matrix is a very memorable film that broke boundaries and has created more spoofs than any other.

This may be best Matrix but i am no fan of the Matrix. I found it to be a mess of a trilogy.

"debjyoti1981","A Triumph In the Genre of Science Fiction !!!","6 December 2009","Writing down the review of ""The Matrix"" is itself a sturdy effort. I will try but can't guarantee... :)

""The Matrix"" will always remain as a triumph in the genre of Science Fiction. Filled with rich narrative, this movie was triumphant in revolutionizing the thinking process of the viewers. The Wachowski brothers have presented us with some story which we could have never imagined even in our wildest dreams.

Since this movie deals with a complex theme, this will require every attention in order to comprehend the flow of the story. This movie is definitely not for those who just like to see action without willing to appreciate the philosophical approach and the depth of understanding.

When it comes to casting, I think Wachowski brothers have made the perfect choice for putting Keanu Reeves as 'Neo', I don't think any other person could have pulled it so efficiently as him. Of course I don't need to mention that Carrie Moss was perfect as 'Trinity', did I miss some one wellwho will forget Hugo Weaving as 'Agent Smith', and it was simply overwhelming.

Action has been the integral part of this movie and will it be very hard to believe that it had become the groundwork of many new movies for the years to come. I think since so much innovative technique was adopted for the visual effects; it was not difficult even for the Academy Awards to be acquainted with and thus aptly awarding this movie for its Sound & Visual effects.

Well I had been the unlucky few to have missed this movie when it came out to the theaters, but I did enjoy when the DVD came out. I must say the DVD transmission was not at all regretful. Sound quality was top notch.

This movie had been the part of the Trilogy and comparing with the other two movies, this had been the best as a stand alone very much similar to the 'Terminator' Franchise.

""The Matrix"" might have received mixed reviews but truthfully this was one of the best science fiction movies which came out in the nineties. This also had been successful in revitalizing the interest amongst us; after all we go to Movie Theaters expecting to enjoy the show with a mesmeric experience.","7"

Its no wonder that all the computer nerds who sit around and rank movies on IMDB would give the Matrix a high score, but if you disregard the hoopla, you will see that its nothing more than a bunch of noise sometimes interrupted by bland lines from Keanu (""am I the One?"").

"rlowe30","Look. . .Haarrdaaaa. . .","12 May 2001","I just saw ""The Matrix"" again at a casino hotel, while Rachel snoozed at my side and I kept the volume down.

But I just followed the story this time, and was left wondering:""Who ARE these guys?"" the writers, directors; the ones with the vision for this dazzling psychological and spiritual tale?

Those who don't get this movie probably won't ever in this lifetime. They rail about ""plot holes"" and ""predictability"". Guess they never read Joseph Campbell on myth and allegory.

""The Matrix"" could be better, but that's like saying the hot tub sucked because you didn't have a Swedish Massage afterwards. . . or something like that. . .

Each character manifests a distinct level of spiritual development, from the ""Initiate: Neo"", to the ""King: Morpheus"", to the ""Sage: Oracle"" , to the ""Shadow: Cipher"", to the ""Warrior:Trinity/Tank/Dozer"" to the psychological concept of ""Toxic Introject: Agents"", to ""The Man: Neo's corporate boss"" , to the ""Ferryman across the River of the Dead: Tank"", to the ""Magician: Mouse,Tank. . ."" , to the ""Lover: Neo, Trinity"" . . .it goes on and on. More informed mythologists than I should have a field day with this movie.

"kensmark","""Bound"" must have been a fluke","31 March 2002","Mild spoilers ahead.

I remain astounded that this film was such a success. It does have a couple of good scenes, but what it mostly demonstrates is an appalling lack of understanding of science, narrative, direction, and action. I was bored out of my mind during most of it and wouldn't have expected it to do any better than ""Lost in Space"".

The effects in this movie are sometimes impressive (although nothing new) but generally senseless. The choreography -- by the legendary Yuen Woo Ping -- is good by US standards, but tired and pedestrian by, say, Yuen-Woo-Ping standards. The actors spent a couple of months learning their moves, and it shows -- they can pose, but they can't really fight very well.

The wirework is clumsy and exaggerated. The shootouts are ridiculously excessive, like parodies of John Woo's already intentionally hyperbolic style. It's in the same league as the action in ""Mortal Kombat 2"". I watch a lot of action movies, and ""The Matrix"" has to be in the bottom 20% for action.

The 'science' in this science-fiction movie is utter, utter crap. Quite possibly the worst I've ever seen, and that includes Godzilla movies. The movie would be vastly improved by the removal of every line of exposition that 'explains' what's going on.

The story stumbles around inconsistently, without sense, stable structure, or pacing, as if a number of unfinished scripts were crudely glommed together. Cliches fall from the screen like crap from a flock of starlings. The white reluctant hero is guided by not one but two black characters who are wiser and more competent but can't do anything themselves (because the script only lets white characters be effective). The ebb and flow of action has all the subtlety of a bad comic book from the mid-1970's. If you die in a dream, you die in real life. Puh-leeze. Try coming up with something interesting.

But worst of all is the complete failure of vision. The characters do all kinds of amazing things when they're practicing for their missions in the Matrix, but when they're actually there, they fail to use their incredible abilities. It's like a Superman movie where he beats the villain by arguing with him instead of flying about and so on. Why couldn't we at least have gotten a chase scene where the characters run and jump from the top of one skyscraper to the next?

If you want to see an actually good movie that deals with the same theme but has originality, genuinely unusual and impressive special effects, a coherent and engaging storyline, strong direction, and real vision, try ""Dark City"". It's everything ""The Matrix"" wanted to be -- except for the kung fu, which ""The Matrix"" doesn't get right anyway -- and much, much more.

Fighting scenes are too long and martial arts look tedious and unnatural. Bog standard conspiracy theory story. Old idea. The ""matrix philosophy"" has been treated in superior ways in dozens of earlier films and books. But I would forgive all of that if it weren't for one of the most pathetic explanations I've come across in science fiction: That humans were kept in those cubicles for generating electric power (If the machines were so clever, why didn't they just build power plants? ... and it would have blended nicely with the story if the explanation had been that the brain's computing power is utilised).

If you haven't watched it, watch it today. You won't regret it. Avoid spoilers. Having said that, it is definitely not perfect. 01. Keanu Reeves's performance is underwhelming and at times comically bad. There's a great video on YouTube called 'Keanu Reeves acting badly' that highlights this. I have nothing against the guy, but he isn't a good actor. Will Smith was originally offered the role, and I think he would have done a much better job. 02. Some of the dialogue isn't realistic and is kind of...cringey. E.g. when Neo flips agent Smith off near the start of the film. 03. Most of the special effects hold up to today, but some don't and are laughable, but to be honest this doesn't affect my opinion of the film, just don't expect the effects to be perfect.

I would give it a 10/10 if not for some of the dialogue and Keanu Reeves's acting.

"g_ryder","Unfortunately, no one can be told what the Matrix is. You have to see for yourself. And it's going to find you if you really want it to.","24 May 2012","The all around brilliance of this movie comes from the multidimensional themes of art, mythology, intellect and entertainment. It stands out exceptional even in special effects and martial arts, so there is something for everyone in it, and that is why it will remain as an all time classic. My focus in this review will be on the myth of The Matrix, the intellectual ideas and the questions that arise in the plot and the dialogs, and these are as I have formulated them: What is real, and by the same token, what is illusory? What is really behind the complex, seductive, at times apparently chaotic and random, at times apparently precisely timed and connected coincidences of the events and between the people of the world? What controls all the events of the world? Do individuals have any control at all through their choices and decisions over what happens or will happen? Or is it all 'programmed' or 'fated' in a scripted manner? In short, who or what runs the show? Are all our perceptions the result of the cultural construct (the set of perceptual interpretations and beliefs about the world 'taught' into each one of us by our social, cultural 'teachers'), or do we have the freedom to make our perception take flight into new territories, where no one has ventured so far? What are the limits of this freedom and how can we then meaningfully correlate with the existing knowledge matrix (and this movie is itself part of The Matrix) of the now diffuse and globalized culture of this world? These questions have been asked by seers, visionaries and thinkers in all parts of the world for millennia. The answers, descriptions, interpretations provided by these people found in the various myths, are so diverse and different that it's mind boggling to the non-thinker, but quite a challenge to the explorer. Levi Strauss put it this way: ""A theoretically infinite number of versions of the myth will be generated, each slightly different from the others. Myth thus becomes the third dimension of language; in it a continuous attempt is made to reconcile the other two dimensions of language - the diachronic and the synchronic. Because complete reconciliation is impossible, myth grows spiral - wise until the intellectual impulse which has produced it is exhausted. Myth grows then, because, structurally, the contradiction - the asymmetry – which gives it life cannot be resolved. Different versions are part of the same myth precisely because a myth is not reducible to a single uniform content, but is a dynamic structure. Eventually all the versions of a myth have to be taken into consideration so as its structure can become apparent."" So if any of these questions has ever bothered you, then welcome to The Matrix, the command and control system of the world that is by the necessary order of things, hidden from us for the very simple reason that it must be beyond individual manipulation (yes, the factual flaw in the movie is that the Matrix can be hacked). The only thing that The Matrix will allow is for the determined individual is to have a glimpse or a series of images of itself, but the interpretation of those is only one such interpretation that ideally should have correlation to interpretations that others have given. ""The test of a true myth is that each time you return to it, new insights and interpretations arise"" (Starhawk).

The whole movie is about Neo trying to discover what the Matrix is. It can be explained in 5-10 minutes, but it is explained in almost 2 hours. The only good thing about this movie is 3 or 4 scenes of amazing graphics. If you like the film only because of these scenes, then you might as well just download the trailer. I saw the trailer and went to see the film, the good bits were in the trailer only. The movie is ever so slow, when does it end is what i was thinking. Keauna Reeves best film is and will always be Speed. Decent kung fu, but i prefer kung fu hustle.","9"
"blackstone454","Hm.","16 September 2001","The heroes are much like the protagonists of STAR WARS.

The villains are much like STAR TREK's borg.

The wardrobe is a rip-off of T2 and BLADE, for the heroes, and MIB for the bad guys.

The gunfights are Hong-Kong inspired. So are the fight scenes.

Those are only a few of the influences I've spotted.

This movie did not reinvent the wheel, but it's still gives the movie goer quite an eyeful and does what it's supposed to, which is to entertain.

"jnguyen46117","The Matrix - 5/10","17 December 2010","I know there are a lot of people who have seen this film and even the sequels. But this is the first time I've paid attention to this franchise. Though it is popular, The Matrix failed to deliver good performances and great fighting scenes. The story is new in its genre and year. The Matrix was created in 1999, which is similar to 2010's Inception, where the world is not the world itself anymore. There are two worlds, The Matrix and the actual world. The Matrix is where most people live in and the actual world is only for the ones that rebelled. As refreshingly new the plot is, the writers just had to put in some clichés in the film: the protagonist did not die at the end, the bad guys died, some romance, and badass action scenes. Well, I guess that's what all movies have nowadays. But the film have so many flaws in it like the acting, it is the worse ensembled cast I've seen in years. The actual writing isn't bad but the way the actors delivered the lines are just unpleasant. Another flaw is the fighting scenes. I first thought it was because they were moving too fast and that was the point. But as it progresses, the fighting scenes are just cheap! The Matrix offers a new element to its genre and has really great visual effects but failed to deliver on its performances which made the film dropped.","8"
"RIK-22","At last, a movie that dares to make you think","13 July 1999","It was wonderfully refreshing to finally remember what it used to be like at the cinema. After the last few years of trash that has come out of hollywood, with the same old crap storylines, but with piles of effects. At Last a movie that made me forget I was just watching a film, forget that I was even in a cinema. For the first time since Leon, I got completely caught up in the movie, forgetting that it was just a bunch of actors going through a routine, but a well crafted, clever, original movie. From the first scene, when I found myself going 'f**k me' I was captivated into the world of the Matrix. I won't spoil it for anyone by talking about the plot, but only to say, if you haven't seen it..GO. I believe this will be a milestone for future films, hopefully they won't just be copies, but will make filmmakers think about making something clever and entertaining.

In summary a great film, very original, very clever special effects and wonderful fight scenes.","6"
"TheHonestCritic","Is this a breakthrough in science-fiction and action films? Or, is it yet another overrated pile of trash?","29 May 2021","""The Matrix"" (1999), people go insane over this ""movie"". I just have one thing to say about that; ""WHY?!"" I'm serious, some people obsess over this ""film"" to the point of paranoia. Granted, the first time I watched it, I thought it was kind of interesting. Then, when I watched it again, the problems and flaws just became more and more noticeable. ""The Matrix"" has a stupid and poorly executed story, the acting is all over the place and most of the special effects have not aged well. The concept for the storyline is, a computer programmer named Neo discovers the truth about the Matrix, he ends up drawn into a rebellion against the machines, along with people who have been freed from the Matrix itself. At first glance, the plot sounds like a lot of fun, with plenty of potential and room for clever storytelling. But, what we get is a boring and cliched mess. Seriously, did anyone proof-read the screenplay? One of the biggest issues right off the bat, is the overuse of stylized imagery, especially slow motion. Look, I'm all for stylized action and violence along with slow motion moments. But, there is so much exaggerated stylization and slow motion that it was almost at the level of cringe-worthy! Film Making 101: for those who want to write scripts, make sure the plot holds together and is able to carry through the entire runtime. Just adding excessive slow motion shots to pad out the runtime is no substitute for poor screenplay writing. It just shows how lazy the execution of the story is A perfect example of a ""movie"" that has this exact same issue, is ""Mission: Impossible 2"" (2000). That ""film"" also has an overabundance of stylized action and slow motion. Honestly, if you take out the slow motion, then these movies would be, maybe, five or ten minutes! The other glaring issue with the story in ""The Matrix"", is that the story is a jumbled and confused mess. It's stupid, a total bore and the plot doesn't hold together at all. How does such a poorly conceived storyline come to a person's mind? Even if you took away the stylized action and slow motion, it would be just as stupid and dull to watch. As for the acting, it's just as big a letdown as the plot itself. The only ones who appear to be trying are: Keanu Reeves and Laurence Fishburne. Everyone else in the cast just looks bored and their lackluster acting doesn't help matters either! As far as special effects go, some of them are good. But, a lot of them have not aged well. You can really see how bad they are whenever there's a slow motion shot, or when there's an over exaggerated stylized action segment. In my mind, the best way to describe the bad special effects here, is that they have aged as well as rotten milk! The sets/locations are great and they give the movie a decent atmosphere. Finally, the soundtrack is composed nicely and it really sets the tone for untold storyline that had so much room for improvement. However, I truly think that the music is trying harder than every other element in this movie! Sadly, those two factors do not help this movie. Overall, ""The Matrix"" is just a very dull and uninteresting action and science fiction romp where hardly anything of substance happens. I'm struggling to give this ""film"" a 2 out of 5 star rating, which equates to 4 out of 10 stars. Do I really have to tell you to stay away from this waste of cinema? Here's a message to all of those who obsess over this ""movie"". Take a good look at yourself and check out a real action film, science-fiction film, or any other film in general. Maybe your movie standards will improve!","8"
"The Truth","Doesn't quite fulfill it's promises (spoilers)","19 April 2000","The first two thirds of The Matrix are simply stunning. The visuals are unlike any movie, the Wachowski brothers have created a roller coaster ride with only a few stops (although those stops are just as beautiful as the rest of the movie - I especially liked the sensitive display of Neo's healing process after he had woken to the real world). The premise of the movie - that the world might be nothing more than an illusion fed to our heads - is a bit of a science fiction cliché, but it can still be used to make an excellent sci-fi film (and most of the time The Matrix does just that). The acting is good, even Keanu Reeves manages to be credible, by acting as little as possible. Carrie-Anne Moss is also good, though her screen time could have been longer. The one who really steals the show, though, is Laurence Fishburne. His portrayal of Morpheus is excellent, I especially like the little touches that separate his Matrix persona from the Morpheus of the real world. To sum it up: technically speaking The Matrix is nearly perfect.

So, the set is excellent, the actors are good, and the speed is breathtaking - what is there to complain about? The problem, as in so many other big budget science fiction movies, is the ending. Don't get me wrong, I did enjoy the last third as well, but only on a physical level, not intellectually. The shoot-out in the lobby is one of the greatest action scenes cinema has ever produced, but that's all it is - a great action scene. The deeper elements of the plot (such as the agony agent Smith feels having to live in a world populated by humans) are left unexplored when the rumble begins. Scenes like Keanu Reeves yelling ""My name is NEO!"", or Carrie-Anne Moss reviving Neo with a kiss make my cliché-o-meter bounce up to ten. And why, oh why does a film with such potential have to end in a kung-fu fight? Having already seen Bound, the Wachowski brothers' previous film, I had high expectations for The Matrix, but in the end it was clear that the low-budget Bound would still remain the better one of these two. Big money doesn't always equal conventionality, but in this case, sadly, it does.

Let's just hope that the success of The Matrix gives the Wachowski brothers the courage to make movies which are satisfying both visually AND intellectually. They certainly are capable of doing so.","9"
"rishavwarrior","Exceptional!","5 March 2022","This movie maybe many things , exceptional is certainly one of them . Bringing a high concept storyline stuffed with pretty cool action , most of the times leads to a hapazard product . Balancing the action and the story development in the movie is a pretty difficult part , and the Directors nailed it here ! You will never feel like the movie is being drifting itself out of the track or is stressing to pronounce certain things .

The concept it deals with is quite philosophical and questions our thoughts and reality. However , it never feels didactic and never try to preach something . The Audience are given fair amount of space to actually process the events which develops the bond and relatibility with the movie. The pace of the movie is fast , and more or less maintains it throughout the length of the movie . The only negative aspect I noticed that , in some scenes the dialogue delivery was not upto the mark and felt that a little bit of emotions would not have done bad or make the product cliche .

However , as a whole , this movie is certainly revolutionary with its action sequences and slow mo scens . Some scenes were a visual spectacle for action lovers ! Mixed with an awesome background music , the action scens were certainly treated to give a adrenaline rush and it did !","10"

"jamsbarlker","Amazing Movie Ever!!!","16 November 2021","The Matrix Is one of the best Classic Sci-Fi Action Film ever !

It depicts a dystopia future in which reality as perceived by most humans is actually a simulated reality called ""the Matrix"", created by sentient machines to subdue the human population, while their bodies' heat and electrical activity are used as an energy source. Computer programmer ""Neo"" learns this truth and is drawn into a rebellion against the machines, which involves other people who have been freed from the ""dream world"".

Written and directed by the Wachowski brothers, this classic sci-fi action film stars Keanu Reeves as a lowly computer programmer who discovers his entire existence, and that of all mankind, is nothing but a simulation in a computer. The reality within a reality is a concept that's done before... but never like this - The Matrix requires absolute attention from his audience, least you'll be completely lost in a few minutes. With the help of supporting cast members Laurence Fishburne and Carrie-Anne-Moss, Reeves discovers that inside this simulation environment known as The Matrix, he can control, bend, and manipulate space-time... resulting in some of the most incredibly iconic images to ever grace the silver screen.

The slow-motion ""bullet-time"" effects as they're known today were groundbreaking and revolutionary when we first saw them 12 years ago. Although Reeves is notorious for his inability to really convey much emotional range, his character here lends itself well to him as an actor. This is a movie that makes you think, makes you gasp, and makes totally forget where the 136-minutes went after finishing it. It's no wonder this film spawned two very successful sequels, and dozens of copy-cats. The Matrix, ""Visually revolutionary, and mind-blowing.""

Keanu Reeves plays the main character, Neo, or Thomas A. Anderson and while he is not the perfect actor I think he does a pretty good job in The Matrix. He doesn't have the longest of lines which was probably a deliberate choice from the directors and it works because this gives him a better opportunity to work on posture and facial expressions and I must say that overall his body language is very good. Very clear and well defined. Laurence Fishbourne plays Neo's mentor Morpheus and he does an excellent job of it. His lines flow with a certain confidence and style that makes his character somewhat unique and interesting.

Carrie-Anne Moss does a good job as well and succeeds in looking both cool and sexy in her leather outfit. Joe Pantoliano, a critically underrated actor does a brilliant job of bringing his character, Cypher, to life. He also played the roles in Underrated Daredevil (2003)and Bad Boys I & II. I can't say much about him because his character is pretty essential to the plot. Gloria Foster appears in a relatively small role that will have greater significance in the following films and she does a very good job.

The best acting is provided by Hugo Weaving, however, in his portrayal of Agent Smith. It is really something to watch him act out the changes in his character. Agent Smith gains some human traits like anger, sense of dread, hate and eventually even a sly sense of humor. Two thumbs way up to Weaving who has created one of the finest screen villains of all time.

Effects wise the film is simply stunning and it deservedly was awarded the Oscar for best effects (and was regrettably cheated out of a nomination in the Best Film category) ahead of even Star Wars. The reason that I think The Matrix deserves the Oscar for best effects is simply that the effects in The Matrix are more innovative than the ones in Star Wars. Just take a look at how many times the effects have been spoofed and you'll probably agree. The effects also help in the symbolism of the film and in creating a very dystopia atmosphere not unlike the one seen in Blade Runner and this works brilliantly.","9"

And I must say I was not disappointed by this one too. It was also good but with a bit confusing concept like it is showed as a computer programming film and then they shows up a prophet who made a prediction about ""the one"" and all what is this a computer program or a magic movie???

"brianjohnson-20043","Thinks its Clever (keyword: thinks)","12 October 2020","Although this movie is much better than the 2 subsequent matrix movies, it's still awful IMO. The storyline isn't particularly as interesting as it thinks it is. The dialogue and styling is so in love with itself when it has nothing actually very clever to say or show. And it looked very odd and into its own aesthetic rather than having all of the visuals and other spectral effects constructed for the sake of the story so that the aesthetic mostly wasn't the center of anyone's mind.

A lot of the ideas that this movie addresses somehow seems to be a lot of people's first introduction into imagining that our entire reality is an illusion. Which is odd. I remember abstractly thinking along those lines long before ever seeing this movie. And I was a teen when I first saw the matrix movies. And I didn't think the Matrix presentation of the concept was any better than a lot of the imagined ideas I had had in my own head. In the end, until we can demonstrate any matrix-like-reality (Like what Neo gets when he takes the pill) it's all just mental masterbation. And although there is nothing wrong with mental masterbation, I find that it's best if you invent a fun fantasy while you're already in that realm if you're going to bother. I've never felt that the Matrix world was fun and never found it very compelling because it's so divorced from the only reality I really know. I couldn't really relate or empathize with any of the protagonist characters. Perhaps thr reason for this is that the characters in the story are constructed to be symbols for other things rather than just interesting and relatable in their own right to the typical person.","6"
"someokiedude","Before you get upset, read the review.","16 September 2020","The old saying goes that the people who often write the stories that people consider to be new and fresh often end up being the most predictable stories of them all. It still mystifies me how this film became such a pop culture icon while films that explored similar ideas (and did them better) like They Live, Ghost in The Shell, and The Truman Show go on to become mere cult films.

As a critic, I sometimes fear that I've become another cog in the machine, repeating praises that other, more worthy critics have already lavished upon a film, so I suppose there's a certain relief to be found when I find a film that's widely praised as The Matrix to fall short of its said praise. That's not to say that I hate this film simply to stick it to the popular opinion, I genuinely don't like this movie.

It was originally Doug Walker's video on The Matrix that initially inspired my anger and disdain for the film, as before then I was rather mixed on it, not entirely sure what to make of it but realizing that it wasn't the mind blowing experience that I expected. I know there's some out there who've grown disenfranchised with Walker's style for various reasons, and even I've noticed that he's begun to grasp for straws with The Nostalgia Critic, and I've grown to prefer his videos where he's himself, allowing himself to flesh out his ideas. But the video, obnoxious as it might be for some, did open my eyes to the fact that perhaps The Matrix isn't the film that people thought, alongside what people claim it to be.

Predictably, it's been my disdain for The Matrix that has caused the most derision from people, which I find odd as it makes me wonder how so many people clicked with this film. A friend of mine explained it to me: much like Star Wars, no one had ever seen anything like The Matrix before. Then again, most people probably hadn't seen Ghost in The Shell, a thoughtful, radical reinvention of the cyberpunk genre, and one that The Matrix would shamelessly knock off 4 years later, or They Live, John Carpenter's pulpy yet also surprisingly thoughtful critique of Reagan era politics, or Dark City and The Truman Show, two films that had come out the previous year and both that I thought had a much more complex and thorough exploration into similar concepts that The Matrix would touch upon.

The Matrix is basically a dull retread of Plato's Allegory of The Cave, touching upon the ideas of Plato's original story but never really bothering to say anything about them, it's the same critique that Ebert lobbied upon Fight Club, ironically from the same year, yet at least Fight Club had decent characters, intriguing ideas, and an dirty, grungy style, (though I much prefer Se7en) but with The Matrix...there's nothing.

Perhaps that's hyperbolic, The Matrix does have several things going for it. The slick cinematography certainly oozes atmosphere, I quite enjoyed how the font would change from The Matrix to the real world, the action is well helmed, as The Wachowskis have been well regarded as action directors, and its paced quite nicely, yet the film would be dragged down by its dull characters, overtly expository dialogue, and flat storytelling.

Nothing is left to the imagination in The Matrix, as much as its avid supporters would have you think otherwise. Characters dump information in the same dull, bored tone, there's no variety or humanity within the characters, and the film spends too long over-explaining things. The audience's intelligence is constantly insulted throughout the film, which is probably what angers me the most about this film. I've had more forgiving friends of mine who would explain to me how the studio had interfered with the film and forced them to change several things from it, though I don't easily buy into that excuse. If that were the case, then it shouldn't have been so hard to get around the hurdles and keep it compelling, yet alas they didn't. There are several scenes that I exempt, like the initial red pill/blue pill scene as well as the deja vu sequence (which is actually my favorite bit of the film). But asides from that, the film is a rather dull, flat experience, asides from flashes of excellence split throughout the film. There were bits throughout the film where I came up with ideas with how they could have made it better, like how in the Matrix, the people could be more dull and emotionally stunted since the robots don't know human nature as well, though when they're out of the Matrix, they can act more human and expressive, yet they didn't do that.

In the end, it's another piece of science fiction fluff that thinks itself smarter than it is, and it made me think back to a quote from Ellison.

""If you make people think they're thinking, they'll love you; but if you really make them think, they'll hate you.""

"mari_del_mar","Best sci-fi ever done.","4 March 2009","I just have to review this movie, even if it is a decade after it was made (I loved it that much)!

One thing I don't see often is reference to the part of the film that deals with faith (mostly, about The Oracle). I find this part of the movie particularly nicely done. A great answer to the question: ""What form would human faith take in a world in which humans are less than slaves to thinking machines?"" I think this also has to do with the fact that the best piece of acting is given by Laurence Fishburne, who depicts quite well a ""man of faith"".

The whole disquisition about what is reality and Neo waking up to learn that his whole life has just been an induced fantasy are just too juicy not to love!

Some acting in it is not first rate, but the rest of the film (everybody knows that the visual effects set a breaking point in cinema history) carries it greatly.

"allenquanobi","Original and great, but with one important flaw","19 November 2017","Released in a time of ground-breaking CGI advancements, the Matrix notched itself above the rest of the competition in terms of film- making. Visually stunning, thought-provoking, and fun, The Matrix is a near-perfect film for any sci-fi fan or any movie fan.

Let's start with the plot and writing. The plot revolves around a hacker named Thomas Anderson who acts as a somewhat ill- explained hacker named Neo by night. One night, he gets contacted by a mysterious internet group led by the omniscient Morpheus. One step leads to another, and Neo, ""much like Alice"" goes tumbling down the rabbit- hole, leading to a world-changing (quite literally in this sense) discovery that will cause him to question his very own existence. Right from the start, the plot hooks you, making the viewers themselves feel like Neo, questioning their own existence. Interwoven with the thought of questioning one's own existence, is a religion intertextuality with Neo and Christianity, making the depth of the film felt even more. The writing is fantastic and philosophical, particularly with the dialogue between Neo and Morpheus. It eclipses in the scene with the Oracle and the famous line ""There is no spoon"", which is where the movie takes a sharp turn. For about ¾ of the movie, I was locked into the originality of the plot and storytelling. However, in the film's final act, specifically around (spoilers) an incredulous scene involving a lobby, the movie collapses onto itself with the most unrealistic and bombastic endings that one could describe as Michael Bay-esque. The final half hour of the movie, while entertaining with fight sequences and explosions, seems pulled out of a video game. You don't feel that the characters are in any real danger at this point, and it all leads to the ending, which is satisfying, but left a sour taste in my mouth because of how unoriginal and cliché it is compared to the rest of the movie.

Despite the problems I had with some of the plot, the film- making is amazing. Never before has a film influenced future movies as the Matrix did. With its famous bullet-time sequence, and choreographed fight scenes, the Matrix set an industry standard that few films have accomplished or eclipsed since then. Finally, let's talk about the acting. The performances are mostly perfect for their characters. Fishburne's enigmatic performance as the audience's guide into the world and Weaving's subdued acting as the monotone and (spoiler) robotic antagonist. However, the one that confuses me is Reeve's performance as Neo. One could argue that due to Neo's character of being Zen-like and unknowing, Reeves is the perfect actor for this role. However, I think any actor of the same age as Reeves could play Neo and the character would have been realized the same.

Overall, The Matrix is groundbreaking in both film-making, world-building, and storytelling, a must-watch for any movie-goer. However, the ending, while satisfying to most audiences, will disappoint those who would expect something different and bold from a truly original movie.","10"

"Corey-12","Why won't it go away?!?!","3 July 1999","OK, here's my basic viewpoint on the wonderful piece of celluloid known as 'The Matrix,' seeing as how it was full of plot holes, and the only things good about it were Laurence Fishburne and the effects.

In all honesty, I hated every single frickin' minute of this flick. It was boring, unimaginative, and really quite contrite. The scripting was terrible, the acting horrible, and for Gods sake, the movie wasn't even a movie, it was a playhouse for new visual effect techniques. Show me one part of this movie that you feel is good, and I'll show you a person who's afraid to make up their own mind on anything good in movies.

While The Matrix was busy making millions of dollars, people skipped out of movies with a SCRIPT and ACTORS such as 'Waking Ned Devine,' an incredibly character driven movie, with real actors, not Bill and Ted rejects. (Don't get me wrong, Laurence Fishburn wasn't in Bill and Ted, and I did like the B&T movies, I just didn't like TED!) This movie was full of eye candy...it's a disappointment that movie goers now a days will shell out $7.50 for a movie full of things you can see on a Playstation...but you don't catch people sitting around the house and paying money to watch some guy play Final Fantasy.

"sausagebrigade","Am I missing something?","1 August 2003","I have seen The Matrix in full. I have considered it in my head. I have now come to the conclusion that the version everybody else has been watching is different to mine, as I can see no merit in the movie whatsoever. The dull characters live in a bland, grey hued universe populated by other dull characters, fighting for a cause that I don't understand and that I don't care for. Along the way they get into supposedly 'cool' kung fu and gunfights all in slow motion. The only relief from the relentless boredom of this emotionless juggernaut is Hugo Weaving's Agent Smith, a character whose blandness is intentional and even amusing. In the case of the other characters, their blandness is unintentional and unamusing. The only people who can possibly enjoy and understand this movie in full are the Wachowski brothers.","6"
"HunterDK","Stupid movie with good action","8 February 2002","I have just watched ""The Matrix"", and I was very disappointed. I had heard it was a real good movie, and it was placed as #40 at IMDb, so I had some expectations.

After watching the first half hour I could see that it wouldn't be one of my favorites. It was more likely that it would be the most disappointing movie ever, but the action in the second half of the movie was pretty good made, so it saved the movie from being a complete disaster.

The story in The Matrix was so stupid that I considered stop watching the movie, but I had to watch it all so I could rate it here on IMDb.

Normally I like movies with ""the chosen one"" like Star Wars and Lord of the Rings, but The Matrix was so stupid. The actors constantly repeated ""he is the one"", I think it would be enough to say this three or four times.

I really don't understand how The Matrix could be in the top-250 at IMDb, but some people like movies with stupid stories if just the action is good. This movie does not deserve more than 4/10.","9"
"happycat-2","Unoriginal and uninspired!","2 April 1999","I can't believe that anyone would seriously suggest that this film was even average! It was worst film I have seen in a very long time.

The movie had so little to offer, it is hard to only point to specific flaws:

1) Keanu has to be one of the worst actors of our era. He shows no signs of even moderate intelligence or talent, and as a hero, he comes across as flat and unispiring. It is hard to believe that his character would have anything to offer that would distingish him from your average idiot. And in action scenes, it was impossible to tell if he is *supposed* to look silly or if he can't help it. No charisma, no flair, just pathetic.

2) Very shallow and poor development of an unoriginal idea. The idea that our reality is not real at all is hardly original. It has been the subject of science fiction for decades, and a successful treatment of the subject should delve into some psychological depths. We should be left wondering whether our world truly is real. Or we should get a sense of how willing or unwilling we might be to face the fact that our world is an illusion. We should wonder whether it matters if our world is an illusion, or whether reality is what we perceive as real. Whatever the protrayal, we should leave the theater feeling intellectually moved. While the film briefly brushed on some of these topics, it was so brief and shallow that no impression was left. Instead, focus returned to martial arts which had no real purpose in terms of the plot.

3) The story dragged as we were forced to sit through an explanation of the matrix that was completely obvious--a couple of visual effects would have gotten the point across in less than a minute with more effect. While the characters beat the idea of the matrix to death in the dialogue, it did little to shed light into the hearts and minds of the characters. What was their motivation, from where did they get their drive and courage? Why were they able to sense the matrix? None of the answers are even touched upon, and the characters are flat and unrealistic as a result.

4) The idea of the matrix is very poorly thought out. Instead of creating a believable world and believable rules for the matrix, the plot resorts to physical fighting, which makes no sense at all. The film obviously had no intention of stretching the mind of the viewer, instead catering to an audience of mindless action-addicts. While action might have added to a well-thought out film, it cannot support a film where the premise is psychological or intellectual.

5) No sense of despair, darkness, or power from the futuristic scenes. The future world is portrayed so little that we really don't even have a chance to be overwhelmed by how horrible it could be. In an attempt to make a happy action film, the dark undertones were completely dropped.

The very few redeeming values were: 1) Interesting use of slow-motion action 2) A few nice special effects (no more than an average action film these days) 3) A promising premise. While not original, the idea has great potential. Several other films, such as Dark City have shown a bit of this potential, and there is a plethora of such plots in books.

In short, any thoughtful, insightful, meaningful, or inspired treatment of a potentially interesting idea was completely dropped to show a few almost laughably out of place action scenes. The fact that people rave about this movie shows that people are willing to swallow the mindless just for some cool effects. How sad.","6"
"zio ugo","Tried to watch it. Fell asleep. Twice.","8 October 1999","I am constantly amazed by the kind of films people can pay money to see. I tried to see this film twice, and both times I fell asleep in the middle of it (I didn't pay to see it; maybe, had I paid, the thought of financial loss would have kept me awake, but I doubt it).

The plot is predictable, the ideas don't work (cyborgs have no better way to get energy than to keep humans alive? And where do they get the energy to feed the humans? Are we supposed to think that human bodies violate the first principle of thermodynamics?), and the acting was... well... not there.

There are, of course, special effects and action, but after years and tears of the same things, one would think that the public had grown beyond saying ""ahhhhh"" every time a dazzling (and expensive) special effect appears, or to cheer every time a good guy chases a bad guy. Evidently not. Too bad: special effects are killing the art of telling a story and developing a character that are the basis of fiction.","10"

"halloweenie_us","most over rated film of all time","22 June 2000","this is a pathetic piece of crap that has plagued the pop culture today. I don't know how. Maybe people like bad acting, cheesy and crappy (also boring) fight scenes, a plot that isn't carried through at all, horrible scripting, and visual efffects that are far from original (check out blade runner if you want good visual effects). Personally, this film was just ok, but the way it had been over-hyped and everyone saying its the greatest movie ever, it just made me give the film a 1 on a scale of 10.

Keanu Reeves looks like a gimp wearing a cast around his neck, and still can't spout a convincing word of dialouge, in this film. Lawrence Fishburn gives the worst performance of his career, but he gets praised for it. the wakouski brothers claim themselves as original, but the film easily ripped off John Woo films and Blade Runner.

The worst thing about this is, is that everyone's IQ dropped ten points after watching this load of garbage. It plays you for an idiot. It actually tries to make you think that Keanu's not ""the one"" so it can try to keep some sort of suspense. But when you start falling asleep through scenes that could have been cut out, it throws in an action sequence not needed just to keep you awake. This film is bad and it's a shame that i'm one of few who realises it.","9"

"Raiderofthelastfries","A modern classic. In 1999 it wasn't just a movie, it was an experience.","20 March 2004","It seems that every few decades we rebel against conformity, against established traditions. The 20's, the 60's and 70's are some examples that come to mind, and of course the 90's. Beginning with cartoons like Tiny Toons and Animaniacs and the Simpsons, which were more honest, and more cynical animated programs than had ever been seen before, and movies like the Silence of the Lambs which irrevocably altered the serial killer movie genre, pop culture was almost self consciously fixated on bending the rules. Everything from the bizarre ending of the Thomas Harris novel Hannibal (altered for a traditonal moral finale in the 2001 movie adaptation-see we're back to square one now, the cycle has come to an end and is restarting...), to movies like American Beauty,Fight Club, Pleasantville (a '98 release), and of course the Matrix were not harmonious accidents, but the inevitable outgrowth of what began in the early nineties. A movement away from self delusion, innocence, and simplicity (which had given rise to widespread jaded cynism, and then gradually the realization that something really had to be DONE about the damaging flaws in our society).

So what was expected to be another Keanu Reeves sci-fi action flick (following his last effort Johny Mnemonic, 1995) turned out instead to be a magnificent fusion of the Terminator, Kung Fu, S & M, Bullet Time (once upon a time known as the Gap Commercial effect), anime, and cyberpunk fiction, overlaid with elements of a Western, film noir, and philosophy. At its core though, its a story of triumphant rebellion against established authority. The Wachowski Brothers quite rightly, imo, acknowledge that social conformity is a mental handicap that keeps many of us from achieving either our full potential, or what we truly desire in life, thus it is no surprise that the Matrix is described as something that you feel ""when you go to work, when you go to church, when you pay your taxes."" Keanu Reeves even jokingly labled his character a hippie (see The Matrix Revisted, 2001),and the movie certainly is harking back to those old attitudes( but again, the anti-establishment feelings our society gets caught up in is cyclical, the feelings must be, because if they were to continue to their logical end without stopping we would all be plunged into anarchy. Still,its nice to spread our wings and fly every once in awhile). Its this surprising social relevancy which imo, helped vaunt this film into the top of the sci fi heap in what was supposed to be the year of the Star Wars: Phantom Menace (ironically what was supposed to year of the Matrix, four years later, ended in bitter disappointment for Matrix fans. Now they know how Lucas fans felt, I suppose). Now for the record, yes the pseudoscience is rubbish and flies in the face of thermodynamics, but it doesn't matter. The pseudo science was also rubbish in the classic tale ""Dr. Jekyll and Mister Hyde"", and was openly acknowledged as such by author Robert Louis Stevenson. What matters is what the story is trying to say.

Its not an especially original movie, from the perspective of plot, or visua ls. Even the iconic green computer code opening credits are stolen from Ghost in the Shell (from were we also have the image of people with electrical conduits in the back of their necks). The scenes were Neo learns that his life was lie recalls scenes in Ghost in the Shell where people are devastated to learn that a sentient computer known as the Puppetmaster has hacked into their brains and implanted false memories, in order to use them for his own purposes (or for that matter the work of sci-fi legend Phillip K. Dick-an acknowledged influence on the brothers- in particular tales like ""Overdrawn at the Memory Bank"" which was the basis for the movie ""Total Recall""). The movie also has some visual cribs from The Terminator (the sun glasses and leather, although I must say it's done much better here), and Se7en (although the dimly lit hallways in this movie are given a cool green tint. Sadly dingy, atmospheric environments are almost entirely absent in the next movie). ""The Matrix"", ""Jacking In"", and ""Zion"" are names and phrases taken from the 1984 book Neuromancer by William Gibson, with which the Matrix's story certainly has some interesting parallels. The basic plot of Neuromancer is as follows: Case is a hacker who has lost his ability to connect to an interconnected system of computers known as the Matrix as the result of a deal-gone-bad. He is all but down and out, running drugs and other particularly risky transactions; he appears to have a death wish. Just as he almost bottoms out, he meets the beautiful but lethal Molly Millions who claim to be able to restore his ability to access the matrix. In the Matrix, Neo is a hacker who sells narcotic software who is haunted by the enigmatic nature of something called the Matrix (and so the now famous phrase ""What is the Matrix?"" is born). when he meets the beautiful but lethal Trinity who claims to know the answer to his question.

Despite this grab bag of ""borrowed"" ideas, the film that emerged had its own unique identity. An undercurrent of sado masochism runs throughout the film, with its emphasis on control, slavery, subjugation and domination. Its only fitting in this S and M fairytale context that the hero is a mostly passive wimp who must ultimately be rescued by a leather clad biker girl in climatic scene that plays like a modern Sleeping Beauty (inevitably the man plays the role of Beauty). Trinity is the second in a line of tough, haunted women with unsual names and a fondness for leather and sunglasses (see Bound, 1996). Although she has striking similarities to Molly Millions, I have to say that in the end, she is definitely a ""Wachowski-an"" character first and foremost. Given that the Wachowski's first movie celebrated lesbian love, it is interesting to note the gender role reversal in the romantic relationship b/t Neo and Trinity. Neo is very clearly the female (in the sequel, Matrix Reloaded, it is he who is revealed as the needy one, calling out to Trinity as she leaves), and in fact not unlike so many of the passive, put upon heroines of 1950s Disney movies who have to be rescued by friends (singing mice for example) from a life of subjugation to cruel authority figures. The maligned climatic kiss then becomes much more appropriate seen in that light.

The Wachowski's also give us one of cinema's greatest villains in the form of the sneering Agent Smith. He's at his sinister best in the original, as he could send a chill down your spine with a single well timed smirk, and always speaking as if he was talking to a small child he didn't like (as one reviewer put it). Unfortunately his menace fades as he became more human in the sequels. Emotion is the enemy of Agents (something confirmed by reading the original screenplay); any sign of anger or frustration on their part is a sign of weakness. Sadly its a hambone joy at his own villany in the sequels which proves to be the undoing of Agent Smith, but nevermind. In this movie he is one helluva cool baddie.

The movie also gets a lot of mileage out of Christian mythology (with Morpheus playing something like John the Baptist to Neo's Jesus) buddhist principles of mind over matter (you can will yourself to leap tall buildings in a single bound), and the allegory of Plato's cave (a model used to illustrate why it is important for humans to achieve reflective understanding), Descartes (who tells us that the only thing we can trust to be real and irrefutable are mathematical principles), and some rather glaring, unsubtle symbolism (like naming Lawrence Fishburne's character after Morpheus, the Greek god who could enter dreams and change their shape), but most viewers will simply view it as a great action movie with a ball busting opener, that segues into a slow second act, before going crazy with action again at the end.

Speaking of which, the ending though considered weak and more like the intro to a television series (not unlike the ending for X-Men), was for my money immensley satisfying because even though it was left open to accomodate last year's sequels, Neo was revealed to be the One, and victory was assured ( Billy Wilder once said that whether a story has a happy ending or a sad ending depends on were you chose to end it, and this certainly would have been a much more rousing finale to the story, imo). It is the Quentin Taratino of sci fi movies, in that it blends disparate elements into a cohesive and stunning new whole that emerges as a true original.

Although I enjoyed the flawed sequels (which deepend the world of the Matrix, but not the characters), it was inevitable that they wouldn't run on the same delirious anarchic juice as the original, those feelings reached their dramatic crescendo in 99'. It was 2003, a different world, where terrorism is afoot in the world and a time for a return to normalcy (so politicians say). I suppose ultimately maturity is learning to cope and compromise with the authority figures hovering over you in life, rather than obliterating them in an orgy of bullet shells and kung fu kicks. That (unfortunate?) fact of life became the point of the Matrix trilogy, and one of the reasons that it turned off so many fans who went in with a definite ""destroy the machines"" bent. *sigh* It's not the nineties anymore, and I-whoops, its time for me to get back to work...","5"

"Hey_Sweden","Which will it be, the red pill or the blue pill?","22 February 2020","""The Matrix"" is a trend-setting, visually dazzling sci-fi / action picture that offers up some provocative ideas and entertaining concepts. Its various scenes of human acrobatics and bullet-dodging gimmickry immediately became iconic, lending themselves to parody as well as to imitation. Granted, there IS a lot of mumbo-jumbo in this script, and the film does go on a little too long, but it's hard to deny the amusement level of such colourful escapism.

Keanu Reeves is front and centre as Thomas Anderson, alias ""Neo"", a software designer by day and computer hacker by night. Then he is informed by characters led by the charismatic Morpheus (Laurence Fishburne) that the world in which he lives is not reality. It is actually an illusion created by an omnipotent artificial intelligence. Morpheus believes that Neo is ""The One"", the person who will be the ultimate weapon for good in the war waged against this nefarious A.I. Pursuing our heroes are various relentless Agents, in particular the deadpan Smith (Hugo Weaving).

""The Matrix"" is generally good fun, as it delivers a number of nicely executed set pieces. The martial arts fights, choreographed by Yuen Wo Ping, are highlights, but there is also one effective chase sequence near the end. John Gaeta supervised the visual FX, which are memorable all the way to the end.

The cast is fine - Joe Pantoliano (co-star of The Wachowski siblings' breakthrough film, ""Bound""), Carrie-Anne Moss, Marcus Chong, Gloria Foster, Matt Doran, Anthony Ray Parker, etc. Keanu does alright as the hero who becomes more badass as the story plays out, steadily awakening to this new reality facing him. Fishburne again displays a solid screen presence, delivering exposition in such a way that one can't help but pay attention. Moss is an engaging heroine, and her athleticism in various action sequences is quite impressive. Weaving is a simply great villain.

Well produced, well directed, and pounding ahead to a soundtrack including Rob Zombie, Prodigy, and Marilyn Manson, among others; this spawned a franchise that as of this writing is about to be revived.

Unlike movies like Dark City and The Mummy which used very clever and enjoyable special effects in a relatively restrained fashion to serve a real story, with atmosphere, good acting and writing, this had people I could care less about, a story maybe I was too dumb to get, or maybe I had too much of a headache to be able to try. Without the aid of a computer, this movie would have nothing.

"Euphorbia","Grand concept, inexcusably sloppy execution","7 September 2002","*** SPOILERS AHEAD ***

Actually, nothing could be more of a spoiler than the movie itself. The concept is brilliant -- the ""real world"" we think we inhabit is actually a matrix of induced illusion, but there is a ""real"" real world outside of it, one that the characters manage to reach.

Okay, fine.

But for this to work, there must be an entirely consistent physics and set of natural laws in the real world, and either a different but equally consistent set of rules inside the matrix, or at least a consistently inconsistent set of rules which change in some predictable way, or which are changed intentionally by someone -- heroes or villains or both -- and we see them making the changes as part of the unfolding story.

What we get instead is constantly changing rules both in the world and in the matrix, and they change for no good reason except to advance the hobbling plot, or to showcase a lame special effect. Sometimes the same rules apply in both, then one changes, then the other changes to what the first was, then the second changes back, then they switch. Or something like that.

The first time this happened, I could not believe the director and/or editor had let it slip by. It completely spoiled the flow of the movie, worse than an actor stepping out of character (lots of that in this movie, too). But then it happened again and again, with increasing frequency as the climax approached, and I realized that they just did not care.

Maybe it wasn't their fault; maybe the studio garbled it up. Maybe some day there will be a director's cut which does make sense. But given the popularity of the movie as is, that is not likely to happen.

I forgot what a great movie the first Matrix was. Even though H. R. Giger didn't make the movie it's clearly influenced by his artwork. Visually it's all exceptionally stunning. The four Oscars it won are all well deserved. The Wachowskis made their name with this masterpiece. Keanu Reeves is perfect to play the role of Neo, as is Laurence Fishburne as Morpheus, and Carrie-Anne Moss as Trinity. They say clothes don't make the man but Carrie-Anne looks stunning in her latex costume. Great costumes for everybody by the way, it's all very futuristic and stylish. Hugo Weaving is also perfect to play the villain Mr. Smith. The reason I rewatch all those movies before watching the last one is that all the movies are difficult to understand. The story is so complicated you need to keep your attention all the time, which is not a bad thing actually. The Matrix is one of the better Sci-Fi movies ever. The ratings it gets are very high and in my eyes completely normal, it's just an amazing movie.","9"
"strangelexicon","Not as good as the sequels, IMO","4 August 2006","While I'm aware that there are a lot of people who feel that the first movie in the Matrix trilogy is the only good ones and that the next two were terrible, I must completely disagree. In my opinion, the most important thing about this movie is that it paved the way for the sequels. That means that this movie severely under-utilizes its own plot and concept and the same are only exploited as they should in the sequels. The real potential for insane action and the intriguing philosophy which actually does make 80% sense, barring the weird happenings which are not even explained properly, are only made use of in the sequels and not in this movie. Thus it is certainly unfair to downplay the sequels. The Matrix as a stand alone movie is quite good, but really not as good as it could have been and this has been fixed in the sequels.","9"

Marcus Chong and Joe Pantoliano are also on hand.

""The Matrix"" (1999) is a cerebral sci-fi/action film that mixes elements of the first two Terminator flicks (1984/1991) with martial arts action and a basic concept that hails back to ""Star Trek: The Motion Picture"" (1979) and no doubt further.

To put this intricate movie together and make it entertaining took genius, so I give credit to the Waschowski Brothers, um, I mean sisters (rolling my eyes). The casting is great and Carrie-Anne is stunning throughout (I usually don't like short hair on women, but she's an exception). For me, though, the Waschowskis made it too comic booky. The posturing characters in their slick black outfits & sunglasses scream ""Yeah, right."" And the Messiah angle is old hat.

What's really surprising is just how well this still holds up, fifteen years after the fact. It was easily the greatest movie of 1999, and a high point of the decade. It's not just an action movie with sweet kung fu and leather-clad gunfights, but also one hell of a sci-fi trip; an honest-to-god journey through the rabbit hole, seductive in its intriguing mystery and still riveting after many viewings. The Wachowskis showed an incredible eye for framing, shot composition and camera moves; this thing reeks of style.

It's a classic any way you slice it, and a laundry list of memorable scenes (the opening rooftop chase, Neo's unplugging, the SWAT ambush in the apartment building, the lobby shootout, the helicopter crash, the subway fight and subsequent chase). The agents still make for striking imagery with their comically oversized Desert Eagles (I love Weaving's intonation and line delivery).

And while it's probably the most cartoonishly parodied movie of the last half-century, those bullet-time effects and killer fight scenes haven't lost their luster.

"mbergh","Matrix aka stupidity.","2 February 2006","This movie provides the opportunity for people who aren't able to understand a film of actual quality to have something to say. It has come to be a sort of common understanding that Matrix contains some philosophical truth or even reasoning. However, this is not the case. The theme of this movie is extremely unoriginal and it's attempts to discuss philosophy is a blunt self-blow.

But, this movie is suitable for people who feel ashame of the fact that they are incapable of understanding more complicated films. Therefore it has come to be a consent between viewers of lower intellectual ability to evoke this film as soon as philosophy is mentioned.

It is plainly speaking a film for people who doesn't like films in particular but needs something to cling on in conversations about film.

Quite pathetic really. A consent of stupidity.","9"
"CinemaSerf","The Matrix","28 August 2023","""Thomas Anderson"" is a nerdy boy by day, and an enigmatic hacker ""Neo"" by night. His latter persona is constantly challenging his norms, his behaviour, his reality even - and when he is contacted by Carrie-Anne Moss ""Trinity"" his suspicions begin to pan out and he is introduced to a crew of rebels led by ""Morpheus"" (Laurence Fishburne) on a mission to expose the extent to which mankind is merely a plaything of the ""Matrix"" living entirely imagined lives. The system is onto them, though, and using Hugo Weaving's ""Agent Smith"" and a fifth columnist from within the group's own ranks, is bent on their destruction. This film has that scarce value of having exciting (rather than delicately choreographed) action scenes married together with an intelligent, at times quite thought-provoking dialogue mixing fact/fiction and religiosity on a clever premiss that once we start to question reality; the conspiracy theories can run wild - and right to the top! Is ""Neo"" the one to save humanity - some sort of resurrected ""one""? The Wachowski Brother remind us how to make a good sci-fi fantasy, but also that in his day Keanu Reeves was a one of the best, his boy-next-door good looks, agility and charisma working very well here. Of course the effects have dated, but one you've been subsumed into the plot - and if you are watching on a big screen - then that matters not; it's a gripping chunk of cinema depicting loyalty, determination and integrity that I really enjoyed.","9"
"Pjtaylor-96-138044","A stone-cold science-fiction classic.","17 April 2018","'The Matrix (1999)' is a stone-cold classic for sure, a science-fiction action thriller that has seeped into pop-culture purely because it is so fantastically constructed. It somehow manages to make its incredibly out-there concept digestible for mass-audiences without dumbing it down or marring it with profuse amounts of heavy-handed exposition. It's just as fun when pondering its existential themes as when delivering its phenomenal action-set pieces, all of which push the boundaries of both visual and practical effects in almost every area of the field. Keanu Reeves always gets a lot of credit for the amazing effort he puts into his stunt work and fight choreography (and rightly so), but major props must also be given to Lawrence Fishburne, Carrie-Anne Moss and Hugo Weaving who all put in fantastically physical performances in some very demanding sequences and don't seem to be talked about nearly as much as the film's stoic star. This goes without mentioning the stunt crew, of course, as well as everyone else behind the camera. The piece is never solely defined by its stand-out action scenes, which is why it works so well as a whole. Though each sequence is breathtakingly entertaining, it's only because they are contained in such a competent and interesting production that they work as well as they do. The whole picture is energetic and engaging, even if it has a few pacing issues and some story elements which are a little contrived. It's actually one of the best action films of all time. 8/10","8"
"gbill-74877","Iconic","30 May 2020","Lots of fun, with many iconic moments. The martial arts inspired moves, slow motion visual effects, and concept behind a dystopian world where humans have been subjected by Artificial Intelligence are all fantastic. The film doesn't stand up to a lot of detailed scrutiny and is more about action than it is about the deeper themes it could have explored, but for me it was easy to go along for the ride and enjoy it. It's a great combination of science-fiction and action, the pace of the film is excellent, and the journey Neo is on to discover his ability to overcome the 'reality' around him is a joy to watch. There is something transcendent and powerful about it, a fantasy maybe or something with philosophical overtones, even if it is grounded in a popcorn flick. I'm not usually a big Keanu Reeves fan but he's fine here, as is the rest of the cast, Laurence Fishburne and Hugo Weaving especially. Weaving is Agent Smith, and has perhaps the best lines of the film, condemning humanity with a snarl:

""I'd like to share a revelation that I've had during my time here. It came to me when I tried to classify your species and I realized that you're not actually mammals. Every mammal on this planet instinctively develops a natural equilibrium with the surrounding environment, but you humans do not. You move to an area and you multiply and multiply until every natural resource is consumed, and the only way you can survive is to spread to another area. There is another organism on this planet that follows the same pattern. Do you know what it is? A virus. Human beings are a disease, a cancer of this planet.

"paulclaassen","What can one say: GROUNDBREAKING!!","22 January 2022","Whether you're into fantasy or not, if you haven't seen 'The Matrix' you are robbing yourself of a cinematic movie experience unlike anything you've seen. New visual effects technology were created especially for 'The Matrix', hence you're bound to see visuals you've never seen before. Since 'The Matrix', off course, the effects have been copied hundreds of times in movies - as visual perfection, and as satire.

'The Matrix' has an ingenious script you probably won't understand with just one viewing. This is a complex premise than needs to be explored and carefully analyzed. Although we've seen the premise before where an individual is being chosen as 'The One', it has seldom achieved the effect it does in 'The Matrix'. Keanu Reeves delivers his most memorable performance to date as Neo, a software creator and computer genius, who soon finds himself being chosen for a higher purpose.

Laurence Fishburne stars as Morpheus - also a role bound to immortalize the actor in one of his best performances. Hugo Weaving is fantastic as the film's main antagonist, Agent Smith - a role I'll best remember him for.

'The Matrix' boasts groundbreaking visuals with stunning cinematography and photography. If you're not into fantasy, do yourself a favor and watch the movie even if just for the visual effects that changed the movie industry forever. The editing is also flawless.

The film is very weird and difficult to understand at first, but as the story unfolds, it slowly but surely starts making sense. Some moments in the film does seem a bit slow, but it is very necessary so we can fully understand the film. The action sequences are incredible, as the film builds to a stunning climax.","10"
"framer94","6/10- okay sci-fi action movie","25 April 2009","I remember seeing the posters for the Matrix plastered all over the place in the summer of 1999. It looked like just another action movie... and after seeing it, it IS really, but is just a little bit better than most mainstream action films.

Keanu Reeves is now Neo- every role he stars in is based on his icy soulless Neo character.

One of the reasons I hate the Matrix is because it rips off a lot of animes instead of being influenced by them (The most obvious is Ghost In The Shell and Golgo 13). The other is that between 1999-2004, it was the sworn god of all goth dickwads on the face of the planet.

All the actors in this movie, Reeves, Fishburne, the woman who plays Trinity, all of em I can't stand now, just because of all the hyperbole that was cemented into our heads to go see this film even if you've just been diagnosed with terminal cancer.

"ElMaruecan82","The Unbearable Artificiality of Being ...","29 September 2017","It all comes down to the most central question of humanity: ""To be or not to be"". I've always asked myself whether reality was an absolute or a relative notion. I'm not a scientist but let me tell you something, if reality existed, there would never be marital arguments. You think I'm joking, I'm only channeling the main idea about ""The Matrix"", it relies on the combination of individual perceptions, reality depends on what we see, it's a subjective process. You can build countless interpretations out of it, one movie did it without being too complex and by kicking some ass on the field of action.

That movie is the Wachowski's brothers (now sisters) ""The Matrix"". Released in 1999, definitely at the right time.

Indeed, every decade, sometimes more, there comes one game changer especially in science fiction, ""2001"", ""Star Wars"", ""Blade Runner"", ""Terminator 2"" brought something fresh and new, technically and visually and in 1999, the year that changed the face of cinema, there was ""The Matrix"", ""Avatar"" would be the following phenomenon but let's stick to the pre-millennium period, perhaps one of sci-fi greatest momentum, forever immortalized with the iconic bullet-time effect. I don't need to describe it, the effect was used in three early 2000's comedies out of 5, establishing ""The Matrix"" as an instant classic, along with ""Saturday Night Fever"" or ""Jaws"".

Now, ""What is ""The Matrix""?"" asks himself Thomas Anderson aka Neo, suspecting that there's something in his surrounding world that looks too artificial to be believable, as if we came to an age where machinery has spread to all the aspects of life, so we can't really tell where the virtual worlds ends and the real one begins. But I remembered a research I made a few years ago, where I discovered that the opposite of virtual wasn't real but ""actual"". Virtual never intended to mean something that doesn't exist in reality, but something that carries a certain potential of existence and can either happen or not happen, if it does happen, it becomes actual. The merit only starts to exist once you decide it to be in an actual form.

In ""The Matrix"", the most heart-pounding and thought-provoking aspect relies on this simple equation, whatever happens might be a dream or might announce a form of reality that is yet to be discovered but it's a matter of choice whether the hero embraces it or not. It's all a matter of taking the blue or the red pill. There's something both corny and genius in the pills metaphor, the idea that it's all a matter of a simple binary choice, exactly as if human thinking adopted computer binary programming. Yet each choice leads to a totally different scenario, one establishes your surrendering to the convenient and reassuring power of computer (why not after all), another your position as an enemy whose duty is to free people.

Which is rather contradictory, why would you give anyone a choice to live in one of the world you intend to destroy, in fact, it's even interesting, if we take the notion of choice as luxury, wouldn't be the most ethical thing to do, to give people the possibility to choose whether they want to be controlled by the Matrix or not, rebels are revolutionary, not reformists. Well, we see one of the members Trinity (Carrie Ann Moss) killing innocent policemen so we're never sure we're dealing with the good guys in any case. Maybe living an ordinary life without asking too much questions would be the wisest choice. But I'm digressing

The film ventures in the realm of an artificial reality that still looks real and convincing thanks to a great design and a greenish tone that conveys the whole computer imagery and rather grim and bleak look of the dystopian future, without overplaying them. It's on the technical special effects that the film elevates the term science fiction, reminding us the core of the genre, it's all about scientific achievement and a fiction, a story where we find our own truth behind, a story that echoes our own uncertainty. The film was made in 1999 along with other 'existential' films but unlike ""American Beauty"" and ""Fight Club"", the film shows a clear enemy and antagonists, which helps to deliver its complex message; leaving us enough intellectual material to think about. It's one of these films that challenge your intelligence even when you try to determine its flaws.

Some critics pointed out the use of conventional themes, of faux spirituality, but let's call them universal, for the theme of the Chosen One is only one facet of the story. Keanu Reeves as Neo is once again playing a hero trying to conquer his secret force. Morpheus is the wise man who believes in him. And Hugo Weaving is the image of the cold and bureaucratic force. But just because the antagonism is clearly established, doesn't make the fight even more complex, it's not just about taking reality back but convincing yourself that it's worth fighting for, it's exactly like jumping on a building, and convincing yourself that you won't fall, one of the best things about the film is that the initial struggle is more internal, it's between Anderson and Neo, and his conviction that it's worth fighting for.

The final showdown establishes his rise to awareness and provides the film's climactic showdown but it's the only third act that could have worked for the film, otherwise, it would have been some faux spiritualism clichés one after the other. The film came as a right moment, it had the relevance, the resonance and the idea that we were all heading up to a world where we don't have to trust what we see. It's ""V for Vendetta"", ""The Matrix"" and any other movies that inspired conspiracies theories.","9"
"karthik-globalsoul","The Matrix  embedded arrays of pure class","29 June 2007","(Karthik Narayan) In the world of computers, there is an abbreviation  WYSIWYG  What You See Is What You Get! The Matrix is a movie based on computer programs, viruses and Artificial Intelligence  after watching this movie I did a little jig of my own  WYBIWYA  What You Believe Is What You Are. In Latin (and Greek, perhaps??)  Cogito, ergo sum (I think, therefore I am).

The Matrix has the perfect blend of everything  action, mystery, suspense and a little romance of sorts thrown in at the end. And there are various versions of thrilling moments in the movie  in the beginning where you are not supposed to understand anything; the middle where you are supposed to begin understanding the turn of events but your mind refuses to believe what you see; and finally the end where you can't understand the ""reality"" but like it anyway. One thing holds you to your seat - the adrenaline never stops pumping.

The moments of truth hit you hard as you progress from one scene to another and sooner or later, you realize you are looking at a philosophy strongly etched in principles of fate, Good vs Evil and the eternal search and battle for belief, faith, freedom and justice.

Keanu Reaves as Neo is too good  the bewildered look on his face match ours as nothing really materializes in his head and his emotions on screen look very ""real"" even though it's supposed to be virtual (get it?). Laurence Fishburne as Morpheus is the coolest dude around and the way he carries himself in the movie makes it come alive. Andy and Larry Wachowski have outdone themselves in the Direction of this movie (duh)  easily their best work and the one which skyrocketed them to the Hollywood walk of fame.

Carrie-Ann Moss as Trinity has a glossy look on her face as though she has been transformed into some machine, but redeems herself in the action scenes where she looks stunning. If looks could kill (and looks do kill)  she would be the perfect hostess for that idiom for this movie. And what can I say about the Agent! If all villains could look this smart, I would cheer for them any-day  but yes, the last hurrah is always for the hero in any movie, and so I give in.

Action-oriented, adventurous, eye-catching stunts, visually stimulating camera-work (especially the scenes in the rain) mind-boggling fight scenes and awesome display of dialogue delivery make the Matrix easily one of the best movies of the century. It most certainly features in my best movies for all time to come.","10"

"851222","Timeless Masterpiece","18 May 2014","Greetings from Lithuania.

What can i say about this film, that hasn't been said before. Probably nothing new - just another review that worships ""The Matrix"".

Yes, the film is perfect, perfect in any way you prefer. I just like almost all of us have watched ""The Matrix"" for ~20 times, in 2-3 years after it's release and each time that was unforgettable tour de force. The timeless plot, characters, action. It created a new dimension in movie making.

Almost 10 years have passed since i saw it last time, and last week i got the blue ray of it, and sat down for a re watch, on my new projector and sound system. ""The Matrix"", to my little surprise, hasn't aged a bit. Really. The visuals still look the same as it was in the year 2000. Still. The same. After 15 years! After ""Avatar"" and many more visuals feasts that i have witnessed, the look of this film in my eyes hasn't aged a bit - i won't lie - i was surprised. Maybe it's because the driving force behind this masterpiece was always a plot, the characters and action wasn't over forced - it always looked as a natural thing of events.

So i won't go in to details, plot - you all know it very well. What i like to say, is that you should check this film again if you haven't see it for some time, it really looks stunning. Ye, i said ""if you haven't see it for some time"" - i don't believe that there is a living human who likes to watch movies that hasn't see and admire this film before.","6"
"mr_tambourine_man72","What is The Matrix? Overblown eye-candy, nothing more.","21 February 2002","I was first attracted to The Matrix by the slick trailers and TV spots. However, I did not choose to see it in theaters until after hearing many outstanding recommendations from friends. I heard such comments as ""man, this movie will mess with your mind!"", ""I still don't understand it"", ""you have to watch it a few times to get it"", and many variations on ""the special effects are awesome!"". I consider myself to be a fan of mind-benders, and the occasional sweet special effect is always welcome in my book. So I go and see The Matrix. In my first viewing, I literally fell asleep. Now, you must be wondering how a person could possibly fall asleep watching such an action packed film. It was easy. The action just doesn't do it for me. You might also wonder why I would write a review for a movie I didn't see in it's entirety. Actually, I rented it on DVD and sat through the whole thing months later. I have many large complaints with The Matrix. Let's start with the whole ""mind-bender"" thing. A psychological thriller this is not. In fact, the fairly unoriginal concepts behind the story are presented in the first 20 minutes or so, and then pretty much never mentioned again. This movie will not keep anyone thinking unless they are incredibly stupid and can't get past the first 20 minutes. The special effects and the visuals in general are indeed spectacular. Good for them. That doesn't do a whole lot for me when there is no substance to back them up. The Matrix, as a whole, is an exercise in style over substance. In all fairness, it is very stylish. Here's the main problem: the movie does about 20 minutes of posing as a psychological thriller (as the trailers would have you believe), and then drops you off into the realm of sci-fi and video game violence. The characters basically just start fighting, running, and shooting things. It feels every bit as stupid and pointless as the next action movie. The only saving grace is the fact that it is much prettier than the next action movie. Once again, eye candy is the key to this movie. Although it seems to easy, I will rail on Keanu Reeves performance in The Matrix. Well, actually, the only thing that can be said about it is that it was weak (like all Keanu's performances, I suppose). Fortunately, it won't distract most viewers from all the cool explosions, gun shots, and camera tricks.

In summation, don't go in expecting an intelligent movie, you'll be disappointed. However, if you enjoy action, special effects, or sci-fi stuff in general, then I find it hard not to recommend this movie to you. I guess when it comes down to it, special effects and action aren't my thing. I need a little more substance.","10"

The characters are strong, characters that you can root for. However, the real star here is the direction and visual effects. The effects in particular are amazing, spell-binding, and revolutionary, even more than ten years since it first premiered. The action scenes are intriguing and tense, and overall the film is never something other than engaging. In that respect is where the film works the best, and is sure not to disappoint. That is pretty much where the excitement lies, and in the world the film creates.","9"

""The Matrix"" is a movie in which you will be stunned, it's a really nice movie with a well-known cast of actors.

The movie show us a hacker who learns from mysterious rebels the truth about the real life and the fake one. It also show us the two sides of war. From one hand is the rebels and on the other hand is the controllers of them.

The well-known cast plays an important role on how we see this movie because of theirs interpretations. Keanu Reeves as Neo made an outstanding performance, such as Laurence Fishburne as Morpheus and Carrie-Anne Moss as Trinity. Hugo Weaving as Agent Smith (the bad guy) made an also good performance.

Despite the revolutionary special effects, high octane action sequences, a promising story and a great ensemble cast, the film falters in its overall execution. The story is beyond overly confusing with large amounts of exposition to catch up the viewers on what's happening. The film asks intelligent existential questions and develops an intriguing universe to accompany it, but the interest level begins to fall when it is over-beard with confusing explanations as to what's going on with characters I don't find too particularly engaging. Although the film is a historic standpoint in special effects and storytelling, in my opinion the film feels dull and exhaustingly boring.","9"

"adamzad","Great Movie with a Couple of Plotholes","12 May 2003","Since there are already plot summaries of this movie, I won't waste your time rewriting them. On to my review...

I only had 2 problems with this movie:

1) Since the machines are dependent on solar power, (as if they couldn't CHANGE where they got their electricity from) the world governments decide to block out the sunlight. Well. Isn't that bright. Wakie, wakie... without sunlight, plants don't grow. Without plants, animals don't have anything to eat. Without plants and animals, PEOPLE have nothing to eat. So... Let's kill off every living thing on earth, just so we can say we won. We beat the machines. Someone's got the IQ of a grape. Peeled. Still, that's par for the course with governments, so it's not beyond the realm of possibility.

2) Even accepting that our twits... er... governments DID block out the sun, here comes Morpheus, the freedom fighter. His plan is to release all of these people (who are COMPLETELY unaware of their actual situation are are living perfectly happy ""lives"" INSIDE The Matrix) into the real world... where their muscles have to be rebuilt, where there is no sun, no plants, no animals, and NO FOOD. What's the phrase? From Scylla to Charybdis, perhaps? From frying pan to fire? Given that we only know what our senses tell us, and the input from our senses is interpreted by our brains, wouldn't these people be better off INSIDE? There they may be ""slaves,"" but they are living comfortable, happy lives (according to the sensory data that their brains are registering, at any rate). They get to determine the course of their virtual lives just as if they were living in the real world (excepting that they're more comfortable than they would be aboard the Nebuchadnezzar).

Now, having gotten THAT off of my chest, this is a great movie, provided it is approached from the correct perspective. I didn't see Top Gun for the plot. Nor did I see Days of Thunder for the plot. This movie is EYE-CANDY. Great special effects, decent (while not outstanding) acting, lots of action sequences, and visually pleasing thespians (Carrie-Anne Moss and Belinda McClory are both knockouts and, I assume, the feminine gender appreciates the surface aspects of Keanu Reeves). Perhaps the best acting was done by Hugo Weaving (compare Agent Smith with Elrond in ""Lord of the Rings"" and you'll see the range that Weaving achieves).

I have to dock the movie a point each for the plotholes mentioned above, but, subsequent to the suspension of disbelief, the storyline follows the expected paths and provides substantial entertainment (which is what we were watching it for in the 1st place). ""If one expects plot, one will be disappointed. If one does NOT expect plot, the lack of it goes unnoticed."" (Credit: C.S. Knepper)

I saw it a couple of more times and I still liked it, although not as much as the first time. Now that I've grown up and am much more mature, I know it's ridiculous. Not very good storyline and Keanu Reeves doesn't know what a great movie is. On the other hand, Carrie Ann-Moss is a terrific actress and was perfect for the role. The directors try to make the movie longer by moving the storyline slowly, especially the parts where Neo transported to the matrix. The directors do that only because they don't have any more special effects to put into the movie. Movies aren't about special effects, they're about acting, such as The Godfather and Marlon Brando.","9"

The Matrix establishes itself among a list of movie standards such as: Jaws (1975), popular mainstream horror movie and was preceded by Psycho (1960) and The Birds (1963), and more recently 1408 (2007).

Ghost Busters (1984), a mainstream fantasy, comedy, horror movie.

Go see this movie 5 times more, then watch the Animatrix & read the books, maybe you need a manual to make it to your minds who knows....

I agree that a quite similar idea was used in Alex Proyas' Dark City. But what if I tell you both Dark City, & this so called Star Trek Episode is a complete copy of another concept?

Go see for yourself. Google these keywords down :

""ALLEGORY OF THE CAVE by Plato""

""Thinking so ruthless for the ones who create or derive ideas & improve them to a point where they can shape it into a movie, & not showing any respect for creative minds""....

it's a very easy thing to do. If I start to think so blame oriented, then I come to a conclusion which is ""from this time ,no one should make a movie. No horror movies! No vampires, no werewolves, no creatures. No thrillers with killers. Why? because these were all used 200 centuries ago in books & literature. Oh all movies are copycats right!?!? Then I think we should kill ourselves, drink cyanide or something. there is nothing else to do in this world.","5"
"The-Sarkologist","The nature of reality and how we deceive ourselves","12 October 2013","My friend commented on how the theme in this movie really appeals to him at this time. There a numerous ideas that come out of this movie, and most importantly, for me to describe it, I will have to give a lot away. As such, I shall warn those who are going to read this, if you don't want your enjoyment of this film ruined, then I suggest you cease reading now.

The major theme in this movie is what is reality. As such it follows the themes of movies such as The Truman Show, News From the Good Lord and Dark City, all of which are movies that I love. The difference with The Matrix is that it is much more action orientated. As such it should appeal to those who love post-modern movies and want a lot to think about, and it should appeal to those who love special effects and huge amounts of action.

The movie is based around a man named Neo. He is a computer hacker and is being sort out by Morpheus, an unknown person. Morpheus is also being pursued by agents of some organisation that seem to be able to remove peoples' mouths, though to Neo this becomes a dream. When Neo finally finds Morpheus, he learns that everything that he knows is a dream. Reality is in fact far different. Neo is one of billions of people plugged into a huge computer system. He is there because in the early 21st century, humanity lost a war with the machines, and during that war the earth was blocked off from the sun. To get the energy they needed, the machines began to use humans. As such, they created an artificial environment in which humans live, and as they live, the machines live off of the electricity that the human brain produces.

Basically the world in which Neo lives is not real - it seems real, but in reality there are things that happen that suspend his disbelief. He asks somebody at the beginning of the movie if he ever feels like he lives in a dream. The reply is ""of course, all the time"" but this comes from the mouth of a drug induced person. Once Neo is out of the matrix, he learns that Morpheus considers him to be the reincarnation of a saviour, one who can manipulate the matrix to his will. He also learns that these agents are not humans but security programs created by the machine to stop the free humans from destroying their power. These security programs are incredibly powerful in the matrix, but have no power outside of it. In the matrix that can appear wherever they like, do whatever they like, and take whatever form they like. In fact they will possess other people (or personas - the person's computer image - their real existence is in a tube in the side of a huge machine).

There are a number of Christian parallels in this movie (though they are not intentional considering the idea is more Buddhist than Christian). The major one is in regards to the matrix and the reality. The world is like the matrix - it is real but we refuse to look beyond it to the heavenly realms. To us the heavenly realms are a fantasy and the world we live in is solid reality and when it comes to miraculous things then we conveniently look for a way to disprove them and if we can't then we ignore them. The truth is that heaven is very much reality, and this world is only a temporary existence created by God for us to inhabit.

Neo takes the form of a Christ figure. He was in the matrix once and began the plan to remove people from the matrix and give them back their freedom just as Christ came to Earth to die for our sins in preparation for judgement day when we face God and explain to him why he should not destroy us. Neo's return parallel's Jesus' return. At first he seems like nothing, but the oracle tells him that he will be the one perhaps in his next life. This prediction comes true as he is killed, but as he has died in the matrix, he comes back to life. The matrix is not reality, and though most people, when killed in the matrix, will die in reality, the most hardy and strong willed of people can survive - Neo is such a person - but when he returns to life it becomes evident that he has gained immense power over the matrix.

The final thing that I must raise is the description of Zion - the place where everybody will party once the machine has been defeated. This is a very biblical reference, and I think this is made in the movie as well. Zion is the hill upon which Jerusalem is built, so wherever one reads the word Zion in the bible, one reads Jerusalem. The city of Jerusalem does not correspond to the geographical city but it symbolises the place where God will live with his people. The reason that Jerusalem is used in this way is because it was the city where God's temple was built in the time of the Old Testament, and where the temple was, that was where God lived. The reference to Zion in The Matrix is a reference to the fact that when Christ returns, all who trusted in him will be in paradise, all that is rotten and decayed having passed away.","9"
"IonicBreezeMachine","The Wachowskis career defining film that changed action filmmaking and blockbuters forever","18 January 2022","Thomas Anderson (Keanu Reeves) on the surface is a program writer for a software company, but on his off hours is a hacker known as Neo. Following an encounter with fellow hacker Trinity (Carrie-Anne Moss), Neo is soon contacted by Morpheus (Laurence Fishburne) who tells him he's being hunted by Agent Smith (Hugo Weaving). When Neo finally meets Morpheus, he learns the world as he knows it is in fact a simulated reality known as The Matrix created to imprison the minds of humanity as their exploited by machines. Furthermore, Neo learns he may be the one who will free humanity.

Following The Wachowskis initial works of the screenplay for Assassins and their critical success the duo scored with the lesbian neo-noir Bound, the Wachowskis were able to parlay this into the momentum they needed to get The Matrix into production with the help of noted action producer Joel Silver. Made for $60 million and grossing $450 million, the film redefined the action genre with not only its utilization of iconography synonymous with Hong Kong heroic bloodshed and Japanese anime (such as Ghost in the Shell), but also in its attempts to tackle themes of Buddhism, transhumanism, reality vs illusion, and has even achieved revised retrospective analysis for its Transgender subtext. In its initial release The Matrix became a massive hit easily becoming the biggest success of a wave of other simulated reality movies (Dark City, eXistenZ, The Thirteenth Floor, etc.). The movie has some truly amazing visuals and action sequences to it, and while its ideas and themes are about as subtle as an anvil they are well integrated into the film to create an engaging experience. But with that said there are some cracks that have made themselves more noticeable with time.

In terms of creating a fully realized visually interesting world, The Wachowskis gave audiences something truly amazing. Utilizing the artwork of comic artists Geof Darrow and Steve Skroce in combination with some dazing and revolutionary effects, the film creates a visually engaging world consisting of the overly ordered and generic ""City"" within The Matrix, and the harsh cyberpunk infused and at times almost Giger-esque apocalyptic future that makes up the real world. The film does a good job of distinguishing between the two worlds flawlessly with the color coding giving a good sense of what's The Matrix and what's ""real"" and visually speaking you could watch the movie on mute and still understand what's going on. On the action side, The Wachowskis use those same elaborate effects with a mixture of Hong Kong influenced wire-fu and gun fights choreographed by noted martial arts choreographer Yuen Woo-ping. The Matrix came at a time when the United States was seeing a greater influx of Hong Kong action talent in their productions with John Woo having established credibility as a director with Hard Target, Broken Arrow, and especially Face/Off which came the closest to capturing his poetic elegance seen in his films like A Better Tomorrow as well as Jackie Chan's successful attempt at international crossover with the sleeper hits of Rumble in the Bronx and Rush Hour. The Matrix was unquestionably the pinnacle of Eastern influence on Western action cinema and with its energy and sense of scale it's no wonder why it spawned so many imitators (The One, Bulletproof Monk, etc.) that tried to recapture its appeal to diminishing returns.

While stylistically and visually The Matrix endures, over time the film has seen its initial novelty wear off with some of its flaws more noticeable with the passage of time. The biggest flaw is probably in the film's lack of subtlety with its themes presented pretty bluntly with its allusions to Jesus Christ, Buddhism, and Transhumanism delivered with the impact of a sledgehammer with exchanges such as ""You're my savior man, my own personal Jesus Christ"". I think because action films tended to avoid trying to discuss anything of weight audiences were blown away by the novelty of seeing such themes discussed gave the film some leeway with audiences and made the chunkiness of the dialogue more forgivable. The characters are also pretty bland with Thomas Anderson/Neo basically being an ""everyman"" serving as an audience proxy and Morpheus and most of the human resistance playing their roles in a very muted and stoic manner. The only ones who manage to break from this emotional muteness are Joe Pantoliano and Hugo Weaving who without question give the best performances in the film by virtue of the fact they're given more than one note to play. With that said though, Keanu Reeves does well as an everyman and the journey he goes on is still thematically and visually engaging even if it holds your hand most of the way.

The Matrix was and remains one of the defining action films of the 90s and its success opened the door for imitators, yes, but also for more ambitious themes and ideas to be attempted in large scale Summer tentpoles. Without The Matrix we definitely wouldn't have more ""out there"" films like Inception or Doctor Strange and thematically and visually speaking it still holds up. However despite the craft to The Matrix there is a chunkiness to the dialogue and pretty much every theme and idea touched upon in The Matrix is spelled out with little opportunity for missing it. But despite its lack of subtlety it's a very passionate film that pulls you into its world (if not necessarily its characters) and its transhumanist allegories have been given additional meaning with the passage of time.","8"
"hoochiemoochie","I can't even explain how horrible this movie is","30 July 2003","Maybe it's not that bad, but what makes it all the worse is how highly acclaimed it is. I had to keep slapping myself to stat awake during this movie. The storyline for this movie is sooooo modern and overplayed. This is in a way just a hyped up and sci-fi version of the truman show. I will never understand how this movie got to be soooo well liked. This is one of the only movies that everybody seems to disagree with me on. So if you're wondering why i'm writing this it's just to prove anybody wrong who thinks that there is nobody who hates this movie because i do. Also if you're a fellow matrix hater then i feel you're pain especially this year now that 2 of them are coming out at the same time practically. I'm just glad the second one failed moneywise so that hopefully the third one will get hardly any money and all this talk about the future Star Wars trilogy will be thrown out the window.","7"
"RodrigAndrisan","A spectacular movie!","22 July 2018","I think now, seeing it for the second time, after almost 20 years, that as well without the special effects, the film would have value, only because of the impeccable acting performances of the five protagonists: Keanu Reeves, Laurence Fishburne, Carrie-Anne Moss, Hugo Weaving and Joe Pantoliano. One of the best science-fiction movies ever, filming that still take your breath away after so many years, pure action. Adrenaline, fantasy, myth, precision.","7"
"onjohn","""Welcome to the Real World""","13 May 2010","Never has any movie so completely fulfilled my every wish of a movie experience as The Matrix did, and still does.

I first saw this movie while visiting an older friend of my family in London. The cinema had two parallel shows; The Matrix and The Mummy. We debated for a while which one to chose (he was more than twice my age at the time), he voting for the Mummy, since he knew that story (he thought) from his own matinées growing up. I had heard just rumor about these two movies, and only knew that I wasn't very keen on a classical matinée (being 29 at the time). So we went to see The Matrix...

When we left the cinema two hours later, we were both silent. What had we just seen? Slowly we started talking about the movie experience we had just had, or rather, I did. My older friend was very confused, and I think regretted a little that we hadn't seen The Mummy instead. I on the other hand, got more and more excited. My first impressions were of course the special effects, what I learned to be the so called Bullet Time, in the movie. But the more we talked about it, the more the story of this fantastic action movie became the center of discussion.

Yes, the STORY. It spoke to me in so many and interesting ways, I don't even think I understood on that walk home from town. An action movie with so much dialogue, it just doesn't compute! And with so many layers of philosophy, religion, science (fiction) and just pure intelligence, it's not supposed to be in an action movie. Period. Never before (maybe once, with Baraka) has a movie added to and completed my view of life, the Universe and Everything... I'm not sure I slept at all that night.

I saw it again, after returning home to Sweden, and then got the DVD at its first release. Have I got it on Bluray? Not yet!","5"

I looked at my timer and it was at the 42 minute mark and the majority of the movie up to that point was clunky exposition. Other than a few good fight scenes and some killer special effects, one could easily draw a conclusion that the matrix was merely at the right place at the right time.","10"
"freemantle_uk","Rage against the Machine","26 June 2008","The Matrix is a modern classic, a great sci-fi film that is bound in its approach in a number of ways. It is intelligent and thought, but also great on an action/adventure level, giving us the famous bullet time sequence.

The film focuses on a computer programme, Thomas Anderson/Neo(Keanu Reeves), who is interested in illegal activities and wants to find out about the Matrix. He meets up with a group of people led by Morphus (Laurence Fishbourne). It is then that he finds out that the world he knows is not real and that it was really a computer programme to keep the human population in subjugation. He learns that during the 21th century man and machine went to war with each other, which the machines won and kept humans alive as a power sorts. Neo was taken out of the Matrix because it was believe that he was the one to save humanity.

The film asks questions about fate and reality. It is influenced by philosophical ideas from people like Plato. It also reminds me of 1984 during the torture scene when O'Brien tells Winston that the party can alter history and reality with ease. I think as long as you are fairly clever and read a little then you would understand it easily enough. The Matrix is also influenced by Postmodernism where reality and images can be alter and are very influential, but if you know this then you yourself and change the world. It can also be seen as a criticism of science and machinery going too far. The film is also very popular with the cyberpunk sub-culture.

This is a great film, but avoid the sequels like the plague, especially the Matrix Revolutions.","9"
"dougalg","Gwarrr... I'm still trying to escape the horror.","17 April 2002","Why does everyone think this movie is a masterpiece? What differentiates it from your typical, run of the mill, enjoyable action movie? Nothing, except maybe that horridness that is Keanu Reeves.... The action sequences are pretty nice, I'll give you that. But if you want to watch really good action sequences go rent some old-school chinese movies. Or even new ones. Those have the coolest fight scenes imaginable. And the special affects, they were nice, oo, aah... But all they were was eye-candy. They were not the kind of special affects that are so good you don't notice them. Those are the best kind of effects, they mesh with the movie so well that they don't distract from the plot, of course The Matrix doesn't really have a plot. The movie tries to be Cyberpunk, it's based on the novel by William Gibson who is a fantastic writer, so I have to assume that the novel is good. But this movie tries to sort of ask about virtual reality and ""where are we headed?"" and so forth, but it does it so poorly where so many others have done well. Try reading (that's right, _reading_ Gasp!) Otherland, or Neuromancer, or the Diamond Age or Snow Crash or any of the great cyberpunk novels if you want to know what this movie should have been. Or even some movies, like eXistenZ which is not really as like the Matrix as some people would have you believe. Anyway, that's my two cents.","9"

"patrickwigington","Trip Through the Wires","1 September 2012","Looking back at the cyberpunk blockbuster, The Matrix is like a time capsule and culmination of the science fiction movies of the 90's. It's scenes and ideas have become iconic, and that makes it a classic, although more because of its importance rather than it being a great film in and of itself.

The Matrix certainly has a technical brilliance that had a huge effect on the way action movies were filmed. And unlike the deplorable shaky cam aspects of the Bourne movies, the style of The Matrix at least made the action movies that stole from it a little more visually pleasing. The Wachowski brothers certainly created a world that was fascinating to think about and entertaining to watch. While their movie ends up not going quite as far as it could and should have, they made a visually groundbreaking movie that incorporates a lot of interesting and complex philosophical ideas, although the movie doesn't quite live up to the ambitions it sets up for itself.

Other movies from the 90's had similar plots to this one, most notably Dark City, The Truman Show and Strange Days in the fact that the world that we live in is far different that what it seems. The Matrix is, of course, a computer generated world simulating the world as it was in 1999, when in reality the year is closer to 2199, with all humans plugged into the Matrix, and used as batteries for sentient robots that have taken over the world. That premise alone is enough to create a good and interesting movie. The main character Neo, however, also happens to be the Chosen one; the human that will end the war between those humans that have woken up from the Matrix and the machines that want them dead. The interesting thing about the characters that have woken up, is that they can plug back into the Matrix when they need to. And since they know they are in a virtual reality, they can manipulate it to be great fighters and defy gravity and all that good stuff. Neo, being the chosen one, is thought to be able to manipulate the Matrix even more than the other enlightened ones.

Keaunu Reeves plays Neo, in the same vein as Harrison Ford or Bruce Willis, in that his acting is going out of his way to do not much at all. This is fine enough, but since Reeves lacks the charisma that Ford and Willis posses, it makes it hard to really care about him as a character. However, Lawrence Fishborne as Morpheus, the wise and powerful guru figure, is an excellent and enjoyable character. He gives off the air of calmness and ease in a world that is controlled by fear and chaos. Carrie-Anne Moss is also excellent as Trinity, the kick ass chick that Neo inevitably falls in love with. And there is also Hugo Weaving, who plays Agent Smith, a program designed to look like a human inside the Matrix that is sent to kill all those humans that keep trying to wake people up. He and the other agents have significant abilities when it comes to altering the Matrix. They can dodge bullets with ease, and can easily fight any human. Weaving is a highlight of the movie, giving a memorable and vicious performance.

One of the most interesting aspects of this movie is the idea of making a choice. This is most notably shown in the scene where Neo has the choice to take the blue pill, which will send him back to his bed and he will never have to worry about what the Matrix is, or the red pill, which is akin to some form of psychedelic. Neo takes the latter, and becomes enlightened, waking up in a tub surrounded by other humans plugged into the Matrix. The direct effect of taking the red pill is ambiguous, and creates a layer to the movie that makes it both more interesting and more fun. Choice shows up throughout the course of the movie, especially with the Oracle, a wise old lady who lives in the Matrix and predicted the coming of the Chosen one to end the war between man and machine.

Neo then meets the characters on the flying ship the Nebuchadnezzar, including Morpheus and Trinity, as well as other characters that end up being completely inconsequential considering they all die. The character Cypher, played by Joe Pantoliano is probably the worst of these characters. He ultimately betrays the crew of the ship to Agent Smith because he wants to be plugged back into the Matrix. Pantoliano plays the character as a total scumbag that is considerably unlikable. This may be what the Wachowski brothers intended, but it doesn't make for an interesting character. There is simply nothing to like about the man; he is like a neighbor you avoid because he does too much cocaine.

The Matrix has its faults, but it is an entertaining and important movie. The fight scenes are a huge part of the experience, based on those old school, gravity defying Kung Fu movies. The choreography of the fights is exquisitely done by Yuen Woo-ping, who would later go on to choreograph the fights in Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon and Quentin Tarantino's Kill Bill. The use of slow motion and it's ""bullet time"" effect, which allowed the characters to freeze mid air and look exceedingly bad ass is another very cool trademark of the movie.

This science fiction movie created an intriguing world and an exciting story. Visually stunning and action packed, The Matrix is a fun movie to watch, even though it doesn't live up to its own ambitions, and the end becomes tangled in a web of convoluted silliness. It is none the less an important and entertaining achievement.

"XweAponX","Keanu Reeves falls through ""The Thirteenth Floor"" of the ""Dark City""","28 June 2011","Of all of the Reality-Perception films of the 90's... Dark City, The Thirteenth Floor... This film made the loudest noise and propagated cell phone knockoffs, two sequels, and a very long-lived online Virtual Environment/Game. And of course, it put Keanu Reeves, Carrie Anne Moss, and Hugo Weaving on the map.

I saw this film in Anaheim during it's first run, this film was released during the Dot-Com blitz and was an Anthem for Pirates and Hackers alike. Whole Usenet groups spring up overnight, and ""There Is No Spoon"" was being painted in Subway Tunnels just like ""Frodo Lives"" in the early 60's when Lord Of The Rings inspired cult-like activity.

""What if I give you the Finger --- And you give me my phone call""

This portrayal of open defiance against ""The System"" and it's ""Agents"" rallied people around the world to take up arms against corporate idiocy everywhere, I was very pleased to identify with it.

""How can you talk when you have no mouth?""

-The Corporate response to any attacks by ""Little People"" is to basically cheat - In this film by literally removing Neo's Mouth.

But Neo was the one who would be able to use the same Methods Matrix Agents used, to beat the main Agent ""Smith"" who was a program that developed an Ironically Human Hatred of Humans.

There is so much in there, a lot of religion and philosophy is explored in this short film. But so much has already been said about this film, being a landmark event, there is nothing really much to add to what has been said about it.

But the idea that what we can see, hear, feel, smell, and taste might just be fabricated for us by ""God"" or whatever, this was new to the year these films came out. Like The Thirteenth Floor which was released exactly one month after this was, this film presented the idea that we are not really here at all, we could be somewhere else altogether... And the idea of Virtual Reality is not really a concept of the 90's computer age, it was conceived in the book ""Simulacron 3"" by Daniel F. Galouye... I am not sure when this was written, back when he thought it up, computers were comprised of huge vacuum tubes and were the size of buildings, but somehow, Galoye saw into the future and that a kind of Virtual Reality was possible using computers.

Even today, as we are on the brink of having 3D HDTV's in our houses, the reality of The Matrrix is not far away - If we are not already caught in it, if we are not already living in a Matrix type environment.

And that is the question, isn't it? Because, it is all in our minds anyway...

""I know that this steak isn't real""

But we can still eat it. So, even without spoons, I can still enjoy this film 12 years after it was made. But it should have ended with this one, there should never have been any sequels.","10"
"drqshadow-reviews","A Conceptually Powerful and Hugely Influential Action / Sci-Fi Blockbuster","12 May 2020","What is the Matrix? I can still remember purchasing my ticket back in '99, that clever marketing slogan at the front of my mind, and strapping in for what would prove to be an unforgettable ride. At the time, I thought it was a stunning accomplishment. An instant favorite. Seen in a modern light, a few of The Matrix's tricks and eccentricities have lost their sheen, but the overall package still works quite well.

I can see why my college-aged self thought so highly of it, twenty-plus years ago. It's intelligent without being snooty, accessible without pandering, hip and slick with only a few whiffs of generational fade. A functionally smart summer blockbuster with hints (and occasional brow-beatings) of philosophical wisdom. It manages a tough balance between an innate grace and the constant risk of overstepping its own reach, brushing past edginess and into the trite. Ultimately, it's too cool to suck, even as its wardrobe has gone out of fashion and its plot has been stripped by imposters.

The action scenes and special effects are largely to thank for that, still sharp and crisp despite so many years. The Wachowskis were wise to insist upon Yuen Woo-ping for the film's frequent fight sequences, given their essential reality-bending nature and Woo-ping's history with the Hong Kong scene. His touch gives those brawls, both armed and unarmed, an unfamiliar air that makes the impossible seem plausible and still sets them apart. The script is generally very good, too, although it sometimes, obviously, thinks a little too highly of itself. Everyone is SO GRIM all the time, which can feel smothering after two hours. Still, its ability to convey and explore some very tricky conceptual terrain, in a way that's both coherent and dynamic, is downright remarkable.

Now into its third decade, The Matrix remains a great time, even if I might roll my eyes at a line here or there. Still an all-timer, though? Well, that's tricky. As a standalone, the movie itself probably deserves an eight out of ten, but its style, ambition and lasting influence merits a little extra credit.","2"
"vengeance20","Good, But Very Complex","7 April 2021","Watched this film for the first time last weekend after getting the original trilogy on DVD. I've recently been watching films I've never seen before (big hyped/over-hyped ones) & given I've heard much about this film & how popular it is (even after 20 years) I thought to give it a watch. Now, I'm not big on Sci-Fi Films, so for me to even understand a gist of this film is something, well if Tenet is anything to go by this film is a piece of p!$$ to follow. But anyway, after watching, the film I think it pretty overrated for what it is.

The plot is Keanu Reeves plays Neo, a man that thinks something is wrong with the world, and is struggling to find out what it is. He eventually finds Morpheus, who explains to him, why the world seems fake. He then tells him why the alternate reality, The Matrix was created & that Neo must fight an underground war against powerful computers who have constructed The Matrix.

The plot of the film is simple enough, but how it is executed, is quite another level of confusing in itself. Now, like I said, I'm not big on Sci-Fi Films so maybe my understanding of the film from the beginning will be too casual & grounded for a complex film. The film has great effects for its time, not to mention how they haven't aged a bit since the release, however, the characters were dull & uninteresting, that or they didn't exactly seem engaging to me. The films plot wasn't at all engaging & I found it hard to understand what was going on by the time the film got to around the 2 hour mark. Which then brings me to my next issue with the film, it was too long, yes, the film was 2 hours & 4 minutes long & really did start to drag after the 100 minute mark.

Like I said before, the effects are great (even for a film of its time), but the plot wasn't all that despite being simple, the execution of the plot, the pacing, the characters & the scenes were a little dull (not bad) but some what dull, bland & un-engaging to the point where you got lost in the final act & didn't know what was what or who was who. You just found it hard to get invested in the film never mind interested. Maybe its one of those films I need to watch a couple more times to understand it better, I don't know, but it may just be the case that I will never get it, just like I'll never get the over hype this film has.

"martinpersson97","A clever script and ground-breaking effects","13 August 2021","The Matrix is a movie that has been talked about a lot, and gaines its fair share of acclaim.

It is without a doubt totallt deserved. Presenting a clever narrative about an ordinary man being dragged into a scifi adventure, it opens up interesting questions about our future and provides a deep message.

The actors do a good job, I am usually not to keen on Keanau Reeves, but with a strong script like this, he works very well. The action scenes and visual effects, of course, are a main draw here and they are ground-breaking, as I am sure you all know by now.

For better (or worse), the popularity of this movie opened up a vast world to explore in other medias, some great, others pretty lackluster - but we will get to that another time.

"Marx Marvelous","We've been so dumbed down....","23 August 2001","I originally gave this flick 9 stars - I retract my vote and give it 4. The more you think about this movie the dumber it gets.

I'm convinced that our culture has been so dumbed down that it can be duped into thinking that movies like this are ""the best ever made"" ... much like the drecks of music (Brittany, NSync, et.al.) can sell multiple plantinums.

Our youth culture has been living under a stupid-rock for so long, they wouldn't know a masterpiece of a film if it jumped out and bit them on their collective ass.

Hey, I like a good action flick as much as the next guy, but come on, I read messages here that state that the people who don't like The Matrix ""just don't get it."" Sorry kiddies, there is nothing to get. Nothing spiritual, challenging, or anything that ""makes you think."" You want a good movie that challenges your concept of reality, then check out Brazil or The Usual Suspects. Even Fight Club can make you scratch the side of your head more than this pretentious essay in psychobabble.

As far as plot goes, there aren't many flicks with as many holes as this one. Human batteries!? Give me a break. Anybody who stayed awake for high school biology knows that this is preposterous. Sunlight, folks -- you gotta have it. And don't even get me started on the curious lack of muscle atrophy...!

But let me do you all a nice service and shatter the principle piece of your precious flick completely -- the matrix itself. Doesn't anybody question why the hell the bots would give a rat's ass what kind of reality their human-robots are experiencing? I mean (laf,laf) if I was a robot, would I be worrying about coma-state, muscle-atrophied human vegetables waking up from their pods? LAF!LAF! This is the dumbest concept for a flick since the good ol' B-movies of the fifties. Wake up people! And the bots need energy, so they harvest humans?! What the hell are they feeding them? Rocks? They need some organic material, where are they getting it without the sunlight? See where this leads you? Lazy story-telling, if you ask me. And I don't think the writers/directors buy their own crap either, but damn! Keanu looks so cool with the guns and suspend-action drop-kicks, who cares?!

You want a good action flick with a plot that holds together, then check out The Terminator or hell, even Die Hard. At least they don't waste brain cells in a futile attempt at taking themselves too seriously.

"dee.reid","Can Special Effects Really Make A Movie?","9 November 2001","Well obviously so because that really seems to be the only reason people like this movie. From the sound of this you may think I hated this movie, but I didn't. The special effects are truly breathtaking. Don't get me wrong, I love this movie!

Thomas A. Anderson/Neo(Keanu Reeves) makes a horrifying discovery; that life as he knows it, is just a dream. A cover-up for the real world. The real world is basically nothing but endless and endless fields of comatose humans that are used by killer machines as a source of energy. He is rescued by Morpheus(the great Laurence Fishburne) and Trinity(Carrie-Anne Moss). Neo is later introduced to the ""real world"" and is informed of his role in the rebellion against the controllers of it.

Keanu Reeves is awesome in this movie. It's glad to see that his stoner image is starting to fade away. He was awesome in Point Break and Speed. The great Laurence Fishburne is just what he always is, great! His role as Morpheus was probably the most important role in this movie.

The main problem that I have with this movie is it's story. It's basically the Terminator all over again except with better special effects. Numerous influences from many other science-fiction films are everywhere in this movie. Most notably The Terminator, Blade Runner, the Star Wars Trilogy, and even Jacob's Ladder(cuz it deals with issues of what's real and what's fantasy).

Aside from it's flaws, The Matrix is still an excellent sci-fi adventure with some truly amazing stuntwork and breathtaking special effects.

"fernandoschiavi","""Matrix"" is a dystopia, that is, a narrative set in an oppressive, totalitarian universe, where the individual has neither freedom nor control over himself","6 June 2020","It is no exaggeration to claim that ""Matrix"" is a major game changer in the science fiction genre. The Wachowski sisters innovate in the genre by bringing interesting science fiction concepts, innovative visual effects and breathtaking sequences. Is the world around us real or just a mental construction of our brain? Can Descartes' maxim, cogito, ergo sum, really prove our existence? Or is it not just reflections, shadows on the wall of a dark cave? On top of that doubt, inspired directly by science-fiction works such as Ghost in the Shell, the Wachowski sisters established their cinematographic masterpiece, Matrix.

The Wachowski throw us in the middle of their universe. A chase scene, with Trinity (Carrie-Anne Moss) fleeing from police and agents, introduces a narrative where anything is possible: running through walls, dodging bullets and jumping impossible distances. The viewer is unprepared and the initial shock is sure, whether you are a first-timer or a sci-fi fan. Then we see Thomas Anderson, a programmer and hacker in his spare time who adopts the nickname Neo in his virtual adventures. The darkness of his room reveals not only possible antisociality but an escape from the standards of society - here we have a man clearly tired of the world around him. Summoned by the last fighters in the name of human freedom, he hesitates to risk a new one. You have nothing to lose. Neo hesitates very little to take the place of the saving leader for those who lived in isolation and unbelief. From the risk, from the new, from a new world view, the protagonist and hero experiences power. Your life becomes meaningful.

We want to see the new and original gathering of heroes, totally human and completely super powered, defeat the machines that imprisoned the rest of our species in our alienation and imbecility. The Matrix teaches that thinking is essential. Neo had to reflect to accept knowing the truth. Make your choice and learn to pay the price. The Matrix phenomenon can be partially understood if we take into account the profusion of influences and themes that appear, directly or indirectly, in the script and in the images of the film. Here are some examples: dystopia, hope, philosophy, 1984 by George Orwell, martial arts, cyberculture, secret agents and conspiracy theories, romance, Alice in Wonderland by Lewis Carroll, messianism (belief in the coming of the Savior: Jesus, Messiah, Buddha, King Arthur), Greek and Celtic mythology, Brave new world by Aldous Huxley, revolutionary special effects, new superheroic aesthetics (sunglasses, black leather clothes and overcoats replace, respectively, masks, colorful sticky uniforms and capes), science fiction, anime and so on. The surrealist feature by sisters Lana and Lilly Wachowski was released in 1999 and reinvented the action genre a year before the debut of X-Men, considered a landmark of the genre, and featured choreographies of martial arts-inspired fights a year before ""O Tiger and The Dragon "". His special effects in which characters dodge bullets have been copied by several other films since then, and his concepts of virtual reality and artificial intelligence have been imitated just as often. Despite all this, in some crucial ways, Matrix has aged poorly in some ways. It is a fantastic premise, but one that has flaws. Anderson / Neo is a hero of the type who does almost nothing to earn his hero status. He becomes an unbeatable martial arts expert not by training for years, but by being connected to a computer for a few hours. And he becomes omnipotent in the matrix not because he is particularly brave, noble or intelligent, but because, as Morpheus says, he is willing to ""believe"". Even though you have the necessary gift, you need to know your powers and believe in yourself, so that something can happen. Neo can only be ""the Chosen One"" if he really wants it and has faith in his abilities. To do this, you first have to convince yourself that you are capable of fulfilling the task that was assigned to you.

The dismay with Anderson's life seems trivial after the 9/11 attacks, the many extremist acts that followed, the wars in the Middle East, the 2008 financial crisis and the continuing environmental catastrophes. For the post-Matrix generation, getting bored with regular, well-paid jobs has become the dream, not the nightmare. In 1999, Matrix was more interested in how boring it would be to sit comfortably in front of a computer all day. And that is why, despite all its technical and stylistic innovations, it now looks like a monument to generation X's self-pity: a time capsule from a more innocent and accommodating era. In Matrix, the machines chose the late 1990s as the setting for their simulation of reality, explains Agent Smith, because that period was ""the height of civilization"". There's not much chance that a sci-fi villain will say that in 2019.

Hugo Weaving (excellent) plays Agent Smith. It is through Agent Smith that we can get to know the impression machines have on the human race, their enemy. More than hatred, he feels contempt for humanity, for believing that he is dependent on ""misery and suffering"". In the scene in which he interrogates Morpheus, after kidnapping him, he says that the first simulation failed due to the absence of pain. The first Matrix was created to be a perfect human world where no one suffered and everyone could be happy. It was a disaster. Nobody accepted the program. Reflecting on evolution, he compares the human being to a ""dinosaur"" because he is about to be extinct, announcing that ""the future is our world"". Bet also that humans caused the ruin of their species and, worse, the devastation of the planet.

One of the interesting aspects of the film is that it leads us to reflect on our conduct as a species. Although the resistance appears to symbolize the good, the liberation of the human species, Smith's speech points to the devastating effects that our species has left on Earth. Thus, the narrative helps to relativize this positivist division between good and evil that does not seem to apply here. After all, despite everything they are suffering now, they have also oppressed and made them suffer in the past. This also becomes apparent in some moments of the interrogation, when Smith expresses emotions similar to those of humans, conveying feelings such as anger, frustration and tiredness. In this passage, the line that separates humanity from the artificial intelligences that it itself created, in its image, seems tenuous. At the same time, the behavior of individuals trapped in the simulation is comparable to that of robots that perform their function without even realizing that they are being exploited. Bill Pope's director of photography knows very well how to differentiate the two worlds that are shown in the film, with different color filters that help the viewer to understand where the scenes take place. While the real world appears with a bluish tint, what happens in the Matrix is always green. This is the color of the computer codes that appeared on computers, of the characters that make up the simulation. Blue and green, being cold colors, seem to refer to the lack of sunlight, clarity and heat. The film's visual effects are exquisite. I am not talking about CGI, but about a credible construction of the world presented, techniques that make us believe that a man can dodge bullets or jump between buildings. The Wachowski, for this, rely on practical effects and only use computer graphics when really necessary (see sentries) or bullets in slow motion. The exaggeration that we would see in the second film is not yet present and everything is so well fitted and disguised that the work remains current many years after its release - impossible not to vibrate in the emblematic scene of Neo dodging bullets. To mask each of these effects, we have the montage, worthy of the Oscar that he received, from Zach Staenberg, who knows exactly when to start from close-up to the more open planes, in order to transmit more naturally to the impossible movements that we see in screen. The use of slow motion, although constant, is also well controlled and works in conjunction with the movement and great choreography of the action scenes.

""Matrix"" is a dystopia, that is, a narrative set in an oppressive, totalitarian universe, where the individual has neither freedom nor control over himself. In the style of diatopic narratives, the film has a component of criticism and satire in contemporary society, exacerbating its defects as a magnifying glass. Launched in 1999, on the eve of the so feared ""millennium bug"" that never happened, Matrix expresses the concerns and anxieties of a society in full transformation. The entry into this new world, combined with rampant technological progress, opened questions about the future of humanity. In the film, humans became so dependent on machines that they ended up being overwhelmed by them, becoming mere ""batteries"" that generate energy to feed them. Worse still: their alienation is so great that they do not notice that they live in prison.

It is this harmonic mixture of well-thought out elements that make the Matrix a timeless film, which brings millennial questions to today in a dystopia that holds us from the opening seconds to the unforgettable climax of the fourth act. A well-built, complex film, but well explained and closed in on itself, it did not need continuations, especially the two that came, that do not live up to the great work of the Wachowski here. Certainly a sci-fi that deserves to be seen and reviewed over the years. At the box office, Matrix managed to make many millions around the globe, but its influence in the world of cinema was enormous. With the success, the Wachowski sisters got carte blanche to develop two new films, which were shot together and released in 2003: ""Matrix Reloaded"" and ""Matrix Revolutions"".","9"

"Fluke_Skywalker","Often imitated, but never duplicated","14 November 2014","Whatever one thinks about the original 'Matrix', its influence on sci-fi and action cinema in the early part of the new millennium is beyond dispute. It was a game changer the likes of which we hadn't seen since the original 'Star Wars'. But with its fancy bag of technical tricks now as outdated as a 56K modem, does the 'The Matrix' still hold up? Yes, and then some.

'The Matrix' is a triumph. Yes, it remains a visually dazzlingly film, with its bullet-time moves and fast-paced kung-fu choreography, but what makes it a classic is its ability to move us emotionally. Too often in this post-Michael Bay world movies seem to think that action is enough to entertain, but what they seem to forget is that we must first care about the characters and the stakes before the action can do its job.

Like any such film, there are holes in its logic should you choose to look for them, but this is a very well conceived and thoughtfully crafted world that the Wachowski's have built. It's totally immersive to the point that you don't even question it. Every single thing has been meticulously crafted. I can't think of a more fully realized fiction in my lifetime.

It spawned an entire sub-genre of imitators, but the original 'Matrix' stands alone as a bona-fide new millennial classic.","1"
"questl-18592","They Know Kung Fu","6 April 2020","There are so many things the Matrix epitomizes. The 90s/00s. That fear of machines, of Y2K . It's high concept sci-fi, brilliant action that defined a genre and changed the game. A message that is so layered and complex. Even after seeing this countless times I still catch things, clue into little details that I'd never noticed before. This time? All the agents are middle-aged white men, dry tone, business suits, desperately trying to protect the world from the burgeoning growth of anything different, from variables and anomalies. Given the directors' own transitions over the years, I can't help but imagine this was intentional.

Beyond all that, I don't know that there's been a movie in my life that has created such discussion, such buzz. When it came out, it was EVERYWHERE. You couldn't escape it. Now, years later people still know it, still reference it. It has invaded the cultural zeitgeist and shows no signs of going away... No matter how hard each subsequent movie tries to ruin it!","7"

But also, I knew this film would be successful, especially after seeing the original trailer.

Even by the time Star Wars came out, I still felt this was the best sci-fi film to come out that year. The cinematography was edgy, and once again established a maxim which all sci-fi films should accept. It mixed in so many different elements: visionary special effects, sound dialogue, a little mystery, a little action, great kung-fu scenes, and plenty of cool production designs. All in all, a strong film, but it revealed too much of the mystery too early, which seemed to be the film's only downside. Carrie-Ann Moss, Laurence Fishburne, Hugo Weaving, and Joe Pantoliano were all good. But who would have guessed Keanu Reeves could carry a film like this!","7"
"sthapns247","Definition of Sci-Fi","14 October 2003","""The Matrix"" is the definition of science fiction stories. It takes place in a future where the main characters are up against impossible odds in a fantastic environment. The main character is a reluctant hero that despite his inability to believe in himself still manages to pull of the impossible and save the day and the viewer really feels for him. However, unlike normal sci-fi movies, there is also another world set in present day reality... Or is it reality?

That is the question ""The Matrix"" asks. With this window of opportunity open, the sky is the limit... Literally. The movie contains Oscar winning special effects and these amazing visuals do not subtract from the story and plot which is a masterpiece of sci-fi perfection. Borrowing heavily from religious faith, and faith in general, the viewer is pulled into the Matrix by the story telling. Needless to say, the movie never gets boring.

Most people have obviously heard or seen the most famous scenes in the movie. (The rooftop bullet dodge or lobby scene to name a few.) But the entire movie is really one huge special effect. So many of the scenarios or computer generated and almost none of the movie was shot on spot, but rather in a building with the actors surrounded by green screens. This has also spawned the Bullet-Time(tm) idea that was design specifically for this movie. (And yes, it was. Prior to this movie Bullet-Time(tm) did no exists, as it is known today.) And the DVD explains the concept really well.

This is more than just a movie; it is a science fiction movie by definition. It is a near flawless piece of cinema that will be remembered for both it's entertainment value and it's originality. Kudos to you Wachowski brother, you have done us all a favor.

"Blueghost","Review number 3605 :)","6 December 2015","I think now I get the appeal of Tarantino's film. Lots of action, lots of philosophical intrigue, lots of mixing of action with a very extreme sci-fi ""what if"" which questions existence.

Combine that with state of the art SFX and some interesting scripting, and you got yourself one entertaining film. You might call it a re-invention of the martial arts genre American-style, complete with gun battles and a high degree of computer-techno cyber-punk wizardry.

After seeing Tarantino's take on the Hong-Kong / Taiwanese, and Chinese coveted martial arts genre, I think I understand a bit better younger audiences impatience with older action films, or sci fi films that tend to be a bit more ponderous than Tarantino's films.

A lot of the shots in this film and the subsequent sequels, are shots that a lot of film makers have been wanting to do for eons, but lacked the SFX know how to pull them off. Tarantino's done them, and it appears that he has many imitators.

Now, having given it praises, to my middle aged sensibilities, I thought it was a bit out there story wise, though I did appreciate the story, and understood every aspect of it. Even so, it is an intriguing premise, and should keep the hard core sci-fi action film fan entertained.

The sequels get a bit more over the top in staging, including the animated film. But it's a fascinating franchise all the same. It's not for the feint of heart because of all the action and shifting of realities, but it is very interesting all the same.

"eric262003","The Movie That Made Stars Out of the Wachowski's","9 October 2018","When it comes to the making of ""The Matrix"", this truly made the Wachowski's a household name. The only other film I could recall the Wachowski's direct before was the 1996 lesbian based film noir ""Bound"". So though they've been around the block before, 'The Matrix"" solidified their place in the Hollywood industry with fans always anticipating what their next film is going to be.

It comes to no surprise that these siblings have been to movies goers since they were youths and studied the craft very seriously, even if it means recycling ideas from their predecessors but to good effect. The Wachowskis took bits of elements from various film genres to create an incredible masterpiece they can truly call their own here. Along with some butt-kicking from Carrie-Ann Moss and a new direction in his acting career as an action star from Keanu Reeves, we get an exciting action film that's second to none. There's no Shakespeare or Oscars in terms of acting (on the technical level the movie won 4 Oscars).

""The Matrix"" is just an endless array of energetic, exciting science-fiction action adventure that's both over-the-top in its delivery an engaging story that's both surreal and riveting and has a climax that will keep you invested. The film depends heavily not on the acting or the story but very rich in terms of special effects that set the tone for action film that rely heavily in special effects to get their audiences motivated regardless if the film makes any sense or logic.

Set in the year 2099, (though through the Matrix universe, the film looks almost the present) due to a virtual-reality brought on by evil overlords who want to gather human beings and enslave them for their own advantage in a quest for domination. It's much more complex than how I explained it. It's another epic battle between humankind and machinery. We all know who's the heroes and the villains right?

So after our hero Thomas ""Neo"" Anderson (Reeves) swallows a red-pill by a charming rebel named Morpheus (Laurence Fishburne) has successfully unleashed a barrage of warriors who take to the skies by hovercraft as they venture to the real world and virtual reality world as they are up against an Agent Smith (Hugo Weaving) and his slick-dressed goons who are just computer enhanced holograms. Morpheus is depending on Neo to take down these villains and unplug the world back to reality.

The chemistry between Reeves and Fishburne is wonderful in teacher/student format with fists of fury Trinity (Moss) thrown in for good measure. with Smith's ability to shape-shift, we can see bits of traces from Robert Patrick's performance of the T-1000 villain from ""Terminator 2: Judgment Day"" when he morphs into metal-liquid.

As I've mentioned before, the technical team were the masterminds behind this film. Production designer Owen Paterson and comic artist Geof Darrow contributed in making this movie as stylistic as possible with the characters sporting their dark leather apparel and their sunglasses at night. The fight scenes were nearly flawless thanks to fight coordinator Yuen Wo Ping where the performers use tricks with the help of wiring which makes these characters fly like human marionettes.

But it's the direction from the Wachowski siblings who created an atmosphere that closes the end of the 21st century on a dark and cynical note. With the Y2K fear that was buzzing around at the time, this film created and unbiased point of view of the computer industry and the social media platforms it has created. Like everything else the age of the Internet can be both a companion and a monster at the same time.","8"

"Holt344","The Matrix is a landmark in cinema, also one of the best action sci-fi films - My Ultimate Review","10 December 2021","The Matrix is written and directed by the Wachowskis. It is the first installment in The Matrix film series, depicting a dystopian future in which humanity is unknowingly trapped inside a simulated reality, the Matrix, which intelligent machines have created to distract humans while using their bodies as an energy source. When computer programmer Thomas Anderson, under the hacker alias ""Neo"", uncovers the truth, he ""is drawn into a rebellion against the machines"" along with other people who have been freed from the Matrix.

The film has Keanu Reeves, Laurence Fishburne, Carrie-Anne Moss, Hugo Weaving, and Joe Pantoliano in the main roles. The characters are extremely well written, like the whole world and of course the overall writing done by the Wachowskis. Their direction along with the writing plus ambition made this film possible. The film contains some good performances but it's true that it's more focused on the action but luckily, the actors along with the stunt coordinators who guide them, it's the biggest performances. The editing and especially the scene transition is phenomenal, you truly notice how each scene was carefully constructed. The cinematography is top notch, with many scenes becoming iconic because of how mesmerizing and well shot they are. The sound editing along with the musical score is fantastic, along with so many other parts makes this a film worthy of the awards it won.

The first time I watched The Matrix Trilogy was a couple of years ago and I liked the first film a lot but I never watched it how it's supposed to be watched, in 4k and Atmos, which I'm doing now for this trilogy. It's overall a much better experience and I can now say it's brilliant and one of the greatest sci-fi action flicks of all time, a genre-redefining landmark event in film history. Beyond the richly layered narrative, The Matrix is arguably best remembered as a series of stunningly realised setpieces which utilised new technology to deliver such effects as 'bullet-time', with action not only slowed down, but also revolved around. There also a ton of terrific and groundbreaking fight sequences, some are memorable for the 'bullet-time', but also for establishing regular actors into action stars. Like the opening sequence was absolutely stunning and had some great fight choreography, with Carrie-Ann Moss's Trinity taking out dozens of cops in a rooftop-leaping escape which introduces not only the skills of the key players, as well as the bullet-time style, but also the seemingly unstoppable 'Agents', who can inexplicably morph into any other individual within the Matrix. Hugo Weaving was perfectly cast as the main antagonist, Agent Smith, whose fights with both Lawrence Fishburne's Morpheus and also Neo himself are spectacular. The training sequence with Morpheus and Neo is terrific from start to finish, making me say ""wow"". The action scenes was influenced by Japanese animation and martial arts films, and the film's use of fight choreographers and wire fu techniques from Hong Kong action cinema, the martial arts fits the cyberpunk world that the writers/directors made.

Would I ever rewatch The Matrix again, for a third time? The film have so much entertainment value that it's easy to watch it over and over again, thanks to the phenomenal and mesmerizing action sequences but also the work done by the Wachowskis as their storytelling is brilliant. The performances of Keanu Reeves, Laurence Fishburne, Carrie-Anne Moss and Hugo Weaving are all worth coming back to. The Matrix is an incredible film that's worth revisiting, it's after all considered to be among the best science fiction films of all time and was added to the National Film Registry for preservation in 2012.","8"

You have flick that is basically Tron meets Terminator, with a strong dose of Bruce Lee tossed in. Add in the John Woo type choreography and flowing robes bits, and ya got it.

Excellent effects, good acting; fine way of pushing our buttons of paranoia about machines, technology, the future, our existence, and Who is Really Behind the Curtain?

But I sat through and just kinda shrugged. It isn't anything that I haven't seen before in other places. And Try as I might, and actually kinda Liking Keanu...you Still have to remember, the lead guy's pet phrase claim to fame is?: Whoa...Kinda hard on the credibility, you know?

And frankly have gotten sick of the oodles and oodles of post Apocalypic fiction that has been flung our way past 30 years or so. This one spins it out in a more creative way, but its still the same old, same old.

So--did I like it?

Sure!

Did I think it was the best flick of '99 or whatever?

Nahhhh!! Gimme the Mummy!!

"gazzo-2","Hmmmmm...Bill(Sans Ted)'s Inexplicable Journey! Whoa, man..","27 December 1999","Okay, I finally saw this one, last night in fact at my brother's. Actually liked it quite a lot, though it really was a Bruce Lee/John Woo Chop socky fest in Terminator's clothing, to my mind. That is not a bad thing, mind-loved Lee's good stuff and Face-Off, so....throw in the Machines-get-smart-and- takeover bit from Terminator(plus countless other Sci-fi stories)and you have this.

Keanu Reaves is Keanu Reaves, same guy as he ever was in the Bill and Ted films, Point Break, Speed and so forth. Every once in a while, ala Patrick Swayze or Kurt Russell, he burbles up to the surface with a new hit. I think he was okay for what he was supposed to do. Loved having(SPOILER ALERT!!) Guido the Killer Pimp from 'Risky Business' to the obligatory Turncoat move here too. And kudos to the guys who cast 'Trinity', this gal was right there with 'Vasquez' in Aliens. Very nice.

You gotta like a film that takes the 'Men in Black' stereo-type and makes them your bad guys, mixing them in with the T-1000 liquid metal guy in Terminator II. Quite good. Very stylish, violent, interesting nod to 'War of the Worlds'-having tentacled squids keeping us penned up as food or fuel or whatever too.

I think a sequel would be fun and look forward to it. But then I said the same about after seeing Aliens and Robocop I, and look what happened to Those franchises.

However, the story, or what passed for one, left a lot to be desired. I never really could get into what the so-called message of this film was and I thought the actors pretty much were overwhelmed by the effects.

"OJT","The ultimate sci-fi movie!?","13 August 1999","Just seen the Matrix for the 3rd time, and I can't help still being astonished! The first time was compelling - a shock. Knew I had to see it again before the film was even over. The second time it was quite different. Now EVERYTHING got clear, also what I couldn't figure out the first time.

This third time I'm convinced! The plot has no holes. It's a fantastic story, the script is unpresidented in the story of sci-fi movies! It's all so logical, and when was a sci-fi just all logical!?

The story is so good that the 2nd and 3rd coming from the Wachowski's can't simply fail. Everyone need to know more about the Matrix, and how the ""neo Christ"" in the 3rd episode will save the world - that is IF he does!

The special effects are awesome, and not ridiculous as in most sci-fi movies. The players are great, the agents are great ""machines"". The fun with all the mysterious links and references are the spice of the film, and the copying of lots of known movie scenes are so delicately done!

My earlier sci-fi-best ""Bladerunner"" has not only been thrown second, it's almost been demolished!!! The Wachowski's for president and vice president. Neo for God! Matrix for 20 - let us just start believe enough - let's start knowing it!

"Zac_La_Porte","A Clever, Entertaining and Popcorn-Worthy Classic","5 August 2021","This film is clever, complex and excellent science fiction cinematography. Although it's not very fast and briefly lacks a fair amount of enthusiasm, the Wachowskis have intelligently structured an entertaining and engaging treasure. If you can't live through science fiction action movies, it's probably a smart choice to avoid this one.

Despite a fairly entertaining and gripping plot, there are unfortunately several elements that, just briefly, ruin The Matrix. This includes the irritatingly-loud movement and music. The film's soundtrack sits perfectly in the background, leaving the impressively exciting up the front. However, it's annoying to have to constantly reach for the remote in order to increase or decrease the volume. That's because the discussions between the characters can get very quiet.

Talking about the action again, the visual effects are eye-taking and the noise will bring most audiences even closer. Other than the very eager action sequences, the story is quite appealing as well. But most movies usually never lack some tediousness. The Matrix certainly joins them.

However, Keanu Reeves owns a mastered performance in this movie. The rest of the cast is also fabulous! It's also another one of those sci-fi movies that's highly likely to have many teens and adults feeling puzzled, but it's very difficult to not enjoy this great story. Thanks to the bright performances, writing, direction and effects, The Matrix will stand as one of history's greatest science fiction movies.

"bkrauser-81-311064","Knocks on the Door of Greatness","2 June 2017","There is a connection to be made between The Wachowski sibling's stylishly heady Matrix Trilogy (1999-2003) and Monty Python and the Holy Grail (1975). Hear me out; the silly jokes and outlandish scenarios of Holy Grail has been repeated, referenced or emulated in multiple movies, television shows and among the viewing public for well over a generation. So much so that when I first watched Holy Grail in college I was not as amused as I should have been simply because everything looked and felt old hat to me.

The spirited youth of today probably get the same woebegone sense of déjà vu when sitting back to watch The Matrix (1999), a film so revolutionary for the sci-fi action genre that it's techniques have been repeated ad nauseam. Bullet time, view morphing, digital rain, all used and popularized by The Matrix. the effects were so revolutionary in-fact that they won the film four technical awards at the year 2000 Oscar ceremony beating out the likes of Star Wars: Episode I – The Phantom Menace (1999) which believe it or not was the odds on favorite.

The story of Neo (Keanu Reeves) is a pretty straightforward hero's tale. An office drone of little importance discovers a group of rebel hackers who think he's their salvation against their enemy. Simple right? Their enemy*spoilers*is killer A.I. which has destroyed the world and cloned humans as part of an organic battery farm to power complex machines and robots. Those cloned sleep in a stasis, dreaming the same dream creating the world Neo thinks he knows, also known as the Matrix.

The Matrix isn't just known for its special-effects and blockbuster sensibilities, its also known for contemplating theories about human consciousness and philosophical theory. These are weighty themes that the Wachowskis would return to in Cloud Atlas (2012) yet here the thought process is more cogent and even frightening to contemplate. Is the world truly what we perceive, taste and feel? Or is there something outside of ourselves, controlling us to serve sinister ends.

Heaven, hell, allegory of the cave, it's all in there in a diluted format and packaged for easy consumption. Yet even for all its kung fu and bullet dodging the movie didn't make as big a splash as one would have hoped. It wasn't until after it was released on VHS and the burgeoning DVD market that the film became a full-blown success worthy of lesser sequels. And once people actually saw it; watch out! Not since the criminally underrated Dark City (1998) had people been exposed to such radical ideas in films. College courses started studying the film, fanboys raved and discussed the film at length, even a cottage industry of animes based on the films sprouted up (there is much contention as to whether The Matrix was a blatant rip-off or homage to Mamoru Oshii's Ghost in the Shell (1995)).

Today The Matrix is considered a benchmark of science fiction films taking its place among Blade Runner (1982) and Star Wars (1977) as a flick worthy of intense analysis and debate and passionate fandom by those who enjoy such things. Will following generations continue to pay homage to it? Keep it in the pristine echelons of sci-fi greatness? Or will The Matrix and its sequels be relegated to almost-classics like Logan's Run (1976) and Soylent Green (1973)? My sincere hope is people won't decide to tune into something completely different.","9"
"TheMaximalApex","Even better than I remember! 10/10","27 August 2022","Back in 1999 this instantly became my number 1 favourite film. I had it on VHS and watched it more times than I care to remember. Heard it was showing on TV so I thought I'd put on the DVD (in case they cut anything out). I hadn't seen the first film for many years and was really looking forward to it. I was glued to the screen like never before. This was not just nostalgia, it was all those years of growing as a person, as a film lover and as someone who is probably much harder to please/entertain than my teenage self! Revisiting a film I loved as a teenager, I fully accepted the possibility that I would be left feeling a little deflated. I was not. It is perfect. Every. Single. Moment. It is a masterpiece IMHO. I am not one to look for faults (there are none anyway), I prefer to just sit back and enjoy the work and passion everyone involved in a film has put into it. The cast is stellar, the look, style and feel is absolutely stunning and the soundtrack seems even more fitting and perfectly in tune with it after all these years. The camera work and editing are so refreshing after seeing so much hyperspeed in modern films. The balance is just right here because you can follow everything that happens and you can actually see everything, without having to rewind 10 times or freeze frame for important details that are so easy to miss. The Matrix is a shining example of the Sci-Fi genre and has remained in my top 5 all these years. It's back at number 1 too. I absolutely love it!","8"
"TedStixonAKAMaximumMadness","""The Matrix""- An excellent and often-clever Sci-Fi adventure. Though not quite the classic it has been idolized as.","20 January 2017","Even nearly twenty years after it was unleashed onto the masses, ""The Matrix"" has remained one of the most beloved and cherished Sci-Fi feature films of all time. For its time, it was a revelation... not only in its incredible achievements in cutting-edge visual effects, but in another unique way: it made a lot of people realize just how awe- inspiring and thrilling the science fiction genre could be. For many people, it is a modern cinematic classic. A benchmark in movie-going history against which many other movies are judged.

Me? I think it's a darned good film. Even a great film. But I was never quite as in love with it as many others. I don't necessarily think it's quite the classic it's been built up as. Though it is definitely one of the best action-extravaganzas of the 90's. That is something I can say for sure.

We follow Thomas Anderson (Keanu Reeves), a computer programmer who lives a double-life as an infamous hacker known by the moniker ""Neo."" Troubled be feelings that the world is not what it seems, he soon encounters a group of freedom fighters including another hacker called ""Trinity"" (Carrie-Anne Moss) and a mysterious man known as ""Morpheus."" (Laurence Fishburne) Neo eventually discovers that he is living a lie- the world as he knows it is actually an advanced computer simulation known as ""the Matrix"", where humans are ""plugged in"" and live normal day-to-day lives while their flesh-and-blood bodies serve as sort-of organic batteries to power an advanced artificially intelligent legion of machines. Freed from the Matrix, Neo joins the other freedom fighters in a post-apocalyptic world, where they lead a brave resistance against their machine overlords and attempt to free more and more people from their grasp. Whenever they ""jack in"" to the Matrix, their knowledge that it is merely a computer program allows them to perform superhuman feats, which is a key in their battle against the program's dreaded line of defense known as ""the Agents""- lead by the nefarious Agent Smith. (Hugo Weaving)

The film is renowned for it's high-end and cutting-edge action and visual effects, in addition to it's often philosophical and metaphorical storytelling. And I do very much think these aspects remain strong and vibrant even to this day. The film was written and directed by the Wachowski siblings, and they are definitely incredibly gifted visual storytellers. The weave wickedly exciting sequences of action and suspense with ease, and are able to craft identifiable and enjoyable characters to populate their tale. Their keen ideas in pushing the bounds of Computer Generate Imagery are also just magical, and the film's sequences of what is now known as ""bullet time"" were absolutely spellbinding when the film was initially released. There's also plenty of symbolism and references in the writing that are a lot of fun to analyze and look into, which adds another layer to the proceedings. In a weird way, it is an oddly religious film, though not in that it is trying to push an agenda so much as it tries to draw parallels with biblical figures to hammer home the story being told.

The cast is also phenomenal in their performances. Reeves might have started out in humorous roles early on in his career, but here he proves himself to be a capable and enjoyable action hero with just enough pathos and self-doubt to keep him grounded in reality despite the broad and intricate concepts of the story. Moss makes for a good supporting lead, and is able to kick butt with the best. Fishburne is phenomenal as a sort-of prophet for the freedom fighters, and his booming voice and imposing figure make him a worthwhile and powerful leader. Supporting roles by the likes of Joe Pantoliano and Gloria Foster are also exceptionally well cast and played. But the breakout star is definitely Hugo Weaving's wonderful mustache-twirling villain Agent Smith. Weaving is just such a delightfully vile presence, and he's ideal in the role. He's the sort-of character you just adore hating. Wonderful work on his part.

So, with an excellent cast, first-rate direction and clever symbolic storytelling, what can there be to dislike in the film? How can I deny that it is a masterpiece of modern filmmaking? Well, it's the fact that the movie isn't nearly as clever as it likes to think it is, and the fact that as a result of this, it comes off as a bit forced and pretentious a bit too often. As complex as it can be, and as clever as certain sequences are, it unfortunately tries a bit too hard and comes across with all the subtlety of a brick to the face. Subtle religious imagery can add a lot to the film as it does in some sequences here... but it isn't exactly subtle when our heroes' name is literally an anagram of ""one"" and he's literally called someone's ""personal Jesus"" at one point. A bit on the nose, don't you think? One scene, you'll have a very tasteful reference to a philosophical concept or a piece of religious iconography... but in the next scene, it'll get spelled out for you all too clearly. And it makes the film seem a bit shallow. As though the Wachowski siblings didn't trust the viewers to be smart enough to understand what they were doing. Which then makes it feel like you're being talked down to. It really bugs me, because so many people are so in love with the symbolism and philosophy on display... but they don't seem to realize that it's actually pretty basic and being force-fed to us. It's clever, sure. But it's not that clever.

Still, I cannot deny that outside of this issue, everything else functions perfectly. ""The Matrix"" is a thrilling, entertaining and exciting adventure with quite a bit going for it. It just isn't quite perfect. And so, I give it an excellent 9 out of 10.","4"

The soundtrack by Don Davis is not left out either, or the choreography by martial artist Yuen Woo Ping.

"Howlin Wolf","Cut out the philosophical claptrap, just accept it for what it is: an awesome spectacle. *****","7 February 2001","There are films that it is worthwhile to spend hours musing over, as to whether the film offers any deep spiritual insights or teaches us something new about the world. In my opinion, this ain't one of them. There are no 'hidden truths' to be found, no startling insights, just an amazing action flick that on its release delivered thrills 'n' spills unlike any audiences had seen before.

One comment I read mentioned that audiences can 'cheer' for the hero. I disagree. Keanu Reeves brings little more to the role than the ability to look cool dressed all in black. Not that he gives a bad performance, just that there is little empathy there.

In this case, though, that hardly matters. What impresses is simply that we are given something new to see and not merely an uninspiring rehash of a thousand action cliches that we've seen put to better use elsewhere.

In short, an awesome spectacle.","8"

In it, a hacker learns the truth about the nature of reality and joins the fight for the freedom of the human race.

On the surface, the cast might seem slightly underwhelming. I wouldn't say that any of them are great actors, more like good actors who can nail certain types of roles. Luckily, they all seem to have been cast in precisely the type of role for which they are best suited. So, I have to give the actors credit but also the casting directors.

The action is undeniably the main selling point here. It was breathtaking at the time and while some of the effects work doesn't look quite as polished as the films that have followed (including the sequels) it still retains a sense of wonder. This is definitely a film designed with a unique style in mind.

All of which is not to say that the script is merely an excuse to get from one set-piece to the next. The underlying idea of the Matrix is an interesting one and the film-makers get most of the exposition out of the way early on so as not to slow down the later stages.

The Wachowski's direction is solid throughout though not quite as slick as it would become later on. Their style suits the film well and delivers the goods in a film that's all about 'the look'. The music is also well-handled with some fitting soundtrack choices and a better than average score.

All of this makes for an essential sci-fi/action hybrid. It may be a stylish film but that doesn't mean that it falls into the trap of emphasizing style over substance. Definitely recommended as a film to put your high-def system to the test.","9"

"Screen_Blitz","Innovative and exhilarating in both an epic and visual scale, The Matrix is a groundbreaking thrill ride","7 February 2017","What if our world is just an illusion and our reality lies inside high-tech computer system? This thought-provoking and reasonably complicated concept is the premise in this exhilarating sci-fi action thriller directed by The Wachowksis who debuted in their career with the neo-noir thriller 'Bound' in 1996. Breaking numerous grounds of both the science-fiction and action genre, this cyberpunk thriller sees the duo filmmaking team operating on a solid balance of complex, innovative storytelling and groundbreaking visual effects that no one before the late 1990s had seen before. The Wachowskis bravely accomplish this feat by introducing a highly cerebral concept that not only strikes the human pulse but feels entirely original, tackling on themes of philosophy, religion, and gripping social commentary of how technology plays a vital role in our society. With almost two decades past, this film has established many elements that have become highly influential to the science-fiction genre today. This film follows Thomas ""Neo"" Anderson (played by Keanu Reeves), a software engineer during the day and computer hacker by night who finds himself chased by a sentient Agent Smith (played by Hugo Weaving) who are set to kill him. He crosses paths with a black suit agent named Morpheus (played by Laurence Fishburne), he learns that all of mankind is a simulated reality known as the Matrix, operated by cyber intelligence, and the real world lies in a futuristic universe where lives are operated by a series of computer systems. When an army of malware machines begin taking over the Matrix. Neo must join forces with Morpheus and fellow computer hacker Trinity (played by Carrie-Anne Moss) to lead a rebellion against these entities lead by Agent Smith who's causing it.

Although the plot is not an easy one to follow, it does almost nothing to takeaway from the absorbing beauty of both The Wachowskis' thoughtful direction and mind-bending script which energized the story in a shiny, cerebral fashion. In further words, the Wachowskis intend not to plunge you into a psychological mind-rape of convoluted storytelling but to stroll you through cutting-edge journey of discovery. Paying homages to classic stories such as Lewis Carroll's 'Alice in Wonderland' while revitalizing the innovative dystopian genre, this film operates with tour-de-force storytelling that takes viewers on a pulse-pounding, frenetically paced adventure through a mind-bending world of simulated reality and psychological deception. And the plot unfolds in a complex balance of exhilarating action sequences including the newly introduced bullet-time slow motion sequences, and a cerebral narrative that tackles on philosophical and religious themes. The action consists a blend of martial arts action and frenetic shootout sequences complete with eye-feasting visual effects and slow-motion editing. Arguably the most pulse-pounding action sequences comes during a hyperkinetic lobby shootout scene. The scenes are all shot with innovative cinematography. As for the narrative which is also written by the Wachowskis, the plot follows the lead character Neo as he must learn the truth behind the fake reality he's been living all his life and fight against the evil forces who carry convoluted plans turning the real world he thought as a parallel universe into a world of hell. What transpires is not only a mind-bending journey through a series of hyperkinetic action set pieces and sassy, cyberpunk imagery, but also the lead character who's reveal to be a God-like figure who's chosen as the savior of humanity in a plot intended to pay homage to a biblical epic (with Alice in Wonderland slapped into the mix). And with strong efforts, the Wachowskis take just enough time to flesh out most of the characters.

Following the decline of Will Smith, the Wachowskis were able set their eyes on a charismatic actor who happened to be no one other Keanu Reeves. Cashing in on the lead role, Keanu Reeves delivers an incredible portrayal as the reluctant action hero Thomas ""Neo"" Anderson who evolves from a struggling white-collar worker into a biblical-like hero with a highly train set of skills in both hand-to-hand and armed combat. Thus, he is granted an opportunity to demonstrate his adrenaline action testosterone in a series of frenetic action set pieces. Alongside, he also demonstrates an engaging camaraderie with Laurence Fishburne who gives a riveting portrayal as Morpheus, the man who takes Neo under his wing into the imaginative alternate reality that Neo was never aware of. Fighting along their side in battle is Carrie-Anne Moss as Trinity who shows her incredible badass persona in which we are greatly introduced during the action-heavy scenes. Then there is the main villain Agent Smith behind the evil scheme, and he is played by Hugo Weaving who delivers a stern, heart-stopping portrayal as the devious man suited in a tuxedo and shades. In shorts, Weaving pulls no punches when letting out in the dubious attitude in his character. The rest of cast is consists of Joe Pantoliano, Gloria Foster, Marcus Chong along with many others who left cashing in on smaller-sized roles but nonetheless play fair roles in the plot.

The Matrix is an exhilarating science-fiction action piece that stands strong on both an epic and visual scale, and sets home to some of the most influential elements of the sci-fi genre today. In outstanding efforts, it is an explosively entertaining sci-fi flick with the driving force of the Wachowskis who spring the film to life. The film is a pulse-pounding and equally complex tale that is more fun to enjoy without beating your brain to a pulp trying to follow the complicated plot, at least for the first viewing.","8"

"MatthewMichaelHoffman","A mental game of Twister","12 February 2023","SCORE: 7.0/10

I love movies that make you question reality. Before I say anything else about this movie, there is no denying the impact and influence it has had on films that have come after it, both in effects and concept. Completely unrecognizable at first, a young Keanu Reeves delivers an amazing perform as Neo and the film starts out with the iconic red pill/blue pill scene. Neo must choose between going back to his normal life or going deeper into the concept of the Matrix, which immediately puts the audience in a position to think about what decision they would make. It's visually stunning and ahead of its time, and it does explore an interesting idea but, for me, that's about where it ends.

Admittedly, this was my second time attempting to watch The Matrix. I first tried watching it on a plane, but stopped an hour in because it just wasn't captivating enough for me and I wanted to sleep instead. For how awesome the idea of this movie is, I was disappointed to see how it was executed, leaving a lot on the surface level. As an avid Christopher Nolan fan, I am used to having to understand complicated story lines, but there are always moments throughout those films that are extremely strong and tie everything together. I feel like this movie was missing those moments and it was like a mental game of Twister. It was just a little too all over the place for me. I definitely still enjoyed it, but I feel like it had so much more potential.","8"

I think that was the main fault in the entire film (besides Reeve's awful acting and obvious lack of anything upstairs) which was that all of us who don't speak Techy - you know, that alien language computer geeks use - don't have a clue what's going on. OR, we do, but don't understand WHY.

The special FX were pretty cool, but I was so confused, I couldn't pay attention to half of them. Think I'll rent the DVD today. All in all, a decent movie with some good acting and a very cool plot (I think). :o)","3"

"Sirus_the_Virus","Seriously awesome.","28 November 2009","Keanu Reeves, Laurence Fishburne, and Carrie Anne Moss star in The Matrix, one of the coolest, most inventive films ever. The Matrix series must have taken a lot of thought. Clearly The Wachowski brothers were thinking about a lot. Because The Matrix is a unique sci-fi film.

I myself am not a fan of Mr. Reeves. I am still thinking about him from Bill and Ted and how he tries to be serious. He tries to hide that voice. But here I liked him. The Matrix makes computer hackers look pretty pathetic. Well, they are pretty pathetic. Like the ones in Die hard 4.

Except these computer hackers aren't nerds. Hugo Weaving is awesome as the villain of the trilogy. What am I saying? Weaving is awesome anyways. As V from V for Vendetta or Agent Smith from The Matrix, Weaving is great.

The Matrix is probably the first films to ever show us such awesome special effects. It's a shame what happened to the Wachowski's once the trilogy ended. At least two out of three of the films were good. The other one... well, it wasn't art but it was pretty entertaining.

The Matrix is a sci-fi extravaganza that you will never forget. I hope so at least. It's one film never to miss. I wouldn't say it's in my top 20 but it's awesome. The Matrix should never be forgotten. If you do for some reason forget it, then you must have Alzheimer's. That wasn't very nice. I was kidding. But be sure never to forget The Matrix.

The plot is very complicated but if you're a comic book geek like me then the plot is very simple....But this film not only provides a great complex story but the action is unseen, by that I mean that the action sequences are amazing, stunning and mind boggling. The special effects take this film to a level of its own and have become almost a cliché in some action films, the 'bullet time'; the synchronised fight scenes....

Keanu Reeves who has been panned by critics for years, finally silences them by providing the greatest performance in his career as the confused chosen one; Lawrence Fishburne who is endearing as the man who has searched his whole life for Neo while Moss is the love interest and Hugo Weaving as the baddie, a baddie like no other; he redefines scary with his cold, steel like tone of voice.","10"

The Matrix is one of the most iconic, stunning, and transformative films of the 21st Century (1999 really). It is perhaps one of the most important films ever. It transformed filmmaking with its visual impact as well as its substantive content. Its genuinely original look at the world and the place of human beings in the ""Matrix"" is complex and compelling but addictively engaging. Keanu Reeves, Carrie Moss, and Laurence Fishburne, and Hugo Weaving give the performances of their careers in this film, which has been copied for two decades but never equalled or exceeded. It spawned an entire generation of films, including John Wick. It's visuals, cinematography, and special effects are ahead of its time. It's fight and action choreography demonstrated that they can have an equal place in blockbuster fillmmaking. Many of the concepts and language infiltrated the social language in ways only topped by The Star Wars franchise. This one is to be seen again (and again) and still holds up. This, unlike the sequels, is a must see.","7"

"TheUnknown837-1","good movie, but way overrated","19 January 2006","I don't see why people like The Matrix so much. I'm not saying that it's a bad movie or anything like that, but it is nowhere near as good as a lot of people say it is. And personally, I don't think it even belongs on IMDb's top 250 list, let alone so high on it.

The Matrix just didn't strike me as a masterpiece of a movie. I just thought of it as a decent motion picture with good action and an okay plot. But the fact was, in between the action sequences, thankfully there were many of them, the rest of the movie just got dull.

But however, when the action sequences did commence, this movie reached my demands. It has a lot of good martial arts combat fights and plenty of gunfire. And I did like those agents that we see throughout the movie.

Overall, The Matrix is a good movie definitely worth seeing a few times, but it is not as good as many claim it to be. Not even close.","10"
"Philby-3","Cyberspace western","12 April 1999","I saw this one three rows from the front, which was a mistake. I also couldn't help noticing I was about the only person in the theatre over 25. (I really should have let my son go by himself.) Good computer game, confusing movie. Naturally loved the Sydney bits (""My God that's our building's lobby they're shooting up""). Noisy? Very. Spectacular? Moderately (don't care for the compulsory futuristic grunge). Profound? You're joking. Good acting? Keanu Reeves has his Stunned Mullet act down to a T. Unfortunately he was meant to be playing a Christ-like figure. Thought Laurence Fishburne is reasonably convincing in his ""John the Baptist"" role and Hugo Weaving exhibits some evil glee as the multichannel villain. Romance? Well, there is the nice lady (Carrie-Ann Moss) in the plastic suit who says she loves Keanu, but doesn't everybody? Action? superabundance thereof. Not a high degree of accuracy (and pretty obsolete weaponry) in the shooting but of course that means the gun battles can go on longer. Inconsistencies. Yeah. Like how come you can only be teletransported using a fixed phone? Were not cell phones invented so we can all transport ourselves from and to anywhere? (Maybe its a bandwidth problem.) Recommended? To 12 year olds who love computer game violence and science fiction and haven't discovered sex, let alone love, yet.","7"
"baumer","A movie that makes you question reality","2 July 1999","I'll be honest here, I had no interest in seeing The Matrix. It was my opinion that this was going to be a convoluted mumble jumble film. I had pre-conceived notions going into the film and I tried hard to stick with them. It is a strange thing really, because I try to like a film more than dislike, but I had such ( at the time ) an anti computer film attitude. I have always thought that computer films were the same. But I am happy to say that I was so wrong. Man was I wrong.

First let's get the comparisons out of the way. The 13th Floor and The Matrix have similar themes, but that is where the similarity stops. I don't think the makers makers of either film copied each other. After all, with this subject matter, there is enough to easily make two different films. Both films are excellent in their own right and as I said when I reviewed The 13th Floor, the only reason that The Matrix did better business is because it was marketed better. And don't forget they seemed to copy a previous film that came out earlier called Dark City.

Keanu Reeves plays Neo. In his other life, he is a computer hacker with a seemingly normal job. But he has inner demons. There is a part of him that believes something is wrong with the world. And then finally one day, he is given an ultimatum by a stranger. He can learn all the secrets that he believes are out there or he can stay in his drab life and never know the truth. What do you think he does? Hmmm.

He is taken into a world by a bunch of renegade freedom fighters led by Lawrence Fishburne, who plays Morpheus. And this is where I think the strength of the film lies. It is here that we learn what the Matrix is. And of course I don't think anyone reviewing this film is going to give away what that is, but just saffice it to say that it will stay with you for a while, especially if you are like me and occassionally question reality every now and then.

The true strength of this film is not just Reeves, but Fishburne. I remember seeing Fishburne in a little known film called Deep Cover. I thought he was outstanding in that film and I was convinced that was his best work. That is until the Matrix came out. Here, he has a similar job as Michael Biehn had in the original Terminator. It was his job to explain to us, the audience, what was going on and how it was all possible. And a script like this is a delicate thing to handle. There is so much information that it would be easy for another writer and another director ( fortunately they are the same here ) to give us a condensed version of what is in the film. But they are brave enough and have confidence in their material to tell it the way it should be told. And for that I am so thankful because it is really an intelligent story.

So much has been made of the visuals in this film and I guess I would be remiss if I didn't at least comment on them here as well. They are outstanding. You will never see better stunts in any movie. The choreography is so perfect it really is like watching a perfectly executed martial arts routine. It flows so well that it makes you feel like you are there experiencing what is happening. I don't think I will ever forget some of the fight scenes in this film. They are sheer brilliance.

But mostly what is enjoyable about The Matrix is the questions that it asks and how it answers them. What is the Matrix? Well, well I'm not going to give it away. As I said it is one of the parts of the movie that will keep you intrigued and will astonish you at the same time. This is a very good film and it's visionary outbursts are worth the price of a rental alone. But it has a great story to it as well and that should be enough for anyone to want to see it.","10"
"olegperov","Cult movie? Not really.","24 February 2000","After watching a movie which some call ""The best sci-fi film of the Millennium"" I had this serious and uncontrollable urge to go in depth and examine it to the last piece. You can ask me ""Why can't you just seat back and receive pleasure?"" I can. But not when it comes to movie which is called cult.

The special effects were good. But the only reason they were made is to create a show. Check out the eXistenZ - I don't think there were any computer animated effects at all, but you get a full feeling of another reality.

What's really bad is a plot of the film. This is supposed to be a movie were the Good Guys are fighting the Bad Matrix. But what Matrix is bad is questionable. It takes away people's freedom to control their lives but allows them to live in a bright sunny world, when the real world is dark ruins, ugly closing and food that looks and tastes like plastic. Some people could say that the Matrix is doing a good deed.

Not to mention that using a people's bodies as a batteries is not very effective, you have to feed them and that's a real waste of energy.

Absolutely unnecessary thing in this film is a Kung Fu. If you can bend spoons and duck bullets with the power of your mind, you don't need any martial arts. It was made only to put some action into film.

And the worst thing is a prophecy about the ""Chosen-One"". Neo was the ""Chosen-One"" all the time and it doesn't matter if Trinity would fall in love with him or not. He had his abilities, he trained them and it's logically to assume that he would get them. But no! He fully gets them only when Trinity says she loves him. Yes, it was in Oracles prophecy, but don't You think that the things You can do are not depend from what other people think about You? This is really falls apart, and this is a major moment in movie.

To avoid any farther damaging of a Matrix fan's feelings, I must say that this movie is not all that bad. It's a good show and you can really enjoy it, but please, don't call it ""The best sci-fi film of the Millennium""! Go see Alien instead.

A quick break from Spider-Man because The Matrix is in my local theater.

It's weird how even though I knew the plot, this movie just became significantly better and refreshing after rewatch. The concept is endlessly fascinating and entertaining. Throughout the runtime, I still had to remind myself what's real and what's not, because it's not an easy thing to accept.

The characters were so badass in those shiny suits and glasses. The calming, mysterious way they talked and the cool dialogues just drawn me into the movie even more. Then, the action scenes were just as entertaining with amazing kung-fu techniques.

A very minor problem was the twist and romance at the end, which felt a little cheesy.

"MuviFan73","what a movie!","28 September 2015","Before going any further, let me tell you that my review is going to be a general review about matrix trilogy.

Set in future with a very stylish approach, Matrix consist of movies consisting of alternate world ruled by the machines. Humans are harvested here in huge fields. Machines create a world for them which is meant to be error free. This is achieved with help of programs. Example of such programs are agents. There are programs , there are anti-programs doing there work for which they have been constructed, thus trying to maintain balance.

Zion is a free city situated underground, for they know their exposure will bring their end via machines. Although underground these people are advanced, they have ships which travel through severs to guarantee well being of Zion. A man from Zion is believed to get to someone who would be their savior(conveyed as 'He is the one'). Do they find him? Does he fulfills his destiny movie is all about that.

An alternate view of an artist can be consider spiritual in nature where this world is a matrix and salvation is way of getting freed. An interesting thought really! I would recommend the trilogy to everyone, specially sci-fi fans.","10"
"hanalisss","Amazingly cool","19 November 2023","The Matrix is a groundbreaking cinematic masterpiece that redefined the science fiction genre and left an indelible mark on popular culture. Directed by the Wachowskis, this 1999 film is a mind-bending journey that combines groundbreaking visual effects, a thought-provoking narrative, and a cyberpunk aesthetic into a cultural phenomenon that continues to resonate decades later.

At its core, this is a story of awakening and self-discovery. Keanu Reeves delivers a career-defining performance as Neo, a computer hacker who discovers the unsettling truth about his reality. The film's exploration of simulated worlds, artificial intelligence, and the nature of human existence was not only ahead of its time but remains relevant in an age increasingly dominated by technology.

The Wachowskis' visionary direction is evident in every frame of the film. The groundbreaking bullet time visual effects, choreographed by Yuen Woo-ping, revolutionized action sequences and became iconic in cinematic history. The blending of martial arts, philosophy, and cutting-edge technology creates a unique and immersive experience that sets The Matrix apart from its contemporaries.

The film's world-building is meticulous, presenting a dystopian future where machines have enslaved humanity by trapping them in a simulated reality. The green-tinted aesthetic of the Matrix contrasts sharply with the stark, desaturated tones of the real world, creating a visual language that reinforces the duality at the heart of the narrative.

This movie is not merely a spectacle; it's a philosophical exploration that challenges the audience to question reality, authority, and the nature of consciousness. The script's blend of action and existential inquiry, coupled with memorable dialogue, elevates the film beyond traditional genre boundaries.

The supporting cast, including Laurence Fishburne as Morpheus and Carrie-Anne Moss as Trinity, contributes to the film's success with compelling performances that add depth to the narrative. The chemistry between the characters, combined with the enigmatic allure of the Matrix itself, creates a narrative tension that keeps viewers engaged from start to finish.

Don Davis's score complements the film's cyberpunk aesthetic, enhancing the atmosphere and contributing to the overall sense of immersion. The use of electronic and industrial music further cements Matrix as a cultural touchstone of the late 20th century.

Must watch.","10"
"jhclues","Transcends Genre Or Category","19 November 2000","(What is the Matrix). In 1977, George Lucas changed the landscape of cinematic Science Fiction forever with `Star Wars,' taking the genre light years ahead of all that preceded it. Such a momentous advancement would not be seen again for over twenty years, when, in 1999, the Wachowski Brothers raised the bar again, taking the genre at warp speed to an unprecedented level with their astoundingly innovative film, `The Matrix.' Co-directed, written and produced by Larry and Andy Wachowski, it is an allegory of salvation and redemption filled with symbolism and metaphor (the Biblical references alone should keep theology students debating this one for years to come); a thinking man's action film, accentuated with moments that are no less than profound. In a world of the future, things are literally not what they seem, where it's Man versus Machine, Reality versus Fantasy, and few who know the truth; among those who do, is Morpheus (Laurence Fishburne), who has long awaited the arrival of `The One,' who it has been prophesied will be the salvation of the world. Enter Neo (Keanu Reeves), a computer programmer with an innate sense of discrepancy as to the state of things around him; he has questions, most of which are still in the process of being formulated in his own mind. (What is the Matrix). Morpheus has answers. And when they meet, it's Alice down the rabbit hole, and Neo's life is changed forever. Reeves is perfectly cast as Neo, the enigmatic young man who may or may not be `The One,' and it's one of the best roles of his career. He conveys a sense of removed, distracted urgency that defines his character, infusing him with both a strength and vulnerability that coalesces as the story progresses into determination and confidence. The underplayed, subtle character development (largely unacknowledged and under appreciated) is a nice piece of work by Reeves. As Morpheus, Fishburne is dynamic; he endows him with a quiet intensity that fairly roils beneath the surface, effectively restrained while leaving no doubt as to the character's power and purpose. You understand his resolution completely by his countenance alone; by the way he speaks and carries himself. It's a memorable performance by one of the truly gifted actors of our times. (What is the Matrix). Other notable performances include those by Hugo Weaving (Agent Smith), who brings a formidable, white-collar sinisterness to his character that is chilling; Carrie-Anne Moss (Trinity), a strong, vital presence throughout the film; and Joe Pantoliano (Cypher), who is entirely convincing in his role of a Cyber-age Judas. Rounding out the terrific supporting cast are Gloria Foster (Oracle), Marcus Chong (Tank), Julian Arahanga (Apoc), Matt Doran (Mouse), Belinda McClory (Switch) and Ray Anthony Parker (Dozer). A visually stunning, thought provoking, captivating film, `The matrix' is a triumph of movie-making that assures the Wachowski's a permanent place in cinematic history. The special effects are cutting-edge, state-of-the-art; the choreography of the action sequences is top rate and delivered with a style and effectiveness worthy of comparison to John Woo's best; and, most importantly, the story itself is complex, intelligent, and deftly takes you into regions beyond the known. This is Science Fiction at it's best, but beyond that, it's a great movie that transcends genre or category; a landmark film that must be experienced more than once, for new meaning is gleaned with every viewing. Enhanced by a driving soundtrack that completes the package, highlighted by incredible action,outstanding performances and memorable scenes to numerous to mention, this is a movie that absolutely must not be missed. (What is the...). I rate this one 10/10.","10"

The question of reality, the complexity of life and the dismal mechanical futuristic view is the Wachowski brothers The Matrix.

Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey and Lucas' Star Wars take a look at outer space in a hard hitting entertaining manner and this 1999 depiction of reality is equally visually stunning with a wonderful puzzling narrative and high intellectual entertainment.

Opening with a rooftop chase and a strange life risking dash to a telephone box, The Matrix then unfolds into mystery after mystery as Neo, along with the viewers, tries to decode the strangeness of what is the Matrix.

This film is more than a 2 hour Sci-Fi masterpiece. It is a picturesque puzzle that leaves the viewer with many questions that are a joy to discuss.

The effects help cement the feel of the futuristic world and the differences between the Matrix and the machine world. Bright and smart, the directors have created a visionary film through the use of some of the finest effects you will see. The green letter encoding sequences are now legendary and the slowing down sequences is a target for spoofs despite the brilliance of them.

The performances are secondary next to the bizarrely beautiful narrative. Hugo Weaving's Agent Smith is a stand out, a fantastic villain that is the only thing that gets better as the trilogy progresses.

The ending puts a damper on the narrative by being too over the top and diving into last gasp convention, However overall this is a fine sophisticated Sci-Fi drama that questions reality in a deep and meaningful manner.

Sadly the originality and imagination of this film was ruined by two over the top gung ho action sequels.

For quality entertainment watch this film and stay clear of the sequels which will leave you with an open mind and plenty of questions to ponder and discuss.","8"

My mind just blanked it out. Not only is this device as old as time, but it doesn't involve the audience at all. It's like we're just listening in. It would have been better for Neo to actually experience it firsthand and find out exactly what the reality is around him and how it came to be. I found the FX to be pretty cheesy as well. I felt like I was watching someone play a video game rather than watching a movie.

"gbheron","Buckle Up!","4 April 1999","Combine engrossing Sci-Fi storytelling with the non-stop action of a martial arts film, then add a large dose of special effects and you have The Matrix.

Set is the distant future, machines have taken over a devastated Earth. Humans have long-since been enslaved, spending their entire lives suspended in liquid pods providing energy to the machines. For their part the machines have created an artificial reality in which the collective consciousnesses of Earth's inhabitants reside, The Matrix. Guess what? It's patterned after 1999 Earth, and the humans are clueless as to what's happened to them.

But not everybody's in The Matrix. A rebel band led by Fishburn dash in and out of it, rescuing humans and searching for their promised Messiah. One whom they target is computer programmer Reeves who begins to receive some very odd communications at his terminal...and thus begins the story.

The Matrix is both a thrill-a-second roller coaster ride, and a skillfully presented science fiction story. The story unfolds slowly, as Reeves goes from complete ignorance of his and humankind's fate, to his destiny revealed. The journey's a trip.

If you enjoy films like the Terminator, T2, RoboCop, Face/Off, and Blade Runner definitely go see this film. If you're a My Dinner with Andre, or Sleepless in Seattle type, give it a pass.","10"

The Matrix was a hugely successful and influential science-fiction blockbuster - a nerd's wet dream, essentially, though less profound and original than it thinks, particularly in its representation of a dystopian futurescape. It deserves credit for at least attempting to blend state-of-the-art thrills, each set-piece insistent on topping the one before, with a more existential line of inquiry (or a line of inquiry as existential as a Joel Silver film will allow).","9"

To do so, he must battle the agents, one of whom is played by ""Lord of the Rings"" Hugo Weaving. Carrie-Anne Moss is the woman Neo loves and is loved by, Trinity.

The first entry was a mesmerizing, eye popping visual extravaganza that redefined science fiction and revitalized interest in the theme of man VS machine. ""The Matrix Reloaded"" was mostly cobbled together faux philosophy that featured dialogue that made no sense, some engaging fight scenes and the chance to see Carrie-Anne Moss stripped of her clothing, leather garments and all (but like Sandra Bullock in ""Fire on the Amazon"", you never see any of Carrie-Anne's private areas, you only see that her slender, 5'8 1/2"" body is completely unclothed). ""The Matrix Revolutions"" was just boring and repeatedly anti-climatic.

"The_Movie_Cat","The Deadly Assassin","3 July 1999","In 1976 the English tv series ""Doctor Who"" featured a collective of unconscious thought as part of a computerised reality called ""The Matrix"" in a story called ""The Deadly Assassin"". I just thought I'd mention it. Because that, like the BLATANT product placement for Nokia (including the slow-motion falling mobile phone)is one of the detracting elements from the movie. But, of course, the biggest detraction is, ironically, the praise. For, when you're about to watch a movie that has five-star reviews in every publication, and has entered the IMDb top 20, then actually seeing it is bound to be an anti-climax. Even Citizen Kane didn't grab me the first time round due to this effect. Yet having said all that, The Matrix IS a good movie - I gave it seven out of ten. Maybe I'm weird, but the film contained no concept or twist that I haven't already thought of, no surprise twist, nothing I didn't expect. Why do all Hollywood films need to contain at least one scene where characters do a ""humourous"" double-take? Lastly, the moral at the end was forcing it down the viewer's throat and a slight to the intelligence, but these were the only truly jarring points. The characters were refreshing three, or at least two-dimensional, with only a couple of the cast there as the ""destined to be cannon fodder"" variety. Direction and lighting is excellent throughout, if a little showy, and the structure is maintained well. For a film that is roughly one hour exposition, one hour pure action, it holds together very well. But does this really deserve to dent the top twenty when Twelve Monkeys is (at date of writing) outside the top 250?","10"

The STAR of this film is Keanu Reeves (Neo) Laurence Fishbourn (Morpheus), Carrie- Anne Moss (Trinity). The film is about an IMAGINARY WORLD called MATRIX. The machines reign world. Peoples are some kind of batteries. Morpheus want to destroy the machines and rescue Earth. He and his fellowship travel in the sewage by ship. The best parts of film are FIGHTING SCENE. Matrix take the revolutions in the since- fictions film because they add the BULLET TIME and the 360 rate.

"CheshireCatsGrin","Horrible","29 March 2000","I fit the demographics on this one. I'm 30, a gamer, programmer, run a domain in my off time, etc. etc. I also love special effects, good action movies and Sci-Fi. I was really looking forward to this movie.

The Special Effects were unbelievable. Overdone, but who cared?!! It deserved every Oscar in visual effects and then some. Besides that:

This was one of the worst movies I've ever seen. I have seen many movies I don't like, this is the first I REALLY hate. The plot had so many loopholes I felt the screenplay was like a quilt with plot(stitches) in between the special effects(panels). It reminded me of ""The Abyss"", but at least in ""The Abyss"" the audience took it for what it was worth - a movie made up of a half edited plot and poor acting while moving forward in the world of special effects. ""The Matrix""- people actually liked this!

Figuring I missed something I've asked people who love this movie what it was about, and they couldn't agree on the basics! So after research my comments are...

Kill me, but the acting was sub-standard, the plot confusing without purpose, and a bunch of characters who all looked like they walked out of "" Scream"" didn't help at all. This is excluding Fishburne who speaks like the Kung Fu master in The Karate Kid.

The screenplay was full of cryptic phrases like ""the matrix has no meaning..."" and ""the matrix cannot tell you who you are"" that could have been told in an easier way without any loss of ambiance. Instead, I felt that I needed to bring my Captain America decryption ring. The lack of the actors' performances made it even harder to figure out the meaning of what was being said.

This movie speaks like a poor novel reads-a lot of words saying what a few could have said better. Big words do not a good movie make. In the end you feel both tired and empty. At least the characters could have made me care.","9"

The movie is more than 20 years old but was way ahead of its time. It was amazing from a special effects perspective and has an excellent plot. Today it has aged incredibly well, the action and effects and even the plot appear fresh and modern.

"Rogue-32","Getting beyond The Hype","15 June 2003","Before the movie came out, the What-Is-The-Matrix hype was everywhere, permeating everything. I went in to the film expecting some great revelatory experience and I was very disappointed with what The Matrix turned out to be (the idea of the world we think is real being actually a computer simulation wasn't that original or earthshaking to me). But in re-watching it on dvd (after having seen the sequel as well), I now appreciate the movie for what it is rather than for what I expected it to be, based on the over-powering hype.

Andy and Larry W. are brilliant, no question about it, and the inspired purity of their vision is definitely evident on the screen. The three leads are fantastic - Keanu Reeves' particular quirkiness has never been better utilized, Laurence Fishburne is stunning as Morpheus, and nobody could have brought Trinity to life with any more clarity and controlled passion than Carrie-Anne Moss. Hugo Weaving looms large as well, as the contemptuous, non-human Agent Smith. The script still leaves a lot to be desired, especially at the end, which wasn't really satisfying at all, but the film is a splendidly creative and heartfelt achievement nonetheless.","10"

The special effects are good, the action scenes are well executed, the performances are compelling, the photography is good, and so is the editing. Script holes can make the film of less quality than what would have been presented to us from the beginning, and that sometimes it feels like a specific story is not being told.

"anselmdaniel","A grand classic","22 May 2023","This review contains spoilers.

The Matrix is a science fiction movie that premiered in 1999. The movie is directed by The Wachowskis, produced by Joel Silver, written by The Wachowskis and stars Keanu Reeves, and Laurence Fishburne. The movie features a dystopian future where humanity has lost the war against artificial intelligence. A hacker awakens to this reality and joins the rebellion against the machines.

The Matrix is a classic movie. This movie features many effects that were ahead of its time and has proven influential to any movies that feature martial arts. This is a great movie in its action, effects, and even set pieces. There are so many great parts of this movie that the audience can appreciate on a technical level. The movie succeeds in entertaining its audience on a purely technical level. Even the effects still hold up today.

The story in this movie follows a pattern of the hero's journey. It is a classic tale that has the main character of Neo come to revelation of the domination of the machines. Eventually through work and sacrifice he ascends to the prophecy of the one. This journey is exciting to watch and it is made more interesting by the world of The Matrix. The movie features themes of sacrifice, truth, and utopia. The movie embodies these themes in both its main character and villain of Agent Smith.

Agent Smith is played by Hugo Weaving and is one of the grand pillars in The Matrix. The Matrix is a great movie due to both Agent Smith's lines and Hugo Weaving's delivery. This villain has much to say about the human condition that both sums up his disgust of humanity and also the reason for the creation of The Matrix. Everytime Hugo Weaving was on the screen it made for an exciting moment as the audience would be getting a great action moment or a grand speech by the Agent of the system.

I highly recommend ""The Matrix"" directed by the Wachowskis.

It's fair to say that Keanu Reeves probably isn't the greatest actor to grace a movie. But his rather one dimensional style is perfectly suited for the role of Neo. The rest of the cast are in fine form and it leads to a very enjoyable couple of hours of escapism. I'm not really a massive fan of sci-fi, but this is one of the better films of the genre. 8/10.","10"

This is true, but only to some degree. The film has really fascinating visual effects and everything in it has cool look - the good guys, the bad guys, the action scenes, the strange Matrix-thing, the hellish future. It is also true that the movie was quite original and not an ordinary Terminator rip-off. That said, the film has some major flaws. Individually, neither Neo, nor Trinity were irritating, but as a couple they were extremely frustrating. The whole love story was annoying and pathetic and in the end of the movie I really hated all about it. The other big failure was the villain. Agent Smith was a joke, a machine who laughs evilly and talks about the problems of humanity is the cheesiest idea ever to be created. Why Terminators are scary? Because they act like robots. Smith is a clown. So my overall opinion of the film is low and I gave it 5 rating only because of the good action scenes and visual effects. I haven't watch the sequels and I don't plan to.","9"

"BroadswordCallinDannyBoy","A rarity: an intelligent and re-watchable Hollywood blockbuster","2 April 2008","***SPOILERS for those who have never seen or heard about the movie***

A good movie can be many things, but one thing that good movies always have is that they don't get get boring after repeated viewings. Going back and re-watching it not only gives you the same enjoyable experience of seeing a great film, but also the opportunity to notice things you didn't quite catch before or see the same things in a slightly (or totally) different way.

""The Matrix"" is that type of movie. A cleverly designed story that speaks about many things on many levels. The most obvious thing here are the spectacular effects that won an Oscar and even spawned the phrase ""Matrix-like action."" They took slow motion and action choreography to a whole new level. But even so, they wouldn't be so great if they weren't part of an innovative story structure that can be seen in a great number of ways. The story can be seen as a heroic quest that the lead character Neo embarks on. A religious and/or historical allegory due to all the classical names of the characters. Or, even that of a totalitarian police state.

The last viewpoint I found particularly interesting as the Matrix is the ultimate Orwellian-nightmare prison. It has full control of your body to the point that it fuels itself with the inmates' body heat. The inmates are kept down by living in a time that is the peak of human civilization and if they defer in anyway, the forces that control the system go after them with police and military forces. The kicker, of course, is that all this is an all illusion and escape, without serious outside help, is an impossibility and even then it's difficult. But how can there be outside help if everyone is asleep in pods? Naturally the story sidesteps this by proving our character with a safe (well, sort of) way out into the real world, but it is hardly a flaw in logic. The story has to start somehow in order for it to go somewhere. Though it remains a fact that trying to imagine how the very first person ""woke up"" and then proceeded to ""wake"" others remains perplexing.

This is a solid smart science fiction film with depth that few blockbusters can ever hope to achieve. So watch it as an action movie. Watch it as a thinking man's movie. But in the end, just watch it. --- 9/10

Keanu Reeves as Neo takes center stage once again, showcasing his evolution as a character with newfound depth and determination. The film editing skillfully balances the dazzling action sequences with the philosophical undertones, although it occasionally leans towards convolution. Its strength lies in its exploration of choice and the inevitable clash between man and machine. The music, particularly the iconic score by Don Davis, amplifies the film's intensity, while the cinematography paints a striking dystopian world that's both familiar and foreign. ""The Matrix Reloaded"" may not match the groundbreaking impact of the original, but it's a worthy chapter in a complex narrative that reminds us that the path to truth is often fraught with paradoxes and challenges.","10"
"JohnRayPeterson","How a classic was born","10 July 2011","I remember how blown away my friends and I were, when we went to see this movie the week it came out. The city, hell the whole country, was abuzz with excitement and amazement at the special effects and the daring surreal theme of this movie. We witnessed firsthand a movie's launch to the realm of global movie classics. Nothing like it had been attempted with the possible exception of Steven Spielberg's works. So many have since copied in one form or another the groundbreaking special effects. No movie and less so no collection of movies (trilogies and the likes) have tackled the religious metaphor that is ""The Matrix"" with as much calculating foresight and contemporary high-tech intuition as the Wachowskis.

With productions like that of Inception, 2012, Avatar and others, which escape me now, we would be almost blasé to special effects and theme of the Matrix if it was released today, eleven years later. I just happen to be scrolling a list of movie bests when I realized that it was not in my movie collection (humble as it might be) and so I quickly corrected this oversight. I then perused countless reviews of this movie, out of curiosity; I could not help but notice how often the same type of interest and passion was written in those other reviews. Eager to add my two cents worth I jotted down this quickie review.

The two sequels, as good as they were, but ratings do not match the initial Matrix, did not deliver the same wowing response. In fairness, the third Jurassic Park movie fared much better as groundbreaker sequel, all things being equal. Also quite exceptional was Star Wars Episodes I II and III produced over twenty years after the original. If I keep writing, more readers may come to the conclusion that I'm an old fart. I'm neither; I'm just a fan of movies.","9"

The combination of then state of the art special effects (I think it beat out Star Wars for the Oscar), spectacular Hong Kong martial arts, technophobia, and philosophical discussion over the nature of reality replete with quasi-religious overtones left an indelible mark on moviegoers. Though his performance is quite serviceable, the film wasn't dependent on Keanu Reeves to carry it. The rest of the cast is also efficient.

We would all like to be heroes of the Matrix, and sometimes in our conscience during waking up from the sleep we feel that we are somewhere else in some Matrix.

If you had me choose one movie from the late 90s that best defined the Sci-Fi genre of its era, I would choose this movie. Period. No debate.

The amount of original storytelling and worldbuilding in this movie is insane. This movie also incorporated new techniques such as CGI & special FX that added to the futuristic dystopia that the movie takes place in.

Normally with a high budget film like this, sometimes the plot or themes would get lost in the amount of CGI & VFX. The Matrix did not compromise on anything. This is one of those films that will have you talking about it once you leave the theatre. Its effects on the wider culture are noticeable has this film has been parodied and referenced time and time again.

And don't get me started on the action. Like Neo in The Matrix, this film bends the rules with what we can expect from any action genre. The use of slow-mo, CGI, and fast-paced kung fu fighting is amazing.

It is a combination of kung fu (martial arts) styled fighting, shootouts, future controversy of Artificial Intelligence, and amazing visual effects. With this combination, the film is impenetrable.

It is loaded with non-stop action, contains a great storyline, and has some of the best and highly unusual camera angles ever used in modern cinema. the casting was well chosen, particularly with Keanu Reeves as the hero Neo and Laurence Fishburne as the wise mentor Morpheus whom are both underrated.

"ofpsmith","Good movie, but not without it's flaws.","26 January 2016","The Matrix was pretty groundbreaking wasn't it? It showed the world that big budget action movies can be philosophical. That said, looking at it now, it does have a dated appearance. Does that make it any less a film. Not exactly, but it's easier to laugh at some of the things about it. We've all seen people make fun of Keanu Reeves going, ""Whoah."" That said I still like the movie. It's a fun action flick that also makes you think, and I like that. The story was good, the effects are good, most of the acting is good (most of it), and I really do appreciate what this film did for the action genre. It wasn't unheard of for action movies to be philosophical, it just wasn't as common as it now. Today a lot of action movies can double as thinker movies, and a lot of that is down The Matrix. If you haven't seen it, you should go check it out.","10"
"AhmedSpielberg99","Creativity At Its Peak!","21 September 2018","Mostly remembered for its distinctive use of slo-mo style and physics-defying action, but what makes The Matrix really stand out, at least for me, is its extremely innovative exploration of some philosophical questions and ideas. These themes are discussed through the movie's layered story premise, but they are explored by The Wachowskis' directorial vision.

There are many great Sci-Fi/Action movies that earned their place among the best of their kind because how profound the thoughts and how interesting theories they are explore, but this is not the case here. The Matrix is one of the best thought-provoking Sci-fi movies simply because of the direction. There is no doubt that the fact we get information bit by bit made the movie so intriguing, but the main reason this movie is so exciting is because how little it offers by showing us, not by telling us. And here is the best thing about The Wachowskis' direction, that it created a world that, for the lack of a better word, broke the limits and pushed the boundaries for its story. The result is what seems to be implausible and nonsensical, made all the sense in the world.

Unfortunately, I hoped the movie relies on its creative visuals even more to explain its ideas. Because the rest explanations are displayed in a very unsubtle and direct way. For example, some of the intellectual concepts Morpheus attempts to explain to Neo often feel like they have been lifted from a philosophy essay or something like this. So there are a lot of exposition that could have been easily ignored, and replaced by some visual explanations, the very thing that happened a couple of times in the movie.

In Addition, sometimes I felt that the philosophical themes are a bit repetitive, and they didn't have any right to be so. In my opinion, this happened because the direction, for all its advantages, is occasionally ostentatious. I've also the same issue with Marvel's Dr. Strange.

It goes without saying that The Matrix has some of the most dazzling and imaginative action set-pieces ever put to film. Although, it's not the most thing I was impressed by, and therefore not what made me love this movie, I have to admit that the groundbreaking action in The Matrix is what made the movie timeless. As it's as creative as it's unprecedented. That's also due to the unlimited world that has been created by The Wachowskis' revolutionary vision. What we got is some of the most memorable scenes in cinema history that deserve every bit of the expression ""often imitated, never duplicated"".

Surprisingly, the movie's wonderfulness doesn't stop at its philosophy or the exploration of it, neither stop at its breathtaking action. The movie also reutilized some of the clichés and tropes that are often found in action movies, and sometimes also in classic fantasy movies! And I can't describe how exceptionally clever they are utilized in the movie, particularly in the astonishing final act.

There is no need to talk about the acting. For all the cast gave great hammy, yet charismatic performances that perfectly matches the movie's distinguish tone. Keanu Reeves played Neo, the role that was the turning point in his career. Both Laurence Fishburne and Carrie-Anne Moss have some of the most intense and emotional moments in the movie that showed some of their terrific acting abilities. Hugo Weaving portrayed one of the most popular villains in cinema, Agent Smith. The rest of the cast who played less important roles are very good, especially Marcus Chong as Tank. I loved his acting so much, and he made me somehow feel I was watching an Alien movie. I don't know why, but that's what I felt!

Another great thing about The Matrix, and one of the factors that made it stands the test of time, is the ageless special effects. The visual effects are utterly stunning. In large part because of how intelligent they are used not just because how stellar they look. The sound effects are equally brilliant and game-changing.

More intelligent and creative than the vast majority of modern big-budget science fiction films, and more impressive and enjoyable than the vast majority of modern big-budget action films. The Matrix is an outstanding achievement in almost every aspect. And an immortal classic that deserves every bit of recognition it got.

"Geeky Randy","Geeky Randy's summary","17 August 2010","The Wachowski brothers deliver a tasty sci-fi thriller that everyone from bully to nerd can't resist. Reeves, who makes his one dimensional acting work here, plays a computer hacker who is believed to be the coming savior of a futuristic simulated reality controlled by artificial intelligence—Hugo Weaving almost steals the film as one of these sentient machines. Chong, Fishburne, Moss and Pantoliano all do an excellent job as the supporting cast of this classic joyride. However, the remainder of the rebellion is extremely underdeveloped, but the pros of the film are so great that they overshadow such a flaw.

"Mcduff3601","Mind blowing","29 August 2023","Even after 24 years this movie is still in my top 10 sci fi movies of all time. When this came out it was ground breaking. The special effects still hold up today but they have lost some of their polish especially since then the techniques are common place amongst new movies using better quality graphics.

The story however is something out there. It is told in a way that allows you to connect with the main character, as he finds out things you find them out at the same time.

I also like that even those this is the first in a trilogy you don't need the other movies to complete this one. It's fine as a stand alone movie.

Totally recommend to anyone who likes sci fi, or movies, or good things.","10"
"Darkside-Reviewer","""It's the question that drives us Neo""","1 February 2020","The Matrix was released in Cinema's back in 1999 and while the idea of AI computers and the world being destroyed by robots in the future is nothing new The Matrix essentially rebooted the idea and gave it a new twist and with the technology of CGI being much better than most science fiction movies that came before it we got something that looked stunning had a brilliant cast and the fighting was beautifully choreographed and with a cool looking Steampunk/Cyberpunk look to the movie and it's characters dressed in black leather the movie looks cool as hell some of the characters on screen presences command your attention and have you hanging on their every word.

The story follows a hacker named Neo (Keanu Reeves) who spends his nights at his computer digging up information on an unknown legendary hacker who calls himself Morpheus (Lawrence Fishburne) who has the answers to a question only whispered about by those who dare dig deep enough in cyberspace what is the matrix? After years of searching he wakes up one night with instructions on his computer that will lead him towards the answers and to Morpheus but little does he know that Morpheus knows everything about him and now Neo is the next target for a group of agents who want to find Morpheus and neutralise him and they intend on using Neo to lure him out into the open but now Neo must decide what path to walk the one that leads to the truth about the Matrix and the world he lives in or go back to his regular routine life and live in ignorance of the truth two paths lay before him and there's no turning back from either one.

If by some miracle you haven't already seen The Matrix do yourself a favour and give it a watch put aside the memes the jokes and the sequels and enjoy a movie that upon release blew everyones mind and paved the way for future science fiction movies you will see why this is considered a science fiction classic filled with kick ass fight scene's a great and thought provoking story and stunning visuals.","1"
"tomimt","Redefinition of action","7 May 2005","I remember seeing ""The Matrix"" for the first time. I knew it was going to be some kind of sci-fi flick, which of all the people I knew raved about. I had my doubts; it's rare, that movies live up to their hype.

The first action scene with Carrie-Ann Moss (Trinity) defines the whole film: expect unexpected. Actually the very first action scene did redefine action movie genre all together with slick camera movement and freeze time shots. It all is visual eye candy, which has been designed to make you as the viewer gasp your breath.

The story goes, that hacker Neo (Keanu Reeves) is seeking for truth. He want's to know what is the Matrix. Soon he is taken for a drive by Morpheus (Laurence Fishburne) and Trinity and he learns that the world is not what it seems. Then there are the bad guys, lead by Agent Smith (Hugo Weaving) and his troop of men in black. In the mix there are thrown pits and pieces from various existential philosophy courses and Jesus and Judas theme is strongly present. A kind of modern semi religious/philosophical mix. Not meant to be taken too seriously, even tough some people seem to do so.

I am actually very interested of seeing, how this movie will last the time. Will it be taken as a new ""Star Wars"" or will it just fade away and become a cult classic. There is no knowing that.

But, my recommendation: Lean back and kick your feet up. Munch some popcorn and enjoy, it's easy with this film.","9"

"arminhage","A pimp giant truck running on grossly non matching tires","17 August 2014","1. The portal between the Matrix and supposed to be the real world was extremely ridiculous, old phones ringing and that's it? seriously??? While the whole thing is pure fiction, within the boundaries of that fiction, audience expects to receive a reasonably believable action and/or explanation and in case of the portal, the thing is so cheap that is beyond any explanation so maybe that's why they just left it unexplained and I thank them for not attempting to insult my intelligence. It was 1930s cheap!

2. Apparently the director(s) were into antiques. Old Lincoln car, old phones, old TVs... I love antiques too but using those stuff in the movie was like an unmatched patch on hole on pair of jeans! Some may find it fashionable but I say its just irrelevant, and it was an irrelevancy overdone!

3. To elicit emotion in a good screenplay, hero and villain(s) should be fundamentally the same and that similarity should be explained early in the movie otherwise there would be no elicited emotion on audience side as a result of their conflict. In this movie there was absolutely no similarity between the hero and villain except a cheesy explanation near the end of movie which aside from being so cheesy, it was also too late and as a result, confrontations between Nemo and the agent throughout the movie were among the most senseless I've ever seen on big screen. It was good action (for year 1999) but that was it! no emotion, no excitement!

4. Villains had no weakness(es). They could virtually do anything, there was no limit to their power. On scree writing point, the villain(s) of the movie were pure disaster and at the end, Nemo was dead! So he came to life again after the kiss of the true love (thank you for making me laugh a bit) and all the sudden he became the one who could do anything better that villains and destroyed them... really???

If I want to explain this movie in a short sentence I would say I was a giant pimp truck running on mini copper tire on rear left, 18 wheeler tire of on rear right, regular truck tire on front left and no tire at all on front right! yes, it was that bad and yet it was successful because of the action and relatively innovative special effects for a time. Also for those who claim that the movie was philosophical... No it was not. The story was not new and there were numerous books and movies on the subject of what if this world is just a dream. That is an evergreen subject and this movie was just an attempt to capitalize on an evergreen subject.","9"

"roedyg","Most Intelligent Action Movie I have Ever Seen","15 May 2006","Here is an action movie that keeps you thinking. It is endlessly intriguing with its metaphors and the grandness of its premise.

Reeves creates the illusion is YOU deciding whether to take the ""red pill"" or the ""blue bill"". The tension pulling in both directions is so strong even if you know which choice is demanded by the plot for the Hollywood movie to continue.

Most sci-fi movies feel like horse westerns in latex drag. This one pulls you into a high tension alternate universe where you scarcely dare breathe.

The truth of what is going on is too complex to be explained in a few pat sentences. It gradually has to be revealed. Usually sci-fi seems to be aimed at young teens. This movie was aimed over my head. I loved the stretch.","10"
"jdring2007","an action epic with an interesting story told brilliantly; sure, it's flawed, but it's timeless fun","13 June 2022","This movie has a lot of nostalgia riding on it and thus I might be a little biased with how much I love it. Like so very few movies, though, it holds its ground after two decades and surpasses its three sequels by no short distance. Iconic to say the least, quotable and even a little cheesy at times, it nonetheless pulls at your heart strings in the right moments, forces you to use some capacity of your brain, and yet simultaneously encourages you to simply ""unplug"" and have fun. The action is, dare I say, over-the-top, and yet it isn't littered with gratuitous explosions, though the copious gunfights are engaging, acrobatic, and stylish; the slow-mo never feels excessive, and despite its R rating there's not a lot of blood, no nudity, no sex, and no heavy profanity. It's sci-fi to the core yet it often feels like a very...human experience. Your first watch is bound to demand a second and third; after that, sometimes it's fun just to enjoy the brilliantly choreographed and at the time rather innovative fight scenes. Hugo Weaving is incredible as Agent Smith; Keanu Reeves iconic as Neo, and while no Oscar winner he does nail the part as if born to play it; Carrie-Anne Moss as Trinity and Laurence Fishbourne as Morpheus are also splendid in their own subtle ways. The movie has an 8.7 with 2million ratings on IMDb for a reason; just saying.","6"
"movieguy1021","The Matrix: 7/10","15 December 2002","Thomas A. Anderson is in trouble. Words appear on his computer screen, telling him to ""follow the white rabbit"". He does, and a mysterious woman named Trinity (Carrie-Anne Moss) tells him that ""they have been looking for him"" and says something about the Matrix, leaving Thomas very confused. In his work the next day, Thomas is chased by some guys. Not exactly ""good guys"". He meets Morpheus (Laurence Fishburne), and Morpheus tells him that once he goes into the real world, he can never go back. Thomas, who becomes Neo, does. And he finds out about the Matrix and everything.

That may not make sense, but it does in the movie. Thomas A. Anderson/Neo is played by Keanus Reeves, keeping his status as ""cool action dude"" real. He originally is skeptical, but soon learns the truth, and he begins, shall I say, enjoy it.

The Matrix draws you in with special effects gadgets and weird things, but soon teeters away from that, making you glued to your seat because you're wating for the next one. While there are tremondous special effects (some were under-utilized, I'm assuming they'll be in the sequels), some of the characters came and went, and the script (by the directors, the Wachowski brothers) didn't really introduce them to us. Maybe if a little less of the fighting (which was very cool) and more of the basics had been there, it would have been easier.

Of course, movies like this can't be without mumbo-jumbo. The mystical Morpheus does most of it-talking philosophically and not making sense at times. I got the rudimentary idea behind most of it (like that they actually didn't go the Matrix, etc.), but it tried to get oo in-depth.

The Matrix was fun and enjoyable, with some heartpounding scenes and cool special effects (love that bullet-stopping). The acting was all very good-Reeves, as I've said before, was good and might be coming back. Fishburne is good as the guy who knows everything but cannot speak it (i.e. Dobby?), and I love Moss-she's great and a rising action star. I didn't really notice that Joe Pantoliano was there, but his voice sounded familiar. He looks a lot different than from Memento.

The Matrix is a fun FX ridden piece that doesn't waste time on ""trivial"" aspects such as characters.

My rating: 7/10

Rated R for sci-fi violence and brief language.","3"
"ryanpersaud-59415","One of the Greatest Films Ever Made.","11 January 2022","The Good: 22 years later, what is there to say about the Matrix? It's literally one of the most iconic and influential films of the 20th century, whose influence would only be truly realized in the 21st.

1999 was arguably the greatest year for film in American history and The Matrix is almost always mentioned as one of the reasons why. This is a tight, interesting, fun action thriller at its core, but a sprawling epic in its ambition. It's perfectly paced, grabs you and never lets go, and opens up a world of possibilities for a story to go. It's not really a stretch to call The Matrix the Gen X Star Wars. (I mean, relatively underwhelming sequels notwithstanding)

But beyond that, The Matrix is a rare blockbuster that doesn't shy away from big ideas. The influences are endless; Greek philosophy, Wire Fu, cyberpunk anime, the Bible, Y2K, technophobia, transhumanism...all in one hell of a fun action movie. There's just so much intentionality with this movie; it's as if every single frame was thought out and meant to represent something or convey some idea. That this weighty stuff ALSO manages to balance perfectly with great characters who exude humanity is a marvel.

Reeves, Moss, and Fishburne are literally the perfect sci-fi action trio. They work so well off each other and all were perfectly cast. I personally think Fishburne basically steals the show here, but there's not a bad performance in this thing.

I almost forgot to mention the absolutely INCREDIBLE final scene, one that cemented The Matrix into the annals of film history for as long as those annals exist. It's the perfect synthesis of action, drama, tension, and eye popping, intelligent science fiction.

The Bad: Nothing.

The Ugly: This film inspired a generation for a reason. Teens entering the new Millenium copied the black leather aesthetic for years to come. Movies parodied bullet time until it became blase. Even the lackluster way the trilogy ended had a gigantic impact on Hollywood going forward. I know this isn't contained to the film itself, but come on...once you've seen the giant footsteps this movie left in its wake, it's hard not to think about that watching it again.","1"
"mfellipecampos","Masterpiece","21 August 2021","One of the most creative films and also one of the best I've ever seen. The film has a huge philosophical character, it makes you think all the time. Keanu Reeves is a great actor and here he's better than ever playing Neo, the Chosen One. The film takes place in a future where the world is dominated by machines but nobody knows that, because they created a virtual world, where people live normally and don't suspect anything, the Matrix. Neo is apparently just another one of those people but he has something special, and since the beginning of the movie he already suspects something. Morpheus is inserted into the plot and starts talking to Neo, whom he believes is the chosen one. It's amazing how the film develops, the two meet and Neo starts to discover everything he didn't know. He discovers that the real world is very different from the world he lived in. The film brings us philosophical reflections all the time, such as ""the body does not live without the mind"", in this case, if you die in the Matrix you also die in the real world, even if that is not real, because your mind is there. The slow motion action scenes are awesome too. And the ending then is completely surprising, there Neo chooses is the chosen one.

"BlackJack_B","Lives up to the hype and more.","2 August 2002","After waiting three years after it's release to theaters, I finally got around to renting the DVD of The Matrix, and now I wonder why I took so long to see it in the first place. This is a gem of a movie, and one of the best films in the last 5 years.

What I love is that they took so many genres of film (action, mystery/suspense, sci-fi, cyberpunk, kung fu, drama, horror) and deliciously mix them up into something that equals a hearty bowl of Minestrone soup, gourmet pizza with the works, or homemade ice cream made with all the ingredients you want. The story was intriguing; the idea that mankind lives in a computer-generated world while the real world is embattled in a fight with computers to regain control of it for humans is something different. Being able to be strapped into a machine and be taught any program immediately and live and die in the world of 1999 is something I'd want to experience myself. The SFX are again used to good use, to help the story, not to hide the fact that the story is weak. Little touches, like Hugo Weaving's Agent Smith, whose voice goes softer as he speaks his sentences or Joe Pantoliano's Cypher, who longs to live in 1999 permanently so he could eat roast beef and not the sludge he consumes in 2199, are terrific.

The performances by Keanu Reeves, Laurence Fishburne, Carrie-Anne Moss, and others are decent to good, although a little wooden at times, but Weaving's character is absolutely chilling, playing a remorseless villain. My only gripe is that while the story is great, the actual scripted dialogue could have used more bite, I think they were trying to get this one rated PG-13, but the hammer-and-tong types at the MPAA rated this one R. Still, it was a huge success, and hopefully the upcoming sequels will be better than this, although it will be hard to top this one.

The DVD I rented contained commentary of the film, cast& credit notes, and a long documentary about the making of ""The Matrix"". Later editions have the extra ""Follow The White Rabbit"" and ""Take The Red Pill"" features that show alternative angles of the famous scenes from this film or SFX documentaries.","10"
"ethan_murdoch","Complex to whole new level","24 February 2004","It isn't very often that a good science fiction movie is conceived. There are those, eh it was okay, or those not bad types, but this definitely ranks among the greatest.

First off comes the very concept of it. Warning: Spoilers.

Neo is a man living in a world he doesn't believe in. He is soon awakened by Morpheus and the eventual love interest Trinity. This is the basis for the story, but it goes deeper than that. You have Agent Smith, a program within the Matrix, which by the way took me two viewings to figure out, that is out to restore order to the programming.

Tidbit number one, the story itself. Phenomenal is one of the best words to describe it. You have a classic idea of a society of the future trapped and blinded by that trap, just living a normal life. But it toys with the concept that not all of us would accept the world we are given, much like the Truman Show. There is only one other film I would compare this to, and would put above, and that is Dark City. Moving on, The Matrix houses an entity of disbelief and human emotion.

Each character has their own history that we somehow learn all about. First and foremost is Neo, played very well by Keanu Reeves. I must say that I have always liked the guy and his films; Chain Reaction, Speed, etc. Now, he flawlessly plays a character on edge and constantly learning how to defeat certain evil. Bringing us to the nemesis of Neo, Agent Smith. I had never seen Hugo Weaving's work prior to this, but absolutely loved his performance. Playing an entity who wants a level of freedom that humans have and take for granted.

Next comes Morpheus, played by a great film actor Laurence Fishburne. Whose work in Event Horizon gave me chills and thrills. He plays sort of the father figure in this sci-fi. Teaching Neo what he must know to help bring the human race out of near extinction. Last, but certainly not least comes Trinity, the love interest and major butt kicker. Carrie Anne-Moss is another actress I had not heard before this film, and I must say that I search for her name when thinking of movies to see. It's what brought me to Memento and Red Planet. But I was amazed that she could portray both an action hero and a serious individual, not! But this seems to be the trend in a lot of Hollywood films. The woman hero is either strong with no emotions, or too emotional with no strengths. Not so anymore, but I think Carrie helped to break the barrier.

Definitely a must see for not only all science fiction fans, but for a whole generation, for this represents a 'could happen' scenario. One way or another, I found myself leaving the theater, and still watching the credits, thinking about what it all means...

He is armed the neck with weapons and ammunition to blast hundreds of people away. I cannot help but think how this might have inspired James Holmes when he went to a Batman movie in a costume concealing a similar arsenal around his chest to shoot twenty or thirty people.

"johnnymonsarrat","Jon Monsarrat review: intelligent thriller with a soul","1 April 2002","""The Matrix"" doesn't exactly have ""something to say that changed my life"", but it definitely has a powerful theme and lots of deep thinking mojo.

Laurence Fishburne carries the film. I'm not ashamed to say that Keanu Reeves has grown on me a lot since the early days.

Don't worry, if you're turned off by intellectual-ism, you can still enjoy it as a straight action movie. Lots and lots of stuff blows up, some of it in a stop-motion crescendo that won The Matrix the Oscar for visuals.

And if you're the arty type who's turned off by action movies, you can appreciate the amazing visuals, acting, and directing, and themes.

The Matrix is rated R but I would say it's basically PG except that it's got a dark and scary edge to it. So definitely not for young-ish kids but safe for your mature-ish teens.

definitely not as nightmarish as ""Brazil"". More like ""Alien 2""

Does anyone know how I can contact one of the sentient programs and ask them to sort out the audio in the matrix? Thanks!","8"
"donaldricco","Mr. Anderson...","16 April 2017","Just super cool, even today! Love the way both Fishburne and Weaving talk! Super cool! And the scene of Neo and Trinity in the lobby where Morpheus is being held is awesome! I'm also a big fan of the Oracle, the actress just totally owns that role! I could, and will, watch this again and again!","9"
"raypdaley182","Still good","21 February 2008","Well here I am almost 10 years after the release of this movie and I'm finally reviewing it! I'd seen it on TV a few weeks back so I thought it was time to commit my thoughts to cyberspace. Take Thomas Anderson, AKA Hacker Neo. He is contacted by an underground resistance whose leader Morpheus he has been looking for.

Exactly why Neo is looking for him is never explained, we are thrown into a different story because Morpheus had been looking for him. When he finally gets to meet Morpheus he is offered the choice to join them and awakes in a tank of goo connected to dozens of hoses before being ejected from the comfort of his pod.

He discovers The Matrix and what he thought was his real life are nothing but computer illusions with computers running The Earth and using humans as a source of power. Basically this film is about the ideas of reality, what is real? Using a lot of imagery and references from Alice In Wonderland the film still looks impressive, has plenty of action (maybe a little bit too much fighting) and a sound enough plot and cast.

Even if Keanu Reeves wasn't 1st pick to be Neo he still did a great job. Carrie Ann Moss as Trinity looks incredible and Laurence Fishburne plays his role brilliantly. Hugo Weaving is almost always overlooked as Agent Smith but he is so deadpan its unreal.

Despite being almost a decade old now the film is still more than watchable even if it's ending is a little weak being left open for it's sequel to explore.","9"
"welhof1","Unbelievable plot line. Incredible.","8 June 2021","Very rarely I watch a film that has such a unique story line as this. Such an incredible film. A lot of people talk about the action and special effects but I think the plot is what makes this movie incredible. I've seen it 4-5 times and it's still incredible.

If you can watch the Animatrix after watching this. It's a nice addition.","9"
"ruby_fff","Dazzling computer special effects and surreal delivery of martialart movements plus underlying save-the-human species storystructure","11 April 1999","Without a doubt, the presentation of this film with its myriad of computerized special effects is spectacular. It's a feast for the eye. A fantastic journey -- though mostly in tones of dark colors -- for the very computer literate. It works very well as a comic book style storytelling in the company of Keanu Reeves, Laurence Fishburne, Carrie-Anne Moss, Hugo Weaving and Joe Pantoliano. From the pen and direction of the Wachowski brothers, Andy and Larry (sharply delivered the previous intriguing ""Bound"" with Jennifer Tilly, Gina Gershon and Joe Pantoliano.) ""The Matrix"" is imaginative. It's fantasy, yet the undertones can be real.

We've had films with similar storyline, Terry Gilliam has two prominent ones: ""Brazil"" 1985 and ""12 Monkeys"" 1995 -- more concentrated on the plot and message vs. dazzling computerized effects, hence more time in deeper delivery of the acting performances along with the story intrigue. Also comes to mind is Alex Proyas' ""Dark City"" 1998, especially when we see the long black trench coats! The virtual reality aspect has traces of ""Star Trek"" (the out of body simultaneous existence, the beaming back to the ship), and of course, ""Star Wars"" (fighting off the bugs/viruses from the ship's steering control platform).

The chase scenes, action-explosive scenes, and martial art scenes we've seen/experienced these before. A lot of other film tracks spring to mind: Barry Sonnenfeld's ""Men In Black"" 1997 (chases and alien monsters); Stephen Norrington's ""Blade"" 1998 (cool martial art movements); John Badham's ""Blue Thunder"" 1983 (helicopter in action); John McTiernan's ""Die Hard"" 1988 (the shattering glass by non-stop flying bullets); and John Woo's trademark rain of bullet ballet styles. The computer-intensive plot has a trace of the situation in ""Mercury Rising"" 1998 with Bruce Willis; reminders of the insightful paranoiac B/W independent film of Darren Aronofsky's ""Pi"" 1998; yes, Keanu in ""Johnny Mnemonic"" 1995 -- Is this part 2? Keanu's character here is a human with doubts and feelings of his own vs. a go-between android type. (Ah, ""Android"" 1982, directed by Aaron Lipstadt is an interesting sci-fi piece with Klaus Kinski as an avid scientist, and Don Opper who plays Max 404 co-wrote the screenplay.)

There are steady quiet moments/brief scenes for pause and emotional exchanges, especially the meeting with Oracle, seemingly a surreal scene yet so down-to-earth with human warmth -- for a moment I felt we're in a calm reality with no hurriedness or impending threat. There's also the scene when Morpheus explains to Neo What Is the Matrix -- come to think of it, kinda have tones of George Lucas' 1970 classic ""THX 1138"" bland background -- esoterically surreal? Jean-Luc Godard's ""Alphaville"" 1965 is a cool French sci-fi fantasy in B/W with no particular special effects but great story that is familiar.

The idea of the bureaucratic society in The Matrix reminds me of John Carpenter's ""They Live"" 1988.

By the way, Hugo Weaving has worn dark shades before in another movie: Jocelyn Moorehouse's ""Proof"" 1991 -- he portrayed a blind photographer (no kidding) with Russell Crowe (who was the robotic nightmare SID 6.7 in ""Virtuosity"" 1995 opposite Denzel Washington.)

Performances are fine all round: Laurence Fishburne always dependable delivery, Hugo Weaving's Agent Smith is as good as it gets, Carrie-Anne Moss is cool moves, and Keanu, his was a decent delivery -- can't ask for more, his presence IS the center of The Matrix. Liquefaction chrome effect is maximized manifold since its introduction in James Cameron's ""The Abyss"" 1989. All in all, the Wachowski brothers and co. delivered ""The Matrix"" successfully as an opening weekend box office #1 hit. Warner Brothers should be all smiles!

Keanu did a pretty good job in Taylor Hackford's ""The Devil's Advocate"" 1997, opposite Al Pacino and Charlize Theron. To see him in a more romantic role and hear him sing with Anthony Quinn, try (""Like Water for Chocolate"" 1993 director) Alfonso Arau's ""A Walk in the Clouds"" 1995.","9"
"departed07","Breathtaking!","22 February 2008","What would you do if you found out that the real world you lived in wasn't what it seemed? In the spring of 1999, ""The Matrix"" popped into theaters where prior to showing how computers can play a role in people's lives, the movie introduced fans dazzling special effects that would change the film-making industry with dozens of directors and hundreds of inspiring young artists wanting a piece of the action.

Keanu Reeves plays Anderson, who goes by the name of Neo on the Internet, a computer hacker who's trying to find out about a character named Morpheus (Laurence Fishburne). He digs deeper before he realizes that a group of agents led by Smith (Hugo Weaving) capture him and use him to see if he can spill any information about Morpheus. Anderson refuses before being set up by the agents in one horrifying scene that I can't even describe as we speak.

Later Anderson is telephoned by Morpheus to meet with his crew where the hacker meets with his idol face to face.

Neo gets more than he bargains for while hearing Morpheus explaining that a war was going in the world between freedom fighters like themselves to those opposing (the agents). He later sees that the way they work is through computers where they're hooked behind a plug and like a computer, information gets put into them from action, weapon and vehicle handling and more.

""The Matrix"" is not only a grand special effects extravaganza, but it uses everything both old and new from philosophy, western spaghetti (cowboy movies), Kung-Fu, and breaking time dimension where scenes run in slow motion. It's so shocking that it's one of the few Sci-Fi movies where you feel that you need to pay attention to.","6"
"StanleyStrangelove","Eye and ear candy","16 May 2006","The Matrix has an interesting premise which I can't give away here. Discovering what the matrix is is the fun of watching the movie for the first time. Upon a second viewing that fun is gone since you already know the secret. What you are left with then is 2 hours of eye candy, impossible martial arts battles, slow motion bullets, a plot riddled with holes, superficial characters and an abrupt ending that is not a real ending, just a tie-in to the obvious sequel.

The main actors do fine with the limited roles they are given. Keanu Reeves, Laurence Fishburne, Carrie-Anne Moss and Hugo Weaving look the part. Moss looks great in her black leather jumpsuits. Weaving has a good scene interrogating Reeves.","10"

"LightcatcherStudios","An Actor Proof Film","27 March 1999","Viewed this absolutely outstanding flick last week with a packed house here in Dallas. What a demographic spread. Everybody seemed to love the film as much as I. It's a righteous blend of fine acting, intelligent dialogue and retinal-busting visuals. I think this picture will surprise people. Exiting the screening, my wife and I were passed by two couples, who had to be in their 60's (I should know, I'm 50). They were enthusiastic in their responses. I even Like Mr. Reeves, course this flick is actor proof. Keanu gets a laugh, early in the film by making fun of himself, uttering his trademark, 'Whoa...'

Go see The Matrix. Exploding masonry never looked so pretty.","10"
"jaywolfenstien","hack-job start, decent finish","10 November 2003","I didn't really care for this film very much on the first viewing. The first thirty minutes of the film is pretty much Andy and Larry sitting in your TV asking, `What is the Matrix? What *is* the Matrix? WHAT IS THE MATRIX?' just shoving that same question and weird occurrences down your throat as if you're too stupid to ask questions on your own. That turns me off and frankly, I couldn't give a crap about the rest of the film.

From there, the film takes all the pop-culture pseudo philosophical buzzwords and questions of the latest fad and rolls it up into one nice long segment of the movie, yet another turn off for me. It's really no wonder that the film caught on, and Andy and Larry have to be congratulated for taking the audience's popular language and incorporating it into their film. Alas, the Matrix's biggest achievement is not in plot, but special effects and visual narrative which is superb.

Many directors seem to lack the ability of getting on screen action captured clearly and when they do it's shot in a boring fashion. The Wachowski's do have a very keen eye for visual flair and clarity comparable to James Cameron, Ridley Scott, and Tim Burton, but they're still too fresh in the field to make a longstanding comparison so I'll hold off. Sure, they're all the buzz now, but in five years we could find out they ran out of steam before they could get started.

Upon the second viewing it was easier to watch the film since I was expecting to be talked down to for the first hour or so and it didn't hit like an insult. Once the plot's condescending tone gets turned down a notch or two, the film becomes a fun roller coaster of well-captured and well-executed (overrated, but excellent) battles and effects that are at the brink of being excessive and ridiculous, and as the final act unfolds it does manage to achieve character sympathy and depth, anticipation, concern, and suspense. Battles have intensity and far more logistics behind them than their successors in Matrix Reloaded.

Lastly, The Matrix did have a nice resolution for the plot and character arcs, and unless Revolutions proves to re-capture what Reloaded has lost . .. it should have stayed with the Matrix. So far everything else Matrix related (Reloaded, Animatrix, ) has seemed like unnecessary excess that mostly serves just to capitalize on it, and not build from it. I guess if you can't get enough of the film, it's fine . . . but to me it robs the uniqueness of the original Matrix film than any of the Matrix's imitators.","10"
"talllwoood13","brilliant when it needed to be","7 April 2023","On one hand this is the most original movie I've seen in years and there is so much pop culture references to it down to video games such as Conkers Bad Fur Day and Saints Row 4. However there isn't enough action in it. The CGI aged HORRIBLY at times. Yet you see a movie like Terminator 1 or 2 from the late 80s or early 90s and than this and there is such a gap. Like the woman in the red dress versus Trinity. I'm sure this movie didn't have the same budget but still there should be times when they said no.

This movie is way too long, there's a few action story cliches and parts you can guess the lines before they are going to say them. Perhaps that's one reason this movie is so highly regarded as there's a balance instead of people trying to over analyze and reach every scene trying to find the deeper meanings like Rick And Morty fan base was or is known for.

The fight scenes are hit and miss, Keanu has done his share of training with firearms and martial arts. Yet I don't believe he would have been the best pick for this. I know crazy to say as many have seen this 2,3 or more times to the point this is some peoples favorite movie. To me he didn't have the right look. Sure he had the charisma but the other thing was he wasn't muscular enough. He was an every man like Bruce Willis was in Die Hard 1 but I suppose he looked like a lot of other computer nerd kids. If I was the directors I'd make my lead take some steroids or drink their weight in protein shakes. Either way I felt they could have cast him a bit better. There is so little shooting of guns in this. The camera work and a lot of other stuff are really well done, the use of color correction used sparingly to in scenes where it is not as noticeable was a good touch compared to some more modern movies I've seen.

The female lead Trinity I believe could kick ""butt"" as she has that look to her but wasn't pretty enough to be cast I think. I'm just glad Will Smith wasn't in this. Besides Keanu and Lawrence it's all nobody actors. I guess 90% of the budget went towards special effects and everything else though so it's understandable. The first hour of this movie is all talking, it's a chore where you're promised these top notch fights and action scenes and ALL they do is talk. It's like this movie Steven Seagal did called General Commander where it was 85% talking that first hour of this.

Yes they set this up for a sequel as we know as this is about as news to ""some"" as the sun being warm but still I don't feel they accomplished enough in this first movie. Plus that stupid kiss to ""Resurrect"" Neo was so ""blanking"" stupid I rolled my eyes. It was like Fifth Element (1997) but more silly. Not to say Fifth Element didn't work as that's such a better movie. It just seems like a group of kids playing with water guns or paint ball guns and you hit one friend and they say NO I didn't get hit. I had my invisible ghost armor on! Then they proceed to shoot you all and ""win"". Yeah I hate that kid! Screw you Mitch! My super soaker is nicer! Charging is better than pumping my water gun! Anyways I digress!

Ways to improve if this wasn't made yet more action more action oh and more action cut it down from 2 hours some more memorable actors some tweaks to the script the outfits are kind of awkward at times, like I'd be embarrassed to go out in some of them

the CGI being better would be a given as it's like going back and trying to play certain playstation 1 or nintendo 64 games for instance.

At the end of the day I can understand the hype as there wasn't a movie like this before it came out. Yet.. on todays standards this is slightly above average. I doubt I'd ever watch this again.","9"

"dfle3","A cool fantasy","3 June 2008","This is a movie that combines style with substance. It's basically a riff on the age old philosophy of Scepticism-a philosophy that holds that we can know nothing of the world we live in as it is all an illusion. The hero of this movie, Neo, finds himself in just such a predicament. He is told that the world he lives in is just an illusion, controlled by inhuman monsters. He is given a choice: accept the illusion, or break out of the illusion.

You can't really say that the events in the movie are philosophically coherent or satisfying, but on a visceral and emotional level, it gives a tremendous thrill ride.

The movie plays like every small boy,s fantasy-a chance to play a god-like being against other all powerful beings. The music adds to this macho, gun-toting, martial art practising fantasy. For example, a variation on Led Zeppelin's classic guitar riff song ""Kashmir"" is used to great effect later on in the movie.

This is a marvellously executed boys' own adventure. It was one of several entertaining movies from Hollywood in this period which dealt engagingly with profound philosophical issues. Rest assured, this is not a movie for the intellect only-it uses this old philosophical chest-nut in order to create an exciting, but scary world where apocalyptic battles are fought.

Other movies of extreme interest from around this period include Dark City and The Thirteenth Floor. The latter is like The Matrix, but more so, if you get what I mean. The former deals with profound philosophical issues, but of a different sort.

In a different vein, is Gattaca. All of these movies could be described as science-fiction/fantasy movies. See them to see a different world imagined.

Lastly, The Matrix was so good, you would have hoped that it would have had sequels made. No such luck. Of course, it would have been so easy to make nothing sequels that reviewers would not want to acknowledge. Yup, the makers of The Matrix knew when to quit-after one movie. A monument.","9"

It's too bad it's coming out this time of year, it has all the potential to be a huge summer hit, and it is sad that its accomplishments will probably be dwarfed by Phantom Menace. This has some of the nicest camera work I've ever seen (some of it similar to Lock, Stock & 2 Smoking Barrels). This movie also manages to create whole world, in the same way that Dark City did. All in all, this is probably one of the best sci-fi flicks of the decade, and it is certainly much more innovative in its special effects than Phantom Menace seems to be.

"alekspredator87","The Matrix is a revolution in the world of cinema","14 July 2022","At the time of its release, the Matrix made a splash. And first and foremost because of its unique visual effects, which were achieved with the help of new developments and methods of shooting. Yes, it's true, it caught on at first. But there is a huge ""BUT"". When the plot begins to unwind, the delight of special effects fades into the background when you clearly realize what kind of world appears in the film and how possible it is in our world. But about everything in order.

The picture of the film is quite dark and with a well-known green shade characteristic of the matrix. The plot is completely unclear at first. Why are they chasing a person, who are the pursuers, what do they want. Then the authors gradually begin to unravel the tangle of riddles in which they themselves placed the audience. This is understandable. It's more interesting this way. Continuing the viewing, you begin to understand what is happening, but as one of the heroes said, ""no one can explain what the matrix is. You have to see it for yourself.""

The actors. Keanu Reeves appears as an ordinary employee of the company, who finds himself in the thick of things. And we see how he matures, accepts a new role for himself, makes a difficult choice.

Fishburne is good in the role of a wise mentor, calm, ready to convey his idea. He's a natural leader.

Moss got the role of Trinity, who is indomitable, but at the same time appears as a trusting person who is ready to help his neighbor.

Weaving is just beautiful. He is the personification of evil, the face of the enemy that people are fighting. It's nice to look at him and at the same time a little afraid. And that means he played great.

The rest of the actors are less noticeable, but also give integrity to what is happening on the screen.

Directing. Brothers... Then the Wachowski brothers presented us with a completely new world, which forces us to look at the progress of humanity and its negative impact on all of us from a new angle. No one rules out that such a thing can happen in reality. I wish it hadn't happened.

Music. Gorgeous musical accompaniment throughout the picture. Dynamic, intense. Exactly what is needed in this picture.

In addition, the scenes of fights are perfectly staged in the picture, and the camerawork is done at the highest level.

Result. The film ""The Matrix"" is a movie event that made people talk about themselves for a decade and even got two sequels. This is a truly revolutionary film with a vivid plot, interesting characters, and a cool idea.

"SKG-2","Entertaining for a Joel Silver movie","5 April 1999","There are two names behind THE MATRIX, one which made me interested, and one which gave me pause. The one that made me interested is the Wachowski brothers, who made the highly entertaining 1996 thriller BOUND. The one which gave me pause is Joel Silver, whose movies seem to function primarily as a way to pound people into submission. Happily, THE MATRIX represents the sensibilities of the former more than the latter. The ideas it throws out in this film are similar to last year's DARK CITY, and this is more or less a high-octane version of that, but it's entertaining, and the philosophy doesn't get in the way of the story. The only time it gets to be like a Joel Silver movie is at the climax, when it becomes overkill. Still, this is the most fun I've had at the movies this year so far.","10"

Only one or two people didnt go for it either so Im almost alone in not thinking it was so amazing. Yes the effects are something we havent seen before, but thats all I saw over and over. Reeves gets strapped in, has some apparatus or another invade his body, he squirms and vibrates about in pain, then hes chased by dudes in sunglasses. Countless times, till I'd had enough. Seems he's been living in a world that doesnt exist, or something. Mysterious folks in tight outfits with shaved heads try to show him the truth, or something. The performances are decent, seeing how dialogue was scarce with the actors giving way to the visuals. When the film was released it had the tag line, ""What is the Matrix?"" After seeing the film I still wasn't sure.","7"
"chrisbrown6453","Wow, too bad I have only 1,000 words to use...","17 June 2002","I realize that I'm going to take a lot of heat for saying this, but it needs to be said; I really, really liked The Matrix, and I think it's quite possibly PERFECT. The story was original, the special effects were great, and for the first time I can remember, Keanu wasn't annoying.

Keanu Reeves is Neo, a software technician/hacker. He feels something is wrong with the world, but can't put a finger on it. When he meets the mythical Morpheus (Lawrence Fishburne) he realizes that the life he is leading isn't real. It's all just a game inside the Matrix. I don't want to give away too much, but it's safe to say, nothing is what it seems in the Matrix.

Let's start with Keanu. Personally I think he's one of the most annoying actors I've ever seen. As a person I like him, he seems nice enough in interviews and the rest, but as an actor I think he's horrible. But here, he doesn't have to speak much, and when he does, it's full of wonderment and amazement, which is what he does best. He's mainly there to be a pretty face and an action hero, and I think he pulls it off. Carrie Ann Moss is the female of the film. If memory serves, she was in the ill-fated tv show, Models Inc. She's come a long way since then. She handles herself well in the middle of all this testosterone. And Fishburne is cool as always. He wears these very cool shades and just has an aura about him. The rest of the cast, lead by bad guy Hugo Weaving as Agent Smith does very well also. The story line was actually well built. At first I was afraid this would be another one of those sci-fi films that looked good but didn't make any sense (on a side note, am I the only person who didn't like Blade Runner?). But here, the story starts off hard to follow, but it makes itself understandable without making it obvious. The special effects were very cool. You've seen a lot of them in previews and commercials, but they look even better in context. Some of the battle scenes were amazing. And the look of the film was done well. The world looked normal, but you could see that something just wasn't right. The audience figured things out the same time Neo did, which made it more interesting. The soundtrack was also good and loud. Any movie that puts Rob Zombie into their soundtrack is tops in my book.

So while I realize that the grade I gave may be out of whack for true sci-fi flicks, I really enjoyed The Matrix. I really didn't find much I didn't like about it. There are several, and I mean several, mistakes such as visible equipment and crew, and continuous errors, but upon first and even second viewing they really weren't noticeable. Anyway, this was a very good, cool movie, so watch it.","9"
"Paragon240","The Matrix completely changed the landscape of special effects cementing itself in the halls of cinema glory as one of the most innovative films of all time.","21 January 2023","I remember watching this movie for the first time as a 9-year-old and having my mind blown wide open! After rewatching it almost 25 years later, this movie is still a groundbreaking and breathtaking masterpiece. It's hard to believe The Matrix came out in 1999 with the quality of effects and production it showcases that still hold up in many ways to modern films. But it's more than the effects. The cinematography serves as the eyes of the audience with clever angles and shots, putting the viewer right in the middle of the action. The editing, sound, and visual effects all won Oscars. The fight choreography was as cutting edge as John Wick was in 2014 with its gun-fu. The Matrix created a fascinating and beguiling new universe that demanded to be explored. The neo-goth, noir, and retro aesthetics keep the movie from feeling dated all these years later. Hugo Weaving's performance deserved more acclaim from the Academy because his unhinged Agent Smith is one of the most iconic villains in cinematic history. The Matrix impacted Hollywood and culture in a way that left it forever changed. The Matrix is a pillar of cinema and one of the greatest films of all time.","9"

"AvidClimber","The Matrix — The domination of the machine, the enslavement of the humans","11 February 2013","The Matrix, the first installment of the trilogy, is a master piece, not so much in terms of movie mechanics, but in terms of story telling. The ideas it brings, not the concept of the domination of the machines, but how that domination is achieved, are stupendous. They are mind breaking.

The first time I saw that film, I didn't know what I was going to see, and it felt like a punch in the guts. I consider myself lucky, because that is a rare thing. Still, it is a piece to catch anyone's breath.

The soundtrack is one of the best ever, bar only The Crow (review upcoming). The costume are perfectly tailored and adapted to the tone of each environments. The mood is excellent, at all time. They even applied a greenish tinge when they are in the matrix, a blueish one in the cold real world, and you'll see only normal colors when they are in the training programs.

The action and suspense will keep you wanting more, the story will light up your mind, and the fight scenes will push you to the edge of your seat.

Some special effects, mainly the CGI, are not aging very well, but the work is still acceptable today.

This is probably one of Keanu Reeves' best performance. He's not a great actor, but the role fits him well. His performance as well as Carrie-Anne Moss' are not as good in the following installments. Those two movies are barely good enough to tell the rest of the story, and are not even close to the quality of the first one. I will not be reviewing them.","9"

The story arc is one that leaves you wondering and its ending is like beginning to many open possibilities.

The Wachowski brothers took the best of the best of the Sci-Fi genre and an idea that never seems to stop plaguing the mind of many that one day computers will be taking over. The movie is directed by the brothers and produced by Joel Silver (who also produced Die Hard 1 & 2, Lethal Weapon 1 – 4, V for Vendetta (2005) and Bullet to the Head (2013)).

The story arc is about a post apocalyptic future where humans were now used as fuel to drive machines. The human race developed ""THE A.I."" program, which in turn raged a war between it and its makers. In the end the human race lost and there are being grown for fuel, their brains are feed with ideas of a real life, while their minds live in a world called The Matrix.

There the human race is living their lives like they normally do not knowing that the life they live is not real. The twist in this tale is, some figured out and the last collection of humans most are those taken out of The Matrix control live in a place called Zion. But there is a prophesy that a certain man will come and save the humans from the machines, and that man has been found by a man named Morpheus (Laurence Fishburne) and his crew which include Trinity (Carrie-Anne Moss). The name of that man is Neo (Keanu Reeves) or as Agent Smith (Hugo Weaving) calls him Mr. Anderson.

The 1982 Disney movie Tron, was to me the main inspiration for the movie, as it features lives in the grid, that is lives in a computer system. Also The Matrix can be said to have drawn ideas from other movies in the 90s like The Truman Show (1998) where Jim Carey's life was being controlled by an external source and he was not the wiser, also I believe they got inspiration from Alex Proyas Dark City (1998) which like The Truman Show was done a year earlier . Also the fight scenes can be said to have been drawn from Japanese animation (Anime) which the Wachowski brothers took a likening into.

After the huge success of this movie, the Wachowski brothers went ahead to make two sequels (The Matrix Reloaded and The Matrix Revolutions), which were both released four years after in 2003. The Wachowski brothers also further expanded the story with comic books, cartoons and video games. The Matrix is a good movie; in fact it is a great movie ranking high in any Sci-Fi list, the later Lord of the Rings trilogy and then the Star Wars prequel trilogy, started the whole trilogy phase that is now popular in Hollywood now a day.

So it is best to get the above listed 3 trilogies.

"PyrolyticCarbon","Stunning special effects, and surprisingly, plot laden story","10 December 1999","A modern masterpiece, to coin a well overused phrase, but not out of place with this movie.

This film has one of those unique qualities that so few films have, it makes you leave the cinema with a feeling of sheer excitement, you feel ready to take on anything and you could, if only the Matrix were real!

With amazing special effects, created months prior to scenes being shot, and looking extremely stylish, it delivers everything that you'd expect, and more, an interesting plot. Yes, there is a plot, and although it's way out there, I couldn't help but overlook the far fetched ideas and leap headlong into the Matrix. It challenges all our beliefs about our way of life, and by the end of the film you can almost argue yourself into thinking it could all be true!

Laurence Fishburne and Carrie-Anne Moss are fantastic, whereas Keanu Reeves is just his usual bewildered character - although in this film it works perfectly. Hugo Weaving, as Agent Smith, is superb, a fantastic love-to-hate character. The way he and Fishburne talk and act throughout this film is just pure cool - I found myself imitating them continuously afterwards.

Go see this film, or rent it on DVD. Only word of advice though is make sure you watch it with Digital soundtrack and surround speakers - it'll blow you away.","10"
"PeeJay","Hard to be original....","30 December 2000","Now that we have had the pioneering-stages of film-making, and passed through the first stages of computer-animation and graphics creating the illusion of another world within the one we live in, life and movies could have become exciting. But in fact the results are pretty disappointing. Hollywood bores us almost to death with re-makes and re-makes of re-makes and the results are almost consistently worse than the originals which at least, but certainly not only, had the profits of being original. This case isn't much different. The producers should be given credit in creating a fantasy and doing it convincingly, as well as doing a good job on dealing with some of the special effects and stunts. Fighting scenes are not too bad either, but lack involvement, and could very rarely be called exciting. This makes the Matrix certainly not a thriller or good action movie. In this way the Matrix is disappointing due to a weak plot, a badly told story that suffers from a lack of story-telling abilities, involvement, surprise and continuity. This movie could make a nice prequel to a series, but a lot needs to be done to really make this a success: better and deeper characters, a good story-line, a more realistic view of mankind, better directing and more involvement with characters and less attention drawn on special effects could make the sequels a good start for a new kind of sci-fi movies. The cast seems good enough, and should not be blamed for the way the story evolves in this movie; one only gets the idea, certainly after having seen the extras on the dvd and 'the making of'-documentary the attention of the directors and producers was drawn almost totally towards the 'Kung-fu' and special effects this way creating a life-like comic-book sci-fi movie. Some involvement of George Lucas could do a lot of good to this movie, even if only consulting him on creating and telling stories. But he certainly would not have been proud of this movie if the result would be this disappointing on so many points. Referring to the beginning of this comment, the Matrix is hugely overrated, but over-looking the releases of the last few years this should not be a surprise... people are not exactly spoiled with good movies, and if trying to be original could be rewarded, this movie should earn an award for maybe a not fully successful, but at least one of the most successful attempts to be original of the last few years. Maybe only exceeded by the largely underrated 'Dark City'.","10"

"JWick23","Free your mind...","4 March 2021","A sci fi classic! Not too old that it wouldn't been as interesting for the newer generations and not too young that it wouldn't be considered a classic. One of the best sci fi movies of all time and one of my personal favorites. Thematically, story-wise, and writing wise.

Great story with terrific pacing with alot of worldbuilding and themes. Great variety of characters that are well written and for once in a sci fi movie you can connect to them and understand them. Impressive visuals and music considering the time it came out in. With great choreography and costume designs. Lastly brilliiant writing and great acting.

Overall a very enjoyable movie. It will make your question yourself for days on end..

"supertom-3","Groundbreaking, brilliant, best film ever!!","11 March 2002","I have to say that the Matrix goes down as one of my favourite films ever. The film is pure excellence in film making. There are so many levels to interprit this film, it is an action sci-fi firstly, with an excellent storyline but in the two hours or so of running time if you read between the lines the film offers so many philosophical and religious undertones its frightening, I can watch this film many times and not get bored because you always pick up something new if you look close enough. I realised a few references in the film for instance Keanu Reeves as a messiah figure.

The script, aside from the undertones, is exceptional. The story is excellently drafted out and there are great twists. Also the Wachowski brothers direct the film with such style it is simply amazing. The film at times comes across like a manga cartoon and you can tell that these guys are fans of the Japanese cartoons when you see the lighting and angles etc that are used occasionally. They really have created a tense and eerie visual delight. The musical score also adds to the impressive visuals.

Of course the big selling point of the Matrix to most are the groundbreaking effects, from the creation of bullet time to the excellent wire work and computer generated effects such as the chilling scenes as Neo awakens in the real world. Despite all these technical flourishes that will drop jaws I did not feel that the special effects were the best thing of the movie. For me it was the way the story pans out and the pacing of the movie as well as the amazing cinematography that create a dark manga styled world.

The cast are all good, Keanu Reeves is a little on the stoic side but his character is suited to that trait, other than a slightly wooden exterior, Reeves is good through the whole movie and impresses in the stunning action sequences. Carrie Ann Moss is very good and very sexy, clad throughout most of the film in tight leather, she kicks rear with grace and beauty. Also good is an impressive Hugo Weaving and the show stealer, Larry Fishbourne as Morpheus.

To the action sequences now, and for action junkies these scenes will live long in the memory. The kung-fu fights are shot brilliantly and the choreography is some of the best non hong kong ever put to screen bar Drive. The four principal actors do the fights themselves despite not knowing any martial arts and the fights also include excellent back breaking stunts and wire work as well as some visual effects. For me though the best action sequence was the lobby shoot out which is one of the best gun fights ever to grace the big screen, the destructive brilliance of the scene was amazing as Reeves and Moss take out a group of security gaurds while rubble is flying through the air. The scene is definately a mild ode to master John Woo, who the Wachowskis are fans of. The end battle is not a let down either.

I would have to say that the film starts off really superbly, more as a tense thriller than action orientated, although there is still action. The atmosphere built up is tense and the film really draws you in. After Neo has met morpheous and goes to the real world, discovering what the Matrix is, the film kind of lost something for me, but still even then is a ten out of ten flick, and of course that is where the kung-fu and effects really kick in and the action builds up. I feel this film is so good that the sequels will be mild let downs especially with the direction the story must take after this films ending. Until the second film can be judged I will watch this when I feel like it and leave you by simply adding 10/10","5"
"coverme6","The real ""Phantom Menace"" killer","5 July 2000","""The Matrix"" is definitely a film of epic proportions. With

great, eye-popping special effects, splendidly cheographed gun

fights that would make John Woo blush, and larger-than-life

performances by the stars. When this movie first came out in mid

'99, ""Star Wars: the Phantom Menace"" was still wowing many

movie-goers. But ""The Matrix"" gave viewers a whole new ride, one

that made ""Star Wars"" look pitifully weak, and well.... DEAD!

Keanu Reeves is Thomas Anderson, AKA Neo, a mild-mannered

businessman/computer hacker, who is given the shock of his life

when he discovers that he is chosen by an elite team of

physically and mentally enhanced individuals, led by a

mysterious guru named Morpheus (played by the mystifying

Laurence Fishburne). This team shows Neo the world of the

Matrix, which is basically the real world, which our world is

basically false. Everything in the real world is in shambles

because of the fact that machines have taken order. Neo

reluctantly agrees to take part in rebelling against the

machines, battling against the agents, evil folks who mastered

the Matrix's powers who despise the rebels.

Other than the fact that the effects in this movie are dynamic,

the inspirations and philosophy behind ""The Matrix"" is also

compelling. This movie had borrowed many ideas and concepts from

other movies, such as ""Star Wars"" (the idea of using an inner

force within), ""The Terminator"" (the idea of man against

machine), ""Fight Club"" (breaking away from society), and ""Men in

Black"" (the wearing of Rayban sunglasses and the idea of joining

an elite cult and not going back to regular life).

""The Matrix"" is most probably the kind of movie that will become

a true landmark in the history of cinema; the kind that will be

a major influence to many other films to come, as did ""Star

Wars"" and ""The Terminator."" This movie practically won many

Oscar awards for effects and sound, I'm pretty surprised it

didn't win anything for performances. And what did ""The Phantom

Menace"" win? Practically nothing! Sorry, Mr. Lucas, sometimes

the competition can be EXTREMELY powerfull! ""","10"
"Marc_Israel_365","A goth-tinted adventure of man vs machine (appearing as man)","17 October 2009","Despite Keanu Reeves' incredible ability to utter the word ""whoa"" this film set the benchmark for altered reality screenplays and amazing special effects. The grainy green hue employed during scenes in the ""dream world"" only added to the mystique that The Brothers Wachowski wrote and directed. The plot is disguised but relatively simple from early on as we learn reality through the eyes of Neo (Reeves), setting up the clash of the superheroes. Led by Morpheus (Lawrence Fishburne) and Trinity(Carrie-Ann Moss) and their collective of real world misfits, can Neo save humankind from being harnessed like Eveready batteries? Is Neo ""the one""? Is The Matrix a societal analogy of today to be challenged or is ignorance bliss? With typical sci-fie explanations that dominate the plot, don't worry about thinking too much. Just enjoy the goth-tinted adventure","7"

"kdnor2011","I REALLY Liked this Movie","11 July 2010","I bought The Matrix out of just pure curiosity, I had heard that it was one of the best movies of all time in both effects and story. I thought, ""Yeah, it may be good, but the effects are probably outated and the story will be really hard to follow."" Not to mention, I had seen so many spoofs of this movie, especially the bullet time sequence so how could this movie live up to the ten years of hype.

Well, it did, this movie was not only a smart sci-fi film, it was also a hugely entertaining film as well.

It's not 100% original, OK, I get it, that's seems to be the only reason people dislike this movie.

But you know what, just because it isn't one hundred percent original doesn't mean it still can't be great. I loved the plot of this film, it wasn't overly confusing, it's was smart, but easy to follow. The effects are still amazing, I love the scene where he is being shot by Mr. Smith and doges the bullets. Now I know why everyone wants to parody it, because it looks freakin awesome. The characters are likable, and there's a feeling of suspense.

A lot of people hate the Matrix because it was called original. Well, no, The Matrix wasn't the most original movie of all time when it came out, and it sure isn't now, but it's still an amazing film.","7"
"Demon-14","Two words: O V E R - R A T E D!","14 April 2000","I watched this on HBO the other night on the recommendation of a couple of colleagues from work, and I had high hopes for an intelligent sci-fi treat. What I found, instead, was the usual mediocre acting and ""look-at-me"" special fx one finds in every other Hollywood ""blockbuster"". Nowhere near as good as it's reputation would have you believe (unless you're as gullible as everybody else who got sucked in by this one). Started out on a promising note, but it was all downhill from there. Keanu is lucky this did so well at the box-office. If it had tanked, the rest of his career would likely have been spent in direct-to-video ""b"" movie action extravaganzas. Scary thought, huh, Keanu? Whoah.","6"

"higherall7","Shadows and the Substance of Things to Come","20 March 2016","A perfect metaphor for Hollywood! Part of the Mass Indoctrination Machine that educates us to worship shadows and not to probe beyond the surfaces of what we see for the inner workings of it all. Now this is a film with meat on its bones both thematically and technically. What is not touched upon here? There is the interface between 'reality' and 'illusion', a very cinematic take on Plato's Allegory of the Cave, a consideration of reification versus abstraction aided by CGI imagery to nail down all the particulars.

Here you have the process that must be undergone to conquer every prejudice, every narrow-minded POV that precludes the unleashing of true potential and beingness. What must be renounced and destroyed in our illusionary constructs to seize upon a new and more salutary truth? What must be accepted and embraced to be newly constructed as the rebirth of Truth? We have in this film presented in a very entertaining way a means of exploring these concepts from a fresh perspective.

THE MATRIX is a perfect paradigm for the Computer and Information Age, where the energy of machines becomes a surrogate for passion and data itself is the substance of a Hell masquerading as Heaven. Keanu Reeves as the Computer Programmer/Computer Hacker Neo is a secret rebel against the Status Quo without realizing that what he is rebelling against is beyond even the range of his understanding. The legendary Morpheus comes into his life to pull his coat about what's really going on, but first must send him into the abyss of his own unreality turned inside out and back again.

Because of the limitations of Cinema, no plausible utopian worlds are postulated realistically; only the idea of a universe at constant war with itself involving citizens awake and citizens still slumbering. This is all very artfully and dramatically explored, with beleaguered humanity fighting in a wasteland to reclaim a vision that long ago was co-opted by their data spewing machines.

The beauty of THE MATRIX is that it fully rests on Cinema's strengths; its ability to create artifice and circus like magic tricks in a spellbinding way. It also serves up and reveals its primary weakness; its inability to pierce the skin of the apple and go to the core of experiences and ideas even when to all the world that appears to be precisely what it is doing.

There is not much more I can add about this ground breaking work, rooted as it is in this new cultural mileau of ever advancing data assimilation towards a global awareness of what it takes to run a planet or even a universe populated with slaves operating as the servo-mechanisms for those sentient entities forging their chains with the stuff that dreams are made of, but it looks good and it rides good and who knows but that it might somehow lead you to read a book and create your own abstractions to reify?","10"
"NoArrow","By far the best modern action movie...","5 July 2003","...and one of the best action movies of all time. ""The Matrix"" ranks up with ""Die Hard"" with its groundbreaking action and special effects. Most call this movie a 'sci-fi' action, but it's really not. 'Sci-fi' action usually involves futuristic weapons like lasers, or Star Wars' trademark lightsabers. Though ""The Matrix"" is a sci-fi movie, the action is pure, modern day gun-fighting/martial arts.

Yes, the action was terrific, but everyone knows that's not all that makes a movie. Things like plot and acting do too, and ""The Matrix"" never fails to disappoint with either. In fact, the worst performance in the movie comes from the protagonist, Keannu Reeves, and even he doesn't do too bad.

My personal favorite part of ""The Matrix"" is the villain: ""Agent Smith"", a simulation of a human in the fake world (or, ""matrix"") who is always after the good guys. Hugo Weaving plays Smith with the trademark slow, deep and intimidating voice, but his real talent is with his eyes. Hugo Weaving does something with those eyes that would creep anybody out and send goosebumps up there necks.

""The Matrix"" never disappoints you, and if you haven't seen it yet, you don't know what you're missing, 9/10.","7"

The impossible can be called the MATRIX but we cannot delve deep therein because the picture is a visual blast and with neural transmitters it becomes inspiring for young scholars like us.

"doctorklopek","Action movies are so cool","4 June 2000","Action movies are the neatest! And this one is probably the best of all! There was a lot of shooting and COOL camera stuff. The cool effects with the bullets were awesome, and the martial arts too. Hi-ya! And the sets were neato too. I think I'm in the Matrix right now; the movie was that convincing. I like that they didn't bother with character development at all because that would have wasted time. Some of my friends liked the philosophical side to this movie. I didn't really care for that though. They kind of threw together some eastern philosophy with a whole lot of Christian imagery and wallah! I don't know though - it seems like that may have been just a device to make the movie seem like more than it is... But how could they make this movie any more rad than it already is? What with all the action and all, and the fast music which helped keep my attention, and Keanu Reeves says ""woh."" That's a pretty good line because it's how we all feel sometimes.

"Cool-Lion14","The best movie of 1999","30 July 2018","I wasn't sure about this movie when it first came out, but I gave it a go and enjoyed it. The sequels came and went, but they didn't compare to the first. And this was one of the few Keanu Reeves movies I liked, along with Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure. But this was even better. We also get Laurence Fishburne and Carrie-Ann Moss along with Hugo Weaving as the villain (whom I first knew from Babe where he voiced Rex the dog). The special effects really blew me away and the cyberpunk themes really resonated. While The Matrix is not my absolute-favorite cyberpunk film (the original Tron is), it did well for what it set out to become. Do yourself a favor and watch this. Avoid the sequels. This was the crown jewel of the Wachowskis. Let's hope that Keanu Reeves returns for an even better Matrix film soon. I heard he said he'd like to come back on the condition that the Wachowskis will make them. Anyone for seconds?","9"
"jro0","mindless","6 March 2004","The Matrix is a horribly formulaic stew of standard pulp items (conspiracy theories, bands of gallant rebels, babes in tight black leather) with a light dusting of philosophical/religious concepts to make it all seem like serious, meaningful stuff. It is almost unnecessary to point out that none of the philosophical concepts plays any real role in the plot, which is basically just a sequence of action scenes enhanced by computer graphics. Its fans may talk about savior figures, but this is salvation lite, by means of gunfights and kung fu. A better bet is Scary Movie: you'll see the same action and maybe even have a chuckle or two, which is more than can be said for The Matrix.","9"

Welcome back to another edition of Adam's Reviews!! **queue intro music**

Happy New Year and why not start off with a bang!!

Have you ever had a dream that you were so sure was real? What if you couldn't awaken? What if you felt like the real world was a dream world? How would you know the difference between what is reality and what is a dream?

Tonight's movie flick is The Matrix (1999), starring the coolest of cool dudes Keanu Reeves who stars as computer hacker Thomas A. Anderson who later becomes Neo. This science fiction cyberpunk phenomenon film also stars the great Laurence Fishburne as Morpheus, Neo's mentor and guide, the awesome Carrie-Anne Moss as Trinity, the stranger who leads Neo into a forbidding underworld and Hugo Weaving as an extremely strong Sci-Fi villain as the cold, sociopathic AI Villain Agent Smith.

Writing a review of The Matrix is a very hard thing for me to do because this film means a lot to me, it will be always in my top 10 films of all time. So, I need to do the film justice by sharing my opinion or in this case writing a review on why this movie is so good. I watched this movie when it came out in 1999, I was in grade 6 and was wowed by the world the movie invited me along. The Matrix to me is one of the most visually stunning films I had ever seen in my life. The movie felt like I was reading a great comic book where I got to watch a transitional element of a character who was this desk slave suit and ended become a kickass messiah.

It wasn't until sometime later, after watching it numerous times and owning the movie on different platforms (DVD, Blu-Ray), I started to think about the film and recognized the philosophical and religious elements of the story. With every viewing I saw something I didn't see the previous time and soon understood the deeper meaning of the story.

The film draws on the Messiah myth, as Neo is a clear reference to Jesus with the analogy of his name Neo = one, which in the film is known as The One who is to enslave humans. Another hidden easter egg is when we meet first meet Neo a man calls him ""You're my Saviour man. My own personal Jesus Christ.""

Aside from the religious elements, the film also gets its inspiration from Plato's allegory of the Cave, where Plato explores the idea that the real world is an illusion and in The Matrix, it is human beings who live in an illusion and must free themselves from the world of appearances and return to free others.

The film also highlights the meaning behind the character The Oracle, which correlates with Socrates visiting the Oracle of Delphi where the Oracle provides cryptic messages and provides guidance to Socrates similar to how the Oracle in the movie provides guidance to Neo in particular showing him the Latin phrase Temet Nosce - Know Thyself. This relates how true wisdom lies in recognizing one's own ignorance.

Lewis Carroll's famous children's story Alice in Wonderland is referenced in the movie, the themes of questioning one's reality and identity, awakening from dreams and to have free thoughts. Neo serves as our Alice in the movies, following a referential white rabbit to discover a world beyond his own perceived reality. Both characters are insatiably curious, preferring a better world where there are no rules where anything is possible. Both come to reject the fantasy world, favouring reality, though through different means and thoughts. A key reference is the white rabbit tattoo which led Neo to Trinity and soon to Morpheus, who even refers to Alice in Wonderland when he gives Neo the choice between the red and blue pills: ""If you take the red pill, you stay in wonderland and I will show you how deep the rabbit hole goes.""

And lastly, we have Jean Baudrillard's essay, Simulacra and Simulations, the book in which Neo keeps to hide his illegal software discs early on in the film. The book argues how objects that look as if they represent something else but have really created the reality they seem to refer to, in this case the culture we live in may be distracting us from the reality that we are being exploited by someone. These representations are described as simulations or imitations of reality, for example the simulations in The Matrix.

Going back to the movie, the movie is about Thomas A. Anderson who is living two lives, an average computer programmer, a nobody and by a hacker known as Neo. Neo has always questioned his reality, but the truth is far beyond his imagination. Neo finds himself targeted by the police when he is contacted by Morpheus, a legendary computer hacker branded a terrorist by the government. The film unmasks the truth and depicts a dystopia future in which reality as perceived by most humans is actually a simulated reality called ""the Matrix"", created by sentient machines to subdue the human population, while their bodies' heat and electrical activity are used as an energy source. When Neo is unplugged from the lies, he is drawn into a rebellion against the machines.

This film has it all; great production sets similar to Blade Runner, you know dark and rainy. The best visual effects for example the interrogation scene between the agents and Mr Anderson's mouth and the sentinels. The awesome kung-fu and wire fu fight scenes; where Neo tells Morpheus ""I know Kung-Fu"" and soon fight in an absolute awesome fight sequence, the slow-motion ""bullet-time"" where we see Trinity doing her trade mark jumping into a high kick sequence in the beginning of the film, the gunfu sequence where Neo and Smith engage in a gun battle Western style, leather clothes, the topics around fate, choice, the story of love and lastly the late 90s metal and techno music, this includes Rage Against The Machine's song Wake Up.

The best acting to me is both Laurence Fishburne and Hugo Weaving, both serve as a mentor and an antagonist in their respective roles and watch the transformation of Reeve's character Neo. Morpheus philosophical and hopefulness quotes hit the spot. With Weaving's performance, it is really something to watch him act as a sociopathic AI who can relate to some human traits like anger, sense of dread and hate. You can also see the correlation of Smith's character to Neo's (or as he was called earlier on Mr Anderson) work manager who has an issue like Smith of anyone who has an issue with structure and authority.

Overall 10/10 - a great movie and definitely in my top 10 of all time.","8"

He is dropped, cold and naked into a underground lake with no town and people in sight. Everything is of machines.

He is picked up by a hovercraft and slips out of conscious. He awakens to find himself aboard Morpheus' ship and learns that a war is raging between the humans and the machines in the real world. The world Neo is from is an illusion, not real. Now Neo is the last hope for the people as he is the Chosen One against the corrupt machines and a agent of the machines called Agent Smith (Hugo Weaving).

The Matrix is the best Sci-Fi film since the 1st Star Wars Film (1977) and does not disappoint at any level. The story is deep, complex and overall ingenious the way it is crafted. The dark, cold world, under the control of the machines is haunting and dark. The acting is near perfect, Reeves is tough and naive in his training. Fishbourne is perfect as the mentor of the troubled Chosen One. The film begins a story for what the life of Christ is like and is simply explained in the second and third film. The Wachowski brothers have made a classic sci-fi that will not be forgotten, at least for its special effects.

The Matrix. Starring: Keuna Reeves, Carrie-Anne Moss, Laurence Fishbourne, Hugo Weaving, and Joe Pantoliano.

"patches89","FREE YOUR MIND!!","22 April 2021","The Matrix at its time of release was one of the most hyped up films ever and even over 20 years since its still beloved by the movie public. The first time I saw it I absolutely didnt get on with it but as time has gone on and the more I understood what they were doing I have grown to love it, albeit its a bit overrated. Mopheus (Laurence Fishburne) and Trinity (Carrie-Ann Moss) track down Neo (Keanu Reeves) before Agent Smith (Hugo Weaving) gets to him and unplugs his mind to join the fight against the Matrix. It was a film that changed the way sci-fi stories were told and paved the way forward.","9"
"Puroo","Best in class","20 June 2021","It is a no brainer that The Matrix is one of the most popular action movies in the world to this date, even though it was released a month before I was born. The movie is something of a pop culture icon. All the ideas that it spawned are being explored upon today with little to no success (I will talk about all those ideas in detail ahead). I had heard a lot about it so I decided to give it a watch on Prime Video along with its sequels. This movie is phenomenal. The sequels, well, I'll write about them in their reviews. This one is only going to be about the OG movie.

The Matrix asks a question that is being pondered about by 14 year olds to this date - what if the world we live in is just a simulation, and that there was some way to break out of it? Once out of the world, we can go back into it whenever we want, and we can learn everything we possibly can by the use of external storages and practices. The story follows Neo, a hacker who manages to break out of this simulation that we call life and lives outside the Matrix. He was extracted by Morpheus who had given him an option whether he wanted to take the red pill or the blue pill.

Another thing The Matrix is famous for is the action. The heroes - Neo, Trinity, Morpheus and Cypher have learnt all kinds of martial arts, have superpowers and can ask their Nebuchadnezzar programmers to spawn weapons or situations for them. Depending on those they are able to choose how to fight Agent Smith's men, who are something of an equal match for them. There are martial arts fights, gunfights and the iconic bullet dodge scene. The action is the selling point of these movies. And the movie offers them even better than what everyone else explains them to be.

The Matrix is one of, if not my favourite non-superhero action movie. I like its sequel also, but since it's a two part series alongside Revolutions, it's not as good. So I'd recommend you should only watch this one. Skip the other two. This is one of the most iconic action movies ever created and will continue to live on the hype unless someone outdoes them which is actually very difficult. Because it's not common for action movies to have futuristic imagination of action and philosophy at the same time.","5"
"nickmesafilms","The Matrix (1999) - Do You Want the Red Pill or the Blue Pill?","11 January 2012","Written and directed by the Wachowski Brothers, ""The Matrix"" is a high-tech, edge-of-your-seat, heart-pounding sci-fi action thriller, that will make you want to see it the second time to understand what the heck is going on. The film talks about a future like no other, so technologically advanced that we don't know if it's real or not. Everyone is in the middle of a simulated reality to subdue the human population. A computer hacker, under the name of ""Neo"", portrayed by Keanu Reeves, is drawn into this rebellion, and fight off against the machines. I'm obviously a fan of big sci-fi action thrillers that make you pay attention throughout. This movie is one of the best examples. The casting is golden, from Keanu Reeves' performance that left his signature as an actor, to Lawrence Fishburne as the mysterious leader of the Matrix, Morpheus. Hugo Weaving and Carrie-Annie Moss round up the supporting cast, and they perform just fine. But, my favorite thing about this movie, was all the incredible technological advantages that were added. This movie is filled with groundbreaking editing, fast-paced cinematography, astounding sound effects, and the jaw-dropping visual effects that are still memorable to this day. That slow-motion gun bullet scene is still quite memorable, you know! From the sharp well-written script, the incredible acting, the groundbreaking visual effects, to the smart directing of the Wachowskis, ""The Matrix"" is truly a favorite for all cinema lovers. It's a fun, non-stop, and exciting motion picture that will take away the 136-minute run time quickly. No wonder movies always go ""copy-cat"" on this movie! ""The Matrix"", in my review, ""a non-stop exciting motion picture, with groundbreaking visuals"".","9"

The Matrix I thought was a little weird but very interesting! The Matrix is about a guy named Neo who is a computer-hacker who gets chosen by a group of rebellious freedom fighters led by Morpheus (Laurence Fishburne) who wants Neo to help him and the Freedom Fighters battle the machines to overthrow them and save the Earth from technology disaster! What I thought was weird was the part when Neo was with those agent bad guys his mouth grows shut.

I thought to myself how do all these people in this movie know exactly every next move that the enemy is pulling on the good guys? Part favorite part was when Neo and Trinity (Carie-Ann Moss) were on the roof battle scene and one of the bad guys is shooting Neo and it shows in slow-motion how Neo is dodging all those bullets without even a scratch on him! Can you believe that? I know I can. But this was just the beginning with Neo and the Freedom Fighters! But that is the sequel and then the sequel after that. I thought it was just cool on how they really made this movie!

"NestorTheGreat","Watch, Awe, Amaze, Rinse and Repeat","20 December 2021","If you haven't seen this showcase of awesomeness, you've seen it spoofed, copied and referenced in anything else you've seen! And if you seriously haven't seen it, do yourself a favour and push yourself to watch it! You'll never regret it!

AI has taken over life as we know it, and only a select few can see behind the curtains and may the force be with them against the Agents! Reading code has never been as valuable as the rebels' use of it in the matrix.

So, what is the matrix? I still don't know and don't really care! Bullet-time filming drained all the awe from me and all my curiosity about the film's name has evaporated! It's a program, maybe. But maybe it's what we believe is real, however fake or full of special effects it is!? Who cares!

Keanu's deadpan look has never been put to better use! He fills the shoes of Neo (anagram of one) perfectly, and then some! Morpheus, Trinity, Switch, Mouse, Tank and Dozer complete the good who are tasked to fight the bad, represented by bland men in black known as Agents.

This first of the trilogy, that is soon to become a foursome, is like an origin story. We follow Neo's awakening, training and heroism throughout the matrix and the non-matrix worlds as more layers of the story are revealed.

AI is as real today as it was in this film, and if you're not worried about what an AI world would look like, you're not paying attention! Let's just hope a real Neo is out there in this matrix of ours!!

Add kung-fu off the walls, gravity-defying stunts and a great amount of comedic relief and it's a hard film to beat! Watch it before it turns into a documentary!!!","9"
"Adriane","This is what action movies should be","16 June 2000","All competitors have met their match with this movie. I agree with other comments when they say that this movie sets the tone for sci-fi/action films in the next few years. I had my mother watch it and we both agree on one thing: take away the action, and when you are left with the dialogue only, it is a sad movie. Are we just a spreading virus? The dialogue makes you think about the world you live in. Watch the movie, and reflect on your life. It is highly enjoyable. One of the best of 1999.","1"
"hawthorn-2","A good video game commercial disguised as a terrible movie","14 April 1999","I'm not sure why so many people were so impressed by this movie. Story? Perhaps if you've never thought about realistic virtual reality, or dreamed you were a butterfly and wondered if you were a butterfly dreaming you were a man. Then you might be blinded to the huge plot holes. But the script will fit wonderfully to its obvious destination: a video game surely on its way to stores right now.

Perhaps the action sequences, if you're the type who likes violence video games so much you'd be happy to sit and watch someone else play one... over and over and over. The camera tricks and effects were interesting once, but we've all seen them on TV already -- the commercial, in fact, is better than the movie.

Certainly it wasn't the characters. Only Morpheus had any kind of personality, which saved us from having to find out what the other actors might have been like if they'd been called on to act. Keanu got two scenes that required acting (the kiss of life, and the epiphany), but he missed on both and just laid or stood there. The rest of the movie, Neo was called The One, but he might have been The Zero -- other than a token reference to him having the trouble with authority figures all action heros are required by Hollywood Law to have (subtlely portrayed by having someone tell him ""you have trouble with authority figures, don't you?"") he had no character, making Keanu a great fit for him.

"zeekwunlau","Life choices in the Matrix","19 April 2020","For 1999, such a movie is undoubtedly extremely avant-garde. Even if it is put into the present, it is a masterpiece that is impeccable in content and shooting style.

The thing that strikes me the most is actually their clothes. The theme of hacking, sunglasses and reflective leather jackets give people a shock from the inside out. It is completely beyond my knowledge. There are only three words_too much. The image of the man in black is the first in the era. As long as these three words are mentioned, my mind will automatically emerge.

Back to topic life choice.

This is a very important point for me, let me understand why Thoreau said that the pursuit of truth is painful and happy. There is a character in the Matrix (I forgot the name). He lives every day after being chased by the enemy. He can't find the direction. He can't see the so-called real hope. So he decided to compromise with that virtual world, and with things that at least he could hear and feel and enjoy. He would rather give in than live too tired ...

I think this is the same as our current situation. We know what happiness is most satisfying for us, but moths surrender voluntarily at the feet of those short-lived happiness. We clearly know what is the best, but we can't stand loneliness and loneliness, and the mentality of holding a broken jar is completely sinking. If you do n't have a firm heart and blindly follow your most current desires, then your life may be very happy, but there are very few things that can be recalled before you die.

Is that really happy? We need to ask ourselves.

Is this enough?

Are we here to enjoy it?

Clearly knowing that the juicy perception is false, why should we choose that fake beef?

can not be like this.

This is the reason for delayed happiness.

What is happiness? Probably the pursuit of truth, the pursuit of refinement.","3"
"cinemapersonified","Great Movie","9 July 2023","Rating: 9.1 Overall, a groundbreaking movie for the time as the good writing and direction coupled with the technical elements really helped propel this movie into mainstream pop-culture, though it does suffer from issues of it being the first part of a trilogy as well as feeling dated at times.

Very Good Direction (Really builds the world well and progresses the story forward in a unique way, gets the most out of their actors in most of the scenes, and choreographs the fight sequences very well (coupled with their use of Visual Effects to pull it off)), Pretty Good Acting (Pretty Bad to Decent from Keanu Reeves (Does a pretty good job in the action sequences and really plays off The Chosen One role well, but is pretty bad when it comes to the dramatic elements as he barely shows any emotion and hits a ceiling in where he can go dramatically), Good to Very Good from Laurence Fishburne (Pulls of the mysterious part of the character very well and really helps guide the story forward in making the audience believe in his cause; also, the teaching scenes with Neo really showcase his talent as he embodies the role of Morpheus very well), Pretty Good to Good from Carrie-Anne Moss (Plays the female lead well and holds her own in the fight sequences as she works well with Neo, kinda falters a bit when it comes to being the love interest), Good from Hugo Weaving (Plays the Android/Sentient-AI role very well as he does not have emotion throughout the movie and acts more like a machine than a human), Good from Joe Pantoliano (Plays the comedic relief character well and shows the most dimensions in the cast), Decent to Pretty Good from the rest of the cast), Great to Incredible Story (Really a unique story on 'AI is taking over' trope as the directors build a world filled with many idiosyncrasies; the character writing is also great as they create characters that are really interesting and installed into pop culture now; the story is a bit stretched out in terms of plot construction (mainly because this was one of three parts and acts as such)), Very Good Screenplay (The dialogue was well written for a Sci-Fi movie, the symbolism was pretty present throughout the movie as the film in itself is a metaphor in the relationship between humanity and technology (coupled with what it means to be alive), the foreshadowing was pretty good as it helps set up the importance of Neo), Good Score (fit well into the movie), Great Cinematography (Helped with establishing the uniqueness of the fight scenes), Very Good Sound (Especially in the fight scenes), Great Editing (Though is kinda dated), Incredible Visual Effects (Very Groundbreaking for the time as it was a key element in making the fight scenes and helping propel this movie into pop culture (though it is a bit dated now)), Good Production Design, Good Costumes (Especially the trench coats (though this did have a bad influence on society)), Plot Structure was the biggest issue for the movie as it really set up as if it is the first movie of three parts (so the exposition and rising action are a lot longer than they should be, with the ending kinda feeling rushed and not really having any closure); this is not necessarily a bad thing but does have an impact on how this movie is viewed, Pacing was a bit on the slower side as the movie is more about building the world and the ideas rather than having the characters fight the conflict (so no time really needs to be added), Climax was the best part of the movie as the audience really gets to see the true power of Neo that is helped by the use of groundbreaking cinematography and visual effects, Tone was very sci-fi esque with a late 90s twist (with the latter kinda hurting the movie cause it makes it feel a bit dated)","10"

"Eternality","The Matrix is one of the best sci-fi films to come out in the 1990s, bringing instant gratification to viewers and critics alike.","14 August 2010","This groundbreaking film is all about style. Laden with astonishing visual and sound effects, it became an instant hit worldwide. While the plot may be on the complex side, this film scores in the area of entertainment. It is a dark film, toying with the idea that humans are like batteries, acting as slaves to fuel power for the 'machines'. No one has ever developed a concept so abstract at first thought, only to surprise people with the ingenuity of it.

The Matrix is technically impressive, bagging four Oscars. There are moments of great editing, e.g. the 'rushy and tense' sequence at the end of the film when Neo (Keanu Reeves) is running away from the agents. You could almost feel yourself shouting for Neo to run faster. Though the soundtrack gets way too 'pop' at times, it is still effective, especially the instrumentals. The signature sound of the trumpet and horns blowing coupling to the slow-motion bullet time sequences are the hallmarks of the Matrix.

Acting is sub-standard though, but the script demands little expressiveness from the cast. The Matrix is one of the best sci-fi films to come out in the 1990s, bringing instant gratification to viewers and critics alike. The Wachowski Brothers have given the world something to talk about for years, both in terms of the Matrix concept, as well as the technical brilliance in exhibition. Strongly recommended.

"ronfish","Laurence Fishburne can tell you","28 January 2000","THE MATRIX is overrated quite a lot, I think. Visually strong the movie really cannot stun me with such a poor story line. The real contents seem to be: impressing the viewer be revealing new facts about the amazing Matrix-world. But after having caught in which way the Matrix works it is just boring seeing Laurence Fishburne explaining and explaining what has already been explained. His never ending monologues nearly ruin the whole movie. It is not that interesting hearing ´´it is like this´´ and ´´it works like that´´ for half an hour. The rating of 8.4 points in the IMDB is too high, I think. I rated the Matrix 6 points.","10"
"crothman","Boring cliched coming-of-age film with great special effects","10 September 2001","I hadn't really expected a lot, but I was amazed at just how dull this film was. The effects are, quite rightly, considered great and are obviously influential in many ways. But other than a couple of action sequences at the beginning and end, you have nothing but dull lectures. Lawrence Fishburne is too good an actor to play a second-rate Yoda like this and the ""philosophy"" was the type of thing you outgrow in 10th grade (""How do we REALLY know reality?"") presented in an ultraserious tone that makes the claptrap seem important. This type of thing has been done before and better, and the various plot holes and inconsistancies were just a sign of sloppy storytelling. The villains were quite probably the least interesting in the history of film, with tiresome mannerisms that made you want to go out and slap the director. And the cliches! Villains in suits and black sunglasses! A traitor in the heros' midst! Man redeemed due to love a woman! Can anyone really call these original?

The effects cannot be faulted, and there were a couple of good action sequences, but the film was poorly written and just plain dull. More action would have been better, or anything to spare the audience the puerile philosophizing.

Certainly one of the most overrated films of the decade.","10"

"macpherr","The issue is whether or not there is a Messianic message beneath the surface?","13 April 2000","Some people believe that there is a Messianic message in this movie because of the fight between Matrix's campaign of domination in the ""real"" world and ""Thomas A. Anderson / Neo,"" Keanu Reeves (A Walk in the Clouds, Much Ado About Nothing) the man who is to save the world. He joins warriors ""Morpheus "" Laurence Fishburne (Searching for Bobby Fischer), and ""Trinity"" Carrie Ann Moss (Lethal Tender) in their warfare against the Matrix.

Neo does die and comes back to life and at one point he believes that ""He is the One"" to save the world. If that was the intent of the writer, the message is not clear as far as I am concerned. There are Messianic elements in many of the super-heros such as Superman, with his powerful vision, Batman who fights the evil and forces of darkness of Gotham City and I just think that Neo is another super-hero with some type of god like' characteristics. To characterize the movie as a Christian movie is really stretching it. There is an element of deception such as the woman in red, is she real or is she a deceiver? There is deception in Batman when all the enemies come wearing a camouflage such as Mr. Freeze, The Riddler, etc. I believe that there is an element of deception or even mistaken identity, if you will, in many movies. I really enjoyed the movie for its special effects and so did the members of the Academy of Motion Pictures as the movie won an Oscar for Special Effects among many other Oscars. I am not much into science fiction but I bought the tape because it was recommended by a bunch of Christian friends. The movie is fine, but I found that the movies such as ""The Sixth Sense"" also have a religious side to them as the boy seeks peace and shelter in a church. There is definitely a struggle between good and evil, but everyone is dead already. In ""The Sixth Sense"" nobody gets that there is no big mystery about the movie except that they are all dead and are talking. Does the dead talk? The Bible indicates that they do. Look at Lazarus. And that was the catch, in The Matrix, that many are led to believe: whether or not there is a Messianic message beneath the surface. Perhaps, there is, but I do not see that as a Christian movie, just a science-fiction movie which you can analyze anyway you want to. I had a hard time identifying scenes that were thoughts and scenes that were part of the ""realm of reality in the movie."" Anyway, I thought that The Truman Show had a big element of the ""eternal"" versus the ""temporary"" in the realm of reality. Favorite Scenes: Trinity jumping from one building to another. Obviously no human can do that without some type of super power. But I don't think that it would be fair to compare her to the Trinity known by Christians. Favorite Quotes: Trinity: "" You're looking for him. I know because I was once looking for the same thing. And when he found me, he told me I wasn't really looking for him. I was looking for an answer. It's the question that drives us. It's the question that brought you here."" Morpheus:"" I'm trying to free your mind, Neo. But I can only show you the door. You're the one that has to walk through it."" This type language sounds really Messianic. I guess one could watch the movie from that perspective. Perhaps it should be fun to have a discussion on the topic of the Christian message in ""The Matrix."" We will have to wait until the sequel to see if that was indeed a much larger Messianic side to the story. I am not sure! Just watch and make your own analysis now and of any future Matrix. Actually I could argue both sides of the issue.","10"

"emryse","Boring to Begin with but Picks Up Halfway","6 August 2021","For the first half of this film I was incredibly bemused at why it was so popular, the story mainly consisted of techno babble, the villains were a bunch of faceless, emotionless ""men"" and robots and the plot felt cheesy, however upon reaching the halfway point my boredom slowly subsided and an over the top action film revealed itself. I enjoyed the last half of the film filled with explosions, guns and intense action galore but I still don't quite understand why it remains so revered. My theory is the impressive technical effects and CGI which at the time were ground-breaking contributes massively to this and while they are still impressive today they're hidden beneath layers of mumbo jumbo and dumb sci-fi nonsense. Matrix is still an okay watch but if you're looking for an older sci-fi film you'd be better off with Star Wars.","8"
"nicolechan916","Intricate story with great action and effects.","12 April 2015","This is honestly my first time watching this film, unless I saw it when I was really young in which case I don't remember anything about it. It's very interesting to note that the definition of 'the matrix' from the film has nothing to do with the bending of the back into that limbo position, and yet it has become known as that in the world. Even to people who have never really seen the film (like me), still refer to that action as matrix.

I actually really like this film, I don't know if I love it, but I definitely will watch the sequels and probably even need to watch this one again soon. The reason being that I did not totally understand what was going on in respect to the transition between worlds, until my friend clarified it for me and it made so much more sense after. However, I didn't realize I hadn't understood until I talked about it, as the film really engages you with its actions, effects, dialogue - basically everything. There is so much going on in the film at one time, that even if you do not fully understand what is happening, you are invested in that moment there and then.

The acting was good too, though the speech did feel a little dry at times. Hugo Weaving portrays the villain character very well and his expressions speak volumes. Keanu Reeves, Laurence Fishburne and Carrie-Anne Moss are also very badass in this, I like it! Though I do have to comment on the fact that Trinity is the only prominent female character in this and she is reduced to emotion, once again promoting the male = active, female = passive, binaries.

Speaking of badass, the action scenes were really on point. It was very fast-paced and has that glitch feel to it which emphasizes the concept of the world. It does feel odd sometimes and I know this is part of the concept, but I really hate (can't stand it ever) when there is flying involved in fights. I just cannot deal.

The effects were phenomenal, and seems really progressive of its time. I mean this was before the turn of the century, and yet we are still getting movies with not so great visual effects today.

Also, it is great how the film covers almost all aspects of life: action, romance, friendships, violence, society, digital age and whatnot. I've read reviews that attribute philosophical and religious meanings to this, but I personally prefer not to go along those lines. A really great film, and I can't help but wonder if Inception was influenced by this. The Wachowski Brothers really have a trademark in the stories they tell; I was not surprised when I found out they directed Cloud Atlas as well, it has a similar style to The Matrix. Plus they even created V for Vendetta, one of my favourites, but they didn't direct it which shows because it doesn't really have their style in it.

"MovieAlien","Stupidity reigns in this movie, not computers.","9 October 1999","If you're looking forward to seeing this movie and have not seen it yet, rest assured that you're looking forward to seeing a direct to video corny B-sci-fi film with lousy actors and weak script. Some personalities may have received top billing in this, but they still delivered lousy performances.

The film is a mixture of a lot movies. (Dark City, 12 Monkeys, The Terminator, Strange Days, Johnny Mnemonic, The Lawnmower Man...just to name a few) but the cliches is not what sinks this so. It's the screenplay, which makes all the actors so constipated and robotic that it's unintentionally laughable. So much hype surrounding the movie is a shocker. I know, it's the reason why everyone loved the ""The English Patient"" and ""Titanic"": The imagery. There was obviously a lot of work put into the storyboard, but good visuals does not make a good movie. A lot of pretentious art house fanatics think so, and if you speak up about it (like what I'm doing) they insult you and say you just ""didn't understand it."" Sorry, I'm afraid it's the other way AROUND.

What was supposed to count as special effects? Slow motion bullets flying in the air? People freezing when they're about to do a karate kick? If that makes a movie great (despite a jello written script and cardboard performances) then the IMDb Top 250 List has new standards and the I.Q. of the Hollywood movie-going public has made a gigantic plurge like the 1929 Stock Market crash.

Empty plot stolen from assorted sci-fi novels and works of eastern philosophy, weak unimpressive acting from keanu reeves. This movie is nothing more than a special-effects showcase. The only light in the mire that is this picture comes in the form of Laurance Fishburne, who brings his character devotion and life that is not present in anyone else in the film.","9"
"mmt02","good effects, good idea...bad execution","6 April 1999","This movie would be good if the director kept the special effects and then fired all the actors and rewrote the script. The idea of The Matrix is amazing. When I realized what the Matrix was, I was interested. Unfortunately, the script didn't allow me to care enough about the rest of the narrative. If the characters were less cartoon-like and I was made to feel any sympathy towards them, maybe the film would work. Go see The Matrix for the special effects but don't pay attention to the narrative, or you will be disappointed. (3 out of 10)","7"
"akash_sebastian","An Incredible and Revolutionary Sci-Fi Thriller; An Exceptional Addition to the Cyberpunk Genre.","10 August 2014","After their remarkable debut movie 'Bound' in 1996, the Wachowski Siblings come up with their incredible and revolutionary sci-fi thriller 'The Matrix'. These siblings always know how to enthrall both the mind and the heart. With such a brilliant concept, spectacular and innovative action sequences, and a gripping story, they keep you hooked and in awe throughout the movie. The characters, the dialogues and the scenes have become legendary now. No matter how many times you watch it, it thrills you every single time.

The movie can be seen as a stand-alone one or the first part of the trilogy; no matter how you watch it, it's simply brilliant. It is a metaphor and allegory for so many things. Mainly, it tries to tell how our urban lives are so commercialized and media-driven that we're almost blinded by it. The film blurs the lines between fate and reality; ultimately, it depends on us as to how we take our life forward. A life of ignorance or a life based on knowledge - though happiness/satisfaction is possible either way, only one of them can keep a particular person happy; sometimes, it's our choice what we choose to go forward with, and we should have the strength to go forward with the choice we've made.

An average living-day-to-day guy waking up one day to find himself to be different, important, and many people depending on him - Who hasn't had that dream? This would be one of the most full-fledged and elaborate execution of that fantasy.

Bill Pope's cinematography and Zach Staenberg's editing make the action sequences seem out of this world (pun intended); it takes you to a completely different level of cinematic action. I remember, when I first saw the movie (back in 2000 or something), I was completely blown away.

Keanu Reeves is perfect for the role of Neo, and he slides in perfectly into the character of the young naive programmer trying to understand and grasp the limits (or should I say, no limits) of the new reality presented before him. Carrie-Anne Moss, Laurence Fishburne, and Hugo Weaving perform commendably, and form outstanding and memorable supporting characters of Trinity, Morpheus and Agent Smith respectively. Each one of them has their own unique part to play.

From the prophecy of 'The One' to self doubt, there are many Christian references in the film, and there are influences from other religions as well. Influence doesn't matter, as long as it leads to the creation of something unique and exceptional. Japanese anime and Asian martial arts films had great influence on the Wachowski Siblings, but it was Mamoru Oshii's 1995 animated film 'Ghost in the Shell' that pushed them to delve into the cyberpunk genre. And as we all know it now, the result was one-of-a-kind.","10"
"cinephile-27690","I don't feel the hype.","16 May 2019","For this review, I'm not going to give the plot or anything like that. I'd rather just tell you why, as much as I enjoyed it, I don't recommend this.

I bought The Matrix on VHS in 12th grade to see it since my cousin suggested it and it's in the book 1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die, a dare I am trying to accomplish.

Visually, this movie is astonishing. A fun fact I heard was that the movie was filmed to look like you were viewing it on a computer, which I could kind of see. The acting's fine, the stunts are cool, aspects like that are good or at least decent. However, I often found the story to be a bore.

At the point I saw it, I found may live action movies to be uninteresting and mainly stuck to animated movies. I was breaking out of it, so I just thought: see it for what it is. Find what you like about this. You can't watch animated movies forever!

Even with that mindset, I couldn't like The Matrix. 1999 had better movies to offer: American Beauty, The Green Mile, Magnolia, Toy Story 2, Tarzan, The Blair Witch Project, Office Space, etc. Heck, I'll throw Larry Boy and the Rumor Weed in there!

If you enjoy The Matrix, good for you. But it wasn't for me and I can't recommend to others.

1. The acting was atrocious! Keanu, YOU'RE NOT IN BILL AND TED'S EXCELLENT ADVENTURE ANYMORE! SNAP OUT OF IT! Fishburne was a robot, and carrie-anne moss was terrible! 2. The storyline was not very impressive...it was just a little from Invasion of the Body Snatchers, a little from Planet of the Apes, and a little from every cheap B sci-fi flick ever made! 3. Where were the impressive special effects the trailers were promising? What, the slo-mo bullets? Nothing that hasn't been done a million times by John Woo! 4. That karate sequence between Reeves and Fishburne - how cheesy was that?

"Mr Parker","""Mr. Anderson...""","19 August 2002","You know you've found a special movie when you enjoy it more and more every time you watch it. The Matrix requires multiple viewings. Not to say that it isn't an amazing experience the first time around. It's just that watching it only once robs you of the complete experience. There is so much to this movie that it goes well beyond what any single user comment can provide. The special effects are incredible, the acting is satisfactory on all counts, there are some incredible action sequences (my personal favorite being the helicopter scene) and the story is great, while not entirely original. That's not an insult because these days you really can't make a movie without being influenced by one or several others. This movie was painted with shades of the Terminator, Ghost in the Shell, Hard Boiled and several others and it shows. This movie definitely deserves a place as one of the modern classics of cinema. It's one of the few films that actually succeeds in creating a living, breathing world. It's not too hard to imagine what else can be going on in the world of the Matrix other than what you see. There are so many options, so many exciting possibilities that the anticipation of waiting for the next two sequels makes you want to drag claw marks into the face of the person sitting next to you. At the time of this writing, I am patiently awaiting the sequels, hoping against the history of bad sequels to great movies that Hollywood can't seem to shake without a few exceptions. It's a big bar they've raised for themselves and you've gotta ask if the magic they've captured with the first one is still present enough to last through a trilogy. Let's hope so.

"Jerique","The Matrix Has You! - The Review","8 January 2008","In the dusk of the millennium, The Matrix was released to screens worldwide, dazzling audiences around with it's kung-fu martial arts, rapid-fast punches, impossible leaps, intense story and gripping heroes and villains.

Keanu Reeves plays the protagonist Thomas A Anderson, a program writer for a software company, who also lives a double life hacking as ""Neo"" while he searches for a man named Morpheus (Lawrence Fishburne). Carrie-Anne Moss plays Trinity, a gravity-avoiding woman who has so much skill and precision who make anyone think she is a guy. You throw in the rest of the cast and you've got a pretty good crew of resistance against the machines.

It sorta plays off as a Terminator-esquire type movie doesn't it? With fictitious Neo as the Connor -prophetic, we will win because of him- character. Even with that, I enjoy The Matrix for everything that it is. It's a science-fiction action movie with tons of laughs and heart-felt moments. I especially like the effects that were never used before.

Actors that do the kungfu moves are actually doing the moves and not using stunt doubles. I hate when an actor is ""believed"" to be doing the moves and they don't even know how even ""pretend"" to know the moves. People will give grief for the romance subplot, but it's really not a subplot since it's hinted at during the entire movie, it's just that until the end, Trinity couldn't speak about it because she was afraid.

I love how complex the plot gets near the end and I love the story itself because it makes you question yourself, the world, and wonder really - am I a program? It's one of the -- if not the -- greatest films ever created and that's something to say because it's science fiction fantasy. I am not alone in that statement, considering it won 4 Oscars, one in the category of special/visual effects. If you hate it, I'd really like to know why.","9"

If they were shot by different persons, with different cast, etc. it could have been neglected. Alas, the same persons are doing it in. That is why ""The Lawnmower Man"" is better and deserves a definite 10 out of 10.

If you want to see how a brilliant movie can be destroyed by clumsy sequels - this is a sheer example.

As to the movie itself, it is properly done and is captivating. In ""The Matrix"" everything is slick...

"kingofdanerds","Near perfect, so not the masterpiece that alot make it out to be","20 July 2021","No action movie has been celebrated than The Matrix. The Matrix was released in 1999 and was a HUGE deal upon release. The critical reception for this film was huge and even today is often considered to be one of the best sci-fi action films of all time. Not only was the film a critical success, the film was also a financial success. So much so that sequels were made. The film was directed by the Wachowski's (Bound) and stars Keanu Reeves (Speed) and Laurence Fishburne (The Matrix sequels).

Neo (Keanu Reeves) is a hacker. Yet, the world he is living in is not what it seems. That's because the world he lives in is the Matrix which is a big computer program and the real world is Earth but destroyed and run by robots and humans are grown. Upon realizing this, Morpheus (Laurence Fishburne) says that Neo is the one to save humanity.

The Matrix, let's just say, is overrated. It is still a good film but not really the masterpiece that people tout it as. Now while the overall premise of the mesiah or the one and the premise of a fake reality has been done to death, The Matrix tells this story with a unique presentation. The atmosphere and world building are truly phenomenal. Very stylish. The film has some unique ideas and uses great metaphors and is symbolic and what not. The first half of the film is mostly talking. Which, in here, is not so bad. I am genuinely interested but at times it gets too philosophical for my tastes. But yet the ideas are interesting. For me, I was going along the ride with Neo. He had no idea what the Matrix was and I had no idea either. So I was able to learn along with the character. The characters all around, with the exception of Morpheus, are not too interesting but one could make a valid point and say that the characters have computer-like personalities which makes sense here considering that humans are grown by computers in this film. The same can be said with the acting as well. So it all makes sense. The second half of the film is full blown action with shootouts and fighting that is really good even if the effects at times seem really dated. Looking back, there are also some plot holes but it does not bother me too much. Just let the people tell their story!

A perfect film would warrant a perfect score. The Matrix is a good film but not perfect.","6"
"The_Core","What a lot of people miss...","4 February 2001","Dear Matrix Viewer,

With every highly successful film (especially a film involving the Academy Awards(tm)), there is a backlash some time after release. There are several reasons for this backlash, one being that people generally don't like what they perceive to be ""too much success,"" whatever that may be for a person. Some people seem to feel personally diminished when they witness a great success -- or they compare a film to a personal favorite, rather than viewing it 'in isolation' -- for what it is AS IS, not for what it's judged against.

Another reason is that many don't realize a film is *more than the sum of its parts*. When a movie is first released, this fact is generally recognized, and a movie is enjoyed as a whole. Later, people tend to pick the film apart, viewing it as *the sum of its parts*, and concluding that because of the perceived faults in various parts, the movie itself can't be so great. The sense of a film as *the whole banana* gets lost when people pick it apart.

Yet another is that people generally get tired of hype. Many are bothered by commercial hype, and feel that when individuals hype (enjoy/love) a movie, some sort of unforgivable sin has been committed.

The psychology of a successful film could fill a book. Notice how well ""Titanic"" was received when it appeared on the big screen -- people were seeing it then as a movie, a whole -- and AS a whole, it's a great film. Later, people saw it as the sum of many different scenes, and so it seemed like a poor film. It's just too easy to lose the ability to watch a movie AS a movie after it's been around for awhile, and people pick and pick at it, until even the greatest film can appears flawed and generally worthless.

Anyway, if you understand some of the psychology behind how films are seen by people due to various factors, it all starts to make sense. And (perhaps unfortunately) it gets to be quite dull watching the (at first) intelligent comments on a forum like IMDB turn to black and white -- either it's ""the greatest movie ever made"" or it's a piece of... well, you get the idea.

THINK, people. And please, try to see how the effects of *time* upon a motion picture operate. Why a film that was initially perceived as a stunning achievement by both the public and the critics can later be viewed by many as ""lousy,"" or alternately become canonized in people's minds as ""the greatest movie of all time.""

I still rate The Matrix 10/10. I still know how to see it as more than the sum of its parts. I hope you do, too (or will, someday).","8"
"The_Core","The ""Star Wars"" of the 90's","23 September 1999","""The Matrix"" is arguably the most imaginative Science Fiction vision ever brought to life on the big screen. Combine that vision with incredible action, special effects and acting, and you have a movie that transcends its genre. The Matrix, like Star Wars was in 1977, is 5-10 years ahead of its time. Is it Science Fiction? Mythology? An action film? You decide. Once again, like Star Wars, I feel that it's a combination of all three. Like Star Wars, it's a perfect 10/10. And like Star Wars (and Blade Runner), it will become a cult classic in the years to come. Superlative, imaginative filmmaking. If you haven't seen it yet, prepare yourself for the ride of your life.","9"
"revival05","Horribly overrated","17 April 2000","Don't try to fool me that I didn't understand it, cause I did.

And I must say, even though I wasn't at all confused by the script and plot as so many others seem to be, I don't think its a bad movie. But h**l, its not THAT good!

I mean come on! I used to had no problems with this movie the first time I saw it, but I have learned to hate it, since its so EXTREMELY overrated (just having it 29 on the best movies ever is a proof).

THE MATRIX is although trying really hard, but I can't even seem to be impressed by one single actionscene. In my opinion. Go see FACE/OFF or some other John Woo-movie to be stunned by action (it won't happen a lot). And it starts up with being (er, sorry trying to be) a smart sci-fi-movie, but suddenly Morpheus gets kidnapped by a team of wooden-acting-agents and it ends up like ANY OTHER bye-bye-brain actionmovie! Am I wrong? Climbing on walls, bounching off bullets, oohh... Give me a break! To be clear, I'd say like this: ''After 25 minutes we know what the matrix is, the rest of the movie is a long hyped up, action-standard, with a lot of glamour. Ehh... intelligent? NOT!

I'm still confused how this movie got to be such a hit (yeah, go ahead mindless matrix-fans, laugh it all off), because the entire movie is old stuff, in a new package. The acting, with the exception of Laurence Fishbourne and perhaps little Joe too, is awful. Keanu seems tired and his entire face shines with that ''I should have listened to my mommy, and become a lawyer''-face. The rest of the cast is on the edge of average, many below.

Oh, yeah, lets not forget all the martial arts. Eehh... is it only me, or are the guys who thought they were spectacular just unwilling to watch some old good Bruce Lee-films.

Also, I would like to point out that this movie was NOT ORIGINAL! The main plot has been used many times before. If anyone can find something out of the ordernal, please give me a mail. Didn't think so.

And has anyone of these matrix-lovers ever seen 2001? THAT'S an sci-fi movie! With effects that lives on still today! Why don't you guys check out THE MATRIX after about 33 years, it will probably be so boring that it won't be watchable, and people will wonder: How the h**l did this win 4 academy awards?

Just thinking about Matrix 2, and 3 makes my blood chill. I guess my mailbox will be filled with criticism, after this, but I know how to respond, trust me...

But, it still is an entertaining and fun movie, that I will never watch again in my life! My rating is 6/10 but I still hate it.","3"

Although it was made 23 years ago, with huge, box-like monitors, and rudimentary internet pages, the story as modern as it gets.

The camerawork is outstanding in every sense. Especially that they invented a completely new technology to shoot the action scenes, a technology that was used for many years, until CGI has taken over completely.

"hasosch","When virtual reality turns into real imagination","8 September 2009","Adding another comment of ""The Matrix"" (1999) in addition to the over 2'000 almost published ones may seem pretentious. However, as it appears, most people have not understood that the ""matrix"" is that what we, according to the movie, mistakenly take for ""the"" reality. It is our ontology and our metaphysics, the space of the objects which we can meet during the trip of our life. But again according to the movie, this reality-matrix is nothing but an artificial construct produced by a computer program, so that it is this ""virtual"" reality which produces our ""real reality"". In addition, also the programmers which have written these omnipotent programs, are nothing else but functions of the program itself. So, the program is operated by its programmers, but it also operates on the programmers. Such logical circularity is excluded from any science which is based on two-valued Aristotelian logic - and this all kind of science we are able to technically realize by now. Insofar, this movie is ""Science Fiction"", but in a good sense of the term.

However, there is one of these long monologues of Laurence Fishburn-Morpheus where he gives for Keanu Reeve's character - and the audience - detailed metaphysical commentaries about the relationship of the two levels of reality, the seemingly real reality produced by the matrix and the indeed ""real"" virtual reality. Here, one has to say that at least for Morpheus, the ""real"" (i.e. non-virtual) reality must actually exist, because it serves him as a reference-basis for his explications of the virtual reality which produced the ""real"" matrix-reality. If it would not, then even Morpheus could not differentiate, let's say, if the ""virtual hull"" of a crew-member of his or his actual ""realy body"" has died. Multiplying the traditional one-reality-ontology and metaphysics does not let dissolve this latter concepts, in the opposite, the more realities are constructed, the more important the ""real"" reality gets as a basis of reference. The reason is that we cannot perceive a priori objects of any reality without ""filtering"" them with our senses, so we perceive them as signs - and those are, by their very nature, always interpreted. Thus, any reality is already interpreted reality and therefore needs a Tertium Comparationis for the sake of comparison and thus reference. Everything else would be a nightmare which would dissolve the human brain long before being able to create such fantasy worlds.","10"

"fjhuerta-2","There is no spoon...","3 June 2000","""The Matrix"" came out on the worst of times: just weeks before the most anticipated sci-fi film of all time was to come out: ""The Phantom Menace"".

Well the menace was definitely ""a phantom"", so to speak. And while hordes of gullible fans talked about how great Lucas' latest space opera was, many more had discovered what they feared the most: that Matrix was everything ""Phantom"" should have been, and then more.

The film has so many high points is difficult to start. The visual effects are simply stunning; there is no eye candy, ala Star Wars I; every single one is used as a way to get you deeper into the movie. The ""Bullet time"" technique is used throughout the picture, and it makes it seem as slick as the best piece of japanimation out there. The storyline is perfectly written: it manages to convince you that somehow it could all be possible. Neo/Thomas Anderson (Keanu Reeves) tells the whole story with his facial expressions of disbelief on the first 3/4 of the film, and then with self assurance. The rest of the cast makes you actually care for their fate (specially Carrie-Ann Moss and Lawrence Fishborne). And before the first half of the movie is over, you will hate the bad guys. Believe me.

I, as incredible as it might seem, am not waiting for ""Matrix 2"". The first installment is so good I fear they won't be able to live up to its reputation (again, like Lucas did with ""Phantom Menace""). Still, I am crossing my fingers and hoping I will be surprised and mesmerized. Again.","5"

Just like Lucas tarnished the image of his Star Wars films with the lesser Menace,Clones and Sith, the Wachowski Brothers were quick to make a buck and dragged the good name of The Matrix through similar mud. I caught a segment of the film on television last night and it reminded me what an engaging,well thought out and intelligent film it is. It also reminded me that it did not require a sequel. The story was told and wrapped up. Neo had realised his abilities and there were no new areas to explore. Of course, people will argue that we don't see Zion and of course,that would be the natural course of a sequel but in terms of character and story, the tale was told. While also being high on concept, The Matrix also delivered in terms of narrative. The film is multi layered. You can watch it for the straight up action fun,or you can also find something rarther more deep and philosophical if the need takes you. It's a big budget blockbuster with brains and it's with a certain regret, that i had kind of forgotten that.","9"
"mirosuionitsaki2","Wake Up And See","5 June 2012","I've been meaning to watch the Matrix series from beginning to end, instead of various clips of it when someone in my family were watching it. I do not regret spending seven hours watching the series. The first Matrix film is sure to be a hit, especially if you enjoy Anime. Some of the fighting techniques and scenes seem based on the fighting you would see in Japanese animation. 9/10 is this movie. I took off a point for the cheesy ""I love you but I'm not going to tell you but I'm going to start a sentence that makes the viewers think I'm about to tell you but I'm not"". Maybe it was common in the past, but it's cheesy for my view.

Imagine finding out your whole life was a life. Imagine finding out you were actually in a computer, and that in reality, civilization was destroyed years ago? Imagine trying to fight the machines that destroyed civilization.. a civilization of billions. I just summed up the entire movie.

One irritating plot event that I won't really mark off for was the fact that Neo was pretty quick to getting ready to save Morphius. Maybe it was because he had new information downloaded into his brain, which is another reason this is 9 and not 8 out of 10, but after being inexperienced and untrained, he's pretty quick to risk his life. But it makes for an exciting and action-filled ending..","8"
"carlos37andre","Definitely a milestone in film history","26 July 2017","Another classic that I took a lot of time to see, and damn, I could not be more regretful.

The Matrix is definitely one of the most important films in history, even today, almost 20 years after the special effects still hold, and especially the fight scenes, are incredible, wonderful, and magnificent.

The story is frighteningly believable, and this is certainly one of the foundations of the franchise's success. I think there is not much to talk about, it's worth even more an addendum inside the fight scenes: Keanu Reeves is fantastic. It's so beautiful to see a fight scene without lots of cuts and blurs, it makes all the difference and makes it as close to the real as possible, and besides the director's merit this is definitely the actor's merit too, and everyone here knows that Reeves does almost all his fight scenes, trying his hardest, and that's not for now (John Wick), The Matrix is here to prove it.

My only problem with the movie is the ""Snow White Moment"" in the end, they would have had thousands of better ways of solving that scene and for me it spoiled the impact.

In summary, it's a fantastic movie.","9"
"basrutten","Style makes up for story","21 April 2002","""The Matrix"" is a very interesting action/sci-fi movie, that's definetely more memorable for the cinematography and action sequences then it is for the story.

I won't go into details here, but the story, although certainly original, is really too far-fetched and sometimes downright nonsensical. The story does, however, offer a plausible explanation as to why all the exorbitant action sequences (people stalling in mid-air, running against walls, dodging bullets etc) are possible, and in the end it's those action sequences that make it all worthwile: they are simply very cool.

It doesn't happen often, but in this case I'd say that the ""coolness"" of the action sequences more then makes up for any plot holes. All in all ""The Matrix"" is excellent.

Far from being a brainless action- and effects-fest the film has a deep psychology behind it and the result is simply astonishing.

The only problem with the film is that it is at its best when watched for the first time. After that the film kinda loses the intrigue it originally had and this may explain the rather lukewarm response of the film's sequels.

Some have surprised us all, with their intelligent uses and creating something for all of us. They combine the special effects and acting, directing, and philosophies. I'm looking at you Inception! But in 1999, something was different was the Matrix. Although not as good as Inception, something was obscured behind it's slo-mo action sequences. It deals with Buddhist philosophies. We are living in a lie and their are two different realities. The other reality is secreted but yet to be found; this sounding so much like the Matrix. And it is. The brothers debut deals with everything you can imagine; with possibly the best action scenes of all time. I've read the bad reviews and all what people are complaining about is the acting or the cheesiness. Please, this movie DOES have a little of both and at times it has it's flaws; but if you look deep within (free your mind) you might well see the most controversial movie of all time. Now listen, I probably re-watched this film at least 10 times; each time was a different experience. But just this last one I realized how much of this movie deals with the outside. The first time was glorifying the action scenes. The second time was glorifying it's intelligent plot. You need to see the Matrix to find out what it is, it's power to suck your soul into this parallel universe where everything is different. The film questions life itself, varying the things we deal with at all times. You need to ask yourself this question throughout the film: what is life? What is it's breaking point? The answer will be reveled through the movies course... Everything will seem a bit different than what you shall see more clearly. I am praising this movie, for one, as it is much different than others. It doesn't rely on it's best pal SPECIAL EFFECTS. The Matrix will rely on you, yourself, and your mind which leads me to the final question... Will you take the blue pill? Or the red pill? 10/10.","9"
"Shiva-11","Best fresh action/plot combination since Face Off","1 April 1999","After all the trailers, interviews, and general hype, I stood in line, special preview pass in hand, ready for the action film of the season. Subconsciously, the question Can they deliver or will TM join Johnny Mnemonic on the Keanu scrap heap dogged me as the lights went out.

The first twenty minutes of the film seemed to confirm the worst: it was choppy, cryptic and I found my mind wandering. Luckily the pace picked up and never slowed down again. As Neo, Reeves gives a fairly wooden performance (something we've come to expect of him), but surprisingly it actually helps his character. Carrie-Anne Moss as Trinity is wonderful: alluring and deadly, a leather clad black widow. Fishburne's softspoken, almost monastic Mephisto is riveting. And, finally, there is Joe Pantoliano's Cypher, as devious and slimy as we've come to expect him (Bound, Risky Business,etc).

The nightmarish real earth landscape was truly hellish. The setting and atmosphere will obviously be compared with T2, Blade Runner, and Dark City, not to mention shades of Demolition Man, and Brazil. Thankfully TM does an excellent job of this and will not be seen as merely a copycat. I was also thankful of the fact that TM does not follow the simple linear plot line common in most Hollywood films these days and makes you pay attention and, god forbid, think. Setting and plot aside, the question on many people's mind, is does the action live up to the hype. Yes.

The action sequences were simply breathtaking and beautifully choreographed, worthy of John Woo . On these merits alone I would strongly recommend the movie. The fact that the actors did all their own stunts and spent several months in intensive martial arts training only gives it that much more oomph. Combine this with the effective utilization of the new freeze photography (popping up in everything from the Gap commercials to Wing Commander), and you have some of the best scenes ever filmed.

This movie will be a welcome addition to my film collection when it hits the video stores next year (hopefully I'll have my DVD player by then so I can enjoy it even more).","9"

"harrylosborne","Proper nerd p*rn, slightly withered by time","17 February 2021","The Matrix has established itself as a piece of cultural history: not just for the insanely memeable lines of dialogue, but for some of the most iconic scenes of recent cinema, particularly in establishing the flexibility of CGI.

It is true that some of the visuals haven't quite stood the test of time (the robots don't always fit, nor do the world-warping graphics), but the fight scene choreography more than makes up. The vision behind some of the major clashes (complemented by the score) is exemplary, and credit must go to the Wachowskis for having the gall to make this.

What deserves appreciation the most, I would argue, is the story. It is stupidly ambitious, but does ask real questions of the human experience (albeit in a slightly heightened sense), whilst still being a fun watch for those wanting an action flick. At points the story falls victim to its own convolutions, but for the most part holds together.

The acting is hard to critique: a film centred around robotics requires robotic performances, so they are suited exactly to the roles. The rest of the trilogy might not have ticked everyone's boxes, but the original has achieved immortal status for a reason. If you like fighting, fantasy and an instance of flying, The Matrix is probably up your street.","8"
"krational66","The philosophy among them influences my philosophy road.","30 March 2020","Is it possible that the entire world is simulated by a computer, and everything around us is just a string of code in the computer? ""You, like everyone, are born to be salves. You were born in a prison you can't perceive."" This conjecture is shocking enough, but the depth of The Mstrix is not only that, it also puts forward on this basis New question: Would you choose bile pills or red pills? Is it a choice of good illusory or cruel reality? It may seem like a good choice, but it is much more difficult than we think. On the one hand is the future doomsday world, which is devastated by hunger and cold, and also faces the danger of being hunted down by robots; on the other hand, it is a warm and peaceful era, with bile sky and white clouds, beautiful scenery, and even opportunities to become successful people. Indeed, everyone knows that no matter how beautiful a dream is, it's only a dream. But Sever was willing to betray everyone for a dream. If we rally escape the matrix and experience the cruelty of reality, maybe we will make the same choice as Sever. Just as when you have Actress liu yifei's choice is too good!! I love it!! So happy!!

"Indy-52","it gets better on repeated viewings!","12 May 2000","after seeing this movie in the cinema and renting it on VHS, i own this movie on DVD and now i watch whenever i want. The good thing about this brilliant movie is that it gets better and better each time i see it! On each viewing i discover new interesting details in the special effects and the story. Sometimes i even put it on pause to glare at the special effects shots, like when Neo wakes up in the real world. You should try do that too, only then you can truly observe the visual excellence of these scenes. This movie totally deserved the oscar for visual effects (sorry phantom menace!). As Joel Silver said in an interview, this movie is ground-breaking, a film that will be much imitated by others.","2"
"Indy-52","one of the best experiences ever!","5 January 2000","this movie was a lot fun to watch, no movie in 1999 or even in the last decennium can surpass it! It's better than Jurassic Park, Star Wars, Jaws, The Truman Show, Blade Runner, Return of the Jedi, Jumanji, etc. (i know these movies don't have really much to do with each other, but this just a list of my favorite films). The only film that is better, to me, than the Matrix, is Raiders of the Lost Ark. I love Morpheus' voice and also the things he says about the world how it will in two centuries, are very interesting AND scary. That's what i liked about this film, it was really frightening. The kung fu scenes are really entertaining and fast, and Keanu's acting is at its best. Trinity is really cool, it's unusual to see a woman shooting all the bad guys. Agent Smith is a really cool villain, he's one of the meanest guys in film history (especially the voice is very creepy). This film actually doesn't have one dull moment in it. Anyone who hasn't seen it, doesn't know what he's missing.","9"
"second_coming_of_oz","Somewhere up there, Ed Wood is smiling...","8 August 2005","1959 saw one of cinema's greatest achievements, 'Plan 9 from Outer Space'. Widely regarded as the worst film of all time, it featured a plot unrivalled in absurdity.

Then came 'The Matrix'. Apparently robots (or space zombies, or some variety of scary CGI monsters) have enslaved humanity, and are harvesting them for energy. To keep their living batteries entertained the robo-zombies (or space alligators, it doesn't really matter) have created a giant computer game called 'the Matrix'. With a devil-may-care disregard for the first law of thermodynamics, this game runs on the energy of the people it simulates.

But some of these people break out of the computer game and live in a rusty metal bucket and eat gruel. Being heroes, they plan to overthrow their demon-squid robot overlords and free humanity, so they can all live in rusty metal buckets and eat gruel. There are some philosophical pretensions and religious references in there, but these are too simplistic and crass to be worth going any deeper into.

Keanu Reeves gives a very believable performance of bad acting, while the rest of the cast mince around in sunglasses and trench-coats, delivering dialogue which serves no other purpose than carrying the plot.

The first fifteen minutes of this film are quite watchable, which is why I am giving it a generous two out of ten.","9"
"Old Joe","The future will not be user friendly","13 July 2003","With dazzling special effects, great cast and intriguing story, 1999's 'The matrix' is a fantastic movie, with a huge following around the world. This film has started a number of movies to follow the similar sorts of formula, some succeeding and some not. However, the Matrix is a film that many people keep returning too, saying that it is what they expect, when it comes to special effects. Who I am to disagree?

Reality: That world is a hoax, an elaborate deception spun by all-powerful machines of artificial intelligence that control us. Whoa. Mind-warp stunts. Techno-slammin visuals. Mega-kick action. Morpheus and Neo (the 'one') lead the fight to free humankind in The Matrix, the see-and-see-again cyberthriller written and directed by the Wachowski brothers. The story sears, the special effects stake out new moviemaking territory. The 'Matrix' rocks!

Now I am one person who believes that special effects are only one small part of a movie, but when they enhance it, like they do in this film, then they are very special. There are so many scenes in the film that show the use of special effects, however I unsure which is the best one. Scenes such as the introduction into the world of the Matrix, the way Neo learns that he has special powers, the weapons that appear in one section of the film, the famous fighting scenes of Neo towards the end of film, where he dodges bullets are all memorable. But I am not going to say one is better than the other, as all are terrific.

There are some fine actors taking on challenging roles in the Matrix. I have been a critic of main star Neo (Keanu Reeves), but in this film he suits the genre and is a fine looking man when finally gets used to the virtual-reality world of the Matrix. The supporting cast includes the Morpheus (Lawrence Fishburne), who makes the whole transition of the Matrix for Neo be as gentle as possible. I love the kung fu scene both Reeves and Fishburne share at about the halfway mark of the movie. The female member of the cast is a girl, who seems anything but a girl, that of Trinity (Carrie-Anne Moss). She has complete admiration for Neo, realising that he is in for big things.

Cypher (Joe Pantoliano) is one character that I am sure we are not able to distinguish as being either good or bad. Both Moss and Pantoliano were a part of 2000's fantastic movie, 'Memento'. Yet we do get to see the baddies which are part of the Matrix. Agent Smith (Australia's Hugo Weaving), is a real revelation as the 'bad guy' of the Matrix. His confrontation at the end of the movie with Neo is a big highlight of the film from my prospective.

The way the stunts were incorporated into the Matrix was terrific. This area of the movie must have taken along-time to organise, and is a great achievement by the actors, stunt doubles and the people working 'behind the scenes'. The costumes designed for the Matrix were also amazing. I love the slick black costumes that Neo, Morpheus and Trinity wear, while the bad agents all looked impressive in their suits. The great glasses worn by everyone in the film were also terrific, and made all these characters in the Matrix look 'cool'.

The director/writers of the Matrix were the Wachowski brothers, who did a fine job in bringing through the other important aspects of the film, not only the great special effects. I believe they made the story genuinely interesting, via the screenplay, with the script having obvious religious reference through the entire film. They also allowed us to be introduced to the world of the Matrix extremely well. Their placement of a 'green tinge' to almost every scene in the movie is another small, but quite extraordinary feature.

Look I am a fan of this movie, for all of its aspects, not just the special effects. But I can understand a person not being a fan of the Matrix, as they would expect a lot more of movie, than just great special effects. A detractor could say that the Matrix only has that feature. The matrix is such a positive movie for the Australian movie making industry, showing that special things can be done in this country. It was also great to see the locations of Sydney in the film. The Matrix DVD is one of the great DVDs going around, with heaps of special features unlocking the secrets of the film. I must also make mention of another movie like the Matrix, that of the David Cronenberg's masterpiece 'eXistenZ'. If it was not for this film, I have no doubt that 'eXistenZ' would be an even greater movie than it is. So with the two Matrix sequels coming up 'back to back' in 2003, here will be three films that I feel will go down as a part of 'cinema history'.

"MrPupkin","A great movie that makes you wanna question reality.","22 October 2019","Simply a masterpiece. The Watchowskis brothers would forever change cinema with this movie.

The action does not outshine all the other layers in the movie, like societal reflection, philosofy and self-preservation.","2"
"general-melchett","A real breakthrough in sci-fi films, The Matrix is a fun ride that will inspire future films for many generations.","11 October 2006","All of the films that people say are great are all from the last millennium (Titanic, Schindler's List, Jaws, etc.), and this masterpiece of a sci-fi flick proves that case further. This is perhaps the most gripping sci-fi film ever made, with a rich, original plot that will not ever make you turn away from the screen. The acting is good, and while there are no life-changing performances, it is still believable and not wooden. But the main premise of the film lies in its superb effects, which have inspired many spoofs and budding sci-fi fans. The ""bullet time"" sequence, which happens exactly two hours into the film, is easily the most famous, and just shows the level of technical expertise that went into this film, expertise that has still not been equalled to this day. This film can be a little bit odd in parts (the young boy who bends spoons with his mind at the Oracle's place is definitely a bit strange), but which good sci-fi film isn't? The screenplay is also good - many memorable lines and scenes are delivered, and Morpheus always sees it right to hammer home a memorable quote every few minutes. Even the ""blue pill/red pill"" scene beats off competition from epic fight scenes in higher-budgeted sci-fi flicks. Though most films of The Matrix's calibre may not be Oscar winning material, this one sure is, and won four very well deserved Academy Awards that are entirely justifiable. Even though the Wachowski brothers may not be names you hear so often, their achievements shall never be forgotten in this film that is more than a cult classic - it's an all-round classic.

First rate effects, one of the brainiest scripts ever transferred to paper, good direction, and many classic moments - the Matrix is the undisputed king of sci-fi movies, and must be seen to be believed! Have we got more advanced since 1999 or have we gone backwards? 10/10","8"
"Brogan","Another Sci-Fi Hit!!!!!!","1 April 1999","The 1990's is going to be a memorable year for the Sci-Fi genre. With films like ""TOTAL RECALL"" ""THE FIFTH ELEMENT"" ""JURASSIC PARK"" ""TERMINATOR 2"" ""EVENT HORIZON"" and ""12 MONKEYS"" they were all excellent films that provided imagination, along with plenty of intellengence and excitement. Now before the Sci-Fi genre hits full throttle (with EPISODE I), you can say the engine is warming up, and it warms up well with THE MATRIX. THE MATRIX is a interesting mix of ""THE FIFTH ELEMENT"" ""12 MONKEYS"" and ""TOTAL RECALL"" it's about a computer hacker (Keanu Reeves) who's is inducted into a gang (led by the always wonderful Laurence Fishburne) into realizing what reality is, and what is the mystery behind the MATRIX? What is THE MATRIX? Ha! I'm not going to tell you, you're going to have to see the movie to find out! But you'll be pleased when you do see it. The movie does have a lot of imagination, and excitement. It also have great effects, excellent action scenes, brilliant directing, and decent acting. Leave it to the Wachowski brothers to make a exciting film. I am wondering after making BOUND and THE MATRIX, on what they are going to be doing next? Until then go see this wonderful sci-fi flick. It will calm down your excitement before May 19th hits. ****1/2 out of *****","7"

Laurence Fishboure also is awesome has Morpheus, A big guy that talks like Yoda. Carrie Ann Mosse is also good has the lovely but tough Trinity. But it's Hugo Weaving that steals most of the picture has Agent Smith, he was just a perfect villian. Well fans make way for it's sequels.","9"
"therskybznuiss","This -would- have been a perfect standalone title. Though I won't let the sequel(s) get in the way of the good time I had with this film.","11 June 2021","I can't say much about The Matrix which hasn't been said already. Though I feel like the need for sequels (a obvious ca$h-in on this film's success) sort of watered down or in some cases completely detracted from this otherwise bulletproof movie's important existential, philosophical and moral statements on the state of, well, everything.

Stylistically, it might be one of the most important action-movies ever made and it still looks pretty great... Overall I had a really good time with this and it's too bad Kung-Fu Producers didn't take what this movie took from them and build upon it's foundation like so many Hollywood Producers did. Anyways all around great-watch.","10"
"suicidea","The biggest bomb from the new age of Hollywood","7 July 2019","Technically, The Matrix was a movie of the last century (made in 1999), but it's a scarily accurate model of the 21st century person: Slick and great-looking, flashy, flaunting and proud, but as hollow and unaware as it can be.

The story, as everyone probably knows, involves a computer hacker realizing that ""the world is not what it seems"" and joining forces with other rebels to overthrow the robot overlords, or save the world, or fly in his long leather coat, depending on your interpretation.

The visuals, sets and costumes are truly impressive, still setting the standard even after 20 years of technical innovations in moviemaking. The special effects also stand the test of time. The direction of the Wachowski brothers (or sisters? What do we call them now? Will I be crucified if I get the slightest wording wrong?) is also excellent.

However, visuals alone don't make a film. The Matrix is a textbook example. It is so unbelievably, incredibly pretentious, tries to bite so much bigger than it can chew, comes off as so high-brow and assertive, that it leaves you scratching your head.

Read as many comments as you want (this will be the 4000th one if approved) and you won't find one which doesn't contain the word ""philosophical."" But mind you, The Matrix isn't ""philosophical"" in the general sense: it's philosophical in the millennial generation sense. Which means, it says ""Things aren't always what they seem..."" and that's enough philosophy to boggle your mind, so then moves on to fight scenes.

Which isn't an unfair assessment. The movie's deep, profound ""philosophy"" that so many fans have been praising for 20 years, doesn't go beyond having a ying-yang symbol in the background in one scene, or someone saying ""life isn't what it seems..."" for an audience that's all too ready to go ""Whoo man, that's deep, man!""

You can almost feel the moviemakers saying ""Hey, why not add a katana or a Chinese letter as well? There, we lapped up all 5,000 years of Eastern philosophy and reduced it to a spoonful for you. Now let's move to the next leather-clad CGI fight.""

In this aspect, the movie reminds me of some celebrities who go on talk shows and say ""I'm a very cultured person. In fact I just read a book. But enough of that, now let me tell about my latest breast implants.""

I still gave it 5 stars for the great visuals and entertainment element, that cannot be denied. But it still feels like a missed chance, it could have been much more than a 90-minute long sunglasses commercial.","9"
"nemo21i","Matrix, The ... shivering timbers!","8 February 2003","This is a movie that people either adore or disregard totally... but I haven't found (though it is statisticley possible) someone who actually hates The Matrix. This, in itself, humours me since this movie IS about hating the matrix and alot of people around me agreed that if it was up to them, they'd probably take the blue pill. WIERD, MAN!

I, of course, think completely otherwise.

Yet, this movie, like many others, has what seems to be an anti-technocracy attitude. I disagree with that observation too, because this film is all about how bad choices can make things go wrong, and how good ones can make them better. Not because technology is bad, but because those who weild it has ""the smell"", and I too feel, sometimes, ""saturated"" by it. it is obnoxious and it is our greatest and foremost weakness as a specie. Yet the movies shows that there is a diffrence between knowing the path and walking on it.

As a determinist, I do not belive in free choice. I do agree that the illusion is mighty, and the movie depicts exactly that. What is important, after all, is to feel good about yourself and accept your fate. Don't mind the reality - stick to what you are and embrace what you consider is good and true in yourself and then, things would SEEM righter.

So THAT, in my part, is the greatness of this movie over thousnds of others. It holds such beautiful concepts, ideas and thought, in what seems to be a high-tech-action-stunts-cash-monger, and a good one too.

and yet It's not. It is most certainley not. There is a spoon!

It IS a visually stunning AND entertaining movie. Actors are good at what they do but please...there is NOT one iota of anything original in this movie! Computer programs as humans or humans in the 'mind' or 'midst' of a computer program? Have you watched 1982 TRON ( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0084827/)? Synopsis from this site ""A hacker is literally abducted into the world of a computer and forced to participate in gladiatorial games where his only chance of escape is with the help of a heroic security program"". Sounds familiar? What about people jumping 50 meters high exchanging kung-fu blows? Well, Hong Kong has been milling that kind of cinematic visuals for decades. I really laugh out loud when I read people going ecstatic over Matrix's philosophy... Proper philosophers coined the 'brain in a vat' dilemma (http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/brain-vat/) ages ago (the 1980s?), asking whether we can say anything is real and how can we be sure of anything. Troubled teenagers will probably find the movie philosophical appeal irresistible...religious fundamentalists may all find their piece of cake (is Cypher like encryption or Lou...cifer? Trinity? Weird none's called Holy Ghost in there). It's a SFX action extravaganza, not gospel. What about Men in Black? There are people who think they are henchmen of an underground government run by aliens from outer space... It's entertaining and visually stunning and are not Carrie Ann Moss and McClory hot? But just that... Movies about prophecies sell a dime a dozen...oh, and waking up the dead with a kiss: THAT is original and not copied from some fairy tale.

"robsta23","Just Awesome","29 April 2015","The Matrix is the type of gem that only comes around once a decade. It is a great film that combines top-notch philosophy (Plato's allegory of the cave) with the coolest action scenes in a long time. It was awesome to learn that some of the coolest effects in the film were achieved by having hundreds of cameras set up to take pictures simultaneously to get the same image from different angles, simulating camera movement when edited together.

On surface level, this film is simply really cool to watch. The shootout before Neo and Trinity enter the elevator is one of the most iconic action scenes in film history. We get all the fun of a lot of bullet fire, one-handed cartwheels, walking up a person's body just to kick them in the face, and a lot more fun choreography to go along with all of this.

I love that this film makes ideas from Plato interesting and relevant via sci-fi motifs. There is also the notion of ""the one"" in the film. I have to admit, this motif gets somewhat annoying at times; everyone seems to say ""he is the one"" at one point or another in this film. People see it as a Christ story, but just because somebody is resurrected doesn't make them Jesus. I mean does he die for sins? There is also no clear connection to a god in this story, which goes against the ideas Christianity. I think Plato is more relevant here.

What is on and off for me is my opinion on Keanu Reeves' performance. I used to think his performance in this film is terrible, but I've realized his playing dumb/ignorant is spot-on. The scene where he questions if he should save Morpheus seems to lack some emotion, but I now realize this is one of the few instances of ""poor"" acting coming from Reeves in the film.

This film would be perfect with a slightly better lead than Keanu Reeves, but this movie is still f***ing awesome.","10"

I was blown away by how they created such a hard to believe world but yet managed to make you believe it. The whole theme of the film (at least this is what I think) was a reflection of our own lives and how we live in a world that's made up of so many distractions we never really realize whats going on around us. So many people shut their eyes to many events that happen in the real world and get lost in their own private worlds. Well to describe the theme this movie tries to pass on to the viewers. I can do this in three words. FREE YOUR MIND. Like I said thats just what I think. Maybe you do too.","10"

"KFstudios2009","Crazy Movie😯","20 October 2023","The Matrix was a huge mess, but with a very good explanation, something that just made everything understandable. Everything that seemed so confusing and unknown, become so bright and clear. As well as the amazing twists, action scenes in the ""Matrix"" style, including the super rushed story but at the same time so explained and evolved, The Matrix is just a crazy movie! In a good way, of course. The first movie starts out with a man called Neo, he lives a double life, and very soon he discovers that the world is part of a bigger universe and that the world is not actually a real thing, but a made-up reality. I can't tell more, but everything was just so amazing, making a story like that and putting in like a movie like this is a win-win situation. The characters were well introduced, Neo, the unknown, weird, confused man looking for answers in this world, wondering what The Matrix is, made him out as a great character, with a very strong personality, and well preformed by Keanu Reeves, that isn't the actor of the highest shelf, but in this case, he really fits the role, with his also known way of saying ""Yeah"", that I see he is saying everywhere, for example in his iconic role as John Wick. Getting back to the case, the other persons like his boss, Morpheus, that was so mysterious, so unpredictable, and just such a funny character, was also one of my personal favorites. Mentioning other things in the movie, I think the suspenseful and computer-like music was well composed, it really fit the action scenes or on the more suspenseful, scarier scenes. The scenes were generally well, sometimes I feel they could put more music behind the talking scenes, for example, or less black fade between the scenes? Not a big problem, just something that could be put in more or removed a bit. Even though the small details, I still give my high rating. This was very entertaining, it was crazy, it was Matrix. With the great cliffhanger in the end, make me just want to watch the next one! I can't wait👍","10"
"Dar Star","OVERRATED","23 September 1999","A nice premise is ruined by a plot that never settles down and decides what it is going to be. The first 1/2 of the movie builds nicely, but the last 1/2 is just mindless action with no direction. The phony fight scenes were out of a Mortal Combat video game. If karate was so essential to the movie they should've gotten Jackie Chan to do it.","10"

Obviously I'm a sap for the combination of ideas and images that go into the making of the Matrix. If the black wet look, computers, hackers and wapping great conspiracy theories are your thing then you're going love this movie. Agent Smith deserves a special mention for his line delivery.

The movie glosses over a few points e.g. (1) exactly how out heros get in and out of the Matrix (2) when Agent Smith cracks up what happened the original host - none of it matters :)

I now look out for Reeves, Fishburne, Pantoliano and Moss in just about any movie - so far I've not been disappointed.

"marc5477","Amazingly good film... though I think it was an accident","12 March 2017","Bottom line is that the Matrix was awesome and still is. The idea was not new, and certainly it had been covered in film in the past, but the ideas of what life was really like outside the Matrix were fresh and the action made the movie thrilling to watch. The chemistry between characters was also excellent and I think that this was one of Laurence Fishburne best performances and certainly Reeves best as well. They fit their roles to the T.

That said, I really think that the greatness of the 1st film (of the trilogy) was a sheer accident. A wonderful accident, but an accident none the less. How do I know? Because the sequels straight up stunk and at the time, were considered a huge disappointment, so much so, that sci-fi fans stopped talking about the movies out of sheer frustration with the sequels. If the sequels were not so bad, then the Matrix franchise would easily rival Star Wars today because the first film was that good. It was on the mind of every sci-fi fan for 3 years. We talked about it like it was Star Wars but after the sequel... the buzz was completely gone, and people forgot about the movies. Many kids today have not even heard of this trilogy for that reason.

Still, a great movie in its own right. Easily one of my favorites. Just brace yourself for the terrible sequels...","10"

The Matrix is probably the best action/sci-fi movie ever,alongside the Star Wars saga of course.

After watching the movie several times it still doesn't bore for a single second.The special effects are absolutely stunning and are still the best I've ever seen. The way the movie is build up from the training of Neo(Reeves) to a breathtaking final 30 minutes of non-stop martial arts slomo action and flying bullets is just great.

The cast is well picked,Reeves is a great action hero and Fishburne is very cool as Morpheus.I also very much liked Carrie-Anne Moss as Trinity,she looks so beautiful in this movie. There is also a very funny part for Hugo Weaving as the evil Agent Smith,the way Weaving speaks(very slow)doesn't make him look like the bad guy. Like I said,the last 30 minutes of the movie are great,or even better,they are movie-history.Just look at the scene where Neo dodges bullets,or the shoot-out with the cops,or the fight in the subway station,or...Like Neo says when Morpheus makes a giant leap from one building to another:WOW!

The movie also introduced the long black coats,which are still worn by a lot of people. Another good part is the soundtrack.The music in the training sequence is very fast and the last scene of the movie is supported by a song from Rage Against the Machine:Wake Up.

Overall,the Matrix is a revolutionary film with sublime special effects that is still not equaled. 10/10","8"

"eoreill","Still great after all these years","30 May 2020","It's always a little bit sad when you watch a movie that you loved when you were young and discover that you no longer love it, or love it less. That happened to me recently with Fight Club. The social rebellion that inspired me at 17, while still somewhat attractive, now seemed reckless, selfish, and irresponsible. So when I decided to watch The Matrix for the first time in, probably 15 years, I was prepared for a similar experience.

It was a happy surprise then that The Matrix seemed just as excellent post-graduate school as it did pre-high school. The possibility that what is perceived as reality is actually a false construct seemed perhaps even more likely, and the call to abandon that construct equally enticing.

Visually, the film is still striking. The use of vertical streams of eerie green digits to depict the virtual reality that constitutes the Matrix is still effective, and Morpheus, in his black leather trench coat and pince-nez sunglasses, still looks cool. The aesthetic of dilapidated, poorly-lit buildings fits the dystopian setting perfectly, and each space, be it the Oracle's apartment or the interior of the Nebuchadnezzar, makes the world of The Matrix seem that much more diverse and vivid.

By the end of the film, temporary suspension of disbelief has become increasingly necessary - say, when Trinity's whispered declaration of love in accordance with the Oracle's prophecy brings Neo back from the dead - but my disbelief was, by that time, completely suspended. The Matrix had drawn me all the way in. I had swallowed the red pill.

My next fear is that the following chapters will let me down -- I remember them being good enough, but not on the same level as the trilogy's first entry. And I should probably stop here, satisfied that the movie I loved as a teenager did not disappoint me as an adult. But it's too late for me now. I'm hooked on the world of The Matrix once again, and I want to spend as much time there as I can.","9"
"chiumt","A Sci-fi Classic","20 April 2019","I have watched this several times through the years. It has remained fresh, even though it is sci-fi. The opening sequence is classic. The Matrix is everywhere. What is it? You have to see it for yourself.","10"
"BHorrorWriter","Mind Blowing","15 November 2001","I have only seen this film twice. The second time being last night. Well, the first time I saw it was when it was released on Video. I must say, I remember not being impressed with it.

Well, on second viewing...God was I wrong. Yeah, The stunts are amazing to say the least, but the story is so complex and in depth. It is unusual for this type of movie. A big Budget action film typically will not have a decent plot...It is all about FX. Well, this does that, but it is built around a wonder story, and of course I hope will be explored much more in the next 2 sequels.

Reeves is excellently cast as Neo. Probably one of the better roled he has ever played. He is dynamic and pure in his acting in this film. You can tell he was really into making this film.

All other characters are also equally excellent. Fisburne, almost an Obi Wan type character is superb. Moss is gorgeous and deadly as Trinity.

With my faith reevaulated, I plan on watching this on a few more times, and cannot wait till 2003 for The Matrix, Reloaded. The directors clearly know what they are doing, and enjoy it emmencely.

Superior film with mind blowing effect and an exceptional story.

The Matrix has very good visual effects and has some decent acting. Keanu Reeves is not a great actor, he can be good and can be bad. This is where he is good. Laurence Fishburne also turns in a pretty good performance as Morpheus. Carrie Moss is also good as Trinity. But the standout I think is Hugo Weaving as Agent Smith, he is excellent.

Looking at it today I noticed that it had aged quickly. The styling looks ridiculous, it is mostly shooting and running, the characters pretty flat, dialogues basic. The storyline has some suprise jumps where you question how they knew that. It is like Avatar, the visuals blew you away, but the content is so-so.","10"
"andy-227","Outstanding!","30 April 1999","This movie is just outstanding. Loaded with mind blowing special effects, and an especially clever plot, I think we've finally found a serious role that Keanu Reeves does well! I saw this a week ago, and when it was finished, I walked out wondering whether or not we humans are really just part of a vast supercomputer program like the ones I saw in the film. It's very paranoid, and it's artificial world is reminiscent of ""The Truman Show"". The only difference was that this world was digital. Another breakthrough with this film was that I was finally able to enjoy and immerse myself in a special effects film. After F/X turds like ""Godzilla"" and ""Independence Day"" came out, I tried like hell to avoid another special effects bonanza. But this time, I had fun, and the plot and characters weren't stupid and unrealistic.

Strangely enough, this film was widely attacked after the Columbine incident. I thought about it for a long time, and wondered why so many people blame the media and the arts for people committing an act of murder. There is a difference between real life and movies, and you'd have to be a real idiot to be influenced by what you observe. Unfortunately, those two students did commit murder, but you can't blame the movies for it. I am defending ""The Matrix"", and many other films that people are blaming for the Columbine incident!

Also, I would advise you not to stay away from this film because of the Columbine incident. If you're smart, you won't feel like killing someone after watching this film, and will be able to appreciate this film for its amazing plot and special effects. I hope you agree with me on this matter!","3"

With knowing what is real and what is not real.","8"
"dholliday-imdb","Zeitgeist-defining, and yet timeless...not bad for a mere action movie!","7 March 2015","The sentiment of The Matrix, the chief paranoia dominating its message, is one as old as the hills: that reality is not what it seems.

Its execution, that AI has taken over and created a virtual reality for us, is a very modern fear, and one perhaps growing ever more realistic as the decades go by.

...or maybe we are already in one?

*cue dramatic chipmunk clip*

Aside from this epic premise, and the profound questions it asks, we still get a riproaring action sci-fi with two brilliant characters (Morpheus and Agent Smith), pulsating set-pieces, nice martial art moves, excellent effects and solid pacing.

Keanu Reeves' unavoidable blandness (and that of his love interest) aren't really detrimental. The philosophical musing surrounding his place in the universe is tantalising and its further development was ostensibly intended for the sequels (alas...we all know how that turned out).

As a standalone action film with intelligent ideas, it's utterly recommended. Watch the sequels too if you're curious, but the quality drops off somewhat (more focus on the action, less on the 'intelligent').","10"
"modius","A visually stunning sci-fi film lacking credible acting","12 June 1999","The Matrix is fundamentally about a messiah called 'the one' (Keanu Reeves) who is a hacker who discovers that everyone hooked up to a computer simulation (altough why I have no idea) and is brought to the real world by Morpheous (played by a very bored Laurence Fishburne) and his crack team of hackers/terrorists.

The plot has been overworked to an outer limits style, and it takes ages for the action and the film to actually kick in.

The film in itself is boring and slow, the actors don't seem committed to their characters, they all seem bored, and inconsequential to the film, what mattered was the plot, the hong kong styled filming and the visually stunning special effects.

The special effects appear to be very good, however the overuse of computer graphics on action setpieces (such as the helicopter sequence) leaves you feeling that you've been ripped off. I want to see real stunts, explosions - not computer cgi-crap - sure it looks good, but if you want to make an action sequence at least make it believable.

The way the film has been shot is likened to John Woo, with slowed down shooting sequences - graphically showing how the bullets fly off. Although this is beautifully shot, it does leave you wondering if you actually WANT to see a couple of people walking around in trenchcoats blowing people away (hang on, haven't I heard this somewhere before???).

Apart from the overuse of CGI, I liked the combination this film used of martial arts and Hong Kong styled directoring, but the martial arts did feel as good as it should have been. It leads me to ask if they wanted a good martial artist, why did they use the very stiff actor Keanu Reeves? Why not Chow Yun Fat or even Jet Li - at least they look good when they do martial arts, Reeves just looks out of place doing all the complex martial arts.

I hated the bad guys, they were deliberatly made with no remorse, no minds and no acting. They were boring, montonious, laborious pieces of cardboard. Whenever they were on screen I felt like going to sleep - there was no real credible bad guy or a big name playing the bad guy - this let the film down (mind you so does the gratious overuse of cgi and gunfighting), the half-hearted ending of Keanu blocking every move that the bad guy did was too quick for me - it should have been one long fight sequence.

At the end of the film, Reeves tells us he didn't want to tell us how this film ends - that's up to us - no it isn't, its up to the directors and producers who made this film and are planning the sequels.

If a sequel is planned - more effort needs to be made on credible action sequences, credible bad guys and credible acting.

Overall, the film is stunning to watch and if you ignore the complex plot you can enjoy a dark, cool attempt at a Hollywood made Hong Kong film with a lot of CGI. I'd personally give this film a 7 but I felt so annoyed at the bad guys and the less then realistic action sequences I'll give it a 6 instead.","6"
"TuckMN","I don't usually like special effects movies, BUT","8 April 1999","WOW!

I was very pleasantly surprised at this film.

There is actually a very good and very dark story.

The special effects only add to the story instead of detracting from it.

All of the supporting characters turned in performances that were just a hair short of being truly great.

Friends of mine that do not usually like either science fiction or special effects films liked it very much as well.

And, as one of them put it ""Keanu Reeves does not ruin the movie.""

This movie will not translate well to video -- the special effects and the sound (which was also incredible) just will not work on a small screen -- so I strongly suggest that you DO NOT wait for it to come out on video and see it in a theater with the sound system that will support this movie.

Enjoy.","10"
"michael_the_nermal","Star Wars Meets Blade Runner Meets Ted's Bogus Journey (no Bill)","27 February 2008","Spoilers Ahead

This movie is an absolute classic of cinema. It follows the ""Star Wars"" epic formula, but is much better at developing compelling heroes, villains, and a setting. The conflict of man vs. machine is a common one, but ""The Matrix"" twists it on its head in that it is the humans who are not so much oppressed by their robotic overlords as kept complacent by a ""bread and circuses"" virtual reality program, while the robots use the humans---most of whom are completely unaware of their true reality---as energy sources. In other words, the oppressor is not Skynet and its band of killer enforcers, but a machine that allows humans the illusion of normality, with no real dangers or oppression beyond what we would expect in our own world. The movie then poses this question: if you knew that reality was an illusion, would you still desire freedom, even if it meant disrupting a rather unoppressive status quo? This movie clearly sides in favor of freedom, but the ambiguity between good and evil, or the humans who desire freedom and the robots who control mankind, makes this adventure story very interesting and compelling.

The acting and the plot construction is absolutely superb. Keanu Reeves, previously best known for his excellent adventures and bogus journeys with Genghis Khan, Napoleon, and the Grim Reaper is absolutely wonderful as Neo, the Luke Skywalker-esquire hero, who is destined to ""free"" mankind from the robots' control. He gives as understated dramatic performance that gives a great deal of maturity and complexity to his character, something that was rather missing from Mark Hamill's performance as Luke Skywalker back in 1977. Laurance Fishburne, previously best known as Pee-Wee Herman's cowboy friend, is excellent as the stoic, deep-voiced authoritative Obi-Wan Kenobi mentor/shaman/sensei/teacher character of Morpheus. His performance in the ""teacher"" role to the epic hero is just as good, if not better, than Alec Guiness's role as Obi-Wan. He is given more screen time to tell Neo of his destiny than Obi-Wan did in telling Luke about ""The Force"", and is therefore more effective in his role. Hugo Weaving, previously best known as Priscilla, Queen of the Desert, is excellent as the emotionless, cold, and ruthless enforcer program of the robots' simulated reality, Agent Smith. He, like Reeves and Fishburne, gives an understated yet powerful performance. Weaving clearly understood that he was to be part-machine as an anthropomorphic computer program, whose sole purpose was to eradicate any threat to the Matrix's status quo; yet, he also convincingly shows a very human mental struggle within Smith as to his role within the Matrix, which would evolve in the movie's next two sequels. All told, these three actors give excellent performances that lift this science fiction movie into a veritable masterpiece of the genre.

Of course, everyone will discuss the special effects. It is certainly money well-spent, and does intertwine smoothly with the message the writers had in mind about humans manipulating the fabric of the Matrix.

This movie is definitely a classic of epic film-making. The Waschowski brothers have created a universe as compelling and indelible as Lucas's ""Star Wars"" or James Cameron's ""Terminator"". Watch it.","8"

EXCELLENT action, sci fi movie that spawned the infamous bullet time, slow motion action scenes. It is very in depth and although you should know a thing or two about computers before watching it, ""the Matrix"" is guaranteed to provide it's viewers with plenty of action and a very cool story that makes you think. A very interesting experience over all.

"mjpiro","Marvelous Action and Story Hits The Matrix!!","21 May 2023","The Matrix is the story of how a group of people band together to fight against a system of controls that - for the purposes of this movie - are generated in one reality through agents and in another reality through squid-like sentinel robots. The Matrix is something of a complex movie but it is a fun type of complex movie the more that you think about it. Another way of analyzing this movie is through Biblical eyes, with the lead character named Neo and played very well by Keanu Reeves (Speed) with his compatriot Trinity played wonderfully by Carrie-Anne Moss (Memento) and also including the anchor of the team Morpheus played terrifically by Laurence Fishburne (John Wick: Chapter 4). Putting them in biblically terms, Neo can be seen as something of a ""new"" Christ with Trinity as something of a fighting Mary Magdalene and Morpheus as someone like John the Baptist, firmly believing in and always fighting for Neo throughout this film. These analogies aside, The Matrix is a tremendous film, groundbreaking really!! It's one of the films that introduced us to stylized violence in the cinema and has set the tone for action movies ever since it was released back in 1999!! The acting in The Matrix is very good also, you can't just have a good shoot 'em up movie and expect it to be good on those merits alone, the acting has to be good too and it was here!! Lana and Lilly Wachowski did a terrific job directing this movie by bringing all of the different personalities and talents together to tell a story that will stay a part of Hollywood forever!! Give the Wachowski brothers equal credit for writing a story that was both interesting and compelling and imaginative on many different scales!! Don Davis did a very good job composing the sound track to the Matrix - one that hit the necessary high points and supported when need be!! Kym Barrett did a nice job costuming everybody especially jumping from dystopian worlds to more understandable worlds, it wasn't an easy job costuming for this movie but Barrett pulled it off with ease!! The Matrix received an R when it was released back in 1999 so it is definitely a movie for adults looking for an escape!! My rare 9 out of 10 stars!!","10"
"len-21","9 on a scale of 10","17 April 1999","This was a long movie - during which my opinon changed somewhat. I usually try to avoid rating it until it is nearing completion - thinking about what could cause it to be rated one notch higher or lower between that point and the end. I just love statistics!

Anyway, for much of it, I had decided that the essence of the movie deserved a 7 and the special effects deserved a 9. But, the last half hour of Matrix is so sensational and unbelievable (the effects 10+ and the story and substance at least a strong 8), that I ultimately gave the movie a 9.

This is the best special effects movie ever made without question! If ever there was a movie to see at a big screen theater - this is it. Even those (including the person I went with) who don't love the genre (cross between Blade Runner, Aliens, and Terminator) will be mesmerized by the special effects.

I truly don't know what's next with special effects, however every few years I believe that I've seen a movie which moved them to a new level. And, each time, I can't imagine what more they can do. The exciting thing is that they will keep getting better - and I'll be there.","7"

Zion, the last human city is now the machines' target and only Neo can stop them. All three films have amazing special effects, hardcore fight choreography and decent acting.

The Matrix is the ultimate Martial Arts/Sci-Fi/Action film. Despite some major technological advances since 1999, The Matrix still holds up as one of the best action flicks of my generation. This movie is the strongest in the trilogy because it really gets everything started and doesn't go overboard on the sci-fi fantasy aspects like its successors. It's the ideas that are more amazing than anything. I remember seeing this and wishing that I could learn any martial art at the push of a button or run across walls or punch faster than the human psyche can comprehend. For about a year after the release of this film a lot of people took it literally and were actually convinced that they were in the Matrix, sure they were on psychedelic drugs but that's how strong the cultural impact of this film actually was. Several camera shots and action sequences have been ripped off by scores of other films including Resident Evil, Versus and several Jet Li films to name a few.

###

The time is approximately 200 years from now, planet Earth. Early in the 21st century, humans achieve functional artificial intelligence (AI) which instead of leading to a comfortable human-machine Singularity[1] results in an earth-razing cataclysm. Machines (computers) 1: Humans 0.

The machine uber-intelligence (MUI) that takes over is analogous to our ""Beast."" In a licentious twist of any physics I'm familiar with, the MUI needs energy, so it clones, incubates, and grows humans in vast fields of sealed chambers to take advantage of their electrical potential. Humans in name only: their consciousness is channeled via a sophisticated neural network set up by the MUI to resemble Earth of 1999, i.e. the Matrix.[2]

(You might ask why bother providing to these Eveready 'droids such a dream world where they seem to grow, live, love, and die as generations before them. You won, why not just turn their minds off entirely? Well, apparently the pod people don't generate the BTUs if they're bored.)

Not everyone in the Matrix is comfortable with the system. Thomas Anderson, who goes by the hacker name Neo (Keanu Reeves) is one such discontent. The few remaining real humans, led by Morpheus (Laurence Fishburne), believe Neo is ""the One"" who will ultimately free humanity from the Matrix and defeat the MUI.

They locate Neo, convince him to unplug (take the red pill), then spend weeks with him in training. The rebels hack into the Matrix where Neo visits the Oracle (Gloria Foster). Before they can safely exit, Morpheus is captured by agentsagents are the MUI's fearsome sentient programs that enforce the Matrix.

In the attempt to rescue Morpheus, Neo goes toe-to-toe with Super Agent Smith (Hugo Weaving) in a scene reminiscent of the final showdown in A Fistful of Dollars. Only the Wachowskis in addition to massive gunplay send up exciting martial arts sequences and special effects that blow you away.

In case you're the one person who hasn't seen the movie yet, I won't spoil the ending, except to say it's terrific.

To me the movie strikes parallels to our real world and our struggle against the Beast[3]. The Matrix itself is the epitome of our quasi-Orwellian, TV-mind-controlled nation: Consider our Beast's indoctrination systems (compulsory schools and the criminal justice system) and propaganda ministries (mainstream media and academic elites). Too many people enfold themselves into these pods of conformity. Agents are analogous to our central-system soldiers and cops turned against Constitutional liberty.

""The Matrix is a system, Neo. That system is our enemy. When you're inside, you look around, what do you see? Businessmen, teachers, lawyers, carpenters, the very minds of the people we are trying to save. But until we do, these people are still a part of that system, and that makes them our enemy. You have to understand most of these people are not ready to be unplugged, and many of them are so inured, so hopelessly dependent on the system that they will fight to protect it.""  Morpheus

How different is this from America or the world? ...

"aratron-00391","A true original Classic film","10 December 2020","I think this film is inspired by gnostic themes . The film was also influenced by another excellent film Dark City.

This film was a groundbreaker when it came out and continues to hold it's own. Watching the matrix is an experience not just a movie.

I have watched it multiple times and will continue to do so. All three movies in this trilogy are good but the first film is great. A must watch for all film fans.","9"
"MichaelMRamey","Still Holds Up Today","14 April 2018","This film is arguably one of - if not the - biggest film of the 2000s. Yes, I know it came out in 1999, but because of the sequels, The Matrix has a huge impact on film of the decade. Thanks to the practical effects, this Sci-Fi film still holds up even in today's CGI filled cinema. It is a story of finding you're ultimate potential and featuring some of the action sequences to ever be put on the big screen. I can't believe it took me so long to jump on this bandwagon.","10"
"Benslie","Still a classic to this day","1 April 2019","First of all, the fight scenes in this film are original and outstanding to watch. From the camera work to the wire work before this film, nothing had been done like this in film before. Also, all the actors trained hard so that most of the time it's them and not a stunt double which helps with the realism of the situation. The set design and cinematography is well chosen for each location so you fully understand where you are. From having green lighting when in the matrix to blue in the real world helps the viewer to understand the difference between the real world and the matrix. Also the set design and how the real world looks disgusting compared to the real world which looks amazing and way better. This film came out in 1999 and honestly the special effects in this film look way better than some nowadays. The special effects help convince the viewer how the real world is now a dystopian wasteland while shots that took place in the matrix was filmed on location. The acting in this film done by everybody was well cast for their roles and you can easily tell everybody was having a good time and gave it they're all. Nobody feels like they are dragging down this movie and that everybody has a part that is important to the film. But the main four actors you can obviously see they are giving it their all. Whether it be Keanu Reeves playing the main hero or Hugo Weaving playing the main villain you can easily see the character and not the actor. The character growth for Neo and Trinity from the start of the film to the end is there and is amazing to see. The pacing in this film is spectacular and you never feel like anything is slowing the film down. In the end, The Matrix is a classic film that everybody should check out at least once in their life.","10"
"thefan-2","Incredible effects","10 May 1999","The special effects are the best I have ever seen, and I've seen 'em all. The concept was a little too dorm-roomy for my taste. (Remember those earnest conversations in your sophomore year: ""What if I'm just a brain in a vat, man? And all this is, like, being fed into my mind by a mad scientist or something?"") I loved the actress who played Trinity. How many faces can survive such extreme close-ups? And what a surprise to learn, here on IMDb, that she was the female lead in a 1993 TV series called -- are you ready for this? -- ""Matrix""! Deja-vu, man.","8"
"darkneox119","Great Sci-Fi kung fu flick","8 August 2000","Keanu Reeves stars as Thomas Anderson, a.k.a. Neo in his cyber-hecker world. He receives various messages from the cyber-criminals, Trinity and Morpheous. After being chased down by the Agent Smith's, he gets bugged and winds up with Trinity. He is then introduced to the world as it is and seen as a possible savior. The movie has it's flaws but is made up by great action and special effects. Carrie Anne-Moss is baberiffic as Trinity. The movie throws alot of religious symbolism in the story. If you like kungu-fu and cool action, check this movie out. Not the greatest movie of 1999 but certainly one of the most visually breathtaking. This movie gets better with each viewing. I expected a whole different movie opposed to what I saw in the theater, but never the less I gave it a second chance and I'm glad I did. Check this out on DVD. The end sequence is excellent. ***1/2 out of ****","3"
"moviecollector","1 of the best sci-fi films ever!","15 March 2000","This movie just amazed me with its excellent special effects & excellent action sequences. This is Keanu's best movie yet & the perfect role for him. Fishburne who also starred in the excellent Event Horizon, shines here 2. & Trinity(Carrie Anne Moss) really & literally kicks butt. It maybe confusing the 1st time around & thats y u must see it again & again. This is mind-boggling, sci-fi thrill ride that every action & sci-fi fan must see & have in their own collection. I can't wait for the sequels. ""Follow the white rabbit.""","10"
"Mickey Knox","best SF ever","20 March 2001","The Matrix is the best SF ever, and one of the best movies I have ever seen. A perfect combination of great action, great directing, great and well built story, fabulous special effects and some meanings and hidden things that i think not many people have noticed. I do not have time right now, but soon i will write a full long review for this title, because it certainly deserves it. Vote: 10+ out of 10.","8"
"fugmo","Our true existence","24 November 1999","I'm surprised that this movie has been ranked so high on the All Time Top 250. While I enjoyed the movie and consider the plot quite original, I certainly don't think it deserves to be rated the 33rd best movie of all time. In fact, based on a scale for measuring movie quality, I would place ""The Matrix"" closer to ""Twister"" than ""The Godfather"". Again, it isn't that I disliked the movie but let's be real. ""The Matrix"" is nothing more than a very original and well done action movie.","6"
"Jdc102","Different...VERY different","25 April 1999","Many people loved the MATRIX, but I thought it was just alright, nothing terrible but the special effects were awsome, they totally made the movie come together, also Keanu Reeves was good, and so was Laurence Fishburne.. If I was the director I would have given the part of Neo to someone like Nicolas Cage, but Keanu did good..

Overall: If you like sci fi, this film's for you..","9"
"jake-law123","A world without rules, without limits.","24 June 2010","Wachowski brothers Andy and Lana create this mesmerizing sci-fi action film with awesome up the ass visual effects, solid editing, and an excellent cast. Keanu Reeves and Lawrence Fishbourne make a great team as two righteous individuals who go on a journey into another world, as they travel to the extent of visuals unimaginable.

Keanu Reeves stars as a computer hacker named Neo who goes through a weird series of incidents, and wines up in a different dimensional world with a mysterious man named Morpheus, along with a group of other people, as he learns the truth about mankind, and is shown a whole other world beyond the eyes.

Entertains you from beginning to end in a very bad ass way. Acting performances aren't the best, along with the slanted story due to the visuals, but doesn't bother you the least bit, if not just for a little bit. Your too concentrated on the stunning visuals, and the terrific editing, which is probably where this movie does best.

Although it takes awhile for the action to start, its all worth it when it finally kicks off, with insane action scenes that will get you all pumped up. Clever choreography, with fighting techniques, as well as shooting scenes included. Sound effects are awesome, and go great with the action.

I could go on forever, but in short, the visuals, action scenes, and editing are the three best things to look for in this film.","8"
"3 of 9","Am I the only person who thought this film was rubbish.","14 January 2001","In mu honest opinion, The matrix is a poor film.

The film is just a chance to show off modern special effects. It appears to me that they decided to forget about the story. Also I believe that Keanu Reeves was a terrible choice to play Neo. It didn't help that his charactor was a 1 dimensional cardboard cutout.","10"
"matija-trost","SCI-FI at its best...","14 March 2002","...effects? Certainly, till now. slow-mov shots, amazing fighting scenes, incredible explosions. But the question is...is this enough to make a sci-fi immortal or it will be obsolete in 5 years? ...story? Breathtaking, but not too intelligent, contains some minor spoilers. Despite that, a real rollercoaster. ...acting? Hey it's a sci-fi not a drama. Who cares. ...action? 100%. ...grade? 8 out of 10","7"
"the-antichrist-is-near","Timeless","26 March 2021","Beautifully shot with a mind-bending story. The acting has it's own style which i understand a lot of people weren't fond of, but I think it suits the whole computer-generated character idea very well.","10"
"Dantès","How many movies can we cram into one?","4 April 1999","At several points during the film, I found myself thinking, ""hey, this isn't so bad"", but then I realized that I was getting suckered by the special effects and martial arts scenes.

This movie is pretty average, with potential to be great, had it not ripped off of every other sci-fi movie there is. It's a great way to entertain yourself, trying to find all the other movies within the movie. For example, the idea of human resistance to the machines? Thank you 'Terminator'. There are also shades of Star Wars, Fire in the Sky, Dark City, Hackers... The list goes on and on.

Keanu Reeves gives a typically wooden performance, but it's really just an action movie, so it's excusable. Laurence Fishburne excels in a sadly cliched role as Morpheus, who is essentially Yoda on Pentium.

Basically, it's a matter of how you choose to take it. If it's just gratuitous special effects, and comic book-like plotlines, then it's very well done. However, in terms of originality, there is something sorely lacking. This is not a cerebral flick, so don't analyze too much or you'll hate it.","6"
"renaldo and clara","to all nerds","31 January 2001","Let me start off by saying that I don't regularly watch animae, though I respect it for what it's worth.

Before another 'animae-head' goes into detail on how The Matrix ""stole"" action scenes from movies like Ghost in the Shell or others, let me say this.

It is one thing to copy something that has been widely recognized to be part of another film entirely. Like, American Beauty and the motif of roses everywhere. If any other movie copied this (at least in the next 25 years) it would be a total rip-off and should be burned immediately. But, come on! Ghost in the Shell? In a case of animae-imitation, I would say The Wachowski Bros. were paying homage and practically doing GITSa favor by using their ***p, ok? So sue me=)

Copying anything from a film is only STUPID if it is clear the producers think they are copying a big-budget money-maker to ensure success. Or if they are trying to create the same atmosphere without original ideas of their own. (ie: A Little Princess's ripoff of The Secret Garden.)

However, to all you animae-phreaks, imitation is still the ""sincerest form of flattery.""

And stop finding so many ""goofs"", please!","10"
"renaldo and clara","Everything is just right....","13 December 2000","..from the acting to the soundtrack, to the visual effects, to all the twists...I just loved the fact that I could; FOR ONCE; watch a sci-fi movie and actually *understand* it the first time around.

But what I loved the most is how this flick takes you to another world. A world where being the lead character requires you to do the hardest things, because they're the right things. Like Blade Runner's Ford and ""5th Element's"" Willis, this movie takes you to another world; futuristic and intense.

How cool was it to refer to having 'deja-vu' as experiencing a glitch in the Matrix. ""It's when they change something"", Moss replies. That was cool!

Not sure about the plot holes, though. I didn't realize there were any.

I *do* think there could've been a lot less ""gun"" violence...the White Zombie song playing in the background while Reeves and Moss blow away innocent people could've easily been playing during martial arts scenes or the slow-motion 'dodge-the-bullet' moves.

Either way, 'The Matrix' is a 9.5 out of 10.","10"

"Jakemcclake","Great Super Climactic Sight and Sound Except...","14 July 2009","Spoilers

I believe I have seen the Matrix all the way through, one time, even though I own it. I watched the start of the movie, and Neo taking the red pill many times. However, I've have seen the climax of this movie about 300 times. This climax is very inspirational and almost as powerful as the dramatic climax of the ""Five By Five"" episode of the vampire TV show, ""Angel"" A character spawned from the ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer""). The IMDb user rating for the Matrix (8.9 stars) is identical to the IMDb rating for that ""Five By Five"" episode of Angel. When I want to feel good, I watch that ""Five By Five"" episode of Angel climax coupled with ""The Matrix"" climax about 3 times every week and never get tired of either one.

I saw the plot similar to the Matrix in an earlier little known & thought provoking movie starring WWE's ""Roudy Roddy Piper"" called ""They Live"". Therefore, the Matrix plot did not surprise me much or make me think. It seemed like the plot ""set up"" was copied from that other movie. This movie ""sets up"" that in the future, humans go through life serving creatures from outer space that enslaved us and use our energy. The enslavers keep us energetic by giving humans a false vision of the world achieved through a computer program called ""The Matrix"".

There are a small handful of humans aware of this. They live in a ship and are led by Morpheus (Laurence Fishburne) and Trinity (Carry Anne Moss). They seek ""The One"". ""The One"" has been for-told to have mental strength to overcome the controlling forces in the Matrix like Agent Smith. The find/contact Neo Anderson (Keuanu Reeves). They show him the truth about the real world, and explain the power needed to overcome the Matrix and train him. They even suspect he is ""The One"". Agent Smith an agent of the Matrix programming is more powerful than any human. Neo's has difficulty accepting this reality and he does not take to Morpheus' training.

In real life, Trinity and Morpheus have rescued Neo from the enslavement existence that most humans have and keep him alive on their ship. However, one of his crew Cypher tries to kill Neo in real life and fails to kill him, due to others intervening. Agent Smith the powerful agent of the Matrix program, has always kept the Matrix in tack. No one ever survived a confrontation with Agent Smith.

The Enslaving creatures find out about the ship and begin to charge through the ocean toward an attack on that ship. At this moment, Neo is killed by Mr. Smith in the Matrix and in real life Neo's heart stops. Also at that moment, Morpheus is shocked, and says, ""it can't be"" as he watches all hope for the human race die with Neo.

As Neo lies dead in the ship, Trinity tell his dead body that she is not afraid. Trinity says she has been told by the Oracle, that she would fall in love with ""The One"". She says she now realizes she loves Neo. Therefore, he is the one. She kisses his dead mouth. Miraculously, he begins breathing again. She says ""Get up."" Neo immediately arises in the Matrix to the shock of Mr. Smith and his friends, but they immediately fire a hail of bullets at Neo.

A split second before the numerous gun shots, Neo softly says ""No"".

As the bullets fly, Neo's ""No"" makes the bullets slow down, then stop in mid air, and then makes them fall harmlessly to the ground. The music hits a powerful crescendo climax as Morpheus is in awe of this power, and says what everyone watching realizes: ""He Is The One!"" Neo then easily annihilates Mr. Smith and afterward, we see all of the Matrix bend at Neo's will. Neo looks at Mr Smith's co-horts and they run. He comes out of the Matrix & somehow disbands the enslaving metallic creatures who have attacked their ship. Then Neo telephones the enslaving creatures and tells them, that he will show all humans enslaved in the Matrix a new world and they will free themselves.

Aside from having seen a similar plot ""Set Up"" in ""They Live"", the only real problem I had with this tremendous movie was that when the climactic music is played and the words ""He is the one"", is heard, we then look at Mr Smith and friends in a shot of green and white computer numbers forming their persons. I know it had to be done for the sake of the story, but it did not fit with the inspirational climactic music and the awesomeness of this scene. This is a minuscule flaw in something very inspirational. When looking to feel good, I usually play the ""Neo Is The One"" chapter of the Matrix to the end of the movie.","7"
"cosmorados","And I want to be someone important ...like an actor","5 June 2008","There is probably no better line in this film that illustrates the bizarre fallacy of out own daily lives than this.

For Neo (Keanu Reeves) his daily life is a series of disjointed and disconnected segments as he works as a software programmer by day and at night works as a computer hacker of sorts. This world is crashed in on by three black suited individuals who want to know more about what Neo is doing and his attempts to make contact with an individual called Morpheus, who, we are told, is as a suspected terrorist. As the movie moves on the world around Neo seems to change by the second as he searches for answers to discover what the matrix is.

""Unfortunately, no-one can be told what the matrix is. You have to see it for yourself."" and therein lies the big reveal as the Matrix is nothing like you anticipate or expect. After this all the rules that usually apply to films to action sequences to good and evil and even gravity are bent, twisted and downright broken as the film moves towards it's inevitable, pre-destined within it, conclusion.

""There is no spoon,""

The Matrix was a groundbreaking film when it came out and whilst two inferior sequels have dimmed some of the appeal for people, if you do what I do, which is wilfully disregard them the same way that I do with the Highlander sequels, then you still have one of the greatest sci-fi films of all time, a film that leaves with you when you walk out of the pictures and makes you question every aspect of the world which we perceive to be the real world.

When I first watched the film I was left totally baffled by Morpheus initial dialogue of what the Matrix was and then left spellbound when I discovered what lay beyond. The learning curve the Neo experiences, we experience with him, we fear when he is not the one, worry when we learn of the fate of Morpheus and cheer as lives out his predicted fate, the good, as well as the bad.

The action sequences are breath taking and the lobby sequence is one of the most amazing of all time, yet the great thing about it, is that it means nothing without the rest of the movie wrapped round it.

No bad scenes and no bad acting.

The only downside, it was done in Doctor Who first and it's not Empire Strikes Back.

still, an extremely worthy nine and deserves it's place in the 250.

Wachowski's Maesterpiece","9"
"jwh-2","worth every cent I paid (I saw it for free)","30 March 1999","There are few words that describe ""The Matrix,"" but derivative, loud, painful, and disappointing would be a good start. From a plot straight out of a Dick or Gibson novel, to the agony of watching Laurence Fishburne recite pages of truly awful exposition, this is a film that tries really hard, but often misses the mark. To be fair, the film is aiming high and the middle third works really well. The sets, costumes and effects are terrific and the stunts and fight scenes are pretty wild. There are also some nice metaphors playing out, and there is a serious parable being told here. The dialogue during the middle is also sharp and witty, and makes me wonder who wrote the rest of it, particularly all the scenes where Fishburne and Keanu Reeves play Obi Wan and Luke Skywalker. (""The matrix surrounds us, it penetrates us...."" And I thought the next Star Wars movie wasn't coming out until May.) The film can't decide if it wants to be Aliens, Johnny Mnemonic, a Borg episode, a John Woo film, or a Gap ad, so it borrows lots from all of them and ends up being too little of each. Like a lot of sf films lately, there was a really good movie in here struggling to get out. But it never makes it.","4"
"robertofuiano","Good film.","13 October 2008","If this movie was Spielberg would have had more. Since these strontium on the assumption that a film must be beautiful to be directed by big names like Spielberg, Lucas, Jackson, Cameron. .. All these assessments are wrong you understand the level of bad opinion of this site. Only films for intellectuals can be saved. This film was produced with many dollars and the optimal use of special effects make the place as among the best science fiction film Americans.

"feaf1979","Yeah, you might consider it a breakthrough but...","11 December 2009","..I reckon it's aimed for a certain type of viewers.

I love Action, Sci-fi, and so on; However, and believe me I have tried, never found that greatness that many were on about after its release.

Therefore, I just cannot get all the cult movement it created afterward (black coats, tattoos, slang,...) For me it was a very original film, nice fights (although the effects were not all that) and just average interpretations from the cast with the exception of the always effective Hugo Weaving (Agent Smith) and little more.

I would not recommend it to those who do not have an open mind for fantasy and Sci-fi.

"ajdagreat","what more can I say?","17 August 2001","What else can I say about this fabulous movie? What more is there to say? This movie is very cool (even Keanu Reeves's very overrated acting ability can't ruin it).

The only additional thing I wanted to say was, if you are a parent wondering if this movie is OK for your kid to see, go for it. I was wondering why this film is rated R the whole time. I didn't catch one f-word, so this movie must just be R for violence, which isn't that bad.","9"

"abooboo-2","#29?!?! UH, OKAY.","1 November 1999","The concept is original, but I was amazed at how unintentionally hilarious most of this film is. All those times characters kept reverentially referring to blank, uninspiring Keanu Reeves as ""the one""; all the over the top martial arts posing and meaningless, new-agey babble - this is just an under-ventilated, overblown hodgepodge of a few good ideas hopelessly overpowered by a dizzying number of brainless cliches.

Once again, the MTV generation mistakes a lot of noise and flashy editing for good filmmaking. If it wasn't for the clever special effects, this would be MSTK3 fodder all the way.","10"
"cofemug","Mindblowing!","9 April 1999","No, I am not quoting from a famous writer, that is what I feel! I should have been getting bored of watching movies because I saw ""Out of Sight"" on Friday, ""Reefer Madness"" on Saturday, ""EdTV"" on Sunday, ""8MM"" on Monday, ""Lord of Illusions"" on Tuesday, and this movie on Wednesday. After a line up like that, generally I would be getting bored of movies, but I loved this movie. This movie held my attention all the way through its 2 hours+

Plot: I cannot explain it. ""You'll have to see it for yourself."" The concept is strange, and I liked it. It explains a lot. I could just barely follow the plot as the movie was flying by at breakneck speed (although the plot wasn't). It is complicated, so pay attention. If you like mind-numbing movies, wait for summer action flix to come out.

Acting: It was decent. I mean, Keanu Reeves sucks as an actor, but Fishburne rocks. He is one of the hottest actors of current cinema. Don't miss ""Pulp Fiction."" The actress is good, but good looking too. Man was she hot in her clothes. You can surpass the acting for the rest of the movie though.

Action and Effects:Outstanding. Easily the best effects for a long time. The bullets, and the staging were great. The choreographed action scenes looked like they were from John Woo. The effects were all over the place. This is one of the movies where the actors don't take the back seat to the effects. They actually work with them, and it seems to work. The action sequences were many, and it was great. Definitely see this movie in the theater because of the effects, and sound, and because it is wide-widescreen. (It has a 2.33:1 ratio, whereas with formatted movies, they cut off the sides to make it 1.33:1. That is 3/7 or almost half of the screen.)

The music is awesome techno; metal; rock and roll. I will definitely buy the soundtrack. Stay for credits when Marilyn Manson's ""Rock Is Dead"" is played through movie theater-quality speakers. Perfection.

Do not miss this movie in theaters. It is one of the best action movies since ""Face-off,"" and one of the best sci-fi flicks ever, esp. since ""Alien."" I give this movie a nine because it had some hokiness, and cliches, but all movie so anyways.------------9","10"

"50fiftillidideeBrain","Out Of The Cubicle & Into The Rubicon ~💊~ Escape The Binary Prison","20 January 2022","I just watched The Matrix for easily the 12th time, but it could be the 20th.

It still ROX.

A 1999 release, it's a challenge to process the fact that The Matrix is now a classic, being over 20 yrs old. It changed the world - Of action/sci-fi thrillers.

I saw TM right after it's release in theaters, and it was better than a foil Pokemon card - it was da bomb: You're men are already dead. Follow the white rabbit. Late for work at the cubicle crucible. Window washer squeaking the squeegee. Getting arrested. Mouth sealed up. Bugged. Deja Vu. Betrayal and awakening. All golden are these.

They devised industry revolutionizing fight scenes and moves that STILL thrill. Top it off with a solid and thoughtful script containing relatively few issues and plenty to ponder, this flick is a major player in the history of cinema.

TM was a new and amazing take on the killer robot/machines trope: Humankind can be crushed by technology. Even the building where Neo meets Morpheous is reminiscent of the building in which the robots/Replicants were hiding out in Blade Runner, which is in the same subset as TM.

The commentary that came with the DVD (kids, just ask your grandparents about DVD's) is informative, revealing the level of detail that was invested in the production. Even when viewers may not consciously notice every artistic touch, the subconscious does pick up on the coding, and it affects the enjoyment level.

TM is in drab colors. It has industrial, cheerless hues of green, yellow, and beige-neutre (that's French for neutral tan) with no blues. This represents the oppressive mediocrity of life inside. Agent Smith gives Neo the reason: Matrix programs providing happy, perfect lives were a total failure. Humans expect misery. Some even crave it.

Carrie Ann Moss won the role of Trinity by literally fighting in a cage match, of sorts, for it. Her resume included only TV and a handful of low rated movies. They took a chance on an unproven actor (but the best fighter) for this crucial role, and they made the right choice. Physically, she always seemed slightly older than Neo. She's actually 3 years younger. Keanu has always looked quite a bit younger than his age. Watching Carrie now, on shows like Jessica Jones, reveals that she is still stunning and she hasn't aged much at all in 22 years. She belongs in TM, and I've never seen anyone else do her amazing overhead kicks.

The gang that comes to pick up their bootleg merch at Neo's apartment drops foreshadowing. The dude asks if Neo wants Mescaline for a good ride? The White Rabbit makes itself known - get ready for a trip through the looking glass. For viewers that didn't catch the Alice In Wonderland reference, Cypher brings up The Wizard of Oz when he quips that Kansas is going ""bye-bye,"" Dorothy. It's code for: They'll be trippin on this trip.

In the way of trivia, the ""White Rabbit Girl"" is a ""thing."" She's played by Australian actress Ada Nicodemou. With 1 word, a look, and a smile she robs that scene, which isn't an easy thing to do in a movie like The Matrix. It's like hitting for the cycle in baseball as a rookie. She's an early highlight in the film. While Ms Nicodemou scorched an impression, she's only been in 9 shows/movies, having appeared in over 2000 episodes of Home And Away. When Neo follows said rabbit and meets Trinity, it's filmed at an actual S&M club. Those aren't actors, folks.

They had one chance for the lobby scene, and they pummeled it. Shots, (camera shots and heavy artillery) the like of which had never been seen before, quantity and quality-wise, such as the elevator door blowing out from the explosion, or raining bullet casings, are routine. The helicopter colliding into the glass building, causing waves of ripples in the glass that looked like a stone plunking in the water, is O-Maze-Ing.

They did an excellent job of building up the agents as terrifyingly deadly. It makes the western style showdown in the subway akin to a half-time show. A crack in Agent Smith's glasses closes out that scene, and it is the beginning of Neo's awakening, as well as the beginning of The End.

Thrills abound from Trinity spiraling through the air in the opening scenes, to Neo stopping bullets and diving into Agent Smith with the new sound of inevitability. Lightening cracks when the red pill goes down. Drop-zooming onto a building top for the jump program is so fast it still makes me woozy. Learning how to fly a helicopter, or to do Jujitsu, in mere seconds ain't just thrilling, it sounds like a dream come true. What a pity we didn't get too see any drunken boxing.

TM wrote in some horror. When Neo's mouth seals up during questioning, it's creepy, as is the wire bug. Wired. Bugged. They tossed in gems like that all over the place. And around we go. It's all still scary today. Rescuing Neo from his 'Coppertop' pod is a disgusting scene. All of it is still insane in the membrane.

Self-reflection is preached through mirrors. Neo plays with a mirror after taking that dreaded red pill. In the shot where Morpheous holds out the red&blue pills, and Neo makes his selection, Morpheous is wearing mirror lenses. Per reports, that shot was incredibly difficult. Yet, they put in the effort to do it. Who doesn't remember looking at Neo make his choice through Morpheous's glasses? Reflections also appear on doorknobs and other things, so the message to look at ourselves in the mirror and to question one's choices is loud and clear.

""Do You Think That's Air You Are Breathing?"" There is no spoon... Is there? The main theme encourages viewers to question reality. Don't be sheeple. Question the system. Question your cubicle life. There are intelligent people out there that believe there is no reality; we've constructed it in our heads, they claim. How would they know? Nobody's that smart. While people should have reality checks from time to time, believing that nothing is real will absolutely drive one insane. Reality is just as real as 2+2=4. Know Thyself, is what's on the plaque in The Oracle's kitchen. It's survival 101 - Know you are real, and what you do matters. Mostly know that to be sure of anything that conflicts with that statement will be destructive.

None of the philosophy is simplistic in TM. While they are posing questions, they aren't necessarily providing answers. Even the traitor Cypher, in that Lucifer goatee, posed valid challenges to Morpheous's decisions by way of defending his own actions, though Cypher should have known his selfish solution wouldn't work. Did Morpheous set them free? Did he deceive them? Yes, and no x2. Yes, he set them free, but to a hard reality. No, he didn't deceive them. Reality has to be experienced to be believed, but he certainly didn't tell them everything. Somebody who wants to believe as Cypher believes would have sufficient ammo to do so. As they tell us, the mind makes it real. While TM liberally incorporates Eastern religious beliefs, the concept of being freed, by a Messiah, from a life of slavish and meaninglessness existence, in order to toil for the physical and spiritual welfare of humanity, looking to freedom in Zion as the reward, is absolutely consistent with Christian doctrine. TM is laden with (mostly positive) varied spiritual messages that add layers to the complexity.

As far it's influence in society, TM reprogrammed us. Red pill: It's like a Shakespearean idiom. It's going to be around for centuries, it seems. Men named Anderson may still be referred to in Agent Smith's voice: MR. AN'derson. We met Hugo Weaving (Agent Smith), and Carrie Ann Moss, both of whom have gone on to star in other successful ventures, playing major roles. The fighting moves that defy gravity still show up in entertainment, particularly as a running bit. It's all good attention. Keanu Reeves was already a big star, but TM put him in the mega star category. TM is The Standard for alternate reality stories, and the one to beat in the sci-fi category.

It's a classic, and it's stood the time test, being a great watch still. Listen to your inner Oracle, dial in, grab that red pill and gulp it down for one of the great rides of your life.

"Kubris","One of the coolest films ever","4 August 2011","IMDb Top 250: 23

The Matrix is an unreasonably awesome movie. The stunts, the effects, the black suits and shades- The Matrix is dripping awesomeness. But unlike many other action and sci-fi movies, The Matrix has brains.

The plot of The Matrix is like Terminator for the internet generation. Man created machine, machine rebelled, machine won. Human survivors fight machines in a constantly dark, post-apocalyptic world. But the machines created the matrix, a giant computer program where the farmed humans' minds live their 'lives'. It's complicated, but it all makes sense. The Matrix's plot demands brain and eye attention.

The actors are perfectly chosen. Keanu Reeves in a role where he's supposed to be quiet and badass? Perfect! He was made to be Neo. Laurence Fishborne aces the wise leader, and he busts his chops during the interrogation. Hugo Weaving is really the show stealer though: his Agent is so menacing, and when he opens up to Morpheus, it's very tense.

This is an action movie, and boy is there action. The martial arts scenes are so incredible, and the insanity allowed because of the setting makes them even better. Running air kicks? Punches that break walls? It's all cool in the matrix. And the gunfights: the iconic lobby shootout, and the even more iconic bullettime gives The Matrix identity in a sea of sci-fi.

The action is boosted by the success of the effects. Agent bullet dodging, the explosions, the rippling bullets, your jaw will drop. The ""fluff effect"" in the lobby is so cool too. It made me wonder why this has never been seen in 3D. Also, the CGI machines are terrifying and realistic.

You should see The Matrix, benchmark of sci-fi films for the past decade. Matching brawn with brain, you really can't miss this modern classic. 9.4/10","9"
"SpaaceMonkee","The Benchmark of Stylistic Action","29 November 2020","The Matrix was one of the movies that defined my childhood moviegoing. Revisiting it some two decades after its release (makes me feel a little old and) cements its status as one of the definitive films of the action genre.

The grievances first: The dialogue can be corny and the arc of the plot certainly displays some not-so-subtle messianic trends. And, the acting often veers towards a rather blank, stock-character type.

And now, the achievements: The Matrix unquestionably set the bar for every 21st century action film that followed. Bullet time, slow-mo, and the highly stylized fight scenes each spawned countless imitators. Though the techniques entered the wider mainstream afterwards, no movie since has matched the Matrix in terms of pure style. Without any spoilers, I believe the lobby scene is possibly the most perfectly stylish action scene ever shot.

On plot, I will say little. The movie does a fantastic job of raising some deep, existential questions, but I will not rate it a masterpiece on those grounds, as many of the reviews seem to do. Raising a legitimate question and saying something worthwhile in response are two very different things. Had the series stopped here and left the answering to the viewer, I would give the film a 9. But, the series continued, and taking its sequels into consideration, it's clear that we won't be finding coherent answers here.

Overall, it's a masterpiece of late 90s cinema and an action film that set the bar for everything that followed, but it's also a film that fell victim to the idea of a series. The Matrix, once and for all, should have ended with Zach de la Rocha screaming the viewer off into the credits.","10"
"Fudge-3","Recommended all action movie. 9/10.","19 June 1999","A most amazing film. Amazing because it avoids mistakes that so often plague formula Hollywood action movies. The sound track rocks. The excellent special effects are never over done or pushed into your face. There is (some) real acting. There are lots of bangs - always a good thing :) - but the gunfights, explosions and chases have a unique nature.

The story unfolds over the first half hour after which you find out what the matrix is. Pleasantly the trailer does not give away the plot - a pet hate of mine. The powerful 'Agents' make great villains and the confrontations with them are ramped up to a suitably explosive conclusion.

Go see this film and see if you don't let out a relieved giggle after ""the lobby scene"" which will go down in movie history as a benchmark for action films. I don't expect to see a better action film this year and that includes Phantom Menace.","10"

One is the doomsday world, devastated by hunger and cold, and the danger of being hunted down by robots.Another is the warm and peaceful era, with blue sky and white clouds, beautiful scenery, and even the opportunity to become a successful person.

Indeed, everyone knows that no matter how beautiful a dream is, it is only a dream. But Sever was willing to betray everyone just for a dream. If we really escape the matrix and experience the cruelty of reality, maybe we will make the same decision as Sever. Just like when you have a great dream, you would rather stay in the dream than wake up.","7"

At both of the films most of the people aware of what was happening. At both films savior doesn't believe that he has got powers.

nothing to write home on the acting front, any pretty face would have fit the bill, but the unbelievable effects keeps one bound to the screen right through. the smart touches, like the ""deja-vu"" effect add to the enjoyment.

the best thing about the movie however is the solid story-line, not unlike an exaggerated 1984 (the george orwell book). its a surprisingly strong story for a special effects laden action movie.

Everything in it: The visual style, the pace, the computer special effects, the Hong Kong inspired action sequences, the anime inspired characters, the stylish ultra violence, and the cyber storyline, was all pointing that many cultural and technological issues needed to be ripe enough for people to get the movie. The Matrix was tailor made for-and-by a videogame, internet, cellular, cool gadget generation which I'm proud to be part of.

I will say that Matrix: Reloaded is a far more stunning and brilliant film than this could ever hope to be. I feel sorry for anyone who would call this the best movie ever or say that it's stupid CGI effects are the best in the world because you know what, CGI is not the best use for special effects. I don't see how anyone could think so. When you see it, it never blends in and is always annoyingly showing and out of place. If you look at older films you can see that love was put into prosthetic pieces and mate paintings which will always generate more awe than CGI can muster. To date there has only been one movie to properly use CGI and it was Jurrassic Park and the only reason that worked was because it was one of the first times it had ever been scene, especially in the detail that that film showed. So get over your selves Matrix geeks this sucks and should be avoided.","9"
"jonnyfendi","Smart Movie With Crazy Action!","17 April 2010","""The Matrix"" is the best action movie has ever made on my list. When ""The Matrix"" was released on its time, thiz movie contributes many breakthrough methods for cinema world. The movie is directed by Larry and Andy Wachowski who was under radar all these times. They are only known as small budget film Directors in ""Bound"" (1996). Later, ""The Matrix"" has two more back-to-back sequels which are ""Matrix Reloaded"" and ""Matrix Revolution"" in 2003. You can almost classify the stars in thiz movie as B-Class Actors, if it's not because of Keanu Reeves, but still the outcome is beyond the expectations. Each of the characters like Neo (Keanu Reeves), Morpheus (Laurence Fishburne), Trinity (Carrie-Anne Moss) , even the villain Agent Smith (Hugo Weaving) have already become a legendary icon in the industry. One of the strengths of thiz movie is the phenomenal action scenes. The fight scenes are something new and different, which is later followed by other movies. Behind that extraordinary fight scenes are experienced Martial Arts Choreographer Yuen Woo Ping. Woo Ping is the man behind ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"" (2000), ""Kill Bill"" (2003),""The Forbidden Kingdom"" (2008) and even Jackie Chan's Kung Fu classic like ""Snake in the Eagle's Shadow"" (1978). His experiences in a lot of Asian movies made him effective. The movie definitely exceeds our imagination. As a matter of fact, many people do not understand entirely the story of ""The Matrix"", there are still many blank spots to be answered. Eventually, the movie is filled with countless great philosophies inside. It seems like Wachowski Brothers have discovered how to make a brilliant concept for the story by fetching the philosophies from some religions. The essence is not that simple as it looks, actually we will always have something new every time we watch it over and over again. ""The Matrix"" is a smart movie and will always be one of my favorite movies of all-time!

"Blade_Le_Flambeur","An interesting blend of science fiction and action","19 May 2003","When The Matrix was released, the Wachowski Brothers and Joel Silver had no idea that it would catch flame and become one of the most popular movies of the generation. Fusing surreal and mind- bending action sequences with deep biblical refrences, The Matrix isn't single- minded or requires a real mood to watch. The acting, is solid, most noteably by Lawrence Fishburne and Hugo Weaving but the rest of the cast utters their lines without much care. The script tries it's best to pick off on the details of the real world versus the Matrix and suceeds somewhat, but when the characters talk as if they are very smart and sophisticated it doesn't really click in. The direction provided by the Wachowski brothers is intense and sharp, trying it's best to penetrate through the usual cliched science fiction movie and create something more. They immensley suceed and pull everything together well. However, the characters felt a bit shallow and under- written but the effects seem to make up for it. The action fits in with the rest of the story well, causing a natural balance between the two which was severed in the newly released sequel; The Matrix Reloaded. Of course, the effects are amazing and started a whole new wave of slow- motion effects. The computers are very well blended into the rest of the movie, so they don't stick out as being the ultimate focus, which they aren't. Overall, The Matrix is a good movie, it has it's fair share of flaws but it stands out as being something original and innovative. 8.5/10","8"

The world that The Matrix creates and the character where absolutely sublime. Not to mention the action, WOW!

The story is great. It went in a direction I never expected. As with most people I have heard of The Matrix before but I personally hadn't watch this. As for a first time viewing I was surprised. In a good way of course. The story I thought was absolutely fine and although I wouldn't say a perfect ten, it was still an absolute treat.

The characters where great. I really enjoyed Keanu Reeves (Neo), his development from the start until the end I though was almost a perfect ten. Trinity and Morpheus I thought where good too (although not as impressive). The way they are casted into this movie is rather impressive. They are characters that I enjoyed throughout my watching experience and though a necessary addition to the movie. The other character (not Neo, Trinity or Morpheus) where not as impressive but they are still acted well and I have no big negatives about the rest of the cast. They may not be as important as the main trio, but that's absolutely fine for this movie. Overall, Neo is an amazing character and his two backups are great.

The action was impressive in some scenes although I don't rate it as highly as others seem to do. The scene everyone knows (even if you haven't seen the movie) where Neo dodge's the butters in a limbo-like fashion is rather impressive and the ending scene I also enjoy rather heavily. But the rest where ok. Nothing I thought was terrible just some action scenes where simply good, nothing spectacular. Of course the fact there are great action pieces mixed in-between all of this makes it a good watch (even if all you want is action). Although I believe the characters do a good job if that alone.

Cast - 9/10

Action - 8/10

''The Matrix'' is not really what I've expected. Even though some brilliant special effects, it was only towards the end of the movie that it got exciting. The Wachowski-brothers has made a really wellmade movie, but hornestly, John Woo does it better. Everything was better in ''Face/Off'' for example. Keanu Reeves is not one of the best actors in the world, and this movie really tries to confuse us in a way that Terry Gilliam tried in ''Twelve Monkeys'' but it still ends up like an ordinary ''Bye Bye-Brain'' action movie. Only better made. If the brothers just made a more entertaining script, this would be really good!

"Asteri-Atypical","Better than most! Worth seeing.","26 May 2001","Certainly this film was interesting and groundbreaking.

The effects broke new ground. What made this film also unique in this era was not only the look and feel, but there was actually an INTERESTING CONCEPT behind it! Wow! A 90's film that wasn't brain dead!

Most action films are so stupid they are pathetic. While this film was not literary genius, it was a good plot and a great concept. Unheard of in an ACTION film. The concept also was such that it allowed for the suspension of logic in the action. Instead of stupidly ignoring science and physics, this film said ""none of this is real""! What better venue in which to create a surreal world?

While the cocept was almost brilliant and the plot was reasonably well developed, I wish the writers had gone just a little farther with the intelligent potential this concept offered. It was still a little ""dumbed down""; just not as much as most movies today. If this film had added a little more time and expanded on the concepts, plus added a higher education level to the dialogue, it could have been one of the greats of all time.

Still, this movie remains a rare breath of fresh air in a world of otherwise hackneyed plots and trite dialogue.","8"
"cocaine_rodeo","Free Your Mind","8 December 2001","This is one of my favorite movies. It is the most intelligent action movie I've ever seen. It's one of those movies that are just fun to watch, because even if you don't get it (I didn't the first time I saw it), you can still enjoy the massive action scenes, the great visual effects, and the amazing choreography of the fight scenes. I also really liked the acting. This is the first Keanu Reeves movie in which I could take him seriously and not see him as the time traveling valley dude Ted (I thought the Bill and Ted movies were very funny though). He is convincing, and he is a likable character, so that makes it all the more enjoyable to watch him undergo the many secrets of the Matrix.

Carrie-Anne Moss was also very cool and sexy as Trinity. She has a good deal of talent and I hope type casting doesn't end her career like so many other Sci-Fi movie actors (i.e. Mark Hammel and Roy Schieder). And of course, who could forget the great Laurence Fishburne, who made Morpheus such a cool character. I really think that only Laurence Fishburne could have done such a good job of doing Morpheus.

I think this movie is for pretty much everyone. The only people I think that wouldn't like this movie are people that can't handle even a little violence, or are upset at the idea of a bleak future (which is probably where the earth is headed anyway, more or less). It's just a kick ass movie. Check it out. 10/10","10"
"BB-15","A Mediocre Sci-Fi Rehash","25 September 1999","I can understand how the Matrix was so successful. With lots of gun shots and explosions per minute, good special effects, stylish actors and a few solid sci-fi ideas what more could you ask for?

Let's begin with some original plot ideas. My problem I guess is that I have seen a lot of sci-fi movies and TV shows. So, basic plot retreads do not excite me. The beginning of The Matrix starts out like Scanners (1981) introducing people who have incredible powers. Then it shifts to the virtual reality, world is illusion, phase (done at least 50 times on the various Star Trek series and Virtuosity, 1995; Strange Days, 1995, etc.). Then comes the machines take over humanity surprise (Star Trek First Contact-the Borg and Terminator 2). The rebels in the Matrix are looking for a Messianic leader (check out the original Terminator).

How about showing some original style? I recommend Dark City (1998) which accomplishes this very well. The Matrix is a blend of Blade (1998) and Terminator 2. We have acrobatic actors firing machine guns in slow motion, big deal.

Does the plot make sense? Sometimes, but it is very inconsistent. The idea that the machine/bad guys would fight with guns in the virtual reality world is absurd. This is a computer controlled reality after all of the 22nd century. Why limit yourself to clunky guns?

How about some decent dialogue? The love interest in this film is a joke. Trinity's (Carrie-Anne Moss) lines at the end of the film are terrible. You want an excellent heroine? Try Linda Hamilton in the Terminator films. Between the posing and posturing and the fight scenes what is being said by the crew most of the time is pretty lame. You want to see good scenes of a crew under pressure? Try the first two Alien movies.

What is there to like about The Matrix? The editing, sound, camera work, stunts and computer graphics are good. Lawrence Fishburne turns in a fine performance as usual. Also, all of the action and special effects are able to cover for Keanu Reeves who turns in a flat performance as usual. Briefly, in the middle of the film when the pace slowed in a scene with the ""oracle"" the characters and plot became a bit more interesting. But then it was lock and load time.

What really bothers me about The Matrix is that this mediocre retread is rated higher by imdb members than these great films; Blade Runner (1982), Alien (1979), Aliens (1986) and Terminator 2 which is outrageous. The Matrix does not belong in the top 200 movies. This will take care of itself in a few years because this oracle predicts that by 2010 hardly anybody will care about this film.","9"

"Eric-1226","A fun movie, Keanu is good, but Matrix should be remade as a comedy","10 December 2001","Yes, I thought it was a fun movie, because it just takes you on a mad roller coaster-like adventure through the real-unreal world of the Matrix. And all kinds of cool high-tech stuff happens, and lots of stuff gets blown up, and ""faster than a speeding bullet"" is a relative concept in this twisted time-space-reality continuum.

I personally am not a big science fiction fan, (either in books or in film) because typically I just don't ""get it"" as far as what the heck they are really talking about (I guess I need more approachable subject matter). But I actually liked Matrix, it has enough high-tech action stuff happening, and enough vague, mysterious tension going on to keep me suitably riveted to the tube.

That being said, I think this movie should be remade as a comedy. I recently saw ""Tank Girl"" and in that movie I was amazed at how well comedy works in a futuristic, sci-fi setting.

I thought many of the dialogue lines in Matrix were downright corny (sorry, I forgot to write down a sampling...), and there were times where I couldn't help but mentally rewrite certain scenes to be redone as twisted comedy. Like, when Keanu's character goes to meet the Oracle, what if the Oracle turned out to be... Larry Ellison!! (or Ross Perot, or Alice Cooper, or Madonna... heck, be creative, pick your own favorite but offbeat ""Oracle"" character to appear here). And when Neo is having that gunfight showdown with the Agent, it could have been rewritten to have him crazily jumping all around and bouncing off walls to avoid the bullets, kind of like Jim Carrey's character did in The Mask.

Finally, let me say that I actually admire Keanu Reeves, and his performance in this movie is quite good (IMHO). Some people think he is too wooden, whereas I liken his style more to a quiet intensity ala Clint Eastwood. I must admit, that it was years before I got around to ""liking"" Clint Eastwood. In his early spaghetti western movies, in the Dirty Harry series, heck, I just didn't see what all the fuss was about. Then, one day I watched ""The Outlaw Josey Wales"" and it was truly an epiphany. Not only did that excellent movie make me a believer in Clint Eastwood, but it rekindled an interest in westerns, and actually made me want to go re-watch many of the great westerns, including some of the earlier ones with Clint Eastwood, that I had heretofore dismissed.

In short, ""Matrix"": not such a bad movie at all, Keanu Reeves is more intense than you may realize, and go see ""Tank Girl"" and ""The Outlaw Josey Wales"".","10"
"Phisocal","Dodging bullets and kicking men with suits","21 November 2003","When the Matrix was first released in 1999 I thought ""Oh, another sci-fi spin off!"" and generally rejected it as not my sort of film. Boy, how wrong was I?! I first borrowed it from someone and when I watched it I thought ""Oh my god I've missed so much!"". I was totally blown away by it!

From Trinity's slow-mo kick to Neo's bullet dodging I was exhilarated not because of the film's plot (even though the plot is very good) but because I realised where all the slo-mo and bullet time (especially from Max Payne) came from. The most interesting character (and I'm sure most people will agree with me) is Agent Smith; he is so very suave and cool. Don't you just love that black suit and tie!

The gunplay and special effects are also breathtakingly realistic, even the bullets have tremendous detail as they disturb the air. Overall, the Matrix is a great movie and remains one of my best. Also check out my comments on the other two films.","4"

And even better Keanu Reeves improves himself above a joke of an actor (although Devil's Advocate was a good movie). A lot of cool action, inventive special effects and high tension of action scenes. The characters were likable and though there are some Jesus parallels, you won't care cause you'll be wrapped up in the great story. Can't wait for the next films (it's gonna be a trilogy. Hey, same with Blade. How come action/sci-fi flicks are going trilogy these days. Probably due to Star Wars.)","8"
"samhendersonthemovieman","Inception meets Ready Player One!","30 August 2020","Let me start by saying that I don't watch R rated movies, but this is one of the two watchable ones for me besides from The Patriot. Like The Patriot, The Matrix is only rated R for violence and nothing else besides from that. I haven't seen The Matrix sequels, but I don't plan to. When I first watched it, it reminded me a lot of Inception and Ready Player One since it takes in a dream world or virtual reality. Like Inception, the plot may complicate some people. The visual effects are frickin' amazing and crazy. The action sequences are non-stop insane! The acting from Keanu Reeves, Lawrence Fishburne, and Hugo Weaving are enjoyable. Keanu Reeves is the one who steals the show throughout the movie such as ""I know kung fu"". There are a few scenes that would creep you out a little. The sound editing and mixing are fantastically fantastic! For me, The Matrix is very original and imaginative. It's intense, but I think a lot of teens will be able to handle it. It's probably one of the best movies of all time and one of the top action or sci-fi movies ever made. Like I said, I've never seen The Matrix sequels and I don't plan to watch them because I don't watch R rated movies.","10"
"InterMedia-1221","Break the Matrix","1 October 2023","The Matrix"" is a 1999 science fiction action film directed by the Wachowskis, starring Keanu Reeves, Laurence Fishburne, Carrie-Anne Moss, Hugo Weaving, and Joe Pantoliano. The movie depicts a dystopian future where humanity is trapped inside the Matrix, a shared simulated reality that intelligent machines have created to distract humans while using their bodies as an energy source. After humans blocked the machines' access to solar energy, the machines responded by enslaving humankind and harvesting their bioelectric power while keeping their minds pacified in the Matrix. The movie was a massive success at the box office, grossing over $460 million on a $63 million budget, becoming the highest-grossing Warner Bros. Film of 1999 and the fourth highest-grossing film of that year.","2"
"senorita_belle","Cool slow motion","30 September 2004","This is the coolest scifi movie I've ever seen. The story was so complicated but the idea was very creative. No other story like this story. It had a strong script and strong actions. The visual effect was so great. Many new looking explosions. Such as that helicopter crash. It was very awesome. And of course the bullets time, the slow motion. It was a fresh looking for an action movie. Cool choreography which Neo did. I had to watch 2 times before I understand what movie is about. What is the matrix is still a mystery. But, I don't care. The movie was so great. Just saw the visual effect and how it went, made me satisfy. I think this movie was the best from the whole trilogy. The movie was very new and didn't to persist. Very futuristic.","7"

"Sinnerman","So much more is expected from Reloaded and Revolution...","2 May 2003","As much as I will be part of the rabid throngs of people lining up to catch a spectacle as huge as Reloaded and Revolution...allow me to counter a common misconception.

The Matrix just happened.

With an uncanny midas touch, The Warchowski bros launched this then unknown film at the the right place, in the right time. With an execution commercial enough to bring in the box office moola and a philosophical subtext accessible enough for the general public to latch on to, the rest, as they say...is history.

The philosophical under pinnings though, (of blue pills, red pills, the subreality of consciousness and all that mambo jambo etc), so successfully popularised by The Matrix, was infact neither orginated by said film nor as fully realised than in other more accomplished works.

IMHO, the best execution on the concept of reality and perception was already explored in much more unbelievably visual opus, one year earlier, the grossly overlooked and criminally under-rated ""Dark City"" (One of My Top 10 All time Favourite Films)

Dark City was impactful both cinematically and ideologically. Most importantly, it rewarded my wildly abandoned reach for human imagination and thirst for ideas, by fulfilling as much promise a motion picture can ever hope to give.

On top of that, my background as a ""trekkie"" scifi nerd meant I instinctively respond to films which challenge me both intellectually and spiritually. Dark City was thus a near religious, life cleansing experience for me.

And any which way I look at it, this film soars to heights unseen since 2001: A Space Odyssey...

But due to its messed up marketing(positioning the film more like a horror film for the teenage crowd), the film did not find its intended audience and flopped unceremoniously. Of course it found its audience but by then its was too late...

That said, the thrist for something better than our run of the mill pop corn fare is still there, waiting to be quenched.

And The Matrix filled that void.

Of course, much to The Matrix's advantage, it was flavoured with a commercial zest which captured the hearts and minds of the masses(myself included) like few films can. Such divine formula for commercial success is way too hard to calculate. Thus credit all round for the clairvoyant Warchowski Bros.

But now that the Matrix mythology and its paraphernalia franchising juggernaut has reached Star Wars proportion, the brothers face an uphill task, to fulfil the massive, pent-up promise that the Matrix may be on to something.....anything.

Contrary to my allegiance to the much maligned ""Dark City"", I for one hope will like to see them succeed. If not for my pathetic pretence of objectivity(not!!), at least for the betterment of Hollywood cinema as a whole.

Such seminal works like Contact, Minority Report and of course, LOTR has managed to sneak out of Hollywood's assembly plant. May ""The Matrix Trilogy"" too be part of this cinematic revolution.

As such, to the millions of Matrix fans out there, do not bite me. My comments are reserved for the sole Matrix movie in 1999 alone. That is coupled with my sky high expectation that its capable of so much more. My eventual take on the worthiness of the entire trilogy, of course, will be decided after completing both Reloaded, and Revolution. I thus hope for the best.","1"
"Ace-38","Exceptional Sci-Fi fare","18 November 1999","""The Matrix"" is a stunning achievement in both the science fiction genre as well as visual effects. The movie, visually, is simply without flaw. The ""bullet time"" photography, backgrounds, lighting, everything point to a great time of care and effort.

Character wise, the movie fares just about as well, although I found Lawrence Fishburn's Mephesto to be a bit overly dry. Keanu Reeves returns from exile to star as Neo, a programmer by day and hacker at night. He is suddenly drawn into a rebellion against the matrix, or what we know as the world. Little does he know that he is the one of prophecy, the one who will set mankind free.

Carrie-Anne Moss is wonderful in her role, its nice to see a strong female lead who is both sexy and strong at the same time. Her character of Trinity is one of the strongest female role models currently on film.

Lawrence Fishburn plays Mephesto, the head of the resistance movement and the one who finds Neo and brings him into the movement. His acting is good, but his presence is a bit dry. He acts a bit overly serious, like he is truly a messiah. He doesnt detract from the movie at all, but I felt he tended to overplay the role a bit.

Supporting cast: an A....all strong characters and central to the storyline. Tank in particular, as he was the controller of travel between the ""real world"" and the matrix.

You might notice I havent talked much about what the matrix is...lets face it, there are some of us out there who havent seen this yet, and its really difficult to explain...I dont feel like ruining the ""surprise"" of the movie for anyone. Suffice it to say that this review doesnt really exist..

""The Matrix"" is a spellbinding film...full of rich visuals and wonderful characters. Do yourself a favor and see this one soon

I think, if i had to be realistic, i watched this moive at least 30 times and I still discover new things every time. As a kid i didn't really get the story and just watched for the action but now as an adult it is carzy how good it is and how much of it could be applied to the real life.

The messages are clear and it is very rare that a sci fi movie comes up with a story you cant really disprove.

Can you for certain say we're not in the matrix? No!

Even small things like a ""deja vu"" (a phenomenon every person had at least once in their life) seems to have a logic explanation in the matrix.

This one will always be my favourite !","8"
"roland-27","Whats All The Hype About?","29 August 1999","O.K, The Matrix is a good movie with great special effects and superb acting. So? The story isn't that good. I don't even think that the writers knew what they were writing about until it came for them to write it!

Keanu Reeves and Larry Fishburne star in this sci fi action about ""a chosen one"" (ooh, original!) who is faced with the task of fighting a group of immortals who have created this blindfolded world called Earth. Its just a creation to throw mankind of guard, and blind them to the truth.

Well, all that aside, there were only a few decent moments in the whole film that were nail biting. They were mostly all at the start where Reeves didn't know the truth, and at the end, when he did. The middle of the film was confusing, and hardly entertaining at all.

Carrie Anne Moss produces the most thrills. Her athletic escape from the Federal looking bad guys at the start was very well done. The Matrix got better reviews that it should have done. Its the type of movie that some love, and some aren't sure about. Rating=3/5","10"
"vessalalizadeh","Awesometacular!","25 January 2022","After I watched this film, some friends of mine didn't know that I haven't watched for a long time the Matrix trilogy and the fourth film. But, as I saw it, it's absolutely enjoyable, action-packed and gorgeous. I remember in the cartoons that sometimes they reference the matrix, such as Trinity's jump as she kicks the bad guys. It feels like the creators are trying to show us how great matrix is, and they're right.

The cast was great in this film, no one can play very well Neo, like Keanu reeves does. The action is stunning, fast paced and great cinematography. The ending was awesome, in the end, love always wins as Neo and Trinity's kiss, and with that optimistic message the film ends. One of the best movies of all time, easily.","8"
"Chris_Ego","Do you think this is air that you are breathing?","8 April 2021","Watching this 1999 tech noir movie again in 2021 was both a philosophical and nostalgical trip to the past. The film includes so many details you will miss in the first run. This time around I noticed that Neo opens a book named ""Simulacra and Simulation"", which happens to be part of the literature the cast had to read prior to shooting the movie. Actually it is a real good piece of literature for people who like to sharpen their mind and think both critical and philosophical. If you are not into it, then you will feel slightly like the reviewers giving ""The Matrix"" 1 star claiming ""avoid this at all cost"". If you are with me, feel free to continue reading.

The story with its thought provoking statements and mind bending perspectives will surely trigger alternative views of the world if you let it. The movie does not claim to be a philosophical guide of some sort. It is just a plot with an intelligent script. I remember after the first time watching the movie I felt invigorated and also a little fragile, almost meaningless. It makes you question life and reflect how you live your life. Movies in general achieve that impact seldom.

The fight scenes make huge impressions. Remember: this is the mother of bullet time and freezed 360 shots! There are so many elements mashed together and still it isn't a spoiled broth. The real art lies in the combination of mythology, religion, different kinds of martial arts and action. This film set standards for cinematography and visual experience.

There is a global cult of followers pointing out the very depths of this masterpiece, that might be hidden for first timers. The trivia section is full with additional info like ""In Greek mythology, Morpheus is the god of dreams. Somewhat ironic, considering Morpheus' role here is to awaken people from their dream states to reality.""

"onestephenis","Can't give it a 9.5","7 June 2017","The Matrix, ah, The Matrix. It is from a completely different era where action and scifi movies didn't require a comic book, or even novel, origin. I love many of those movies, but there is just something about a totally unique plot with compelling characters you've never heard of.

I was quite young (which makes me old now I guess) when the movie came to theaters. I only had to watch one trailer that showed before another movie to say to myself... I just gotta see that.

I was fiscally challenged at that age and I was already sitting down to watch one of the two or three movies I could afford to go see a year and a new Star Wars movie was just on the horizon and there was no way I was going to miss that. (In hindsight I would have gladly waited for a DVD release lol) Boy was it worth every valuable penny. I told myself, and my date, that I couldn't afford popcorn or candy and encouraged a little purse smuggling if she just couldn't go without. Despite not having any of the usual bonuses that generally improve movie going experiences, including that old fashion mid movie make out session that was a little more common back then, it was possibly the best theater trip I have ever made.

It's sad that no one is likely to get to see this movie in theaters again, and even if they did the special effects wouldn't have the same impact that they did at that time. The Matrix gave me the best movie going experience that I ever had to that point, and it has still never been topped. And since the wonder of special effects is almost blase now it is unlikely that it ever will.

If you are young and have never seen The Matrix and you think that the special effects and action scenes wouldn't impress you in this day and age see it anyway. You'll likely learn something about what truly makes a movie great. The Matrix isn't modern anymore, but it's a classic now. Watch it and you'll probably agree.","10"

""The Matrix"" was that film. The Matrix was everything I wanted ""Dark City"" to be and more. While watching this movie I couldn't help but think how this would certainly raise the bar for science fiction flicks to come.

On the surface, the Matrix is a thought provoking sci-fi story about a post apocalyptic earth.

""The Matrix"" does have its faults however. The ending seemed rushed (despite the length of the movie) and the story seemed to get a little thinned out from what was earlier in the film a very richly textured story. Also, the much heralded special effects (which were, without a doubt, awesome) have been used in television commercials within the last year (did somebody mention ""The Gap"" commercial?). Lastly, the movie seems like it could have made better use of a sound track (except of course at the end where we hear Rage Against The Machine at full ear shattering decibel levels.)

But there is no doubt this is a very well put together movie, complete with good acting (particularly by Fishburn) and beautifully integrated with state of the art special effects . Go see it.","10"

"raphaklopper","What is the Matrix? How you define Matrix?","31 May 2013","When someone hears the word ""Matrix"", it already thinks on a man dodging bullets in slow time, little he knows that ""The Matrix"" is so much deeper than that.

""The Matrix"" is the classic action - sci-fi that forever changed the cinematic action scenes, but the film is not only fantastic action scenes, as I said, is much deeper than that.

The story begins with Neo (Keanu Reeves), who lives two lives simultaneously; in one he is Thomas Anderson, an important secretary in one of the most important computer companies in the world; in the other he is Neo, a night-hacker that sells all kinds of programs and computer viruses and tries to discover the meaning of the ""Matrix"". One day he meets Trinity (Carrie-Anne Moss) who claims to have all the answers he needs and show Neo the way to get to know the Matrix. After a problem with the police, Neo decides to accept the help of Trinity who introduces him to Morpheus (Laurence Fishburne) a wanted terrorist that shows to be an very polite and smart man and he know something that Neo doesn't. Morpheus offers Neo a chance to know what the Matrix is. Neo accepts the offer and discovers that not only what is the Matrix but also discovers that our whole world is nothing but a lie.

The Wachowski brothers (directors-writers) can raise the film several philosophical theories about what is real and how the human mind works, and how we can create and control what is not real. But along with the philosophy, the Wachowskis have created action scenes that changed cinema forever. But all the frenetic action ranging that goes from Kung Fu moves in slow motion and the incredible bullet-time, and of course the classic scene of dodging bullets in slow motion, all of them are part of the whole philosophy that builds the Matrix.

Writing and fantastic direction had to be accompanied by a formidable cast that is not what is missing in this movie. Keanu Reeves is superb and becomes the ""chosen one""; the fantastic Laurence Fishburne as the unforgettable Morpheus; and one of the greatest villains that cinema ever had it's Hugo Weaving as the cruel Agent Smith.

A classic action and sci-fi that will be forever remembered, thanks to a fantastic writing and breathtaking action scenes make's ""The Matrix"" a true masterpiece.","10"

Maybe our real world is also a matrix. The ""Creator"" created it and gave it limited natural laws to allow it to develop freely. Human scientists can discover the laws of nature, but can never explain why it is this way, not that way. Why is the Planck constant the current value and the speed of light is exactly 300,000 kilometers per second? Perhaps such a question will never be answered, it depends on the preferences of the Creator. Those who belong to this world cannot surpass the rules of this world. Only those who do not belong to this world and have the same level as the Creator may be unrestricted and arbitrarily modified. The right of human free choice is inevitably limited, because if everyone's existence is in the rules, the law of causality is inevitable.

"Michael Kenmore","The Matrix is a contrived POS movie","2 April 1999","What are they smoking when they're raving about The Matrix? I had the opportunity to see this film and I was appalled that it had NO trace of originality. Simply put, this is a live-action comic book with the self-consciously stricken characters, ludicrous fight scenes and tons of technical mumbo-jumbo repetition. This movie may belong in the serious neo-noir genre á la Blade Runner and the laughable Dark City, but it blatantly ripped off the crucial plot from Mamoru Oshii's 1995 visual mind trip animé Ghost in the Shell based on Masamune Shirow's torturiously complex manga, and a bit from Katsuhiro Otomo's groundbreaking Akira. It made me feel I was watching a live-action adaption of Ghost in the Shell coupled with the elaborate kung-fu and gun fighting sequences copied from Jackie Chan and John Woo. This is the newly-spawned version of Keanu Reeves' inferior predecessor Johnny Mnemonic, only better with mind-bending visual effects and decent acting in spite of a lame script chock full of tired by-the-book cliches. The Wachowski brothers may be complimented for their astounding vision (I've never seen the 3-D dimension revolving the characters in the ""time slice"" scenes done so well with style), but this movie is nothing short of a derivative sci-fi movie relying on visual eye candy and dark futuristic theme intended for the primarily target audience of pony-tailed comic book shop owners, computer geeks and aspiring artists. *1/2 out of four stars","9"

I reached this conclusion when watching such sci-fi classics as the Star Wars trilogy and the first Highlander film. I considered myself pretty spoiled, and after such high-quality films as those, few movies make my eyes pop. But The Matrix did. It's visuals are incredible, and it's cast and plot are so brand new and refreshing, I now consider myself truly thrilled by it. Why don't they make more movies this good nowadays?

I won't reveal the plot, but I'll just say this: Nothing is as it seems. Nothing. You don't exist, and the world is run by robots.

Confused? Go watch the movie and find out for yourself.

I am convinced that if when movies first came out, and they had all the great technology back then that they have now, they had made the Star Wars trilogy, the first Highlander, and The Matrix, no other movie would have ever had to have been made. They are so superior, nothing could have ever topped them, so they shouldn't have even tried.

The Matrix....One of just a handful of sci-fi masterpieces!","10"
"Tin Man-5","Overrated, but still a good flick for what it is.","26 April 2002","Like everyone else on the planet, when The Matrix first came out, I was blown away by the film. I thought it was cleverly written, with visuals that were mind-blowing, and the style was amazing. Immediately upon its release, it was being hailed as the sci-fi film of the 90's. At first, I was completely agreeing to this notion. Then I watched it again, and a funny idea occurred to me.

The Matrix is really not very original. While it is a very entertaining film, originality is not one of its good elements. I like the film as an action picture now, but I certainly do not think that it deserves the title of issuing a bold new standard in sci-fi.

There are a few reasons for this: first of all, Neo has little character development. His performance is limited to a series of ""Woahs,"" and ""I don't believe it."" Case in point, Keanu Reeves did a good job in the part....an actor whose range is limited to Bill and Ted and, well...Point Break. That's because he had so little to do. Morpheus, Cypher, Trinity, Tank, and Agent Smith all came off much better than Neo.

Second of all, the storyline isn't very original. Last year, I had the pleasure of watching Dark City for the first time. It flied vastly under the radar when it was first released, and it was certainly a quieter, more thoughtful film. It occurred to me while watching that the plot line, from the characters to the basic premise, is very much the same as in The Matrix, and it was released a year before. I'm sure you've all heard this argument before, so I won't go too far into it. But I will say this: Dark City, visually and story-telling wise, is a far superior film, IMHO. The complex themes that both film rises are better developed in Dark City as well. The Matrix seems to fall into the pattern of action movie in the final act, where Dark City maintains its deep philosophical elements throughout. I think it is a pity that The Matrix was able to set up such a realistic world that was so intruiging and inventive, and then push the audience into overkill by having the final third of the film being a long shootout/martial arts fight. Granted, it was the finest shootout/martial arts fight that I have ever seen in a film, but I felt that after it introduced all of its philosophical elements in the first two acts of the film, the final, violent act was rather mind-numbing and a shift in the wrong direction.

That leads me to the action scenes themselves. So many have said that this film sets a new standard in sci-fi. I don't see this at all. The great sci-fis are followed by a series of rip-offs and films clearly inspired by them (Star Wars=Battlestar Galactica, Conan=Beastmaster, Alien=Creature, E.T.=Mac and Me, etc.). The Matrix has found few if any sci-fi films that have tried to rob it of its interesting new action style. Instead, its style has turned into a fad for action films that is quickly fading. After The Matrix, we saw a release of films such as Mission Impossible 2, Charlies Angels, Beowulf, The Art of War, and Mummy 2 that ripped off its style. And it is a style that is quickly growing old.

The great sci-fis are usually films that are released before the general public is ready for them. The ones now considered classics opened to scathing reviews upon initial release, and many of them bombed at the box office. It was only audience reaction to them later that proved their worth and re-evaluation by film experts. The best of best were failures upon initial release--remember initial reactions to Close Encounters of the Third Kind, Alien, 2001, Blade Runner, Highlander, Dark City, and even Star Wars? These are now considered paragons of the genre. On the other hand, The Matrix did stupendous at the box office, and even went onto rival Episode One (an inferior film, by the way) at the cinema. I'm not so niave as to say ALL the good fantasy/sci-fis have to fail first before becoming great....Battlefield Earth and Lord of the Rings proves otherwise on both ends of the extreme. I am suggesting that The Matrix was simply a big, summer blockbuster which, because it had a plotline that appeared original because only smaller, quieter films had used it before, and because it had a lot of loud (but smart) action at the end that is appealing to the average moviegoer, was hyped up to be something greater than it really was.

Twenty years from now, will it still be on this list? I don't think so. How dare you people put this movie in front of Das Boot, Raging Bull, Fight Club, Almost Famous, and Apocalypse Now.

Okay, I do love the Matrix, but come on, giving the movie a 10 out of 10 is saying you wanted the movie to win best picture!

"boe_dye","boe_dye sez: has it been ten years already?!","3 January 2009","I can remember seeing this in the theatre so long ago. I remember going to the movies, having an expectation that it was about aliens or perhaps some type of over the top b-movie, and then being totally blown away by just about everything that was in front of my face, and then blown even further away after learning about all of the symbolic meanings hidden throughout the film.

And 10 years later, my wife and I decided to pop in a DVD and try out our new 42in LCD and sure enough the movie still blows my mind.

Sure you can still enjoy this movie for the sole purpose of the eye candy. The story line while not directly original, was at the very least original to the generation who watched it.

1999 was certainly the tail end of the appeal to the so-called cyber-punk genre. Previous we had the wonders of Blade Runner, Hackers, and Johnny Neumonic just to name a few. But this movie set a standard.

Borrowing ideas from Anime, Post-Apocalyptic dystopia, and Terminator, and doing what Star Wars did for Generation X in the 80's by giving us ""The Force"" and amazing ways to shoot models in epic space battles, this did for Generation Nintendo in the 90's by inventing new ways to use camera angles, and ""bullet time"", as well as giving us the idea to ""unplug from the Matrix"".

It gave ""woah"" a totally new meaning, as well as catch phrases like ""there is no spoon"", and ""see how deep the rabbit hole goes"".

You can watch this movie two ways: For the utter enjoyment of what you see is what you get, or in the double meaning catch phrase by seeing ""how deep the rabbit hole goes"", you can learn all of the philosophy that went into it, which there is quite a bit.

A movie that brings back memories, it is certainly my favorite movie of all time. It was kind of a bummer that the sequels were more about flash and fire as opposed to substance and thought.

But the great thing about this movie is that it does end with an ending that doesn't need to be taken as a cliffhanger. It can be taken as somewhat open ended, but with a great deal of finality.

A great supplement to this film would be the Animatrix series which gives a great back story and history to how the humans and the machines started fighting each other in the first place. It also provides some other short stories which in many cases are better then the 2 sequels.","1"
"DoctorSkyTower","BETTER THAN STAR WARS!","20 November 2000","SINCE there are over 2000 reviews on this film already, there is not much more I can add, but....

Special effects are the best I have ever seen. Keanu Reeves acting is his best yet. The story and plot is fascinating. Supporting cast are excellent. Action scenes are awesome!

I have seen dozens of science fiction movies, very few of them have lived up to my expectations. For example, check out the utter lousiness of Hollow Man and Species 2! The Matrix is one of those few films I have really enjoyed and given a 10/10.

I am surprised to see so many reviewers comparing this film to Star Wars Phantom Menace. That flick was dumbed down to suit pre-pubescent teeny boppers, never mind adult audiences, with atrocities like (dare I say) Jar Jar Binks and lame C.G.I! The Matrix, however, is far superior to the over-rated, over-hyped S.T.P.M.

CONCLUSION: Mr Lucas should watch this film a few times to see how C.G.I should really be employed to its best advantage in a movie. Darth Maul, eat your heart out!","10"
"smashattack","Special effects, yet some `perfect' events.","27 December 2001","Some spoilers may arise.

The Matrix combines amazing special effects, good acting, decent music, and an excellent plot that immerses you into one of the most amazing sci-fi action thrillers to date. I won't say anything about the storyline as this movie is a lot like the PC game The Neverhood--nearly everything you need to know, you learn within the movie.

Certain things are left unsaid, of course, like in all movies. This is one of the drawbacks to the movie. You hardly ever see the world outside of the Matrix, which gets you feeling sort of claustrophobic. Events that take place and names of individuals, ships, and places rip off from the Bible, which is kind of annoying since the movie is nothing religious (although the use of prophecies and an uninteresting, ""perfect"" oracle tends to make that statement false). This is a major bad part of the movie along with its ""perfect"" events, as mentioned above. For example, in the end, Trinity gives Neo a ""magical kiss"" that revives him from death. Amazing how women can be sometimes, right?

The music, composed by Don Davis (Jurassic Park III), wasn't too bad, but it did seem a little repetetive at points. My brother has both soundtracks and neither is too great, but the music does fit in with the movie.

Also, the movie tends to be a little boring. This IS the first movie, so that much can be expected because we need to fully understand what is going on. The explanations pretty much cover up for the lack of action that was expected (there IS NOT a huge lack of action--there is just long parts of explanation between big events).

Without taking the bad parts into consideration, this movie is not just another sci-fi thriller. The plot is amazing, and I've always wondered when someone would make a movie pertaining to this kind of idea. All in all, a really good movie, but I couldn't really watch it more than seven or eight times.","10"

-That is basically what we all had to do if we are new to the Matrix Movies.

-I like that We start out in the eyes of Computer Programer Thomas Anderson who wants to break away from a controlled society. Of course he is hunted by government agents and fate has Anderson run into mysterious folks Morpheus and Trinity who show him that the world is not what he thought it was AT All.

The twists were briliant just brilliant. I love that we see the real world the first time just as Anderson does, and that his life and identity were all false info given to him by the Matrix
Trinity:""The Matrix cannot tell you who you are""

-Anderson then forsakes his false identity and becomes Neo, the prophesied chosen one who is said to free the human race from the Machines, who created the Matrix.

-Neo with letters rearranged is is ""One"" further cementing him as the one.

-Keanu Reeves and Carrie Ann Moss are great In Their roles. Joe Pantallio is great as the sleezeball traitor Cypher.

-but Laurence Fishburne (Morpheus) and Hugo Weaving (Agent smith) were the true excellent performances of this movie.

"NikkoFranco","Revolutionary","28 May 2018","When I describe this film franchise as revolutionary, I mean not only in terms of visual and graphics but including the storyline. For some reasons I tend to think that this film is George Orwellian in nature, like being controlled and oppressed, the fight and battle for freedom and the strength of mind over matter. However complex it is, especially the very first release, it is still appealing to the mass viewers as it also has a lot of action in it. Keanu Reeves in his past roles before this, always comes across as a surf dude, but I give him points that as Neo, there's a depth that was not visible before. There's also good team chemistry between him, Laurence Fishburne, Carrie Anne Moss, Joe Pantoliano and the nemesis, Hugo Weaving. The other actors also delivered brilliantly and the Wachowski brothers deserve a lot more credit for coming up with something extra ordinaire.","9"
"Phil_H","Keanu is stupidly beleavable","21 April 1999","Before I begin, let me say this: I am not a fan of Keanu Reeves' acting ability. Short of ""Bill & Ted"" movies, he hasn't found a niche yet (in my opinion). I went to see this film on the advice of several people whose opinions are valuable to me. What I found was that Keanu's normal stupidity actually was believable here! This film (for Keanu) works! Really.

I was impressed with all the acting, the effects, and even with Keanu. This IS his best film to date.

Is this film as good as the rating makes it sound? No. I reserve an ""8"" rating for films like ""The Empire Strikes Back,"" but this films isn't as bad as a ""6""...by default I give it a ""7."" Could be a bit better, and could have been a LOT worse!

Could still be argued that it had a much broader and significant impact in filmmaking than any of the BP nominees.","10"
"thewillt08","What is The Matrix?","16 August 2012","Welcome to the real world of awesome reviews. Me personally, I would have taken the red pill. Obviously I am talking about the mind bending experience known as The Matrix. What is the Matrix? To be honest, after seeing the entire probably ten times I still probably can't even tell you. The Matrix is about a man named Thomas A. Anderson who lives a double life. He works for a company which he hates, but he is also a computer hacker by the alias of Neo. He is searching for the answer to the Matrix question. He is also looking for the legendary Morpheus, but Morpheus is also looking for him. Neo is destined to be ""the one."" Mr. Anderson gets sucked into ""the real world"" and he experiences a whole new world.

The first Matrix throws a lot of plot at the audience, especially in the beginning. We learn about The Matrix and the history of the real world. The human race is on the brink of destruction and they are at war with the machines. Neo is destined to be ""the one"" the one to save humanity and end the war, but first he has to be sucked out of the Matrix and into the real world. Neo has lived in the Matrix his entire life and he got taken out. The plot is a little slow and confusing but if you stick with it, the story is very interesting and rewarding.

The dialog in this movie was very clever. When Neo entered the real world he asked why his eyes hurt. Morpheus answered, ""You never used them before."" Neo is a full grown man and the idea of him using his eyes for the first time just makes you think. Morpheus says, ""Welcome to the real world."" That line was probably the most memorable line of the entire movie. My favorite line has to be when an agent is dodging Neo's bullets and when he fires back Neo dodges all but one of his bullets. The agent walks up to Neo and before he can pull the trigger Trinity comes out of nowhere, puts a pistol to his head and says, ""Dodge this."" Then she blows him away in slow motion fashion. That was awesome not cheesy at all.

The villain in a movie has to stand out and be memorable. Hugo Weaving plays Agent Smith, and he is probably one of the greatest villains in a movie I have ever seen. The way he talks, the way he moves, the way he acts, everything about him is just bad. This guy does not play around, he is strictly business. One of the first scenes we meet him he is talking with Mr. Anderson and he makes Mr. Anderson's mouth disappear. He lets the audience know that this is his world, his playground, and everyone plays by his rules. He is intimidating because he is a leader, he rarely shows emotion, all he wears is a suit and shades, and he is plain scary. Every time he says, ""Mr. Anderson"" it sends a chill down my spine.

The special effects are in a league of their own, there phenomenal. The beginning of the movie may have been a little slow but once Neo gets into the real world there are plenty of fight scenes, gun fights, explosions, death, and fear. Somebody turns of the special effects switch and the movie goes off. The most famous of course is when Neo dodges bullets and basically does the limbo. That has been impersonated by everybody at least once. The last scene where Neo and Trinity go into the building with a bunch of guns and blow away the soldiers, that was awesome. There were bullets flying and punches were being thrown. The martial arts and slow motion effects were amazing. Actors must have worked really hard to master the technique, and it really did pay off. Sure some of the things that happened in the movie would never happen in real life, but think of the world they are in. Think of the story and how it doesn't matter if it would happen in real life or not. The Matrix technically isn't ""real.""

Problems with the movie, there are a few. This movie is not for somebody with a short attention span. You need to pay attention during the first hour of the movie. It is all plot and explaining the world that is The Matrix. It drags a little bit but it is important. The audience could still have some questions at the end. What exactly is Zion? Is Neo the one? The oracle says he isn't but he does things no other person can do. Do the oracles prophesies even mean anything? She said one will live and one will die, meaning Neo or Morpheus. This story leaves some holes but that's why two more movies were made. A main problem I had was the rating of the movie. This was rated R violence and language. Sure it was violent and bad language was used but there was no blood and language wasn't as bad. This movie could have passed for a stretched PG-13 and it would have attracted more of a crowd.

Overall, this movie was great and different. The technology used in this movie was awesome and used right. The slow motion wasn't overused or underused, the action scenes weren't crazy because they were worth waiting for and scenes I could watch again. This movie gets the WillyT seal of approval and can be watched more than once. It is also a movie that can be seen with friends or alone. If you have not seen this movie, check it out. It's a movie everybody should see.","9"

I won't discuss the concept, which is simply brilliant, nor the photography, which is astonishing. Special effects? Come on... Acting? Dialog? Script? Editing? Directing? How could I? Even now, when I remembered the film, I remain almost speechless. ""The Matrix"" is a landmark in the history of cinema, and more. Many scenes are so fascinating that anyone's hair would stand on its end while watching, and for many reasons, visual or spiritual.

Because this film is not just a film, but an art work that transforms you, it gives you a deeper perspective on life and yourself. So, it is really great art, at a level reached by surprisingly few movies. OK, it has its Buddhist themes. So what? Isn't it all about truth, freedom and the individual? Are these not fundamental questions for anyone? Isn't the perspective of this movie on them tremendous and extremely touching? And the ending... Wow... A rare, powerful and effective way to end a great film. The fight will go on and on (compare Neo's approach to the Stalker's in Tarkowsky's masterpiece). Because the story is not just a sci-fi about some bleak future, it's a parable (like any good sci-fi) about the very present day, about what is real now, and how free are you now.

P. S. The sequels are disappointing and mere lame action sci-fi thrillers. Too bad. No more real spiritual concepts, but over-complicated plots and inconsistent new characters. Never mind, let's forgive the Wachowskys for wanting some extra cash, since they have given the world this masterpiece in the first part of the trilogy!","7"
"kupcr","What Is The Matrix?","1 January 2021","'Matrix' is a 1999 film by the brothers (now sisters) Wachowskis, and about a character that's a computer programmer named Thomas Anderson (Keanu Reeves), but he's also has an alias named ""Neo"", who's a computer hacker and in the story, an elusive figure named Morpheus (Laurence Fishburne) who's the most dangerous man alive, is the only one that can answer Neo's question ""What is the Matrix?"" And when he is contacted by Trinity, marvellously played by Carrie Anne Moss, leads him into an underworld where it is revealed to him about the world he lives in. The CGI at the time was pretty awesome and you'll notice this in the fight throughout the movie between Agent Smith, played incredibly by Hugo Weaving and the character Neo. The ending fight scene was AWESOME! The scenes are unbelievable, as well. Also, the locations and the similar DiCaprio ""Inception"" type infusion and the way each character moves, is pure gold. Love the idea of how far A.I. (Artificial Intelligence) could go to make human citizens second class. The idea that computer viruses could be human isn't far fetched. The idea to transform the final film footage with LUTS, a conduit or code to transform colour (RGB) input values from the film to different colour (RGB) output values to give your final footage a different look or feel, like a greenish tinge which is prevalent throughout the film, gives 'Matrix' a mysterious feel and emotion to the film.

"overcaffeined","Not a masterpiece. Interesting, but not a masterpiece.","19 May 2003","The Matrix is not a masterpiece, despite the huge number of people voting it 10/10. The concept is interesting, but the plot has too many teen-minded moments, resulting childish at times. This problem is usually bad for movies, because it makes them age bad with time.

The Matrix is a worth of mention sci-fi movie, but has no contributions enough to be deeply analyzed and commented through monographs in Philosophy Schools, Art Schools, Architecture Schools, etc...

The two things I liked most are:

-The F/X. They're quite good. The 3D deciphering scene, as well as the bullets slow-motion are perhaps the most interesting of all.

-The brief romantic subplot. It's too brief, too insufficient, but at least made the movie a little less Quake-minded and somewhat more adult.

I voted it 6/10.

I'd strongly recommend ""The Thirteenth Floor"" (1999, Josef Rusnak) for anybody who wishes to really feel delighted with a plot and concept similar to The Matrix, but far more elaborate, with more drama, more interesting cybernetic twists, more adult, and greater care in the details (click on my name for reading my review).","1"

"pulpficat","Where Reality is a Laughing Matter","11 October 2023","Alright, hold onto your pods because we're diving deep into The Matrix. You might expect a thrilling, mind-bending sci-fi blockbuster, and you'd be absolutely right. But this movie is so much more than just your regular sci-fi action flick; it's a reality-bending masterpiece that messes with your mind and leaves you questioning the nature of existence. Sounds like fun, doesn't it?

From the moment we meet Neo, our hacker-hero portrayed by Keanu Reeves, it's clear that The Matrix is no ordinary film. Neo's life takes a surreal turn when he learns that the reality he knows is a computer-generated illusion designed to keep humanity in check. Can you say, ""Welcome to the dark side""? Enter the enigmatic Morpheus, played by Laurence Fishburne, whose epic, almost Shakespearean speeches make you want to take that red pill right away. It's like he's the Obi-Wan Kenobi of the digital world, guiding our hero through the rabbit hole and opens his eyes to the true, nightmarish reality.

Speaking of that rabbit hole, The Matrix raises some profound questions about reality and the nature of existence. You'll find yourself questioning everything. Are we all just lines of code in someone else's program? Are our lives just simulations? It's enough to make your head spin. The underlying philosophical questions about reality, destiny, and choice add layers of existential dread that will resonate with anyone who's ever questioned the meaning of life or the dubious nature of our reality. So, in case you haven't had your daily dose of existentialism lately, The Matrix has you covered.

But let's not forget the spectacular action sequences. The slow-motion kung-fu showdowns are pure adrenaline, and that rooftop chase scene? Heart-pounding stuff. And the famous bullet-dodging scene is so iconic that it's become a meme. Plus, the black leather and slick shades - it's like every character walked out of a '90s goth fashion catalog.

All in all, The Matrix is a blend of cyberpunk aesthetics, philosophical musings, and action-packed sequences that'll make you question reality long after the credits roll. So, if you're ready to explore the shadows between what's real and what's not, give The Matrix a try. Who knows, you might just wake up from your own digital dream.","10"

I found the first half to be pretty dull so I turned it off. In it's defense it had good visual effects but nothing much more. Keanu Reeves is still not a good actor. In fact I only liked him in Speed and Bill and Ted. I didn't feel it deserved those Oscars though, because I thought The Phantom Menace had better effects, not to mention being a much, much better movie. I think this was just a weak attempt to beat Star Wars at the box office. And why are they making two sequels? To make a good sequel you have to have a good movie to base it on. Next to South Park, Austin Powers 2, Blair Witch and Wild, Wild West this was the worst movie of last year. If you want to see some of last year's best, see The Phantom Menace, American Pie, Detroit Rock City or Bowfinger. But avoid the Matrix unless you just want a good visual effects movie. 1/10","9"
"clay-8","*** out of ****","7 April 1999","Although the previews for this film make the movie out to be an action-packed extravaganza, it really wasn't. I was surprised to see all of the best scenes in the movie already show up in the trailers. Nothing much surprised me unfortunately, but I did enjoy the film because of its intriguing plot. It actually seems plausible. I also love the special-effects, although much of the movie was too murky to see anything. They were completely seemless and that's what I loved about this movie. Other than that, it relied a bit on cliches and formulas and the ending was too predictable, that the film wouldn't have suffered at all if it were changed to be more original. It may have actually been better. This film is worth seeing once at least.","10"

"leijona-15930","Average sci-fi movie","21 July 2022","Yes, I know The Matrix is an iconic movie, but I have watched it only twice. For the first time about 20 years ago and now for the second time. I'm quite sure this was also the last time as it was just as average as I remembered it to be.

The biggest problem is the plot which is just too generic (mad AI destroys the civilization but a lonely warrior can save it... hmm... Terminator and a bunch of other sci-fi movies already used that!) and full of weird holes and stupid ideas... You have to answer a phone to exit the Matrix? Why? Why the Oracle is in the Matrix? Why, why, why?

The story lacks surprises. After the first 30 minutes or so everything goes just like you expect them to go... They have an excellent option to erase either Neo or Morpheus (just like the Oracle predicted) from the story and bring some moral thinking with that into the box, but nooo... Of course all the good guys in the main roles must survive. How boring.

I know that 23 years ago the special effects of the movie were cool, but I have never really appreciated special effects that look like... well, special effects.","10"

FILE OPENING...

What is the Matrix?

How many times do we hear that phrase in the movie of the same name? And do we really know everything we have to know on it once the movie is finished? ""The Matrix"" owns many characteristics that could appear inconceivable. Because it's at the same time a movie with an incredibly complex story, a philosophical festival, an homage to many genres of film and literature and an explosive blockbuster as well.

""The Matrix"" is directed by two near unknowns, the Wachowski Brothers (Andy and Larry), and stars Keanu Reeves as Thomas Anderson, a software programmer whose main hobby is to hack different computer systems, under the pseudonym of Neo.

Neo soon meets Morpheus (Laurence Fishburne) who learns him that the world where he's living isn't real. It seems that it's rather a virtual world created by the Matrix. So the Matrix would be an immense artificial intelligence system that ""sucks"" the energy coming from the humans and locks their minds inside a virtual world where the most fundamental laws (such as the laws of physics) seem to be hardly applicable.

Morpehus believes that Neo is ""the one"", that is the person who owns the power of stopping the Matrix and thus freeing humans from their cybernetic prison. Morpheus brings Neo along with his crew towards a Star Wars-like adventure in order to accomplish his destiny.

""The Matrix"" is some kind of ""Alice in Wonderland"" set in the electronic era. The parallels with the Lewis Carroll classic are very obvious in the film and the Wachowski Bros. are fully aware that their work can be linked to Carroll's.

And like ""Alice"", ""The Matrix"" astonishes and entertains with its infinitesimal quantity of surrealist elements that make the people asking if it's possible to completely understand the movie (and/or the world that it describes).

In fact, ""The Matrix"" is nothing but a genuine feast of spectacular and revolutionary special effects which already elevated the film to the rank of legend. The movie makes a clever mix of techniques which require the use of sophisticated computer programs, which is ironic with the anti-technology message that prevails in the film. Some passages strikingly reminisce the George Lucas odyssey. The difference is that instead of traveling in the infinitely big, we travel in the infinitely small.

And the final addition to this virtual jaunt: nothing else than action scenes directly taken from the oriental genres... Kung-fu sequences, especially those which take part during Neo's training, evidently come from Hong Kong martial arts films, while many other action scenes with superhuman movements seem to come from Japanese mangas and anime.

The whole movie lays almost entirely on presentation, and for once, it's the only thing that is needed in order to provide a good movie. Characters are cool, but too much two-dimensional to my taste. They can thank their sunglasses. But it doesn't prevent them from being interesting. Neo is the best example. We can feel his questioning, his fear and also the acceptance of his fate throughout the progression of the story. Honorable mention to Hugo Weaving who plays the sinister and almost-unbeatable Agent Smith. In his case, his sunglasses don't make him cool, but even more terrifying.

Just like ""Fight Club"", released a few months later, ""The Matrix"" is at the same time a pollution of explosions and fights and a philosophical must. In the Matrix case, the viewer has to ask himself about the notion of reality and the importance of machines on human life. This latter theme is very popular nowadays because of the quick industrialization process by the developed countries. Presented the Matrix way, we want to get the farther from our computers... at least for the moment...

With its open end, it was obvious in 1999 that the movie would turn into a full series. And it was the case with the release of two sequels both in 2003. But nothing is worth the original... Because the sequels usually use the same techniques and they're not as striking as the first time we see them.

Overall, ""The Matrix"" is a set of breathtaking special effects which owns the merit of having a story that is solid enough to make all pieces hold together. And it's not even worth searching to understand everything. The only thing to do is to watch. And you won't be disappointed. And remember that what you see is real (way of talking, evidently...), so take benefit of it...

"eamon-hennedy","Star Wars for the MTV generation.","15 May 2003","An awe inspiring mix of philosophical debate and spectacular action sequences (in other words that rare occasion of a Hollywood blockbuster mixing intelligence with the usual dose of thrills and spills) The Matrix is a superb film on every conceivable level, doing for my generation what Star Wars did for my mum and dad. The film is one that contains many surprises (not least a fantastic lead performance from Keanu Reeves). Somewhat unconventional for a summer blockbuster, the film goes on a more complex path to most summer releases, opting for a more difficult narrative in the early stages and then going for a story route that goes from being the stylish (the sequences in the Matrix itself) to the downright filthy (the scenes in the real world). The biggest surprise from the film that I got was that I went to see it based on it theatrical trailer which highlighted the action sequences, only to find when I got there that the film was offering up a more intelligent and thought provoking science fiction story with the action sequences being saved until the last half hour, and it is this course where the film suceeds the most. The Wachowski's develop characters that we come to care about. We come to care greatly for Neo, Morpheus (for the record my favourite character) and Trinity while developing a hatred for Agent Smith (perhaps the most interesting villian in recent years). They sucessfully integrate the audience into their universe and once we're settled in, they let rip with a final act that would make even James Cameron proud. At the time of writing The Matrix Reloaded is on the verge of release and now is the perfect time to re-examine a film that has very well changed the course of cinema, perhaps forever. The sequel, along with concluding chapter Revolutions, will have to go a long way to beat this masterpiece of the Hollywood blockbustser, a genre that many thought was dead.","8"

"panta-4","Too many things still need answer!","13 May 2020","When originally came out, I think that I watched about 20 minutes of it and then walked out. I was definitely not getting why would people be so excited about Keanu Reeves' acting or the story and directing of Lana and Lilly Wachowski! There were some interesting theories in it, and that was all for me. So, I revisited it last night for only one reason - David Icke's documentary ""Renegade"" I watched the same day. In that film there was a scene from The Matrix explaining ""reality"". The good news is, I lasted to the end this time, and I liked it more than the last time I saw it, I could connect with the movie more than before, but there is still a lot to account for: from some flat acting to some ridiculous directing mistakes to many unanswered questions in the screenplay.","10"
"nelliebell-1","Under The Yoke of a New World Order!","13 May 2007","The Motion Picture ""The Matrix"" perhaps should be spelled matrice because that is what this film is using to tell the story of one Thomas Anderson(played by Keanu Reeves) who works for a top software computing company.It seems early into ""The Matrix"" Thomas Anderson has two lives,one as already stated with the added comment that he helps his land lady take out the garbage and the other life is involved with computing and the internet whereby Thomas Anderson goes by the hacker alias ""Neo""and is guilty of committing about as many crimes as there are on computing and the internet.The definition of a Matrix is a switch which is a device ""that allows multiple channels connected via serial interfaces to connect under operator control to designated remote or local analog circuits.""It is while at his computer keyboard on a given evening that Neo is contacted directly by way of his own personal computer.How this is in fact accomplished is never clear however it is made even more implausible as Neo is not even on the computing network legally as his hacking proclivities would stand more a chance of being discovered.Yet that is exactly what occurs though that discovery is arranged by a notorious individual in Morpheus(played by Laurence Fishburne) with stalwart and even inspirational keyboardest in Trinity.Trinity wishes to meet with Neo and it is Trinity who has the capacity real or otherwise to write to the construct with an ability to actually break into a virtually invisible and undetectable space and land in Neo's lap.This occurs at a point in time when a knock occurs at his apartment door with a deal about to go down which though innocuous is not about drugs per se though drugs do enter into the general conversation(it is the only way to fly) it is about a specially written or/either stolen piece of computer data(on disk)and is purchased for some $2,000.00.Neo it would seem is living up to his name and indeed even by todays standards that is a talent only a few perhaps have the ability to achieve.Neo is a hacker who when a moment ago prior to the arrival of the these persons he was informed by way of his computer to follow the White Rabbit.A female who is partnered with the purchaser of the computer disk shows her shoulder to Neo to only expose a tattoo of a white rabbit and due to this coincidence he decides to go out though he has work the following morning.He somehow meets Trinity and it is here that it is discovered that Trinity is a girl and indeed Trinity is played by Carrie-Ann Moss.She warns him that they are looking for you and Neo asks who is.The film provides a cardboard characteristic perhaps more the equal to an animated construct as an air of a constructed set is bally-hooed with most of the picture being given imaginative as well as staid staging that provide for an effect as a construct which may actually be required as part of the purport of this film.The message however is that Thomas Anderson is about to jump ship permanently and bare the hacker alias Neo for the rest of time.The film leaves no doubt as to how all of this is to transpire with the matrix as well as telecommunications being made to be the transporter of the very physical presence that the film is named after.The real problem that this film will not shy away from,is that there is in the construct a reported illusion to an authority that is not real but artificial and indeed the film proceeds to be transported through telephone lines while evolving to a crusade to free themselves from the arrival of an artificially constructed cyborg entity,""Agents"".The agents are in fact hardwired to the construct and represent the gatekeeper ideology.They guard all the gates.It is not new territory,this territory as to telecommunications and though not new it is as well not new to be concerned with an artificial intelligence as the evolution of the computer has been for many years concerned with these very areas.The arrival though as to the claim of actual Agents(lead Agent played by Hugo Weaving)whereby they materialize as if residing or embedded in a matrix only environment for purposes of enforcement using the bodies of the citizenry is to underscore something unusual.The film provides for something as to the truth and the admission that there exists the real presence of an overseer whose authority is unmitigated by circumstance and whose power will not relent.We are in effect under the yoke of a tyrant and the communications of the 20th century has given witness to this rise of a foreign power as well as an artificial intelligence.They are in fact the same thing and we don't have to wait one hundred years as it is here now and has been here for at least some 50 to perhaps 75 years.It is well to understand that behavior has mass market appeal with films providing a virtual backyard to convey as films such as these do.The mass market appeal is likened to a cash register for what is more powerful than to control the wealth of the world,it would be to have power over it.The very clear and precise arguments as to abuse with power over others continually creeps into the picture time and time again allowing for an inability to get out from under the treachery of an overseer.It is this challenge that eventually materializes into the films most engaging scenes as Morpheus,Neo,Trinity all weigh in against the construct with real world rock-em-sock-em fight scenes.Though this is but something of an abbreviation,the climax as to the Matrix is worthy of mention as a kiss is well earned and if true love ever had a chance it won this one hands down.I've watched this more than once to learn as much about the construct as to learn about the film.","10"

The Matrix also have two things in it that very few Hollywood movies ever have a strong black lead and a strong female lead that is not weak and helpless.

"lopcar1993","The best Sci-Fi thriller ever made! Hands down.","6 September 2009","When I first saw this movie when I was twelve I didn't think much of it, I thought it had a confusing story and a mindless plot that was supported and only succeeded by out of this world slow motion stunts. Boy was I naive or what!? Now seeing it again after all these years I could see that I was not ready back then to handle a movie of this complexity and strange coherent means of story telling. But now I fully respect and love this movie for what it is and for what it always will be, mindbogglingly, mind blowing, out of this world fun.

When the Matrix was released in 1999 this was the film to go see people were busting out of the theater's and telling anyone they can to go see this movie. It was the ""It"" movie of the year and it gained the title justly. This film mapped out new territory in action and ushered in a whole new generation of action & Sci-Fi thrillers and video games as well(Max Payne comes to mind) it is one of the biggest and most beloved film of the 90's and has one of the biggest fan base out there.

This movie unique and I mean unique story and style has such and impact on you when you first see it you'll want to see it the minute it's over and some more after that and after that and you'll want to see it a million times it's just that good. The Matrix put's a Gothic and dark spin on the dystopia and apocalyptic themes that have become very common in Sci-Fi films, this film does it one better it takes those overly used themes and creates a completely original and unique world around which everything we Believe is a lie. It has a great monolithic tone to it that makes it a masterpiece by any standards and it creates a great aftershock in which few films can actually do these days. It purposes that machines while enslave humanity and use us as a battery source to power there vasts armies of machines around the world. But that's what makes it so great to watch it gives you a sense of hope and a sense of justice that you just feel all the way to your bones.

This movie has given the fellow movie goer what they've always wanted and always searched for in a film, great action, a smart story and plot, acting you can live with and put them all together and what do you got? The Matrix! This movie will stick with long after it's over and even after tour old you'll still remember one movie that rocked your world like none other. All in all this film delivers great any day entertainment that is like Laurence Fishburn said, "" Unfortunately no one can be told what the Matrix is you have to see it for yourself."" And trust me once you do you won't ever look at Sci-Fi or other movies the same way again. This movie delivers.","10"

This is in my top 5 favourite films of all time. All I can say to people out there who don't like this film, is that you are crazy and must have been on drugs while watching this film, because there are no faults in this film. The directing by the Wachowski brothers is excellent.

The Wachowski Brothers, who have written many comics for Marvel before, take almost five years to write the series completely.

On top of that, the Wachowski Brothers tell producer Joel Silver that they want to make a real anime and that they can transfer the action in Hong Kong movies to the audience in another way, by slowing it down.

"Mr_PCM","Yes, it really is as good as you remember","23 March 2013","With all the imitations, spoofs, parodies, rip-offs and sequels that have come from it, it is easy to forget just how groundbreaking 1999's revolutionary film The Matrix really is. Yet even 15 years later, it still has the power to amaze and shock as much as it did on the day of release - power not wielded by many since, and certainly not the two cash-inspired sequels.

Back in 1999, the Matrix was a genuine original - something rarely seen in the movies in the latter decades of the twentieth century. It was a film that took such an interesting concept that it seems amazing that it hadn't been done before, and coupled it with genuinely mind-blowing special effects to produce something very special indeed.

The story itself is almost so simple it's genius. The film's premise rests on the idea that the entire world is an elaborate construct of machines, and that we are unaware that the entire population of the earth is simply plugged into a virtual reality which feeds the sentient machines which now rule the earth. Those few who have escaped are now able to re-enter this 'Matrix' at will, and bend its rules of gravity and physics as one would bend the rules of a computer program. This leads to spectacular shootouts, furiously fast fight scenes, jumping and dodging that would put an Olympic triple jumper to shame, and all of which featuring the now much-parodied slo-mo camera spinning that became synonymous with the film itself, and which made it stand head and shoulders (and knees and toes) above the rest.

It seems odd to think that Keanu Reeves was not the first choice to play the lead role of Neo. Usually being able to display only a single emotion might be a drawback, but in the sepia-tinted dulled colours of the grimy world of The Matrix, Reeves' constant single expression of permanently mildly perturbed seems a perfect fit somehow, and the thought of Will Smith's excessive personality in the lead role (as was apparently the first choice) seems like a completely incongruous thought now. Meanwhile Lawrence Fishburne's presence as a 'Morgan Freeman-in-training' mentor with muscles role is perfect, while Hugo Weaving's minimal yet menacingly effective turn as the villainous Agent Smith nearly steals the show from the effects gurus' noses. His understated delivery is at times positively chilling - in particular his addressing of Reeves' Neo as 'Mr Anderson' in a manner ice-cool yet dripping with malevolent intent. Interestingly now, this role seems perfect preparation for him for his role in a second monumental trilogy of films, as shades of his performance as Agent Smith are apparent in his similarly brilliant role as Elrond in the similarly blockbusting Lord of the Rings. It's just a shame that other roles aren't similarly fleshed out - particularly Joe Pantoliano's potentially fascinating role of 'Cypher' - leaving the central quartet as the only real roles with significant screen time. Additionally, Carrie-Anne Moss lacks the warmth and charm to be a convincing (and inevitable) love interest.

Yet these are only relatively minor quibbles. Which brings us on to the special effects themselves - which are, quite simply, the most visually impressive since Terminator 2's T1000 morphing, if not ever. A number of standout shots have made their way into popular culture - including the camera-spinning freeze-in-midair kick which forms the standout part of the opening scene. Having been imitated so much in numerous subsequent comedies and spoofs such as Scary Movie and Shrek, their impact has perhaps been diluted over time, but to go back and see the shots in their original context still will transport an audience to a state of wonder that only the cinema can bring.

The Matrix is a film that is always well worth a revisit - whether it has been a few weeks or a few years since you have last seen them. It's just unfortunate that it raised the bar so high that few films were able to subsequently raise their game enough to match it - including two average, serviceable but pale-in-comparison sequels that inevitably thought that more equals better. But as a stand-alone film, The Matrix is one that will stand the test of time, and will no doubt come to define the era in the way that classics such as Casablanca, Gone With The Wind and The Godfather have defined theirs.

A true masterpiece.","7"
"jofitz27","The greatest action sci fi ever","10 March 2005","This really is a sci fi action masterpiece to be truly appreciated and watched over and over again. All though it is endlessly complex, and still dragged down by its two poor sequels, this still is an original and brilliant piece of kick ass action and story.

Starting off with pirating criminal Neo (Reeves) he is getting bizarre messages on his computer and having many strange encounters. Particularly in one scene where he is tracked down at his work by some very unfriendly looking criminals... Then we really are shown what a fantastic film this is. After a scene (wince) where he is injected with a bug, and then taken out as he travels naked and skinless through a watery world, we see some incredibly done ""special-effects"" scenes, as well as brilliantly original fight scene with Morpheous... This may be very long, but it never, ever loses its touch. It pulses with fantastic action and violent scenes throughout, whilst the complex story adds to the package. Very, very good.

Final Analysis: ***** out of ***** (5 out of 5)","9"
"svetaaniston","Smart, but nothing really special","15 July 2003","This movie is made very cleverly. It mixes a lot of long-known philosophical ideas into one movie filled with action and special effects. A guaranteed way to succes. However, such an ambitious theme also sets more expectations, and after all has been considered, the only conclusion can be that no new philosophical insights emerge and no deep thoughts have been provoked once the credits start rolling..","5"
"chiguy17","Redefined science fiction","28 May 2019","I know that this is an older film, and the effects are kind of out dated, but at the time, it was absolutely revolutionary. Things like ""bullet time"" were invented to be able to make the story come to life. It has inspired so many filmmakers; not to mention its influence on pop culture in general.

It's a perfect blend of sci-fi and action/adventure (kung fu especially). Sure there are a few plot holes, but things like humans being used as batteries had to be changed to make it more accessible. Apparently the concept was originally to use humans' brains for their computing power, but the studios thought that would be too confusing for viewers.

It truly was a game changer. The sequels definitely went in a different direction, and unfortunately the Wachowski's other efforts haven't lived up to the high bar set by The Matrix, but I can't say enough good things about this movie. Obviously no movie is perfect, but The Matrix is a fun, inventive, action-packed blockbuster of a movie.","6"

The Special effects for this film were spectacular and it has been copied in many other films. Especially during a fight scene when the characters would suddenly stop in mid-air.

But, I felt that the story of this film took a while to take off. Once, Neo had been told the truth and exited the matrix the story began to take off. But, I felt that the beginning of the film seemed to go on for days and that took away from the rest of the film.","10"
"TheBabblingFool","The only competition between T2 as sci-fi film of the 90's.","12 August 2002","There are many choices to have under as action film of the 90's, horror film of the 90's, even martial arts film of the 90's. But throughout the decade the sci-fi film that no one could touch was T2. No other sci-fi film was so revolutionary, and no other sci-fi film was as effective on the way Hollywood did special effects. Until 1999, when The Matrix came out.

Not only did it have a plot that makes you think, it mixes beautiful cinematography with grade-A martial arts, Die Hard style stunts, and makes black trenchcoats cool.

The acting and dialouge in the film is as good as it gets for a sci-fi film. All of the characters had a sort of calm motion to them all. This worked best with Agent Smith and Morpheus, who pulled it off like it was nothing.

Of course the main hype behind the film is the ""bullet time"" effect, but there are other things to put into thought when thinking of renting this movie. Keanu Reeves and Lawrence Fishburne put in 6 months of martial arts training to do their fight scenes, and the shoot-out scene in the lobby took 6 weeks of filming. In other words, this film took a lot of effort and it shows.

I definately recommend this movie.","10"

Both sequels (reloaded and revolutions) can be considered as a single film. Actually, I think if they had combined them in a single film, it would have made a good sequel.","8"

"bd74","Spectacular!","5 April 1999","I originally thought that this film was going to be yet another overrated action flick with nothing more than action scenes and special effects to make it interesting. But I actually liked this film a lot, which is interesting because I'm usually not impressed by action films. There are so many words that can be used to describe this film. Visually, this film can be described as a mixture of ""Dark City"", ""Metropolis"", a comic book, and a progressive music video, all with excellent action scenes, and some of the most outstanding and innovative special effects ever seen. The cinematography is remarkable. I liked the all-black clothes that the group of ""hackers"" wore. I especially liked seeing the character named Switch dressed in the white outfit while the others wore black--I thought it was a nice touch. I'm placing this film on my list of best action films, alongside ""Die Hard"" and ""Ronin"". I look forward to going to the theater and seeing this film again, which is not something I do unless I consider a film to be really good.","10"
"dust-7","Plot holes aplenty, but lots of action - typical movie","7 February 2000","Spoilers!

Story, on a classic premise, about smart machines taking over the world, sometime in the future. Humanity is utterly enslaved, bred merely for bio-electrical energy for the machines; people growing and dying in little bowls of slime, with tubes connected throughout their body and probes into their brains, the bowls stacked miles high like Christmas lights strung down a tall electrical pole. The idea is that the machines create a dream world, a fantasy world for these millions of 'battery' people, these people lying still under the slime, practically comatose their entire lives, so that they will in fact take many years to live out their lives content in the belief they ARE living their lives and all is normal - just a means of extending 'battery' life, as it were. And the fantasy chosen is the world from the last part of the 20th century. And the fantasy world is called - the Matrix. It's elaborate and confusing, and so there's a LOT of narrative in this film - understandably a little too much. The tag line is that you can't explain the matrix - you have to see it. But I think I just explained it. (?)

The good guys are an organized resistance, operating in gigantic sewers under what had been the cities, all bombed out now, flying what look like spaceships, one assumes lingering from the ultimate fight with the machines as they were taking over - but it's suggested the resistance movement began afterward (?). Somehow, this resistance retains their futuristic ships and weapons; each ship operating as an independent cell, tied to the last city of free people - which we never see - called, Zion. Somehow, this resistance manages to enter back into the matrix, at will, to communicate with other members of the resistance, to recruit new members, trying to avoid detection.

Most of the good scenes, the sf/x stuff, occur when they are in this dream state, in the matrix. But the sf/x, in the real world, for some floating robot hunter/killers, called 'sentinels', which go after the resistance space ships, make these 'sentinels' look all too CGI. They look like part of the dream, and it's confusing, cause they are supposed to exist in - reality. Just unconvincing effects, is all.

The hero is ultimately able to somehow ignore the dream, make it dance to his tune, and frustrate the machines, thereby - at least in the matrix. It's not that bad guy and good alike don't alter the dream reality - cause the good guys fly through the air and the bad guys also make lips grow together. But the hero does it to the extent of practically busting up the dream itself. He's the 'chosen one', as it were. In the real world, the resistance ships use EM pulses to disable the machines - and why machinedom can't trace an EM burst to its source, I don't know. Ultimately, the matrix is thwarted by the hero, or is just about to be by film's end. How this disables machinedom, itself, isn't explained. Why the machines wouldn't just reprogram, as they admitted to doing once before, isn't explained. Etc.

If fact, it isn't explained why people are bred. Are cattle too big? Are rabbits too small? In the slime, people in this constant matrix dream don't use their muscles at all. When the hero is rescued by the resistance from his bowl, it takes days to rebuild his atrophied muscles, using future technology. What kind of energy does a body utterly undeveloped generate? It would seem the machines would be pumping everyone full of steroids, and having them run a treadmill every other hour of the day in their 'reality'. Or better yet - why not breed Brahma bulls? I guess the answer is that there couldn't be the story, or the struggle, if people had already been x-ed out of the picture.

I suppose the most interesting thing about the film are the effects. And a few mini-documentaries follow the flick, which explain the burgeoning idea of 'virtual photography' (in this film, a rapid cascade of still cameras along some path, when motion is the necessary artifact of the method), when another shows the storyboards and some rough CGI of scenes from the film, another how they trained in the martial arts, and so on.

Interesting film, in some ways. But if you think _too_ much about it, it makes less and less sense. As for casting Reeves, he does seem a little overly bewildered sometimes, and one wonders how a Samuel Jackson would have done in the role, or someone else; save that the hero is supposed to be some younger nerd/hacker type in the dream/matrix. Reeves gives sort of a Harrison Ford everyman showing, but without the same edge or character Ford always had (even in his Gunsmoke villain days). Then again, they could have cast Leo DeCaprio or David Schwimmer in the lead - so . . . could have been worse.","10"

A masterpiece with new technologie at these times. Keanu Reeves is in his best role. Fantastic world and imagination.","10"
"crowrobot","Slightly overrated, but still a good film","5 April 2005","""The Matrix"" is a hodgepodge of intriguing science fiction and comic-book violence, and although I feel it's overrated (I've heard 1998's ""Dark City"" is a similar yet better movie), I still had a good time.

The special effects in this movie are, without a doubt, some of the best I've ever seen. We get the now-famous ""Bullet Time"" where Neo (Keanu Reeves) dodges oncoming bullets; we get mechanical octopi taking on hovercrafts; we get the swirling fight choreography and slo-mo techniques. All very impressive.

The story is illogical, but it does introduce intriguing suggestions about the difference between reality and dreams; I think we have to take the ""machines-rule-mankind"" aspect on faith.

The acting: Keanu Reeves is good in an uncomplicated role and he looks right for the character, Laurence Fishburne successfully acts this material as if it was Shakespeare, Joe Pantoliano is perfectly slimy as a traitor, Hugo Weaving is one of the best movie villains ever as the sinister Agent Smith, and the sexy Carrie Ann-Moss is Trinity, Neo's (eventual) love interest.

Overall, while I don't think this is one of the best movies ever made, it's still a great movie. 9/10","10"
"thesouthfamily2-552-707097","Never send a human to do a machine's job.","19 January 2014","""The Matrix"" is a visually dazzling cyberadventure, full of kinetic excitement.

I've seen dozens if not hundreds of these exercises in violence, which recycle the same tired ideas: Bad guys fire thousands of rounds, but are unable to hit the good guy. Then it's down to the final showdown between good and evil--a martial arts battle in which the good guy gets pounded until he's almost dead, before he finds the inner will to fight back. Been there, seen that; however this one is an exception, as it done very well.

Still, I must not ignore the movie's virtues. It's great-looking, both in its design and in the kinetic energy that powers it. It uses flawlessly integrated special effects and animation to visualize regions of cyberspace. It creates fearsome creatures, including mechanical octopi. It morphs bodies with the abandon of ""Terminator II."" It uses f/x to allow Neo and Trinity to run horizontally on walls, and hang in the air long enough to deliver karate kicks. It has leaps through space, thrilling sequences involving fights on rooftops, helicopter rescues and battles over mind control.

And it has performances that find the right notes. Keanu Reeves goes for the impassive Harrison Ford approach, ""acting"" as little as possible. I suppose that's the right idea. Laurence Fishburne finds a balance between action hero and Zen master. Carrie-Anne Moss, as Trinity, has a sensational title sequence, before the movie recalls that she's a woman and shuttles her into support mode. Hugo Weaving, as the chief Agent, uses a flat, menacing tone that reminded me of Tommy Lee Jones in passive-aggressive overdrive. There's a well-acted scene involving Gloria Foster as the Oracle, who like all Oracles is maddeningly enigmatic.

""The Matrix"" did not bore me. It interested me so much, indeed, that I wanted to be challenged even more. I wanted it to follow its material to audacious conclusions, to arrive not simply at victory, but at revelation.","10"
"nmholland","A Revolution For The Action Genre","10 April 2016","The Matrix is directed by the Wachowski Brothers and stars Keanu Reeves, Laurence Fishburne, Hugo Weaving, and Carrie-Anne Moss. The basic plot of the movie is a computer hacker named Thomas Anderson, whose code name is Neo, finds out that everything he believes about his reality is a lie, and that he must learn to fight a certain force in order to ensure the survival of humanity. That's all I can say without spoiling the entire film.

The Matrix is one of the most revolutionary films of all time, especially in terms of the action genre. There's no explaining just how amazing The Matrix is, without just recommending it to a person who has never before seen it. Everything that can be said about The Matrix has already been said, and I'm just going to say it again.

The absolute best thing about The Matrix is the indescribable direction. Rarely are there films in which they look better almost 20 years after they come out, then when they first hit theaters, yet The Matrix is one of them. Even movies that used very little special effects, like Star Wars (1977) still have little points that look a bit fake. Not The Matrix. Every single shot of Keanu Reeves dodging bullets, or Laurence Fishburne doing a back flip and kicking Hugo Weaving in the face looks inexpressibly beautiful. Nothing since this movie, not even its two sequels, have come even close to the directing capabilities, no matter how hard they've tried.

Another great thing The Matrix offers is the incredible acting. Even Keanu Reeves, who is considered one of the best worst actors of all time, does really good. He isn't Keanu Reeves in this movie, he's Neo, and he knows it. Laurence Fishburne as Morpheus is one of the most iconic characters of all time, and does great all throughout the film, whether it's an exposition scene or one of the many amazing action sequences. I don't even need to say that Hugo Weaving did near perfect, because, well, it's Hugo Weaving. And he does near perfect. Carrie- Anne Moss plays a great Trinity, to the point in which I couldn't see any other actress playing her character at all, and that's saying something.

The special effects. Wow, the special effects. The Matrix contains some of the best special effects ever put to film, ever. As mentioned earlier, many other films have tried to copy The Matrix's directing style, and none have even come close to it, even its two pretty disappointing sequels. The Matrix's special effects are utterly perfect, and there's no doubt about it. Every single scene has flawless special effects, and blends them in incredibly, leaving not a single trace of doubt in them.

The script for The Matrix is also as good as it gets. Although there is the symbolic ""woah"" from Keanu Reeves, every single line fits into the film perfectly. The Matrix has one of the few scripts that I would have no complaints with. Not even one. Not too often does a script describe action scenes, like this one does. I implore you to read the script for The Matrix, and just see how in depth The Wachowski's went into the action scenes. Reading the script feels almost like reading a full length book due to the extent that the writers went to in order to achieve this masterpiece.

In conclusion, The Matrix is one of the best action films of all time, and might just be one of the best movies of all time. Thanks to its revolutionary directing, perfect script, and near flawless acting, I'd recommend The Matrix to anyone, as long as you avoid its two sequels.","9"
"fleagles","Unique sci-fi action","25 September 2000","Many moviegoers have voted The Matrix as one of the greatest films of all time (current ranking on the IMDB 250: 31st), but it does not deserve that ranking. It is however, a very good film for its genre(s); a sci-fi thriller with lots of martial arts.

I won't try to explain the plot, because I only started to understand the story about an hour into this film, and even then am not sure what was going on. That being said, The Matrix is arguably Keanu Reeves' best film. Reeves, who is constantly derided as a mumbling surfer dude, fits his role perfectly as a hacker/possible savior of mankind. The martial arts sequences, while somewhat campy, are amazing, and the video-game-like action sequences are certainly unique (did he really need that many guns, though ?) Laurence Fishburne and the always good Joe Pantoliano are also very good in this unique film. Among the best films ever ? Not by a long shot.","8"

"starlit-sky","The Most Philosophical Science Fiction Movie Ever!","12 August 2000","There are so many reasons why I think ""The Matrix"" is the most brilliant science fiction movie ever made but I like to present its philosophical implications because that's what interested me most. Now, most people may think that ""The Matrix"" is just a great science fiction movie with lots of amazing special effects but there is more to it than that. As a person with special interest in philosophy, I was amazed by the plot. It's like Plato's theory of forms converted into a science fiction plot! Plato is one of the greatest philosophers of all time from ancient Greece who theorized that the world we live in is not real. Instead, it is a reflection of a real world and all the objects we see are mere shadows of the ideal forms which exit in that real world. I do not want to go into much detail for I think the implication is obvious: The world we live in is ""The Matrix"" where nothing is real; it is a computer-generated reality in which human minds are trapped while our real brains are hooked up to a giant computer administering that program to consume our energy. So everything we see is just a reflection of the objects created in that program, electronic signals stimulating our nerves to give us the impression that we are actually sensing material objects. In fact we are just watching the shield put in front of our eyes to prevent us from seeing the truth (just like in Plato's cave). Now this plot is amazingly parallel with the most recent findings in physics; Bertrand Russell explained it in a completely scientific way that we can never know if the real world exists because all we sense is just electronic signals stimulating our senses; we cannot know where these electronic signals are coming from or if the source of these signals is a ""material substance"" in the sense we think of the term. ""The Matrix"" suggests that these signals are delivered to us by a computer. There have been many empiricist philosophers, like George Berkeley and David Hume who denied the existence of the material world but their methods of proving their theories were not as scientific as the ones developed in the mid 1900s. ""The Matrix"" is a movie where implications in these philosophical theories are presented in science fiction which, I think, makes ""The Matrix"" so special. I sometimes think that this world is not real and our real existence lies in another dimension. I have friends who have the exact same feeling. Those of you who have similar thoughts will find the science fictional interpretation of their thoughts in ""The Matrix"".

The fact that ""The Matrix"" is a computer-generated reality makes all the visual effects, specially the fighting scenes, very plausible. Luckily, this fact makes it possible to create any kind of visual effects without the risk of making it look unrealistic (this is a computer program, anything can be real). ""The Matrix"" is definitely one of its kind; it is not like most other science fiction movies where humans are against aliens. The screenplay is so original that it makes it surpass all other science fiction movies except, maybe my other science fiction favourite, ""The Planet Of The Apes"". I cannot imagine a science fiction fan not liking this movie.","7"
"Mario64","An enjoyable, visually impressive flick.","8 August 2001","The Matrix was a surprising delight of a movie. The story is deep and interesting and it flows along well. The visuals are the best part of this movie. It's great effects to the likes of which we really have never seen before and are done in a way that's just fasinating. The characters are mostly all played well, particularly Keanu Reaves who plays his best role since Speed. The only downside to this movie is that in the end it really never gives you any clear thought to what has really happened. Still I really liked this movie and give it an 8 out of 10.","6"
"ericjg623","This is what movies are all about","5 July 2001","The initial response to seeing this is much like after having seen Star Wars for the first time. You just go ""Wow!"". The best movies use the visual medium to create new worlds and bring them to life, and that's what this movie is all about.

In the case of ""The Matrix"", you start out with a female hacker being confronted by a squad of cops. She makes a spectacular escape, making moves that are simply superhuman, and which sets up the tone for the rest of the film. You know within the first five minutes that you are in for a wild ride. Next, we are introduced to ""Neo"", a hacker by night, a working stiff in a huge software company by day. He's a regular schmuck, his boss chews him out for showing up late because he's been out partying all night with his cyberpunk friends. Things seem normal enough, but something just isn't quite right. When Neo digs deeper, and makes contact with a mysterious fellow known only as Morpheus"", he finds out just how wrong things really are. The most bracing scenes in this whole movie are when Morpheus shows Neo exactly the true nature of the world he lives in. Even though you know this is a sci-fi thriller with bizarre plot twists, you are simply not prepared for what he finds out. Without revealing the actual plot, let's just say it borrows ideas put forth in The Terminator, Total Recall, Tron, Blade Runner, and even Alice in Wonderland and 1984 (think of the interrogation scene) yet creates a completely original story to which are added stunning visual effects. And yet, unlike some other films, the effects just add to the basic plot as opposed to becoming the dominant feature (a la Terminator 2). For example, the virtual reality fight scenes are in themselves amazing, but merely serve to point out that, in such an environment, a well trained warrior could use his/her mind to overcome the limits of body and physics and accomplish the impossible.

Well, lest I ramble on too long, the basic point is this is one of those rare movies that just grabs you from the opening minutes and never lets go. It sucks you into a bizarre world that nonetheless seems totally real and believable. What more could you ask for in a sci-fi action thriller?","10"
"blissey_s","Millenium Masterpiece","14 January 2022","The Matrix has attracted a huge fan following for good reason: it's original, it's full of action and it's based on a concept that many of us can relate to. This last point is, I think, why The Matrix has garnered such widespread attention. All of us, at one point or another, have looked around and wondered why we're here. Who decided that we were to be born to two parents, go to school, get a job, fall in love, have children, get old, die and then repeat the entire process again and again ad nauseam? So far, the answer to this question remains a mystery, but The Matrix proposes a possible answer, and that so-called answer is just believable and understandable enough to make us think, even if it's only subconsciously, that it might be true.

The appeal of The Matrix is that for us who suffer through life perhaps there is salvation somewhere and we too can become like Neo and the gang and fight to awaken others around us. It's kind of a noble idea and one that holds a lot of temptation. The way The Matrix is executed only adds to its brilliance. The combination of classic shoot out scenes with weird computerized graphics was something truly revolutionary for its time. Remember, this was released when the web and computers were in their infancy so a lot of it was completely brand new, although through the eyes of someone living in 2022 the graphics might seem corny and outdated.

The Matrix has not aged well in terms of the innovation that has come since, but it remains the classic predecessor to many films of the same genre that came after, and spawned so many iconic moments that have been imitated or spoofed in various ways since.","9"

Keanu Reeves is the perfect hero in this, and Carrie-Anne Moss and Laurence Fishburne are excellent in this too, and add to the mystery and secrets of this film.

Reeves, Moss, and Fishburne trained months for the martial arts scenes, and their accomplished athleticism and physical aesthetic makes this much more than a 32-bit version of TRON.

Its full of state of the art special effects, expertly choreographed fights and dashing heroes, a beautiful heroine and evil villains.

I had a little trouble with the story, however. We are supposed to believe that the world as we know it is a computerized matrix and that nothing is real. Laurence Fishburne and his gang of ""rebels"" are supposed to be fighting the evil ""agents"" through some form of virtual reality transfers from their ""ship"" back and forth to the ""real world"". And we are supposed to accept Keannu Reeves,the hero, as the ""second coming""? Give me a break.

Reeves is OK as the super hero and Laurence Fishburne is excellent as the leader of the rebel forces. I also liked Carrie-Anne Moss as the heroine and wish more had developed between her and the Reeves character.

I know that I'm in a minority, but special effects aside, I just thought that The Matrix was a little to far-fetched to be believable.","9"
"Denver53","Good idea, some great execution, but fizzles","20 October 1999","The Matrix took a great idea, set it up in a very involving manner, then collapsed at the end by seeming to forget everything it had set up and devolving into a plain old shoot out.

I'm not a K. Reeves fan, but he was fine here because he didn't need to act (I don't think he has really acted since ""Bill & Ted""). His supporting cast was better, if underused (we never got to know Mouse or a handful of the other members of the resistance band).

It was the concept that shined and hooked the viewer immediately.

SPOILERS AHEAD

The idea that we live in an illusion set up by a ""master race"" artificial intelligence that uses human bodies in stasis as battery power was horrifying and well presented. The mythology of a prophesied ""chosen one"" was a bit shallow; no time was spent explaining how and when this prophesy came to be, or even how long this resistance had been around looking for The One.

That made the repeated references to whether Reeves' character was The One annoying, because it was hard to tell why anyone would think he was, and what exactly made him The One to begin with (that is finally explained in a couple of lines in the latter third of the movie).

Many people have written about the visual effects in The Matrix, so I won't other than to say they were outstanding. Even better was the fact that the effects had a point; they showed how a person in the simulated world could use his/her awareness of the simulation to alter the supposed ""reality."" And altering the simulated reality could mean life or death.

For the first hour to 75 minutes of The Matrix, I was drawn in and at times mesmerized. Then the bottom fell out.

For reasons I thought were unclear, when it came time to rescue the leader of the resistance, Reeves and a fellow rebel choose to storm the enemy citadel and basically ""blow stuff up."" Two people take on a small army of guards and somehow, inexplicably, and with vitually no strategy or stealth, manage to blast their way through to the imprisoned leader. For a movie that took great pains to show us the virtual simulation and how it could be manipulated by those with the ability, abandoning that tack for a plain old blow-em-up was patronizing and insulting. Sure, perhaps the twosome managed to dodge a few bullets through their VR tricks, but not the thousands of rounds sent their way by multiple guards. Why take the chance that you won't get through? Because you are The One and can't be stopped? Please. Then why not just saunter through unarmed?

It would have made a lot more sense, and would have been much more satisfying, if the duo had come up with some special maneuvers to use their awareness of the VR to their advantage.

The climactic battle between Reeves and the computer's agents was similar. It did make use of a special talent The One had, but otherwise, it was like a kung fu movie. Very disappointing. An analogy would be watching a terrific play on Broadway that, in the last act, suddenly became vaudeville.

It's too bad the movie went in that direction. Its impact would have been much greater had it continued on the path on which it started.","10"
"MickeyTo","Lift the veil ... and it's still bad acting!","6 February 2000","I saw this movie when it first hit theaters and then again on video a year later. The first time I saw it I remember hating it and I couldn't understand why it became such a cult classic with practically everybody. I seemed to enjoy it a bit more on the small screen, perhaps because of the new venue, it seemed a bit slicker than what I recall, however, I can't get past the fact that Keanu Reeves is a lousy actor, and what's worse, that The Matrix is a great idea gone horribly wrong.

The Matrix is the story of a computer geek who sells bootleg software to the underground market. We are never quite sure what he is selling, but we know it must be good because his clients are paying top dollar to get it. Reeves is Neo, an unsatisfied software pusher who is contacted via his computer, by a group of action heroes who are somehow able to dodge bullets and clobber anyone in their path.

These hooligans, headed up by Laurence Fishbourne, claim that they need Neo's help, and promise him the truth that he has been searching for. Before he can make up his mind, the authorities are hot on his trail, threatening untold danger if he doesn't turn his new friends in.

Neo is offered the truth in the form of a pill, a la Alice in Wonderland. One pill will show him the light, the other will allow him to return to his day to day world. Of course he chooses the light.

The light, as it turns out, is that we are living a false life. We are actually hundreds of years ahead and we are being kept in a state of incubus. Our minds are controlled by a computer program that lets us imagine that we a members of the 20th century. And that's just the beginning.

The Matrix is a nicely styled action flick, offering some neat special effects and a seemingly cool plot. As stories go, this one is brilliant. But The Matrix is far from perfect.

Let's start off with Keanu. As one of the worst actors ever to rise out of Hollywood, this guy grunts and groans his way through his part, acting as an extension of his old Bill and Ted character. For an action star this would normally be fine, but Reeves takes himself far too seriously (as usual) and his deadpan wit is no where near as funny as his contemporary, Arnold Schwarzengger.

What's worse than Keanu's bad acting? Well, his bad acting happens to be the best acting in the entire film. All of the supporting stars, including Fishbourne, over act their way into oblivion, making what should have been an interesting premise, seem silly and trite.

And just when you think it can't get any worse, the big finale arrives. I got the feeling that the writers/producers ran out of neat ideas, or perhaps they just felt that this was going no where so they decided to really screw things up. I won't spoil it, except to say that this flick turns from being too serious to being too outrageous.

In the end, The Matrix is nothing but a big let down. However, I can't argue with the overwhelming response from fans everywhere who have already taken this film to cult-like status. Maybe I'm just not in touch with today's movie going public. Or maybe I just took a different pill than everyone else.","10"
"GHCool","Good story, great technique","14 April 2003","I saw THE MATRIX again recently. It was a much different experience when I saw it for the first time. The first time I saw it was on its opening weekend. It just looked like a somewhat cool movie and I was bored that day. It wasn't famous or anything yet. I walked out of the theater knowing I saw something special, but I didn't realize how special it was (largely because I didn't realize how intricate the special effects are).

Last week was at least the 5th time I saw it. I was aware of the cult status it had and how many movies copied it and how many of its lines and ideas are memorized by science fiction fans. I also had a better idea of what went into making it (I don't think I'll ever understand the true complexity of it).

I had more admiration this time for the technical stuff, but I felt basically the same about the story. It is excellent and has a lot of good philosophy, but it doesn't really have an ending. In place of an ending, it has a long violent action sequence and then the fight between Agent Smith and Neo. They are among the best action sequences and fights ever filmed, but compared to the richness of the story in the beginning, I always felt it could have been more.

What I'm trying to say is that I have no doubt that MATRIX RELOADED and MATRIX REVOLUTIONS are for sure going to be at least as good as the ending of THE MATRIX. I just hope it also has some of the stuff that made the beginning and middle of THE MATRIX great too.","5"
"mrincodi","Entire world: forgive me: I didn't like it.","10 September 2002","Well, what's the big deal? Dragon Ball-like special effects? The emancipation of selfishness as the greatest ""virtue""? C´mon, you don't learn anything from this movie. It's bubble gum for the eyes: useless. The only interesting idea is that about that reality is not what we think. Well, I liked the quid and spider-like robots. But, the story? Bah: nobody helps nobody in this movie (above all, that super-egocentric ""Neo"" character). And, oh, yes, it's TOO violent, much, much more than what it needed (bullet showers and destroyed buildings were what this pacific world was needing, isn't it?). If you think you are the center of the world, you will love The Matrix. I didn't.

If you want a really good sci-fi movie, go for 12 Monkeys.

An excellent film, with ground-breaking historical special effects, for all adult men to see. A Man's film. What I disliked about the film and by film makers in general is the use of slight green tint. It is unneccessarily used. I would have given The Matrix the highest rating if the film was entirely in rich, true colors.","5"
"Jeremy Bristol","Cool kung fu, but then it ""tries"" to be more and becomes something scary.","31 May 2001","There are definite plot holes in this movie (come on, do you really think that just because you think you're dead you die?). And the back story makes no sense (why would a computer waste it's precious juice on such an elaborate hoax as the Matrix--if you cut the damn spinal cord, a humans will go nowhere and still generate just as much body heat and electrical impulses--and as expressed in the Terminator, computers have no pity, no remorse, so they wouldn't be sentimental enough to find some way to let people be happy). Cool kung fu, though.

Which brings us to the real reason I don't like Matrix much (6/10): like Michael Bay's Pearl Harbor today, there is a lot of killing in the name of Good (the humans are killing humans to save them, while Bay shows the deaths of many US military personnel in a supposed effort to honor them) without any thought or reflection as to the implications. Once Lawrence Fishburne says that the humans can be inhabited by the enforcers, it becomes open season on everybody. This gives the message that slavery is worse than death. Personally, I've always thought Locke listed the inalienable rights in order of importance--life, liberty, then property. Once you're dead, you can't have any liberties. It's one thing to give your life for liberty, but it's another thing altogether to have your life taken away for that purpose. There used to be movies where it was debated whether it was even right to kill the bad guys (Casablanca, Lifeboat), now it seems to be open season all over again.","5"
"great_sphinx_42","Free your mind, and the rest will follow.....","13 August 2001","There is so much that's good about this movie, it's a shame that there's even a little that's bad about it- but there is. First of all, the bad: some of the performances and dialogue are a bit stilted. Not even the main characters are particularly developed beyond their central archtypes- Trinity and Neo's love story isn't the least bit believable because of this. The final scene is just silly. And the whole film has the Messiah Complex, which has been done and done and done...... Okay, enough haggling. Here's the good: everything else. The whole idea is cool. This just might be the launching film for a whole mythos, like 'A New Hope' and (hopefully) the first Lord of the Rings movie. There are metaphors and analogies here, a lot of them. The Wachowski brothers showed great promise with their very first flick, the terrific 'Bound', and continue to do so here. There are small things that intrigue me- things like the little robots that help with the human-harvesting and look like a cross between insects and surgical instruments. Visually, the movie is nothing short of an unprescedented marvel and has already proven to be one of the most seminal films made in the last couple of decades in that regard. Hugo Weaving is a true find- amazingly creepy as Agent Smith, he absolutely exudes menace and contempt for humanity. The story is rooted in our race's fear of our own creation- technology. Technology has been our salvation. It has allowed the human being- a physically inferior mammal with few natural characteristics to recommend it- to thrive. Cautionary tales that display our fear that it will also be our destruction abound- 'The Matrix' is one of the best. It will be interesting to see how the series develops. It could be as important to the action genre in terms of complete, complex story-telling as it already is visually. One can hope. With the Wachowskis at the helm, there's a good chance.","10"

This film does borrow a couple elements from other hit blockbusters though: it's grim factor and backgrounds are very much like ""Blade Runner;"" the ""machine"" world is very much like the shock value of ""The Terminator;"" there is one scene that requires our main protagonist to take either a red or blue pill ( ""Total Recall""); Don Davis's musical score is like a ""Star Wars"" score that is constantly frantic; the lobby shoot-out reminds viewers of how intense the one in ""Heat"" was; there is electronic/rock n' roll music playing in the background while people in leathery capes kill other people who are dressed similarly ( ""Blade"" ); and, last of all, the entire movie also consists of symbolism to Comic-Books and religion, which is also pretty classic !

Still, the film is undeniably a must-see before anyone here leaves this world ( and hopefully doesn't end up in this one ! ) and deserves it's acclaim.","8"
"bullions27","A Favorite","27 October 2000","The Matrix is a technical and special FX marvel of unbound lengths. What they have put together here, the scenery, the colors, the lightning, the sets, is a true masterpiece of the sci-fi genre. The story, a bit more serious and exponentially more intelligent than the folly of Phantom Menace released in the same year, does make you think about the privacy of our own world. This question has always been around us, although maybe in a different tone and not as dramatic as how The Matrix brings it out. Are we really monitored and watched by someone? When we purchase by credit card, make a phone call, go on the Internet, what have you, all of those signals broadcast out, are they being monitored? It at least plants a thought in your brain compared to some of the other recent mindless sci-fi films which includes the aforementioned Phantom Menace and Wing Commander. There are a few parts of the movie that were recycled from earlier films. I don't really mind since NEARLY EVERY sci-fi film since the birth of the genre has recycled one of the older concepts at one point or another. It's already a known fact. Tinkering around it however and throwing in your own blend and style is what distinguishes the new from the old.

Every character in the film is unique, with the exception of maybe Neo who Keanu expertly plays as another airhead. What I like about the characters is that they work with each other well. They rely upon each other's individual strengths. Neo could have turned into a one man show easily for the entire film but it took everyone to get him there and he feeds off of that.

I'm glad that this film did so well with the awards and the box-office. It tells you the sci-fi genre, the serious sci-fi, is still alive.","8"

It is original, thought-provoking, great-looking, and constantly surprising. It also is proving to be the most influential and widely-copied film since ""Pulp Fiction"". The writing and plotting are far superior to 99% of the action movies out there, combining already familiar sci-fi elements (""Star Wars"", ""Lawnmower Man"", ""They Live"") with Zen philosophy and martial-arts mayhem. The zeitgeist of the millennial era is perfectly captured here, exploiting the apprehension and bewilderment many people feel at the overwhelming advance of technology, while celebrating the indomitability of the human spirit. I only hope that the sequels can maintain the same level of excellence.

Matrix hasn't been helped either by the amount of spoofs/rip offs featuring the scenes where the action stops , the frame freezes , the camera turns 360 degrees and then the action starts again . These scenes were jaw dropping at the time but have now been done by countless ads , pop videos and other movies it's become impossible now to remember the impact this cinematography technique had at the time .

"Coolflic","Sci-fi perfection.?","15 June 1999","Having read some of the reviews of this film on the imdb I felt there were some doubts over its quality but after a few minutes of watching it those doubts where blown away and I new I was in for a 'trip'.

As a piece of science fiction this film can only be described as a work of genius and proof that when it comes to film writing and directing two heads, or two Wachowski brothers, are better than one.

What makes this film so good is the mind bending concept in the story of a universal virtual reality, a very simple but effective idea which is portrayed to perfection by the smallest detail. The comic book origins of the sets provided the duo with proven material and they choose well. The outstanding and ground breaking special effects pushed the film to even greater highs and they even had the self belief to include marshal arts style fight scenes that any oriental director would have been proud of. All these elements came together to produce one awesome movie. My only criticism would be a possible continuity fault with some of the 'damage' accumulated by most of the characters.

It was a risk to cast Keanu Reeves in a lead role given the public attitude to his acting abilities but thankfully those abilities when not over stretched as you would expect with this type of film and he has done his career a favour. The rest of the cast were equally efficient.

This film is labelled as science fiction but it is also an orgy of violence and destruction given a positive twist with music and fashion, a death in cyberspace is still a death on-screen. I think it would it have been far better to have gone the whole hog and included more sex scenes, as was hinted at in the film. This would have made it an over 18 rating and a more rounded piece of work.

What is the Matrix.? The Matrix is what we can expect in our theatres for the next millennium. Cool.","7"
"filmfan1991","Happy 20th Anniversary to one of the most epic science fiction films of all time","31 March 2019","Today marks the 20th Anniversary to the The Wachowskis epic masterpiece ""The Matrix"" and I just got done watching my midnight showing in 4K HDR and I have to say that watching it like this is like watching the film for the very first time 20 years ago today. I was too young to have seen this in the movie theaters back in the day and didn't watch it fully until I was older. Now it is one of my favorite films of all time.

What is the Matrix?

That is the question literal office drone Thomas ""Neo"" Anderson is asking when he questions his reality. He finds out the answer the hard way when he discovers that his reality is a lie, nothing more than a computer generated dreamworld known only as The Matrix, designed by a race of machines in order to keep what's left of humanity under control and to serve as a power source. When he learns the truth, he follows his destiny as ""The One"", the one human who would show humanity the truth and free them from the machines grasp.

""The Matrix"" is one of the most innovative films of the last two decades and it holds up beautifully unlike some other films released in 1999. The film was highly innovative for its slow motion action sequences, kung fu and a special effect known as bullet time where you see a bullet flying through the air in slow motion even leaving behind a ripple effect. While action and special effects hold up nicely, the thought provoking story adds more icing to the cake. The story involves philosophy, noir, religion and the very nature of humanity. It asks the audience questions and it does it in a very smart way under the guise of a summer action blockbuster. Most action movies are dumb mindless fun, but not ""The Matrix"".

The acting is great across the board. Keanu Reeves is stoic as Neo but he does a great job of pulling off the role. Everyone else is fantastic from Laurence Fishburne as Neo's mentor to Carrie-Anne Moss as Neo's love interest and action girl. But the best performance goes to Hugo Weaving as Agent Smith. Weaving is menacing and calculating in the role. He plays as a villain that you absolutely love to hate but can still understand.

""The Matrix"" is a film that comes as close to perfection as possible. There are minor flaws and possible plot holes but the film is so well crafted and immersive that those flaws aren't substantial enough to tamper with ones experience when watching this film.

This film is quite possibly one of the best science fiction films ever made on par with the original ""Star Wars"" from 1977. Even if you haven't seen it, please by all means watch it at least once in your life.

All I can say now is Happy 20th Anniversary to ""The Matrix"" and thank you to the The Wachowskis for making this epic masterpiece and allowing it to endure.","10"

"keihan","""Metropolis"" meets ""Star Wars""...","1 August 2000","I have not seen ""The Matrix"" since it's initial release in theaters in 1999 (I, in fact, saw it twice, a very rare occurence for me). The reason I haven't written a review for it before now is that I wanted time to think about it. The reason I haven't watched it on videocassette is because I'm still waiting on the widescreen edition.

While I am sure most would recognize the second film above (is there anyone on this planet who COULDN'T?), the first may seem unfamiliar. ""Metropolis"" is widely regarded as the first science-fiction film, dealing mainly in the themes of the dehumanization brought on by the rise of the eras of Industrial Revolution and Big Business. ""The Matrix"" can be seen as the ultimate updating of that concept, where the fruits of those revolutions have contributed to much of what ""Metropolis"" foresaw. What is the difference between being a factory worker and an office worker in our day and age? Both require two things that Stephen King in ""Danse Macabre"" said are the only qualification to be a Hollywood screenwriter: a low-alpha wave pattern and the soul of a drone. Most corporations simply don't care if you live or die. If you don't play the game according to their rules, well, you can always be replaced, rather like a cog in a fine Swiss watch. This is the reality of our age because too many people DON'T want to or can't try some other way.

Which leads me to the real problem in ""The Matrix"". It isn't, as so many of the short-sighted have said, the machines, it's the people. Morpheus points out that most of the people who aren't clued in to what the REAL situation is simply couldn't withstand the shock. To quote Hamlet's most famous speech, they would rather ""bear those ills they have rather than fly to others that they know not of."" That doesn't make them evil or stupid. It's simply human nature. Neo himself is not immune to this hard blow to his world, as his initial enlightenment session ends rather badly. That's why most dictatorships on this planet stay in place for longer periods than most Americans sometimes expect. People prefer the devil they do know to the devil they don't know.

Mixing into this basic core is the mythic elements pinpointed by Carl Jung that, while, on the surface, may seem preposterous, actually have a logical explaination. My pet theory is that the Oracle is actually not a human being, but a computer program. The prophecy mentioned could easily be just the end result of a mathematical probability equation, not unlike the psychohistory concept put forth in Issac Asimov's ""Foundation"" novels. If someone like the One could exist once, it is logical to assume that, with the right combination of genetic factors, such a being would come into existence again. When the Oracle was touching Neo's hand, it was, no doubt, scanning for those factors and found them. Still, it didn't tell him that he was the One; it told him what he needed to know to realize his full potential. After all, the prophecy she told Neo DID come true.

Of course, it helps that this film combined with it's message some of the most impressive action this side of ""Terminator"". John Woo is the usual one cited in the scenes of slo-mo gunplay, but even Woo owes a debt to the late great Sam Peckinpah, who took the ballet and carnage of violence to new heights while not losing track of the story. The kung-fu sequences are probably the best done in an American film since ""Enter The Dragon"". Top them off with some of the most amazing SFX in years and you have a truly unique experience.

Characterization, usually given short shrift in most action films of recent years, is central to the plot. Whether you're talking about Reeves' hesistant savior, Fishbourne's wise mentor (easily the best performance in the film), Moss' tough-as-nails Trinity, Pantoliano's weary traitor, or Weaving's chillingly malicious Agent Smith (the most scary machine character since HAL 9000), I never got the impression I was watching cardboard cutouts, but real characters with real questions and struggles. Without this last element, ""The Matrix"" would have been an empty exercise for me. With it, it's a ""Metropolis"" for the 90's.","9"
"flickjunkie-3","One of the best science fiction films in a long time!","22 November 2000","The first time I saw The Matrix, I thought it was such tosh that I didn't even bother to watch all of it. When I came on Cable TV, I decided I would give it another go. I watched the whole thing, and I was thoroughly impressed! I think The Matrix is one of those movies were it must be seen twice to be understood, and to be liked.

Thomas Anderson (Keanu Reeves) is a bit of a slacker, selling illegal software on the side under the pseudonym 'Neo' to finance his computer hardware needs. He wants to find someone called Morpheus (Laurence Fishburne). He's searching for the answer to a question. He has no idea where the question came from. But the urge to discover ""What is the Matrix?"" will lead him to places where nothing is what is seems and to people who hope he is The One...

Although over-hyped, The Matrix is a largely entertaining sci-fi thriller with an attitude. The action sequences are stunning, the sound is immaculate and the acting is very watchable, Fishburne in particular is amazing as Morpehus.

Overall, I strongly recommend The Matrix. It is a stunning, clever and unique thriller with style.

"ToldYaSo","Not a bad film, even with the ""Keanu"" Factor","24 April 1999","I had a bit of reluctance to see ""The Matrix"". I had figured it for one of those run-of-the-mill stupid sci-fi films without a brain and all special effects and didn't give it much thought after that. The reasons were simple.

1. ""Matrix"", ""13th Floor"" and ""Existenz"" are all films that play with ""alternate realities"" and none of their previews made me want to see them much, with ""The Matrix"" perhaps tugging at my wallet just a bit.

2. Lawrence Fishburne pulled me in to ""Event Horizon"" which was a pretty bad film that I didn't expect ""Matrix"" to be any better than, and I still haven't forgiven him for that.

3. Perhaps the strongest factor of all, Keanu Reeves, not being a bastion of good taste or strong acting ability, whom the public can stand if he simply can manage to not suck too badly. He brings a fairly robotic element to all of his roles that may be appreciated in another century and make him the actor of the millennium.

4. Lots of teenagers were raving about it. The same kind of people whom I suspect are already lined up for the ""Phantom Menace"" which is the clearest indication and proof of a loser with time on their hands as could ever be devised. Lawn chairs + Laptops + 6 weeks = Loser.

The reason I caved in to see it, however, was based on some positive reviews from some reliable and trustworthy sources, and a good friend whom I don't see much was eager to see it. My good friend Kalev also took the time to relate some of the finer points of the film with great enthusiasm, and so I promptly decided to see it. But most importantly of all, the Wachowski Brothers were behind it, and I thoroughly enjoyed their film ""Bound"", so there you have it.

The film is a visually stunning, no contest. The acting is passable and the dialogue is just on the edge of being too expository but the story's elements are at times so complex, this measure can be forgiven quickly. This is a film for the Marital Arts fan. The fight scenes are fantastic and executed with originality.

The story line owes a great debt to ""Invasion Of The Body Snatchers"", which if you enjoyed the Matrix you should check out one or both of the first two versions only. But as one of my ""computer g_ _ k"" friends has informed me, ""The Matrix"" writers really did their homework and those aspects held up well.

"Tresix","The longest, most expensive GAP commercial ever made!","14 August 2000","Okay, I know a lot of heat is going to come my way for saying this, but I'm ready. So, here goes: I did NOT like this movie! I'm not saying that it's terrible, just that it didn't move me the way that it seems to have touched some people's lives. The perpetually perplexed Keanu Reeves is Thomas aka Neo, an office grunt/computer hacker who is recruited by the mysterious Morpheus (Laurence Fishburne)to free humanity from enslavement by machines. It seems that the world that we are living in is all an illusion provided by free-thinking computers who are using people as batteries (Can I be an ENERGIZER? They last longer). The only thing standing between humanity and totally servitude are the Agents, led by the soulless Agent Smith (played by Hugo Weaving in a good performance). Agents are the only ones who seem to have the ability to alter the reality around them, making them able to do fantastic things like dodge bullets and the like. Neo is shown that he, too, can alter the world around him when Morpheus jumps from one roof to another a block away (to which Keanu gives his signature line: ""Whoa!""). He is then trained in hand-to-hand combat, spaceship-piloting and the use of high-calibre automatic firearms. This seems to provide the film with its strong suit: Dazzling stunts and special effects. However, I found the story to be just a little too pretentious. I realize that there is a lot of symbolism within the story (most of it cribbed from the New Testament), but, while watching the movie and getting the messages of the movie, I half expected to see signposts appear saying CAUTION! METAPHORS AHEAD! I did get a kick, however, out of the street intersections mentioned in the film where all of the ""exits"" were: They are actually streets in Chicago, the Wachowski brothers' (and my) hometown. As I said before, the special effects and stuntwork are fabulous. In fact, I thought the film should have received Oscar nominations for its Art Direction and Costumes. Beyond that, I thought THE MATRIX was nothing more than the longest, most expensive GAP commercial ever made. For a better handling of this type of material, I suggest two films that could be combined to make a better MATRIX: THE LAST DRAGON (for it's metaphysical message and martial arts action) and DARK CITY (for it's handling of a scary fantasy city under siege). Okay, let the brickbats and/or bouquets fly . . . !","10"

"chuckrules","good...but not great","27 March 2002","I had a chance to see Andy and Larry Wachowski's ground breaking thrill ride a minute movie, The Matrix, last night. I have to say that as writers the two brothers are very good Directors. The story is fairly straightforward. It seems that our reality is not really our reality but a computer generated one and the year is somewhere close to 2200. The computers harvest babies and use them as giant batteries to keep the computer generated world running as they see fit. A few special people are able to break out of this dream life and begin their battle against the computers. One group, led by Morpheus, is searching for the mythical ""One"". A man who will be able to fight the computers with their own strengths and lead humanity back to the pinnacle of life where we once existed. Morpheus believes he has found this person when he finds Neo. The rest of the story details the training of Neo, the discovery of a traitor in their ranks, and the eventual battle between Neo and the Agents of the computer. The special effects and the action sequences keep this movie going. Unfortunately nothing truly spectacular occurs in any of these sequences. I am not saying they were bad there have just been better sequences in many other movies. For the most part the actors do their best with the roles they have been given. Laurence Fishburn tackles the role of Morpheus and gives the performance we have come to expect from him. He is able to draw attention to himself at any time without saying a word and when he speaks his voice wraps itself around you and transports you away with its power. Carrie-Ann Moss plays Trinity. She is, in a word, BAD...and that's good. It has been a long time since we have seen quite as tough a woman in film. Ripley would be proud of her. Now we come to Neo. Keanu Reeves has done a good job as an action hero before. This time he is passable but that is all. Some scenes, like when he walks through the metal detector and unleashes an arsenal are great. Other scenes don't work as well. His acting ability has frequently been in question and this is one of those times. The first half of the movie his dazed expression is completely befitting of a character who is bombarded with the information he is receiving. Unfortunately that expression stays on him the rest of the movie. Remember my comments concerning the power of Fishburn's voice? Keanu is not blessed with the same gift. In fact at all times he sounds as if he is stoned beyond belief. Though the story is silly and meanders off on different tangents I am not saying I disliked this movie. I will say that it wasn't the be all and end all of Sci-Fi/Action movies. However it was relatively entertaining and I am not sorry I went.","10"

Fishburne is reduced to spouting Zen platitudes and comments about the Net as poorly-reasoned as Al Gore's recent gaffes. The film is basically an excuse for the special effects, and the best that can be said for Keanu Reeves is that he wasn't any worse than the character he played in ""Johnny Mnemonic"" (or is that ""Moronic""?)","7"
"ichabod81","Fresh. Good. But not perfect.","16 June 2004","The first time I saw The Matrix, it was in a theater. It was good. After that, countless times on pirate videos and on DVD. Still good. But it has never given me that mystical spark that would make it a five star picture. You know how you really like some movie, but it's just missing that something, that thing you can't define? That's how it is between this movie and me.

The Matrix is no doubt the most inventive movie to hit the screens in a long while and the dark visuals and themes common to the Wachowski brothers are really at home here. It's almost a crime to say what I'm about to say, but I have began to like the sequels even more. There, I have now disgraced myself.

At least in one way this original does beat the sequels, though. There is none of that melodramatic romance between Neo and Trinity that in my opinion was the greatest fall of Reloaded and Revolutions. Plus here the idea is still fresh. Check diz!

Beyond that still is the best cyberfilm to come out of the 90's. In fact I would go so far as to say that it's the best cyberfilm since Bladerunner. (which is a pre-mainstream cyber awareness film to begin with) and even though I like it, I can't with good conscience include J.Mnemonic as a good cyberfilm. The f/x, story line, and cinematography is fluid and beautiful. Laurence Fishburne is as always subtle and larger that life as Morpheus. Carrie-Anne Moss' Trinity kicks almost as much butt as Milla Jovovich's Leeloo but with the grace of a crane. Joe Pantoliano is wonderfully understated as our friendly, greasy Judas - Cypher.

"nexus-37","Superhero in a dream","22 May 2006","Please don't read this if you haven't seen matrix.

First I saw The Matrix in theater without any knowledge about the film nor my friends hadn't seen it.

I'm a coder with weird mathematic background since I was born but still I can be objective with things like this.

The Matrix script hadn't really any new ideas. The whole movie is very illogical and acting is really cliché way. Still my opinion of this movie is that it appears to be most original scifi movie of the 90's.

The thing was that whole movie was put together thinking everybody, first rule of making money. The ones who doesn't understand this ""geek"" thingy, they get real nice action and effects etc., drama lovers get their kind of love story, geeks get their ""whoa""s and real movie freaks get the whole picture. First time when I watched this movie I was like ""huh?"" when it ended. I sure thought it was just starting and looked at clock .. No other movie had never done this to me.

The battery idea is funny even if everyone says its stupid. Hey, some humor? Thats the mainstream crap ;) Then those pathetic ""I KNEW IT, HE IS THE ONE!"" etc. boring crap, well, there are very very young kids watching that film and there is a hero, so i don't really think it was so annoying. People who saw this in year 2000 or later they probably think ""what.. i've seen this, basic crap again"". I think that makers of this movie were aware of that at the time, they just wanted to make their thing and knew it would be copied later in other movies. Thats probably why Matrix 2 & 3 were so .. well, so different. If I understood correctly they had them written long ago before starting, they might have had to blow up some scenes to get any attention.

I think Matrix is the Star Wars of 90's. Don't you think Star Wars ideas were copied in many movies after that? ..and I didn't really like those prequels, third was ""okay"". Good bless Jar Jar ;)","7"
"echozdog","Ground breaking on multiple levels","3 July 2003","I saw the Matrix without seeing any trailers nor ideas about what the movie was about. This probably helped make this a top 20 movie all time for me. The special effects are great, but special effects are only great when they augment a great plot (see Star Wars I & II for examples of how $ spent on SE and none on the script make for a lot of eye candy and a crap movie). The acting in this movie is great even though Reeves doesn't have to do much but look confused (I guess it no much of a stretch). Any movie that gives explanation to things we often think about (e.g. Deja vu etc) I love. That there is a hidden works going on behind the scenes makes for great entertainment. IMHO.

Too bad next movie only has the Special effects and no new guts.","10"
"paul-nemecek","Take the Red Pill!","6 July 2018","Really good films often work on multiple levels. The best art is art that is profound enough to make us think, yet abstract enough to allow for multiple interpretations. The Wachowski brothers' film The Matrix does that and more.

Keanu Reeves plays a computer whiz named Neo. When Neo starts getting messages from his computer, his life is turned upside down. A woman named Trinity contacts him because the great cyber-rebel Morpheus (Laurence Fisburne) is looking for him. When Morpheus and Neo finally meet, Morpheus explains that reality as we know it is a cyber-illusion. The ""machine"" has taken over the world and is literally feeding on human energy, while the humans are oblivious having been placated by their virtueless virtual reality.

One approach to this film is to see it as an excellent example of postmodern art and as an analyis of postmodern society. Our first clue to this interpretation is the book Neo hides things in-entitled Simulacra and Simulation. The concept of simulacra refers to the blurring of the line between reality and fiction-a copy for which there is no original. If we see The Matrix through this lens, the film becomes an interesting parable about modern society. This blurring of the line is a common theme these days (EDTV, Celebrity, Mad City, The Truman Show, Wag the Dog), and this film is an engaging addition to a growing body of work. Invite your favorite philosophy professor or social theorist and you can spend a few hours afterwards discussing phenomenology and the social construction of reality.

At another level, we can approach The Matrix by analyzing ""the machine."" If you just got back from a weekend of training with the Michigan Militia, the machine can be seen as intrusive government that is manipulating the media to blind us to reality. For those of us who lean a bit left of center, the machine can be seen as the capitalist world system that exploits the poor, and ravages the impoverished nations of the earth, but keeps us plugged in by fantasies of the good life.

For the less political, there are a number of religious and spiritual themes sprinkled throughout the movie. Morpheus and Neo end up looking a bit like John the Baptist and a Messiah figure respectively-including the proclamations by Morpheus that Neo is ""the one"" (which is an anagram of Neo). In other scenes, Morpheus comes across like a New Age Zen master, or Yoda with an attitude.

If all this work at multiple meanings makes your head hurt, the final alternative is to approach the film as a well-written action/adventure science-fiction film. There are some outstanding special effects and some interesting action scenes. In the end, it is the complexity of the multidimensional story that makes this movie work. A definite thumbs up for one of the more interesting stories so far this year.","10"
"dheise","Don't believe the hype, The Matrix is horrible.","7 November 1999","Whoah! That was a really awful excuse for a movie. Horrible acting and a horrible script is what you get with this one, but I expected these things to be bad. What I didn't expect was that the SFX were horrible too. I can't believe people think that they are good. Good special effects make you forget that you are seeing special effects, and you can believe that they are real. In The Matrix, you never forget. They are way overdone and end up looking very childish, and we've seen these cheezy effects done a million times in commercials even though people may not realize it.

All I've heard about this movie is how the effects are amazing, but I say if that is what you are looking for watch The Phantom Menace or The Mummy. If you want to see a good virtual reality movie watch eXistenZ or even The Thirteenth Floor was better than The Matrix.","10"
"mhalvorson","Blew me away","24 May 2002","The best thing I could say about this film is that in the theater when it was over my wife and I just looked at each other, grinned and started talking at a million miles an hour. Not many movies can give you that completely blown away feeling.","9"
"Rhino Rover","Thought provoking","20 February 2000","I have to be honest and say that when this movie came out in the theatres, I had absolutely no interest in seeing it. And a big part of it was because of Keanu Reeves. But I kept hearing how wonderful this movie was and this was at about the same time when Star Wars: The Phantom Menace came out. Now mind you, Star Wars wasn't that great either but the hype surrounding that movie promised, at the very least, an entertaining time. I recently had a conversation about movies with my sister and her boyfriend and when they found out I still hadn't seen this movie, I was soundly chastised for it and was subsequently ""summoned"" to come over to their place to view it on DVD. And you know what? I'm glad they did.

The story takes place in the future where technology has taken over the world. In fact, Earth as you know it has been transformed into a technological play ground where reality and fantasy are so intertwined that it is almost impossible to tell where one ends and the other begins. We meet Neo (Keanu Reeves) at the beginning and find out quickly that this quiet young man is actually a brilliant computer hacker. He is quickly recruited by a band of secrete underground rebels who hope to free the world from the clutches of technology. It seems that computers in the future have become self-aware and have taken over the world by enslaving humans and these rebels lead by Morpheous (Laurence Fishburne) are hoping that Neo is the ""Chosen-One"" to free them from this slavery.

I have to say that the special effects are wonderful. I've seen quite a few special effects intensive movies this year and The Matrix comes out very near the top. The only other one that I thought was better is Star Wars but that was to be expected when 95% of it was computer generated and George Lucas is backing it. The Matrix comes very close and in fact in some places out performs Star Wars in the creativity department.

I mentioned earlier that I stayed away from this movie because of Keanu Reeves and I'm sure many of you will agree that he is not in the same echelon as Tom Cruise or Kevin Spacey but I was pleasantly surprised here. He did do a fairly good job as Neo but part of it was the fact that he did do his own stunts and brought a sense of believability to his character. What made this movie even better was the rest of the cast, especially Laurence Fishburne. He had a lot of thought provoking dialogue in this movie and his portrayal of the rebel leader and mentor to Neo was well depicted...although it did seem somewhat similar to Yoda and Luke Skywalker. The one actor that I really did enjoy was Joe Pantoliano as Cypher. He played the laid back, yet somewhat cynical rebel very well and when he turns on his comrades his performance becomes even more enjoyable.

If you choose to see this movie, keep in mind that this movie is primarily about ideas. Focusing on plot flow will only ruin the movie's intentions. I have seen other reviews where people commented on the laws of physics or other such scientific evaluations and to be honest, this is only a movie. Its intention is to portray some idea(s), not to educated the public about energy transfer or the laws of relativity. This movie makes quite a statement about what reality is and how we perceive it so if any of you are looking to see a thought provoking movie with some pretty impressive special effects, go see this movie.

"campblood13","A good mix of action and emotion","29 September 2003","Of course the action scenes are top notch and really get you going, but the key to this film is the emotions we feel for the characters. The film takes time to develop the characters and their relationships. For such a complex story they take the time to tell us every detail of what is going on.

The Matrix also has a great last 45 minutes of action which is similar but better than hackers. the acting was great because each member of the cast really cared about this movie, you could tell. They cared so much that the movie took almost a year to make. I recommend this film to everyone and if you can see it in the cinema it will be worthwhile.","9"
"Clive-Silas","Go see it, but *not* the best sci-fi film ever.","2 January 2001","A lot of people have rated it as the best movie they've ever seen. I ask all those people to start thinking of other great movies of the past, even if you restrict yourself to science fiction movies - think of the characters you fell in love with, and the performers who brought it all to life - then try to imagine some of those actors, those characters appearing in equivalent parts in The Matrix. Think of Harrison Ford's Rick Deckard (from Blade Runner) as either Neo or Morpheous. Think of Sigourney Weaver's Ellen Ripley (from the Alien series). Think of the witty dialogue and excellent character interaction of writers Joss Whedon or JJ Abrams. You can think up your own examples. Then compare it to what we've actually got in The Matrix. It just doesn't stand up.

Storyline: You can see that at the script stage, the concept works very well as being a marvellous ""coup de cinema"", when Neo wakes up and the ""real world"" is revealed for the first time. But the advance publicity told you all that before you even got to see the movie. I don't believe in picking holes in plot points, unless they rely too heavily on coincidence - it's not an easy thing to build a foolproof scenario to achieve the high concept you have for the movie. But I will say that generally in any movie you are supposed to be on the side of the good guys. In this situation, however, all I could see was that Morpheous and his friends were determined to wake the whole world up to the fact that they are living in an enormous dank sewer, under a gunmetal sky, with apparently no other living creatures or vegetation on which to survive. Or they could stay in The Matrix (what we call ""real life"") and remain ""slaves"". I was with Cypher's (Joe Pantoliano) side all the way - better fake steak that's better than the real thing, than physically real but otherwise totally unappetising food which resembled some kind of edible snot.

Regarding the action, I have two points to make: a) If I see one more helicopter flying alongside a glass skyscraper, so help me.... b) There is such a thing as ""too good"". I originally wrote how pathetic it was that high speed fight scenes were so obviously speed ed up film. I now know that in fact the film wasn't speed ed up, but Reeves and Fishburne were moving so fast that it looked like it was. A little slower and they'd have had ten times the impact.

Here was a film where the dialogue could have done with some serious polishing by a script-doctor. Imagine, if you will, if Sean Connery had been cast as Morpheous - can you see him saying the bland dull-as-ditchwater stuff that Fishburne was trying to make so much of? No of course not, and Connery would have made sure of it by calling in his favourite script doctors (like he did for 'The Rock'). Why didn't the studio step in? Did they make a mistake and think they had the Coen brothers instead of the Wachowski brothers? There was no characterisation whatsoever - we didn't know anything more about Morpheous, Trinity or Neo at the end than we knew at the beginning. About the only fully rounded character was Cypher (which was why he got all my sympathy). Trinity's interactions with Neo, in particularly, needed to be ten times better to achieve anything like the meaning and emotional fulfilment for the audience that that relationship merited.

The remainder of the cast did their best with poor material. Keanu Reeves did what he always does. I don't know what it is, but it isn't acting. Reeves is a star because he infallibly picks smash-hits to be in (Speed, The Devil's Advocate, The Matrix), so they keep sending him scripts. But I cannot think of a single Keanu Reeves star-vehicle which wouldn't have been better with anybody else who just had some presence and charisma.

I'd like to deal with the deficient morality of the film. It's very easy to say ""It's an action movie, so lots of bad guys will need to be killed"", but 'Terminator 2' for example, is a very violent action film which has a moral sense. In 'The Matrix' not one of the bad guys are killed (they are only software constructs, after all), but lots and lots of innocent policemen and security guards are just wiped out, and, what is more, by the supposed good guys! Morpheous tries to explain this away by telling Neo to regard every human as an enemy, but this doesn't expiate the wholesale bloodbath which occurs when Neo and Trinity are just trying to get into a building. Why wasn't that sequence put together as a Kung Fu spectacular, with all the human opponents merely stunned? The last shot of that scene shows just the elevator as the doors shut on Neo and Trinity, and broken bricks and plaster and all the devastation which has just been wreaked - there is not a single dead body in the shot. This sanitised view of what constituted a totally unjustified massacre on the part of our heroes failed to make me feel better about what they had just done.

I think it's easy to get carried away when a big-budget movie has an interesting and (relatively) original premise, and the visual effects do a good job of showing it off - but these factors do not make a truly satisfying film.","9"

I began to appreciate the actual story, something i missed first time around. The plot is as deep and surreal as you can get, and the action is really just the icing on the cake. Few and far between, the fight scenes, gun play scenes, are all fantastic. Edited sharply, and being inventive with the visuals,using slo-mo, then speeding up the frame. and it works wonders. The actors look cool enough, and there is plenty of room left to boost their characters, which it will hopefully do in the following two movies.

One of the most visually appealing films to have graced the silver screen. A truly original and unique film going experience with mind bending action, the Wachowskis bring the first of their mind bending trilogy to the screen. Philosophical at its very core that leads one to believe that this ground breaking film is more than just a simple action film. Highly original in its story and well acted by its principal players is a must see for any fan of film. One of those films that must not only be viewed but experience by the viewer. Reeves and Fishburne fit into their roles respectively and do a masterful job of bringing the heroism, suspense and intrigue to the forefront. Reeves who isn't known for his stellar performances, really outdoes himself and what may go down as his most iconic and famous role of his career. The film is a mind bending ride that deliverers in its attempt to not only sweep away the viewers but truly invests the viewer in not only the story and characters but in the alter techno fantastic world of The Matrix.","7"
"GailTaplin-98447","Not normally my kinda film but I love Keanu ;-)","14 April 2020","Very late to the game on this one, but I enjoyed it very much. Loved the setting, tricks, special effects and characters. Futuristic of course, interesting story-line and love the styling. Being a Keanu Reeves fan, I have liked all his films that I have seen to date. Not a genre I would normally follow but I would definitely recommend this film.","8"
"ChoiBaby","A futuristic thriller with a unique plot, excellent special effects and a profound theme.","4 April 1999","The ""living"" world has come to an end. Mankind's own technological advances have turned against them. Now, computers are the primary inhabitants of Planet Earth... The humans have been turned into slaves by this master race of super-intelligent beings controlled by the CPU known as ""The Matrix."" This devastated world appears to be a nightmare...but it is only too real...

Neo (Keanu Reeves) is a computer hacker, unknowingly living in a virtual reality world created by The Matrix in order to keep him in check. The Matrix fabricates synthetic worlds for many people in order to suppress any potential insurgence. However, an underground resistance group led by Morpheus (Laurence Fishburne) and his officer, Trinity (Carrie-Anne Moss, looking lovely in that black leather outfit) must pull Neo out from his fantasies...and force him to face the grim reality as it is...

A Prophecy has been spoken. The Oracle, a spiritual guide for the remnants of the human race has professed Neo to be that special person, the ""Chosen One."" However, is Neo indeed the ""Chosen One?"" If he is, can he exhibit the valor and courage that the Oracle has supposedly prophesized for this specific soul?

In a world ruled by computers and machines, these people are our last hope. The heroes must valiantly fight the main CPU inside the VR system...or die trying... With the abilities to dodge flying bullets and to increase their own upper body strengths, the human players do have the upper hand... However, can Neo, Morpheus and Trinity lead the human race into victory, or will the machines forever rule the planet?

THE MATRIX is a neat, thinking man's science-fiction thriller. The ambitious production design is demonstrated with some spectacular action scenes laced with great special FX. This virtual reality world with provocative imagery will enrapture the human soul as he/she will experience a journey unlike any peregrination in the real world. This film is visually appetizing...with lavish, computer generated special effects. The high-tech setting will expand your imagination to new horizons. As well, the ambiguous, though-provoking story will keep your minds thinking constantly as you try to solve the stratagem behind this brain twister of a concept...

Masterful stunt-work, especially the martial arts choreography by Yuen Wo Ping and endless firepower is integrated with astonishing, maniacal FX. The much anticipated comic book violence is enhanced by plenty of digital effects. In this way, characters can perform virtually endless tricks from the book including acrobatic movements and flying jump kicks to gravity-defying combat battles. Much of the special effects are epitomized in the shape of those ""Sentinels,"" bizarre spider androids with unfathomable powers. The scenes transitioning VR to reality and vice versa are astounding also.

A few shortcomings in THE MATRIX cannot be ignored such as a complicated plot with loose ends and some occasional slowdown in the film's pace. The plot in THE MATRIX is indeed convoluted, but this film will probably require several viewing before you can truly grasp the heart of the matter. Also, some sections of this movie are a bit hamstrung, but the rapid-fire action compensates for most of the plodding segments.

Is this film overly meretricious? Maybe. Appeasing to the naked eye? Definitely! Will you have fun watching this movie? You bet. Although THE MATRIX is sometimes uneven, garish and twisted, this motion picture is groundbreaking work from the brotherly duo, directors Andy and Larry Wachowski. If you have enough of an attention span to endure the film's slow-moving sequences, than prepare to be warped into an artificially created world where rules are not bound, laws are meaningless, and nothing is what it seems... Aficionados who are devoted to ""cyber-punk"" thrillers should not miss this one!

RATING: *** out of ****.","8"
"se_vaan","Overrated TRASH!","22 January 2004","The Matrix is perhaps the most overrated movie i have ever seen, it doesnt offer anything but... Overwrited or other manner bad and comic dialog. Amusing armchair amateur philosophy that makes me laugh! Boring, overcool, unintentional-comic and baffled looking kung fu fights and shooting scenes with stupid looking slowmotions. Also a lot of clichés and scenes that are copied from other movies. I give The Matrix 1/10 and it deserves its 100%. Dont ever watch this movie, its waste of time and maybe waste of money if you rent it or go to cinema to see it!","10"

This is a movie for teenagers and people who like teenagers and people who want to be teenagers. Check the message board: it's teenagers arguing about the worth of this movie, from a pool where both ends are shallow.

I wish Keanu Reeves and L. Fishburne all the good fortune in the world, but acting at this level will wash them up before they're fifty.

This movie is all special effects and razzle-dazzle. There's just nothing to it. Of course, it's listed very high on this site's list of great movies, because there are so many young kids here voting on movies.

My indictment of this movie and its sequels is similar to my indictment of this web site - it was a good idea; it's still a good idea; but it just doesn't deliver. It's certainly not the fault of this site that most of the people writing are too young to be on their own in the world, but I hate that IMDb panders to them, much the same way that I hate how these movies pander to them.

Yes, they're the ones who go to the movies more than anyone else. It's just a plain fact.

"bobbyelliott","An original movie... for science fiction fans","12 June 1999","The Matrix is a science fiction movie that will mainly be enjoyed by fans of the genre. But if you like serious SF then you'll love The Matrix. The film has two main strands - there's the main storyline which is quite intricate and complex and then there's the action movie-within-a-movie. The plot is intelligent and mostly plausible but quite dense so you have to listen carefully. The action sequences are surprisingly good thanks to superb special effects. Don't be put off by the Kung-Fu comments. Yes, it does have this type of fighting but it's sensible in its context and the effects are *outstanding*. So an intelligent, thought-provoking, thrilling movie - but don't expect your granma' to like it - or your girlfriend unless she's into sci-fi or kung-fu. But for those who are then this is a top movie. I gave it 8/10.","9"
"liano123","The Matrix (1999)","23 May 2014","he Matrix is a 1999 American science fiction action film written and directed by The Wachowski Brothers, starring Keanu Reeves, Laurence Fishburne, Carrie-Anne Moss, Hugo Weaving, and Joe Pantoliano. It depicts a dystopian future in which reality as perceived by most humans is actually a simulated reality called ""the Matrix"", created by sentient machines to subdue the human population, while their bodies' heat and electrical activity are used as an energy source. Computer programmer ""Neo"" learns this truth and is drawn into a rebellion against the machines, which involves other people who have been freed from the ""dream world"".

The Matrix is known for popularizing a visual effect known as ""bullet time"", in which the heightened perception of certain characters is represented by allowing the action within a shot to progress in slow- motion while the camera's viewpoint appears to move through the scene at normal speed. The film is an example of the cyberpunk science fiction genre.[4] It contains numerous references to philosophical and religious ideas, and prominently pays homage to works such as Plato's Allegory of the Cave,[5] Jean Baudrillard's Simulacra and Simulation[6] and Lewis Carroll's Alice's Adventures in Wonderland.[7] The Wachowskis' approach to action scenes drew upon their admiration for Japanese animation[8] and martial arts films, and the film's use of fight choreographers and wire fu techniques from Hong Kong action cinema was influential upon subsequent Hollywood action film productions.

The Matrix was first released in the United States on March 31, 1999, and grossed over $460 million worldwide. It was generally well-received by critics,[9][10] and won four Academy Awards as well as other accolades including BAFTA Awards and Saturn Awards. Reviewers praised The Matrix for its innovative visual effects, cinematography and its entertainment. The film's premise was both criticized for being derivative of earlier science fiction works, and praised for being intriguing. The action also polarized critics, some describing it as impressive, but others dismissing it as a trite distraction from an interesting premise.

Despite this, the film has since appeared in lists of the greatest science fiction films,[11][12][13] and in 2012, was added to the National Film Registry for preservation.[14] The success of the film led to the release of two feature film sequels, both written and directed by the Wachowski Brothers, The Matrix Reloaded and The Matrix Revolutions. The Matrix franchise was further expanded through the production of comic books, video games, and animated short films in which the Wachowskis were heavily involved","10"
"critic-22","The Christian theme is...............","30 March 2000","The Matrix

DIRECTION `% Once the special effects are rolling you might (will) start wondering how they make the camera bend time and slow it down to see all the action.

ACTING % The main good characters show good performances. However it's the satanic like agents that pull in most of the atmosphere!

EDITING/SPECIAL EFFECTS % This movie was designed with editing in mind and work and plays like a dream computer game.

PLOT '% Computers take over the world and uses humans as batteries. However this is only the cover-up as the movie has got tons of Christian themes throughout (and perhaps other idealogies). You are the one, who was forseen in prophecy.... but where is the Judas character lurking?

STRONG WORDS AND VIOLENCE ETC 79% Much action and sparkling violence with few swear words (if any)..

MUSIC % Lots of rock tunes to move the action along. Not what you call classical music. I was wondering if these tunes have hidden messages within them!

SOUND -% Loud explosions and other big sounds.

HOOKABILITY % Can't wait to see or hear what happens next.

LASTABILITY `% You want to know how it will end and if there will be a sequel.

OVERALL '% The Christian theme is a nice touch. But the movie draws attention to the role technology is having upon society in terms of our working and leisure time. If you are reading this then you are on the internet, do you really trust the internet? Is someone watching you? Are humans becoming like commodities in a technology based society to be used by the higher unethical human good? Are you willing to fight the evil or stand back and enjoy your comforts in life, while you are being manipulated by satanic agents who want to keep the status quo? For me and many people this is a BIG concern upon how technology is being used to manipulate people, and this theme continues with advance uses of genetic engineering. This is not neccessarily a better movie than ones with lower ratings, but needs these ratings so people can get informed quickly before it's too late!","7"
"critic-22","One of the greatest movies of all time and WHY!","30 June 1999","When I went to watch The Matrix I thought the special effects were going to be the selling point in the movie... gladly I was wrong. I found out to my surprise that the story and the psychological emotional elements of the story were profound and so thought provoking. The Story (psychologically) you need to think!

1) The actual idea and conception of the Matrix is really frightening to the extent that we begin to see that humans who create technology then are enslaved by it(much better than Terminator 2 in storyline). This reminds me of our present situation where computers and genetic engineering is slowly changing how we live in 1999. Science is slowly making us slaves and we are doing nothing about it, we don't even care or notice it but accept it as progress. This movie is an early or late warning signal - will anyone take notice?!

2) This movie is about the bible and how Christ saves us from the demons (the men in black with sunglasses). We see birth and incarnation, prophecies of the coming messiah and the search for this messiah. We see sacrificial love and ultimate betrayal (Judas) and people in sin but do not realize it. The fact that many people miss this plot twist in the movie makes me feel very very sad and proves that people are deluded and have not got a working or spiritual knowledge of the bible and what Christ did for humanity. The bringing down of the divine to the enslaved earth. If these points do not create any form of emotions I feel sorry for humanity in general.

Rating 10/10

The Mummy and The Matrix. I saw The Mummy first. It was good but didn't please me as much as The Matrix did. I got out of The Mummy later than I thought I would and missed about 25 minutes of The Matrix. I don't think it mattered. I loved all I saw. It was such a wild and loud ride, at one point, I thought I WAS living the movie. The effects were very good. The best I've seen. The plot was a little confusing but still it's just the best ride to take. The parts that really look cool are the training parts. The martial-arts moves were astonishing. I want to go see it again but not because I missed the beginning. I loved the parts movie that I saw so much. If you want to just be lost for 2 hours 15 minutes than take this ride. If you don't then take this ride. This is a movie that everyone will love. What about Keanu Reeves? He CAN act. I thought he did a really great job in this movie. I don't know if Star Wars-Episode One: The Phantom Menace can be as good as this movie. We'll have to wait and find out.","1"

"dexter-3","Quite a ride...","25 October 1999","""The Matrix"" is an absolute thrill-a-minute ride with a twist: there's a plot and some depth behind the superb special effects. The film is highly entertaining, provocative, is generally well-acted (Reeves does a great job UNDERPLAYING his role here), and it boasts a terrific villain in ""Mr. Smith,"" whose monotone barely disguises his loathing for humans. The producer of ""The Phantom Menace"" should take note of the use and quality of the fx here, and perhaps get a clue for his next film. In particular, the martial arts scene with Fishburne and Keanu is not new, but is sharp and nicely integrated into the plot.

My main issues with the film (as also noted by Roger Ebert) are that it has a partially derivative screenplay (see ""Dark City,"" the writings of Philip Farmer and Harlan Ellison, and certain stock action films), and that the climax, while exciting, is predictable and well-worn, and implies that the screenwriters and story editors simply ran out of ideas. This leaves the viewer unsatisfied with the traditional ""good guy v. bad guy"" fight that leaves the intellectual issues raised earlier unresolved. That said, ""The Matrix"" is great entertainment and a definite ""big screen"" film. An ""8.""","10"
"FilmCreature","FilmCreature reviews 'The Matrix'","6 February 2008","Keanu Reeves, who has been dubbed as one of the worst actors of our time, is actually extremely well-cast in 'The Matrix', one of 1999's most enjoyable and imaginative thrillers. He plays Thomas Anderson, a young man who lives his life in computers under the hacker pseudonym Neo. He feels an emptiness inside of him, a cold darkness that he cannot explain but he is determined to find out its source. His journey begins when he is contacted by the voluptuous hacker Trinity (yes, *the* Trinity who cracked the IRS d-base). He presents her with a question.

""What is the Matrix?""

As it turns out, The Matrix is the very world we live in, which essentially lives up to be one big computer program whose purpose is to serve a rogue A.I. that harvests our corpses for fuel. Fun, fun, fun. Carrie-Anne Moss, one of my favorite, down-to-earth actresses, is terrific as the sexy human agent Trinity. She seems like someone you would fear but then run to for protection a second later. Reeves is a great hero as Neo. Laurence Fishburne took his performance from this better-than-average sci-fi and directly copied to into a smarter, better movie, titled 'Akeelah and the Bee'. He plays Morpheus, who is essentially Neo's Obi-Wan; a wise, methodical, prophet who happens to tote huge guns and the strength to break handcuffs (and bones).

The fight sequences are glorious fun, the film is rarely predictable, and the performances are tuned just right. Even though it gets weighed down with clichés near the end, 'The Matrix' is well worth seeing (it visually LOOKS fantastic), or even owning a copy.

I also liked the speech by Smith where he equates humanity to viruses. Acting, action, and pacing were great. The famous scene with all the guns where he invades the building was epic and crazy.

The whole machines take over the word thing has been done before (The Terminator), but not in such fashion. The ""Matrix"" is a great push which I found very creative. The acting is top notch in my opinion, not once did I not feel someone giving it their all. Great detail and Agent Smith makes one very good villain. The fight scenes were pulled off with a fashion.

Great story, great characters/actors, great editing, great dialouges, great direction (by the Wachowski Brothers), great action scenes (gunfights, kung-fu kicks, chases, etc.), and most of all, spectacular special effects. I don't know what else to say about ""The Matrix"" because I'm speechless. The wierdest about the movie was that this is the Wachowski's second film they directed (after ""Bound""). But, they did an excellent job. This is one of the best films of 1999, one of the best films ever, and one of my all-time favorite films. Will there more sequels? Yes. In 2003, two ""Matrix"" sequels- ""The Matrix Reloaded"" and ""The Matrix Revolutions"" will be out in the same year, but, in different months. If you wanna see the trailers, you can either go see ""Star Wars Episode II: Attack of the Clones"" or you can log onto www.TheMatrix.com and check out the trailers.

Characters are charismatic and i think that Keanu Reeves plays to perfection the role of Neo and Laurence Fishburn is the best person to play Mortpheus The scene when Neo woke up in the real world for the first time made me really confused.

My friends this is the Matrix. I never got into the Matrix except for the anime and video games and that's what this movie basically is.

STORY Mr. Anderson is a normal pencil pusher who works a 9 to 5 job until one day he gets an EMAIL and realizes things are not the way they are. Mr. Anderson gets accosted by agents but then gets saved by women and men in black coats. He is told to take the Red Pill which shows him the truth of the world. Blue pill just goes back to normal. When Mr. Anderson takes the Red Pill he sees the terrifying TRUTH! He has been keeping machines alive that have taken over Earth since Birth! It's a terrifying dystopian apocalyptical world where people live in red vats of Abiotic fluid and learns that he is Neo. Now Neo must joint a group of religious rebels who see the truth and must stop the Machines in the Matrix. It goes on from there against the evil robot overlord that has been keeping us sedated for far too long.

CHARACTER The characters are the weakest part of the Matrix. They are far too stoic and Keanu Reaves barely emotes as well as Laurence Fishbourne.

Neo is also too powerful. Once he learns Kung Fu it's like ""I know Kung fu"" Yeah well maybe you should have practiced Kung fu. Oh no just program it in my neck. I can control reality!

Mr. Smith is truly evil but doesn't contrast much from Neo in his personality.

SPECIAL EFFECTS There are so many crazy special effects in this movie. You will see clones and bullet time slow-mo effects that goes too overused. You will see terrifying scenes such as Neo's mouth disappearing and tiny robot spiders falling out of his mouth. So much body horror for such a sci fi flick. This was all in 1999 and doesn't look half bad today. Lot's of good practical effects to like how the space ship uses real life sets.

MUSIC I keep hearing this song that is meant to be le epic sweeping horns score but it's nothing but repetitive. I guess it's alright.

"StarCastle99","An Incredible Film Whose Influence Is Changing the Industry","2 June 2002","Certain films define their times and set a standard for look, drama, and special effects. These films seem to come along every decade or so. 50's - Forbidden Planet 60's - 2001: A Space Odyssey 70's - Star Wars 80's - Terminator II 90's - The Matrix. Each of these films became possible by some technological breakthrough. For example, without the motion control camera, Star Wars wouldn't have been made. Without advances in CGI software and rendering speed - no Terminator II. In the case of The Matrix, it owes a lot of its style to electronic non-linear editing, which allows the picture to go from slow motion to fast motion (undercrank for the old timers) with the click of a mouse. In case you haven't noticed television editing tries to copy the Matrix - just look at CSI. When the Warshawski Brothers made the film it took a computer and 121 cameras to create the whirl-around effect. Now three years later it can be done with one camera and some Vi(Z)rt software.

Let's put aside technology and look at the film. It's plot is a bit convoluted but certainly accessible. The sub-plot which follows the transformation of Neo is there for all to see. The sub-text, which few people ever get from a film is also up-front. Our reliance on computers has become total. Put enough high speed computers into a grid system and you have a world as imagined in Collosus: The Forbin Project. The idea of automata taking over really goes back to the imagination of Czech writer, Karol Capek and his play ""R.U.R."" Capek invented the word Robot, from the Czech verb ""robotus"" meaning to serve.

Matrix put a fresh spin on reality that puts a question mark on the end of Descartes dictum, ""I think therefore I am"". The concept was superbly realized. If the acting wasn't world class level, the picture made you think. Not many films do. Personally, I can't wait to see the sequels. Incidentally, this film's opening is on a par with ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"". It hooks you in the first five minutes. Something aspiring screenwriters should consider.

The plot is really well thought out, which is often the problem with the other strictly F/X films - that thought didn't go into them! This has some really great acting, great and memorable lines (especially from Keanu), slick and sexy fashion, UNBELIEVABLY great F/X, and a real story!

The actors are great, and Laurence's gap tooth defined his character for me, and the action scenes are the best in ages.

It just would have been better if the Wachowski brothers got some one else to write the script off of their ideas.

But enough of the script. This movie is far from bad. It's great fun in a group, you'll be on the edge of your seat, you'll have a blast.

And it was a little too long, too. Oh well, maybe I just can't enjoy a long movie no matter how good it is. But you'll enjoy this modern epic of suspense and action!","9"
"Hellrazr360","The Greatest Sci-Fi Masterpiece Since Star Wars","31 January 2006","The Matrix stands among the greatest sci-fi movies to have ever surfaced in years. Like Star Wars before it, The Matrix has awed movie audiences with its great special effects, different view on the world and its deeply intriguing plot. Not once does The Matrix cease to amaze its viewer with what it has to tell, and it has quite a story to tell us indeed.

The story of The Matrix is that in the near future, Neo, a computer hacker, is found by a group of people to discover the roots of the Matrix. What Neo quickly learns from this group of people led by Morpheus is that the world he lives in is not what it appears to be. This world he feels so safe in is merely an illusion created by the Matrix where the way we live is used to fuel the Matrix and the cyber beings that created it. Neo is brought into the picture because Morpheus believes Neo to be the One, a single person who's destined to save humanity from the prison of the Matrix. The plot is deep and isn't very easy to understand at first but this is what makes The Matrix such an interesting watch.

What makes The Matrix different from other sci-fi movies is that it doesn't focus so much on special effects and mind-blowing special effects. Instead, most of the running time of the movie is used to tell the plot to the audience and let them understand how the Matrix works as if they were Neo. Yes, Neo might be a computer hacker at first but once he learns of the Matrix it's like all his knowledge of computers barely even matters. With that, the viewer almost never feels like they aren't getting anything in the movie that Neo isn't.

The cast of actors/actresses in The Matrix is a pretty strong selection. Keanu Reeves plays the role of Neo, Laurence Fishburne plays Morpheus and Carrie-Ann Moss plays Trinity, a feisty woman who later becomes Neo's lover. Keanu Reeves does a good job of portraying Neo as a computer hacker and as the One. Fishburne also delivers a more than worthy performance as the persistent Morpheus. Carrie-Ann Moss gives the audience nothing less than the impression that she has feelings for Neo from the beginning and she keeps that feeling along with her more get-to-the-point attitude together very nicely. Then there's Hugo Weaving, who plays the bad guy of the show, Agent Smith. Weaving does a great job of giving Agent Smith a smirky but somewhat charming personality that makes the viewer not help but love him for it.

The action scenes that The Matrix does give the audience are fun to watch and definitely worth seeing. But don't expect much action in The Matrix, as it only makes up about thirty to forty minutes of the movie. Hey, at least you get to see some sick CGI at the end of the movie, not to mention the world-famous signature lean by Keanu Reeves that got The Matrix for its nickname. Not only is the action scenes in The Matrix awesome, but they also present some funny humor to help them be more enjoyable. The battles in The Matrix may not be Star Wars huge, but with such a great presentation in the movie otherwise it doesn't matter.

The Matrix ends very smoothly and by the time it does the viewer feels much more than just satisfied with their buy or rent of the movie. Without a doubt, if you're a sci-fi goer you just have to have this movie in your movie collection. If you are and you don't have this movie along with the other Matrix movies then why are you even reading my review to start with, go out and buy it now!","7"
"Stephen-12","Visual feast without much substance","6 July 1999","Felt a bit disappointed with this one. Bags of eye candy, certainly, but all the best bits were shoved into the trailer, so there weren't any big surprises. The moving freeze frames were quite nicely done, but I found the martial arts sequences quickly became boring.

Whether the pretentious symbolism works or not doesn't really matter (Christ, Alice in Wonderland, etc. - hey, original, guys!), but given the amount of money spent on this film, couldn't they have come up with a better script? This screenplay is Cameron-awful. The best moment is the in-joke when Keanu does his 'woah!' Brought the house down when I watched it.

The acting is pretty variable, too. We don't expect much from Keanu at the best of times, but to see an actor of Hugo Weaving's talent reduced to a snarling, stereotyped villain is saddening (and why does he talk so slowly - was he having trouble with the accent?). I suppose the Reservoir Dogs uniforms are quite fun.

Easily the best bit is the sequence with the Oracle. Beautifully underplayed. If only the rest of the film had been this subtle. Admittedly, the break-in at the top security building has an energy and style which is impressive. And I will confess that charging down a corridor with two guns blazing in your fists, while wearing a dark coat and sunglasses, is pretty cool.

(Those sunglasses were everywhere, weren't they? Even in dark rooms. Do these characters have a sight problem? Is that another piece of symbolism? Do I care enough?)

I give it 7 out of 10, for the visuals, and for evidence of some intelligence at work. But, boys, when you come to do the sequel, do think a bit more about the dialogue, and stop pretending you're George Lucas, because he's not exactly the world's greatest screenwriter.","1"
"Darth_Stat","Well worth seeing but not original.","10 April 2001","The story of this thing is more a rip off of Virtuosity, Star Wars, Hideaway and every other ""chosen one"" flick. The dialogue is pretty corny as well, ""he is the one"", the acting is fine for what the actors are given, Morpheas is laughable with all his oooh aaah knowledge and the way he comes up with extremely complicated answers to simple questions, how complicated is the matrix concept, all of humanity is plugged in to a giant computer that pulls a digital world over our eyes to use us as batteries, let me know when it gets complicated.

Reeves does not do a bad job at all, he suits the role and he is never unbelievable in the digital world he has to act against, and nobody save Schwarzeneggar can wear sunnies and leather like he does. At the theatre this would have been one of the greatest experiences, I saw alot of movies at the theatre in 99 but this was not one of them unfortunately. Overall this really is not a bad movie for entertainment, it is very definitely a teen flick formula but it can work for other people as well. The effects dont really seem to dominate the movie, there is only 5 or 6 points where they are used to the max, and there is only 3 or 4 where that multicamera trick is used, the effects basically just help you to believe that there are two worlds.

Getting plugged into a computer that makes you believe it is reality and having to rescue someone inside that and the possibility that being killed in the computer can kill you in reality are all Virtuosity, as for a messiah taking a young and unsuspecting boy off to train for the time when he must save the galaxy from a dominating empire I dont think I need to say where that formula has come before. You really aren't quite so analytical when your watching it.

In short, the effects, the characters and acting and the story are all pretty good, and this a movie to note, it is not run of the mill, its also watchable more than once. Overall its worth seeing at least once so do yourself a favour.","8"
"t-81966-84968","a brief evaluation","25 March 2020","This story was written in the true history of mankind, the standpoint of natural science, when the earth's resources are exhausted, the symbiosis of humans and machines is the only way. The film is not only great scene, but also contains a profound truth. Tells us that the Earth is our only way to survive their homes, to cherish the Earth, Protect the Earth. Worth a visit","10"
"Ron L","Over-hyped, Style over Substance","27 September 1999","I had high hopes for this movie, being a huge fan of the ""what if none of this is real?"" genre, but I was disappointed. The film does have a few things going for it - let me cover those first, since that won't take long. The visuals are beautiful and stunning - whoever shot this movie is indeed an artist. I can't remember a film that was this fascinating just to look at. The film also has a creative and intriguing premise (which I can't mention, or it would spoil it). Keanu Reeves, who is a horrible actor, is actually more tolerable in this flick than he has been in most of his others - mostly due to the fact that the role requires almost no acting. Keanu does look good in the film, and Carrie-Ann Moss looks fantastic in tight PVC pants! That's it for the good, now for the bad: the story has holes in it the size of Texas. Is it really so hard to write a story that makes sense, that is tightly crafted? Total Recall and The Terminator come to mind as examples of tightly written sci-fi films. I can't go into the details of the many, many things that just don't make sense since it would spoil it for those who haven't seen it. Did the writers not understand virtual reality at all, or did they just assume the audience was too ignorant to notice the absurdities and non-sensical aspects of their virtual world? Seems like the makers of The Matrix just got lazy. They had a great premise and Keanu Reeves, so they just threw in some extended slo-mo gunfights, kung-fu battles, lots of big explosions, a pounding soundtrack, and called it a day - very crass. About those slo-mo gunfights, kung-fu battles, big explosions, and pounding soundtrack - they came across as very contrived - obviously hacked onto the story to make it an ""action"" movie. How obviously formulaic! I can just hear the producer saying ""We have a pretty good story here, but we want to make it an 'action' movie, so stick in these elements..."". This film had serious potential, but ended up as merely mediocre - what a shame. 5 out of 10.","7"
"MovieFreak35","its ok","18 December 2021","This movie has its moments, the plot is actually really interesting and to me its what holds the movie together and keeps me wanting to know what happens next. On the other hand tho i cant really seem to get into any of the characters, i think alot of the acting comes across as bland and mediocre and their likability it just meh, i dont hate any of them but i want to like these characters more then i do. Also im not big on the action scenes, all strings attached and running up and down walls, it just doesnt really work for me. This is not a bad movie bc i really enjoy the story, i just think it could be played out in a much better way.","10"
"HORROR_FAN_1","Plain and simply brilliant.","26 April 2002","If I would have commented on this flick after the first time that I watched it then I probably would have only rated it 8 or possibly 9. It is so true that to fully appreciate this film you have to watch it 3 maybe even four times. I thought this film film was brilliantly original, clever, atmospheric and well thought out.

It's especially interesting to see how much effort and skill went into making it. The actors for example, took 4/5 months just to learn the martial art skills necessary for the Morpheus/Neo fight simulation. The cast is great (especially Trinity in that sexy cat suit, wow!, she has a lovely ass!). The direction is superb and I just cannot find a fault with this masterpiece, apart from at the end, where it becomes a bit corny in that in order for Neo to become 'The One', Trinity must confess her love for him. Rather corny but after all, this is the one thing that the machines which have taken over cannot feel or relate to, feelings such as love or compassion. Subsequently it is this, that leads to their downfall as Neo wakes up and kicks Agent Smith's ass!.

A must watch for any viewer & one of only a few films I will give full marks to.

Rating 10/10. Master Class.","10"

"mayurp7","A masterpiece will never gonna made again! 10 out of 10","27 December 2015","Note: It is difficult to understand the film in first see. A must see film if you are bored by same daily routine films. A brainteaser for audiences force them to think.I don't know why all three installments of Matrix are having below 9 ratings. Actually there is no flaw in all these films. A evergreen script and action scenes you will watch over and over again! I liked this movie as it specifically meant us to think how the things act internally of computer literally. Also I come across the observation that the colors used for filming the particular is not for fun but they have given it meaning like: The green color indicates the scenes inside the matrix, white color shows that the purity of the soul like scenes of sati, oracle. etc. Those who haven't still watched it, just download three parts and take a ride.","8"
"abum190","I love this movie","15 November 2006","The Matrix has become such an iconic movie that it's hard to say anything new about it. I'm hesitant to try. Everyone knows it's a good movie- and if they don't believe it to be good, they know it's a well-loved movie. I, for one, love it, but I don't think it deserves to be so high up in the Top 250.

The Matrix is a good example of a movie that pretends to be about something in order to keep your attention. The truth is that the story in this movie is so good and the characters so engaging that it doesn't need the message (be careful about getting too dependent on your machines- they might kill you). The way the story is executed is also nearly ingenious. When we first meet Neo (Keanu Reeves), a computer programmer for a software business that sidelines as a black market dealer in computer parts, we do not know the secret of the Matrix. The Wachowski brothers do not reveal the secret till about a quarter of the way through the movie- the perfect time to do it; any shorter, and it wouldn't have been a shock; any longer, and the movie would have become boring and there would have been less action, which is the real star of this movie.

Neo meets Morpheus (Laurence Fishburne), a man proclaimed to be a terrorist by the government through the media, who gives Neo the choice between returning to his boring life and discovering the truth about the Matrix. Neo's choice sends him and the characters he meets into intense gun-and-fistfights. In between the action sequences, Morpheus spouts some philosophical tripe that could be considered deep, but there's really no life behind it; I didn't care. The movie is fun, and that's all that matters.

I don't think it's a great movie, but that doesn't matter. If you're just looking to have fun and sit on the edge of your seat for a few hours, then this is a great movie for that.","5"
"evoapollo","So what would you choose. The blue pill. Or the red pill?","30 July 2021","I played the matrix path of neo when I was 11 and after beating it I wanted to watch the movies. So they were significantly different from the game obviously to make it more fun but it took me years to understand the message of these movies. At first I thought it was just cool choreography and sunglasses. But as i grew older i realize what it was trying to tell me. Neo was a nihilistic hacker who felt like something was wrong but didn't know what it was. Then he meets morpheus and offers him the truth. He seems reluctant at first but then proceeds. It turns out that his everyday boring life was just a simulation called the matrix. And that we were all just programmed to follow it and live in it doing mediocre things. Luckily 1 percent I think they said in the movie could see through it and they were shown the truth that outside of the matrix was basically a wasteland full of these cybernetic things running the matrix. I cant put exactly what it was as I haven't seen it since i was like 11 so memory is very cloudy. I was crazy about keanu Reeves before he was john wick. This movie had some great action scenes. And rage against the machine plays at the end. So go figure what that tells you if you know a thing or 2 about rage against the machine. People can either accept the painful truth and deal with it. Or they can live in ignorance and live a mediocre life without questioning anything. In a sense, we as humans live like we're in a matrix. We waste our lives not realizing the true capabilities of our universe, that we just sit and dont ask questions. Basically like sheep just following the group and having no sense of anything else even if theres a wolf among them. We live life like we think we will be alive in the next 100 years or so. And like morpheus said (I might quote it wrong) that most people arent ready to accept the truth that their lives are basically lies and therefore are the enemy until they realize the truth. Its An illusion. It has it own story centered on the matrix but the deep message behind it is to think freely for yourself. Not what someone wants you to think. And the one guy who betrays all of them I forgot his name basically is the definition of ignorance is bliss. As in he saw the truth and he cant accept it so he'd rather live his life as a mindless sheep because he hated the truth and refused to deal with it. He'd be happier or so he thinks living in this simulation. People do this too as they lie to themselves and try to stay ignorant of it as they think it will not be their problem. But for him his world is not the matrix and he thought by going back to the matrix would make him feel better by living a life of lies in a fake world. People also do this as well. Social media, video games. We all do this, wasting precious time of our lives, even now as I'm typing this review I'm wasting my time trying to explain what the matrix means at least what I think it means. We could be doing something else in the world right now than on these digital things like how people could be fighting the matrix but instead live in it like it's a part of their lives but its really all an illusion. They're just sitting in something hooked up to a machine their whole lives waiting to die. Dont be like this. Dont be what the machine wants you to be. Rage against it. Thats why the ending of this film was so amazing because the band that plays is a very political based band. And if you cant tell then you must have not listened to their lyrics in their songs. Rage against the matrix. Rage against the ""machine"". Seek the truth. I think I broke down the meaning I could have misinterpreted it if so carry on with your lives. Its moving forward whether we like it or not. This movie was amazing all 3 were. Fantastic cast, keanu Reeves was awesome, Laurence fishburne was the first movie I saw of him. I had no idea he was in so many movies before it. Event horizon, a nightmare on elm street 3 or 4 I cant remember. And everytime I see him I'm reminded of morpheus. This movie was great I'm hoping to rewatch it again as an adult soon.","10"

"DragoonKain","Science Fiction at its best, and great action too","16 October 2003","For those of you Science Fiction fans who have not yet seen the matrix: For God's sake why? I was lucky enough to catch this in theaters opening night. I had no idea what to expect. What I got was by far the best SF movie of 90's. And the best part was, it was the best action movie too.

This movie is very loosely based on a Harlan Ellison short story titled ""I have no mouth and I must scream"", considered by many to be one of the classic SF stories. The characters and plot are completely different, but the basic theme is essentially the same. Why does the world not seem real? What is real? Is this all a dream? This is certainly not the first time movies have tackled this theme, but it is certainly the first time the theme was handled in this way. This movie is a very original piece of work. It's influence will be felt for decades.

Keanu Reeves plays Neo and as the story unfolds, we follow his adventures into some truly mind-boggling situations and discover things as he discovers them.

It's hipper than hip and cool as ice, I defy anybody not to enjoy at least some part of this film.

It blows you away at the beginning and gets better and better right to the very end, ending on a perfect cliff-hanger.

"FilmSchoolFlunk","Unbelievable sci-fi","2 May 2023","This film follows Neo, a software developer by day, underground computer hacker by night. A man named Morpheus shows Neo the reality of his world, that him and everyone else are living out their lives in a fake simulation developed by the robots that now inhabit earth. It is prophesized that Neo is the chosen one, and will be the hope the human race needs to free themselves from the clutches of machines.

I had high expectations before watching this movie - everyone knows The Matrix, and that it's influence and references transcend cinema. I can happily say It was better than I expected! What a world to get immersed in for two hours. I loved the dystopian future setting, and found it very reminiscent of Blade Runner with the low key lighting, constant rain, and accompanying foreboding presence. It stood on its own two feet however with the present day earth production design and the plot of machines now controlling earth. I found it breathtaking watching the scenes and flashbacks that took place on earth, the black clouds with no sun, billions of humans encapsulated in endless spires, robots scouring the land. Morpheus' ship looked incredibly 90s sci-fi, but it was great, and watching it travers the sewers was sweet. All in all the production design, costumes, sets and cgi in this movie are incredible. The look and feel is 10/10.

Now onto the story. I loved the plot, humans trapped by robots in a simulation to keep them content while the robots suck their energy. A group of rebel fighters free the chosen one from his mundane fake life and train him, showing him the mind bending reality. As a viewer you feel right there with neo, because well, a lot of us live the lives Neo did. All of a sudden hes being told it is all fake and we watch him struggle to process it - as a viewer I was truly side-by-side with Neo and was trying to wrap my head around it too. The logic behind the matrix and the rules we learn through Morpheus and the crew are all believable given the context, not to mention so incredibly cool. Neo being the ""chosen one"" can be cliche, but in this movie I accepted it and didn't mind. Up until the final 30 minutes I was convinced that they had the wrong guy. The payoff at the end when Neo finally kills and agent is one of those rare moments where emotion, action and understanding come together in a perfect climax. Let me also mention how well done the action is. Great shootouts with acrobatic stunts, high stakes and uniqueness - so crazy this was back in 99.

This movie has undertones of some deep and thought-provoking themes. Free will vs fate, existentialism, being controlled by a tyranical force, oppression, etc.

I was a fan of the love that blossoms between Neo and Trinity, but I have to say it did come a bit abruptly at the end. We get hints the entire movie that trinity feels something for him, but Neo gives us next to nothing. A few more moments between them would have really cemented their feelings. Another big thing I feel like is never explained is why the robots created the Matrix in the first place. If they created it to keep humans sedated and satisfied so that they inevitably turn to energy - why not just trap them in the pods minus the Matrix? Why go through the trouble of giving a race you went to war with a whole fake universe? Just grow and harvest us like you've been doing and keep us trapped or sedated. Idk that question was plaguing me the whole movie. Another thing is the use of guns for all the action. If the Matrix is a computer simulation, and these Agents and Neo can see it for what it is and exploit it, I would have liked some crazy action beyond guns. There was so much more potential for mind bending fights - I mean these people can literally make this simulation their playground. Its also worth a note that Keanu is the best worst actor ever. He was better here than in John Wick, but I didn't find much impressive in terms of his acting.

Overall, The Matrix is an expansive sci-fi movie with incredible action sequences, beautiful sets, world design and a mind bending story that stays grounded. I loved this film from start to finish.","9"

"DesertDogMedia","The Matrix","6 August 2014","Title: The Matrix

Condensed Storyline: A computer hacker learns about the truth of the world and has to try and save it from the computers by being 'The One'

Notable Acting: This movie has a great main cast consisting of Keanu Reeves, Laurence Fishburn, Carrie-Anne Moss and Hugo Weaving. These are the only characters who actually matter and who provide good acting. Sure Joe Pantoliano and Marcus Chong provide their good parts, but they're just secondary characters who get minimal character development.

Noticeable Camera work: This movie is great for its dolly shot and its 180º shots, these are only used during the fight scene which makes them special as they are not over used, but apart from that there are few other good shots which they use to good effect as the rest is left up to standard shots

Graphics: This movie had the best CGI for that period of time and it's CGI still stands up amazingly in the standards set by today.

Incorrect Science: The plot revolves around humans being used a batteries, hence why there are massive farms of them. But humans cannot generate chemical, thermal or electrical energy without a food source which provides them without enough energy to do so. In short this means it takes more energy to keep humans alive than a human body produces. So the machines are working a flawed system. The second time Morpheus calls Neo he says that ""this is a tapped line"" and proceeds to tell Neo where to meet Trinity. If the line was tapped Trinity would have Agents coming after her because Morpheus just gave away their position. In the end of the movie Agent Smith shoots Neo with a Desert Eagle, a weapon of that caliber would go through Neo and into the wall, but we only see a blood smear and no hole in the wall.

Overall Feel: The first opening scene of this movie was done on a $10million budget, once it was shown to the people at Warner, they were then allowed the Wachowski Brothers to have the $80million that they originally asked for. That was just a little bit of trivia for you. This movie was ahead of its time in its usage of CGI, it is a movie which can still rival a few movies which are made today. Amazing mixture of good acting, great CGI and good camera work.","9"
"TIALI","Awesome special effects loaded kick-em-up Sci-fi flick","4 April 1999","Every good thing you hear about this movie is true. The special effects are amazing and Keanu doesn't talk much. Any bad thing you hear is just someone who just didn't get it. The plot is simple: take one part Terminator, one part Total Recall and two parts any movie like Dark City or 12 Monkeys or that Star Trek episode where they fight at the O K Corral. There are weaknesses in dialogue but not enough to be bothersome, but the story is good solid sci-fi. What is the Matrix? It's everywhere and everything--simply, it's a computer program, but really it's not that simple: watching the characters learn to understand that is two-thirds of the movie AND THAT'S NOT A BAD THING. We watch them learn and what we learn about what's happened to their world in the mean time is interesting enough to keep your mind wondering where all this is going. Another reason to go out and get a DVD player.....","10"

But these adjectives could also be used to describe an MTV music video. In fact, it seems music videos, along with Japanese animation and the slow motion action scenes from John Woo movies, were the main inspiration for this film. Throw in a science fiction plot containing lots of pseudo scientific jargon and you have a movie that is not only action packed but seems quite intellectual as well. But it is this intellectual aspect of THE MATRIX that I feel has been overrated. The film's central question, -- `Just what is reality?' is drowned out by all the action and not examined in any great detail. A motion picture that tackles this very same question in a much more fascinating manner is 1998's highly underrated DARK CITY. Both films explore similar territory, but because DARK CITY was not geared towards the mainstream by incorporating a modern music score and a shoot-em-up sensibility, it was not as popular. Like little children fascinated by bright colors and loud noises, modern audiences tend to be transfixed by films like THE MATRIX. But this movie's lasting power (like last months number one pop hit) won't be long term. Entertaining  yes, great or meaningful  No.

"charlietuna","Settle down!","25 January 2001","The ratings on this film are way overblown! Excellent special effects, a bench mark for sure. Yet in all other aspects of film, this movie is far from the litany of 8s,9s, and 10s it is receiving. Sure I bought the DVD as soon as I left the theater but people, 2001 ASO, Alien, Blade Runner, etc. those are 8-10. This movie is little more than a 7 on special effects steroids.","9"
"Number8","A treat for the eyes","3 September 1999","This movie featured some of the best special effects ever. The action was intense and the fighting was superb. Never had I seen anything like it, and I love what I saw on screen, effects wise.

But with the great effects came an inferior storyline. I think they had a good thing going with this ""humans enslaved by computers"" plot, but it fell short because they tried to explain this very complex concept halfway during the movie in a matter of few minutes, confusing the audience as well as broken down the pace. It would have been better if they took more time to explain it, or didn't explain it at all. Either of these would make the plot a lot easier to follow.

Another bad thing would have to be those instances in the movie where they put some comedic dialogue in, which seemed out of place. I knew it was supposed to be funny, but I just couldn't laugh, kinda like a good joke told wrong. Good thing there were too many of those since they were getting annoying. I also don't like the romance bit a the end where Trinity and Neo. I mean what gives?! The movie was going along just fine then suddenly love becomes a subject. It just seemed so fake and forced. My impression of it was that they decided to put love into the story at the last minute, because it seemed so out of place. Personally, I didn't like that one bit.

All in all, an enjoyable film, but it's definitely not a masterpiece. Do see if for the effects though, because it couldn't get any better than this.","9"
"Cathz","A big disappointment, but still enjoyable","24 January 2005","I'm afraid I have only to reiterate what others have already said on here - 'The Matrix' is hugely overrated. I, like others, did enjoy it for its sheer escapism, sense of adventure and regular conventions of good vs. evil. There is a great deal to admire in it - the stylistic qualities, good soundtrack, and of course special effects. The fight scenes - to begin with - are fairly mind-blowing, but throughout the 3 films as a whole there are far too many of an almost identical nature. It seems the choreographers ran out of different moves & poses.

Onto the less good - as I agree with others, the utterly pretentious and convoluted 'morals' or 'underlying themes' of the film. It seems like just another of a particular ilk, that seeks to confuse the viewer as much as possible, to hide the fact that there is very little intelligent substance in there. As others have noticed, the basic philosophy running through the 3 films has been expressed many times before, only without the needless drivel that is heard in 'The Matrix'. This becomes more apparent in the second film, I must admit, but what IS there from the very beginning, and what annoys me most, is the OVER-CONSCIOUS nature of the film as a whole. It appears set up, from the first, that 'this is going to be a landmark film' - there is a sense of over-importance and worthiness which is, frankly, unconvincing.

Not only this, but the dialogue is cliché-ridden, some of it reminding me distinctly of old Bond villain lines, recycled and delivered as if Shakespearian quotes; ""I will enjoy watching you die"" etc. Unlike others, I found Hugo Weaving's performance one of the weakest. The best way to describe it, in a word, is over-acting, and possible one of the worst accents in movie history. I will give credit to Joe Pantoliano, and most of the cast are reasonably likable, but the characters themselves are weak to say the least, and as others have commented the love story is both shallow and superfluous to the plot.

In short, I was disappointed with this film as I went into it with an open mind and was ready to enjoy it, from what I had heard from others. However, it fails to deliver on many levels and the over-complicity of the 'philosophy' ruins what enjoyment could have been had from a pretty good and interesting premise. On a final note, I would have to say that the dark glasses - not given a purpose in the film, as far as I can tell - are the ultimate example of what this film really succeeds in: IMAGE. Apart from that, it all seemed rather wasted. I'll give the first instalment of the trilogy 6/10, for pure entertainment value!","10"

The film's title ""The Matrix"" has become an extremely common term in the English language. Kids will be pretending to dodge bullets and they will yell ""MATRIX!!!"" or something like that. It is actually quite amazing. Anyways, This film is incredible. The Wachowski brothers have definitely created a masterpiece in the art of film-making.

*SPOILERS BELOW*

Watching Neo evolve from a mild-mannered young geek with an office job who had very little confidence in himself and seeing him slowly start to accept his fate as possibly the most powerful being in existence was probably the most epic character arc I've ever seen in a film. I was 11 years old when I first watched this movie and I've never grown tired of it.

If you're a fan of Sci-fi or just good action movies in general and still have somehow managed to avoid seeing The Matrix up to this point, please, just do yourself a favor and watch it. I'm almost certain you won't be disappointed.","10"

The Wachowski Brothers take us into a complete and imaginative universe all their own and they do so with a kinetic visual style that will get your heart pumping. The effects are like nothing you've seen in any other film.

It's a fun comic book video game come to life but it's also much more. At its heart, the film has a philosophical message: ""Free Your Mind."" See it as quickly as possible.","6"

Mostly expressionless, he looks rather bewildered and reluctant to be in the adventure; he would have backed out the door if he'd had the chance. Personally, I'd prefer to be a human battery. Speaking of which, surely the computers could have figured out a way to make some nicad batteries, with all the other gadgets they figured out how to make. As science fiction goes, it's a little on the 'light' side, but fun nonetheless. However, before you decide to see this, be warned -- I also liked 'Johnny Mnemonic'","8"

The Matrix is the world we live in, which is really a computer generated program.

The Matrix has everything. It has Sci-Fi, Action and Comedy. The characters are very likable, and their are very personable and able to understand. The Action Sequences are amazing, and the special effects are simply mind blowing. The plot is very well written, and is very original. Keanu Reeves suits the role of Neo, just like he was born to play the part. The supporting cast are also extreme good actors.

"Shuggy","Kung fu and guns to fight unreality?","23 April 1999","The Matrix is ideally suited to its target audience, 14-year-old boys. Lots of action and danger, little love interest, and a ""What is reality, really?"" theme.

It has overt echoes of ""Alice"" (Was it all a dream?) and Oz (not in Kansas any more: someone actually says ""Pay no attention..."") but there's an echo (Morpheus/Morbius) of Forbidden Planet and hence The Tempest, and of course, centrally, the gospels, with a Chosen One. Keanu Reeves is suitably humble.

I went for the special effects and was sometimes impressed (except for one patently computerised wall of flame), but at its heart, the story is flawed: why return to an illusory world to save a real one? Once there, ultra-violence is again the solution to all problems. Should we be surprised schoolboys go on rampages?

A flub: reality should not shimmer in the real world.

Hugo Weaving was suitably sinister: a cross between a young Jack Nicholson and Richard Nixon. Laurence Fishburne was credible as John the B^h^hMorpheus. Nice cameos from Rowan Witt as the boy who bends spoons and Gloria Foster as the Oracle (I was expecting Whoopi G. and I wasn't far wrong). It warmed my Kiwi heart to see a Maori name, Julian Arahanga (Apoc), in the credits.","10"

What I found was an amazing movie, with some of the greatest special effects I've ever seen. The camera angles really work for the action sequences and the choreographed fight scenes made me yearn for more. Say what you want about Keanu Reeves' acting.

He may not deliver the best dialogue, but his look can carry a film. He was a great choice for the role of Neo.

Carrie Anne Moss was great as was the underrated Laurence Fishburne.

I highly recommend this film for those who are a fan of visually stunning movies. It will blow away your senses...","10"
"8cd","Hollywood cool","22 March 2001","The Matrix is just COOL. It is a good thing that the cool factor is more an emotional response than an intellectual response, because if one starts to think about the story, the movie just does not make sense. Why would machines use humans as batteries? Cows have bigger biomass and need no entertainment. But why create a matrix for humans in the first place? Just make sure they're all chained up. Agents are fast enough to dodge bullets but run slow, as computerized characters, they should have perfect shooting skills but can't hit an elephant a foot away from them etc. As for the ""deep philosophy"", there isn't any. If you think there is, you haven't read any real philosophy. From Plato to Wittgenstein, the problem of the reality of the world has been thoroughly, and in a INTELLIGENT way, explored. The martial arts part is disappointing. Mr. Reeves and the gang are way too STIFF. The lack of fluidity is too obvious. So what we have left is a lot of explosions, bullet shells, gratuitous, cold-blooded murders, good-looking stars and awesome computer graphics. Hollywood cool. And I like Hollywood cool... when I need to spend a mindless afternoon, so mindless in fact that I didn't even mind the really BAD ending: next time she kisses him, he'll turn into a frog. 7/10 for the cool factor.","8"
"preppy-2","Good BUT...","7 April 1999","""The Matrix"" had an interesting (if far-fetched) story, jaw-dropping special effects and some great action, but it's not that great of a film. Two reasons for this: the plot...it's too complex and a lot of meaningless details are thrown in and conservations are pointlessly drawn out. The film could have ended at least 20 minutes sooner. The second and most severe problem...Keanu Reeves. This is a real problem considering he's the lead and is supposed to show emotions and feelings. Instead he's totally blank, and it put me at a distance from him. So ""The Matrix"" is worth seeing for the special effects and interesting plot, but Reeves' lousy performance stops it from being what could have been a great sci-fi movie.","10"
"SRVHS","Teenager thinks movie was hella tripy","17 September 1999","The matrix was a good movie because it was twisted and had lots of wierd speacil effects. One of the really cool effects was when these two guys were shooting each other. It was cool because it made it look like every thing was slowmow cuase they were moving so fast. Another thing about the movie was it as confusing in a weird way. No other movie wil make you think like this one.

The thing that made this movie cool was the plot. The plot was that the world was a computer program. Like nothing was real it was all a computer fanticy. With out the computer you couldn't live a normal life. It says you are not born by a mother you are grown like in a corn field.

The other thing that made this move good was the speacil effects. I liked them so much because they were a fat trip. One of the tripiest thinds was when thet shoot at each other. That was cool because they could move so fast they could doge the bullets. And when they did that every thing would get all wavey and mest.

In my conclution this movie was the bomb. It had every thing you want in a action flick. Tripy stuff lots of shootig and agood looking chick in a tite suit. So take my advise and go see the matrix and enjoy the trip

"SRVHS","Dave sez this movie is like a ninja.","17 September 1999","The Matrix is about a computer hacker (Keanu Reeves) named Neo who gets mixed up in what is called the Matrix. If you don't know what the Matrix is, it is the world that has been pulled over our eyes to make us think that we are living a great life but in the ""real world"" we are actually being harvested to power robot type things. Confused? That's what I thought. You will have to see it for yourself to fully understand what the Matrix is.

As far as the storyline goes, I thought that the writers had done a fair job. It was well written in most parts but a little hard to follow in the beginning. I'll have to disagree with the critics when they say that the actors did a just ok job with carrying out their parts. I think it was well acted. The discussion between the characters was genuine. It was almost as if the discussions were made by real people instead of just robots programmed by the writers to carry out a story.

If you are looking for sensible action then this is the movie for you. It has enough action to keep you awake but still isn't non-stop carnage. Blood and gore wasn't a problem since there was only one scene with blood. However, there was quite a bit of gunplay. I thought the rating in The Matrix could have been a PG-13 instead of an R.

The special effects in The Matrix were awsome. Trying to find out how the effects were made isn't a bad idea. When the people in ""the Matrix world"" change into agents (or vise versa) is always a good effect. This movie is another example of how technology is changing the way we watch movies.

Overall, I highly recommend this movie. With only a few slight flaws, The Matrix is destined to become a favorite to many people. Why the critics didn't like this movie is a mystery to me. It has four stars in my book.

The normal average bussiness man suddenly turns into someone who has to save the world. Now, what does a good action movie have in it. Action of course. And that is exactly what this Sci- fi movie had in it.This action packed thriller is one that will definitely go into the books.

The most action packed scene of the movie was over 15 minutes long. The star of the movie (Keanu Reeves) has a karate scene with this enormous black guy. Every minute you see a flying fist here and a huge kick to the head.Definitely one of the best action scenes I have ever seen.This was my favorite scene of the movie. You can't tell me that this doesn't fall into the action cattigory.

Now for the ending. I can not give it away. There is a little bit I can say though. The ending involes all of the characters from the whole movie. There are a lot of guns, a lot of suspense, and a lot of action. We cant leave out the special effects though. So sit back and watch the action packed thriller of the summer of (1999). This definitely was the movie of the summer.

The music mixed with the well choreographed fights makes for some great action, the movie has a ton of action and the last hour is pretty much all action and don't worry, there is action trough out the whole movie, not just the end.

The Matrix has now garnered it's own cult of teenagers and young adults all over the world. I admit that only discovering this little movie only months before the sequel, The Matrix Reloaded was due to come out. I rented the DVD not knowing what to expect. I knew the storyline but nothing too deep other than the most basic of information. I sat through the film's 136 minute running time, watching carefully. After the movie, I took the DVD out of my player, put it in it's case and walked out the door, remembering absolutely nothing. Ouch.

The Matrix is a science fiction tale of a computer program writer called Thomas Anderson AKA Neo (Keanu Reeves), who learns from a band of rebels that the world he lives in is a digital simulation. The world he sees, the world we see is in fact a virtual reality created by an entire race of machines to keep humans under control and giving those machines energy for them to survive. After learning the truth from the mysterious man known as Morpheus (Laurence Fishburne) and leather-clad, ass-kicker Trinity (Carrie-Anne Moss), Neo is released from the virtual prison known as the Matrix and finally witnesses the real world. But there's something more to Neo than meets the eye: Is he possibly the One, the only person in all of mankind that can destroy the Matrix and free the human race? The answer? Probably.

The main source of entertainment in this movie are the fight scenes, which zip by like a six-year-old having a sugar rush. I admit that these fight scenes are spectacular, crafted with the most seamless special effects I have ever seen. There is a particularly impressive hand-to-hand fight between Keanu Reeves and Australian actor Hugo Weaving (Lord of the Rings) in a subway and even a more impressive one between Reeves and Laurence Fishburne in the first hour of the film, taking place in an old dojo. It was hard to believe that Keanu performed all of his fight scenes himself, or that he had the brains to remember the moves! Sure, pretty-looking fight scenes are abound in this film but that's where my investment in this film stopped dead.

The Matrix's fatal flaw is that there is not one likable or colorful character in all of the film's bloated 136 minutes. The only character that comes even remotely close to being likable is Carrie-Anne Moss' Trinity. All other characters are ultimately forgettable and not really worth caring about. Some characters just drove me out of my mind! I found most of the crew of the Nebachanezzar annoying and pointless. What's worse is that most of them have the worst dialogue of the whole movie. ""Digital pimp hard at work!"" Are the Wachowski's eighteen or something? I know this movie is marketed to teenagers as something ""cool"". In fact, I'm only fifteen years old and I didn't think the movie was all that ""cool"". Instead of ""cool"" I found it ""cliched"", ""silly"" and ""lame"". I admit, Keanu Reeves' character was decent and somewhat interesting considering the fact he didn't look like he could figure out what everyone is saying. You know a main character is not worthing giving a damn about when everyone around him must constantly explain things to him, often slowly. Actually, I found the whole movie to merely being an ""introduction"" to this concept. There WAS no story.

But alas, there is a saving grace and that is the new world unraveling before our very eyes, often with the most spectacular visual effects. They're not much of filmmakers, but the Wachowski's are certainly digital wizards, able to magically create dreams out of the latest of technology. The CGI used in the ""real world"" is particularly impressive, probably more impressive than most things out of that ""other"" big-budget release of 1999, called a little something like Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace. But I found the Phantom Menace much more entertaining! Like Star Wars, there is never really a moment in this movie that special effects are not used. Sure, these special effects are great to look at, but a movie should not be reliant on special effects. That's why most indie films end up being some of the best movies of all time. They are about writing, directing and acting. Films like The Matrix are only made to show out the latest technology. Now make no mistake, I didn't watch this film expecting it to take home the Best Picture award from the Academy, but that's doesn't stop it from being disappointing.

Many people claim this film for being ""deep"" yet I see nothing ""deep"" about it at all. ""There is no spoon."" Yeah, I already remember Laurence Fishburne's character blabbing about that earlier in the film for immense amounts of time. And I hear Reloaded is just one big Philosophy 101 lesson! The philosophy found in this movie I think is trying to be subtle but in the end simply bogs the film down. I commend the Wachowskis for trying to take action films to another level, but maybe that just won't ever happen. The only movie that ever actually came close to being something more was 1991's Terminator 2: Judgement Day, which happens to be a much better movie than The Matrix, action film or not. And don't give me that ""You just didn't understand it!"" crap, because I understood the whole thing perfectly and believe me, there is nothing special about it.

I think the real thing that made The Matrix loved by millions of viewers is that it glorifies computer geeks and school nerds. The real problem with me is that I'm neither of those things. I guess that's why it never touched me, or the story just never moved me. Sure the action scenes are spectacular and the special effects are great to look at, but in my opinion, special effects should not drive the story. It should be the other way around. Combine that with one-dimensional characters and uninspired dialogue, there is nothing here to entertain me. A movie can be the greatest movie of all time but if it doesn't entertain, it does nothing for me. That's exactly the definition I would give The Matrix.","5"
"Chihiro_Sen15","Far from mind-blowing or impressive, but I was entertained","10 May 2003","Chihiro_Sen15's Rating: 6.5 out of 10

There's much hype among a little 1999 film called ""The Matrix"" a movie which I only discovered this year, a little before the release of the much anticipated (much overhyped) sequel ""The Matrix Reloaded"". I don't why I waited so long to see this movie. I just never got the time or just wasn't interested enough to see it. But I just kept seeing advertisements for ""Reloaded"": All of the soda and beer ads, the posters, the extremely good-looking Carrie Anne Moss. I had to check the first one out! I finally rented it on DVD from Blockbuster, and after taking out the disc, I came to the conclusion that the ""Matrix"" was one of the most overrated movies of all time. But that never stopped it from being entertaining.

""The Matrix"" tells of Thomas Anderson (Keanu Reeves), a computer programmer by day and a hacker by night by the name of ""Neo"". But by having a mysterious encounter between peculiar strangers Morpheus (Lawrence Fishburne) and Trinity (Carrie-Anne Moss), Neo learns that the world is not what it seems to be. Him and all the other humans are slaves in the ""Matrix"", a computer program deluding the humans from the ""real"" world. After being ""unplugged"", Neo joins with Morpheus and Trinity to fight against the machine army threatening to destroy ""Zion"", the last human city of the real world, and to free the rest of the humans from the Matrix while taking on Smith (Hugo Weaving) and the other agents.

""The Matrix"" does have a few ideas, but Phillip K. Dick wrote better than this. The dialogue is banal and the movie is constantly explaining the whole explanation to the audience. ""The Matrix"" is a very, very simplistic premise but the film is able to expand past it's small idea into an over-wrought world laden down with special effects. All of the characters have no depth in them at all and are treated like special effects like the rest of the film! What begins as a fairly interesting plot turns into a video game with cardboard characters and fancy visuals.

Then why was I entertained? Simple: It was fun. I had a fun time. It's not the classic the desperate action junkies and video game nerds want it to be. Nor was it mind-blowing. I saw nothing here that I haven't seen in billions of stories written decades before this movie was thought of. The visuals are fun and ""bullet time"" was somewhat cool to look at, but there really was no POINT to the movie. What are we getting out of this? Nothing except minor entertainment. Should I bother with Reloaded...?","10"

"daved-3","For SF fans only","9 April 1999","The Matrix is visually stunning (not just the FX, but also wonderful direction and camerawork and superb fight choreography) but should appeal only to hard core SF fans. It has familiar plot elements taken from TRON, Terminator 2 and several other SF stories, but it is so innovative in its visuals you don't mind (in fact, the story needs to be familiar to make sense of it). Keanu is at his best looking slack-jawed and going, ""Whoa!"" It lacks the pace of T-2, but the ending is dynamite (literally).","5"
"Colonel Ted","Good, but not THAT good","24 September 1999","I was very surprised to see this film in the top 30 films of all time. Not least for the fact that it borrows from nearly every other sci-fi film ever made such as the imagery of Ridley Scott's Blade Runner and (vaguely) the plot of James Cameron's The Terminator, which are frankly, better films. The fascinating plot premise is wasted to a certain degree by the mind boggling plot and a never ending stream of psycho-babble that shows every sign of a film cramming in far too many ideas than it can handle. And then there's the lousy ending However for all these flaws The Matrix (particularly the last half hour) is very entertaining, getting by on that old trick: showmanship. It's absolutely stunning! SFX, from the mirror spreading on Neo's face, to the `flo-mo' camera shots, to that helicopter crash, are superb and are by far the most impressive of 1999's blockbusters. The Wachowski brothers direct with pace and flare and there are some very funny moments throughout (`Wooah'). Performances too, are good. Fishburne and newcomer, Moss (what a find!) shine and even Reeves is not half as wooden as usual. I was slightly disappointed, mainly due to script and after reading all the great reviews, perhaps I had set my hopes a little high. But The Matrix is by far the best summer SFX blockbuster this year. 8/10","10"
"hprill","Good entertainment, interesting concept, cool actors.","24 January 2000","While not ranking among my top favorite films of all time, I thought this was one of the better films of 1999, a lot better than your average science-fiction / action / Chosen-One-saves-the-world flicks. The concept behind the plot (how real is the world around us?) wasn't too new -- Philip K. Dick and others have been there many times before --, but that doesn't keep it from still being interesting. The same goes for the movie: even though some of the plot elements were cleverly recycled from elsewhere, the screenplay managed to present them in a new, refreshing, up-tempo, and thrilling way (though I was a bit annoyed with the dumbo character who betrayed the lot because he couldn't get the girl. I've seen this too many times before, and it just didn't fit).

The coolest thing about this film, however, was not the screenplay, and it wasn't the special effects. It was the actors. Hugo Weaving gave me the creeps as smooth, unscrupulous Agent Smith. Laurence Fishburne was cool beyond belief, a walking enigma if I've ever seen one. Carrie-Anne Moss... my God, what can I say...? I just *love* good-looking (and well-dressed) women who kick butt. Even Keanu Reeves showed some decent acting, even though he looked a bit too cute at times.

If you said yes a few years ago, you would be seen as a crazy madman with a stupid conspircary theory. However when you watch the Matrix, it makes you wonder if we are all alive or not. It is about a computer hacker called Neo who is asked to joined a viligante group out to save the human race from destruction. Neo escapes the world he believes that he is in, and ends up in a post apocalpytic future. Sounds like you normal run of the mill sci fi but you would be wrong. The action sequences are absolutely fantastic especially when Neo is fighting his mentor Morpheus. It reminds me so much of the old kung fu movies, I was expecting some very dodgy dubbing. The acting was ok,but there was some glimmer of great acting especially from Mr Fishburne. However it is the special effects that takes the audience breath away. That is what makes this movie so special. The special effect of the Bullet Time, (this is where the action stops but the whole thing relvoles to get another view of it), is so cool. I have to take my hat off and say this is a brillant movie, and should be watched by anyone from Conspricay Theorists, Sci Fi Buffs and even the people who does not like sci fi at all. 10/10","9"

"abentenjo","That one that everybodys watched","14 April 2002","Borrowing many of its ideas from Hong Kong movies yet subverting them to create an experience like no other, this often spoofed and pretentiously scripted affair is nevertheless an action movie classic; a breath-taking masterpiece that firmly established the end of the nineties with one solid roundhouse kick. Its pumped-up and highly-charged action sequences blend a dazzling array of firepower with kung fu, expertly handled by the genius of Yuen Woo Ping, who's digitally-enhanced fight scenes intertwine with a hyper-stylised narrative that moves at a breakneck pace, designed solely for the short attention span of the MTV generation. The story takes us into the bleak apocalyptic future where the machines rule the earth, and what we believe to be the `real world' is merely a computer program designed to shield us from the horrid truth. Neo (Reeves) is said to be the 'chosen one' who can save the human race from its inevitable annihilation, but with a few Agents, traitors and lovers along the way, it's not going to be an easy quest. The Wachowski's state-of-the-art cinematic vision has very few flaws - although hardened martial arts fans may find the Keanu `I know kung fu' Reeves fight scenes a little hard to swallow - this is still inspiring theatre, revolutionary in its style and ever-so cool. Frankly, if you haven't seen this movie, you don't deserve to be here.","8"

I have to say that this was pretty good for an action movie. It had a rather original approach (although it's nothing new - the ideas HAVE already been there, although many people don't know or believe)and GREAT special effects. But it also has the same flaws as most action movies: flat characters (Neo is the only person we get to know at least a bit), a terribly boring last twenty or thirty minutes, which have no story and are just there to display more off the special effects (and even the bullettime gets boring after you've seen it once), and an absolutely stupid ending with Neo coming back to life after receiving a kiss by Trinity (OH PLEASE!!!). Anyway, I think this is nearly as good as an action movie can get, so see it if you have the chance.","9"

The direction was superb, the effects excellent (though sometimes bizarre), the plot was confusing but compulsively interesting, the acting was not too bad, and the whole thing rattled along at a breathtaking pace. It was only the third time I watched it that I noticed that it was based on possibly the most stupid idea for a movie ever made: an all-powerful computer that keeps people alive for the sole purpose of feeding off their bio-electricity! How could anyone believe that the world could possibly be taken over by a machine so stupid that it does not realise that it could get more electricity from one decent-sized power station, with about one-billionth the trouble? Full marks to the producers and director, however, for making the movie so exciting that I had to watch it three times before I noticed.","9"

Apparently everyone liked the Matrix... heck, apparently even Pauline Kael thought it was good. I thought it stank. There were two broad reasons I disliked the film. Firstly - it made absolutely no sense! I can't really go into details here without revealing too much... but watch the movie and pay attention... listen to what characters say and watch what happens - it makes *no* darned sense at all! Now I could have forgiven that, if it weren't for the second problem - The Matrix is unbelievably overbearing and pretentious! Everything about it is falsely heavy and pretentious - the art design, the direction, the acting (well... presumably because of the direction)... if I had to choose, I'd say the cinematography bugged me the most - vapid and overbearing in the extreme. Since the movie seems to be intent on hammering the audience into the ground with its own self-importance but makes no sense whatsoever... it really completely baffles me why so many people liked it. Now... if you want to see a worthwhile, intelligent movie on the same basic theme, see The Thirteenth Floor... a vastly superior film in almost every way (although it has far less in the way of gunshots, explosions and general noisiness).","10"

The opening scene is brilliant, setting the tone, pacing and rules for this universe. The ending is brilliant too, kept short and sweet. It wraps it up perfectly and satisfying. It is the perfect arc going from this scared boy barely willing to open his door to this beast (for lack of a better word) willing to take on all the agents. As alluded to, the action scenes are some of the best of all time. They create tension perfectly. At the end, Neo is basically a Mary Sue. However this feels earned due to the brilliant character arc and there being the feeling he can still lose outside of the matrix. The concept is genius and one is the best screenplay ideas ever. And for a little cherry on top, I'm pretty sure none of the actors had a body double for stunts or fights.","10"

This movie is the kind of movie that can be easily ruined, I suggest (if) you haven't seen it that you go see it. AFTER you've seen it, then come read these reviews. It's a great science fiction movie, good action sequences and a fantastic plot / concept which will (REALLY) blow you away (if it's not already spoilt)

I've had a hard time writing this review, retyped it 3 times now, but I've decided to go with that above. The only way I can do this movie the justice it deserves is to make sure others got the same experience out of it as me, I'd be sorely disapointed if someone else missed out because someone spoilt it for them. If you are as passionate about movies as myself you really will love this great film, so this is the best way of ensuring others do too. (good luck :) )

Do yourself a favour and see it, but read no more reviews if you haven't seen it yet and don't know much about it (hopefully) the movie will speak for itself.

Great storyline / concept Good action / effects (not that that's important - although often people think that's all this movie is about it's NOT there's a fantastic twist to the movie) Fairly good acting even from the often loathed Keanu Reaves (I don't mind him to be honest)

I'd honestly rate this an 8.5 / 10 (no movie deserves 10) For those of you who have had it ruined by other spoiler type reviews, you have my pity, you miss out on the jawdropping experience that is The Matrix. You have to see it to beleive it.","9"

A truly breakout performance for Mr Fishburne. His character shows emotional depth in his almost paternal care for his crew but also a greater sense of responsibility for those still trapped in a cerebral prison called, The Matrix. Laurence really explored and embraced the character known as, Morpheus. His instincts tell him it's too dangerous, but his deep, almost romantic, connection with Neo isn't something that can, nor should, be ignored. Morpheus can't express himself physically and is left in a mental prison of his own creation.

"ThatAnimeSnob","A wannabe philosopher with cool shades","19 March 2013","In its basic formula The Matrix is a more than typical teen adventure for all those who want to escape in a world where you can look cool, and gain superpowers, and fight a shady organization that enslaves the world, and get the girl. Throw in a convenient power up just for the sake of winning when everything feels lost and you have a cheesy fighting shonen anime to win the kid audience.

As cheesy as it is, it has a very high budget that makes all the above to look marvelous. It has famous actors, cool clothes, detailed machinery, attention to physics, and lots of cinematics such a slow motion, big explosions, and shrapnel falling all over the place. That is enough to win all those who seek fancy visuals and shallow entertainment.

It also has dozens of symbolisms and allusions to philosophy and religion that really make you think about the meaning of life, god, freedom, and all those existentialist stuff. That is enough to offer a superficial depth to win all the wannabe brainiacs.

Oh but wait, did I just call it superficial? Why yes I did; because it is. All the above elements are just fan service and despite all the attempts to make it intellectual, it fails in the longrun. And by longrun I mean the next movies which try to expand the concept, only to open more plot holes and inconsistencies as it goes on and on. By the time the final showdown took place in the third film, I just didn't care anymore about the outcome, and even the epilogue was disappointing.

Anyways, The Matrix is philosophical first, action second, and sci-fi third. There is a bit of everything in it to please anyone who doesn't try to think too much of how plausible are all the stuff that happen in it; in-logic or not. It managed to be something very few films managed to achieve over the years and it is a high recommendation. Could they have made it better? Sure; but the point was to have fun and think a bit and not to go kamikaze on hard-science.","9"
"oktech","So well done in the first 2/3rds, that the last third is forgiveable","22 July 2000","Why do people see the concepts of the story as metaphoric? How are they any less than real? Sure, a few visual and plot devices were used to represent a society being operated by a totalitarian remote, and that may constitute symbolism, but the principles are at work in the world around us every minute of every day. I am slightly concerned that this movie leads people to believe it was more a sci-fi story with a social commentary, than it was a simple observation of society and how it actually works.

The whole post-apocalyptic messiah story is more than a bit tired, it's on life support, but that detracted little from the movie for me - Keanu needs to be the chosen one, aw, let him pretend.

Where the movie disappointed was in its degeneration from a thoughtful and interesting and visually spiffy romp through the concerns of the oppressed masses into a string of Starsky and Hutch chase scenes climaxing in a hail of gunfire.

Is a yank movie somehow incomplete without that seemingly requisite ""only the NRA has the final solution to save the universe and that answer is limitless ammo"" message? Chucky ""God loves guns"" Heston must have creamed his jeans when he saw all the big bang-bangs.

If you can forgive the individualist-supremacy hammer that the end of the movie hits you in the face with, it's great.

Fortunately, I can suspend that disbelief just because of the quality of the story, concepts, observations and execution of everything =up to= the denouement. Watch it for the story.","4"
"Eviljomr","Cyberpunk kung fu at it's best","9 December 1999","The Wachowski brothers follow up their excellent neo-noir film Bound with this visually amazing cyberpunk action flick. I can't believe this is only the second movie these guys have made. The Wachowskis wisely retained several team members from Bound, including cinematographer Bill Pope, composer Don Davis, editor Zach Staenberg, and actor Joe Pantoliano (here in a smaller role than Bound). Keanu Reeves isn't as annoying as he tends to be, and pulls off his fight scenes surprisingly well. All the actors do, thanks to rigorous training by legendary Hong Kong action director Yuen Woo-Ping. I've always said that American action directors should take a lesson from their Hong Kong counterparts, possibly the best directors of action on the planet. Hugo Weaving is a great villain, I think the only other movies I've seen that he was involved with are Babe and the unfairly ignored Babe: Pig In The City (he did voice work for both, only briefly in the latter), but I'm already a fan.

The film takes it's story from many disparate elements, including crime films, cyberpunk fiction, Japanese anime, and kung fu movies, all of which are things I like. The stylistic influence of directors such as John Woo, Tsui Hark, Mamoru Oshii, and others are evident in many scenes.

The cinematography by Bill Pope is also excellent, as usual. Wheras Bound had a great film noir-style ""b&w in color"" look, everything in the Matrix seems to have a sickly green computerish color, as if everything is shot under fluorescent light.

In some ways, the story makes me think a lot of the story of Bound, both are about a journey to freedom, and the majority of the film being set either in the Nebuchanezzar or The Matrix reminds me of Bound being set mostly in two rooms. With only two films under their belts, the Wachowski brothers are already a major talent to watch for, I eagerly await their upcoming Matrix prequel and sequel (I wonder which is going to be made first).","8"
"MovieMusings","not original, but intriguing no less","23 March 2003","I commented previously, but had to add that this movie isn't all that original. Humans have been targets for annihilation/cultivation by all kinds of thingies (Body Snatchers, Terminator, etc...). Matrix takes a fresh angle, but it's not altogether purely original.

MINI SPOILERS AHEAD - Further, in terms of action and style, go and rent Blade and see for yourself that Matrix downright copies almost too much of the Blade screenplay, including and especially the big scene where they enter the building to rescue Morpheus (the black leather overcoats, the glasses, the gun play, etc...) And, let's not forget the most famous and copied Matrix thing - Neo's bullet-dodging moves are just frames spliced right out of the scene in Blade when Blade shoots at Frost and he dodges the bullets, in slow mo', leaning backwards...

I'm at a loss for explaining how Matrix got sooo much media coverage for these scenes and Blade got absolutely nothing...but if you watch Blade and then watch Matrix you'll probably also shake your head and wonder...

It'll be interesting to see if Matrix Reloaded is as good a sequel as Blade II was.","7"

For any who have pondered the enduring questions in life, this film is delightful. The fundamental issues of reality (metaphysical questions), knowledge and truth (epistemological questions) and a little bit of axiology are wrapped in a slick futuristic skin.

At the point Reeves' character is first introduced into the matrix, and has difficulty believing what is ""real,"" I asked the question out loud just as Lawrence asked it: ""what IS reality?""

I read the the writters insisted the actors read Similacra & Sumulation, that book Neo uses to hide his disks at the start.

It's very influential in terms of action scenes at least. That sequence when Neo ""wakes up"" in his real body for first time, those 40 to 60 seconds have to be one of the most memorable of any movie I have ever seen. It's dystopian, it's sick, it's twisted, it's amazing.

Not really into action movies, however the fighting scenes in this one are gripping and engaging. Maybe it's the premis of the entire story that makes them seem meaningfull and not some mindless battering. How could you not root for Neo, there is religious symbolism all over the prohecy that he is ""the One"". The man that bought the his program right at begining even calls him ""my own personal Jesus Christ''.

Of course your gonna break the vase if the people on the inside lead you to believe your purpose lay in its path. The Matrix makes a number of symbolic edifices through costume and screen-writing, which show the casual humanistic character verse the straight laced corporate image of the logical design of society, most probably government. Costume and screen-writing are obviously more associated with the actors. However props in this film seem to have keys of suggestion such as the vehicle with suicide doors and the magical predicted breaking vase in the presence of the oracle. Perhaps there is much to learn from the strum of a harp which is music to some actors ears and promises made by a benefactor of an actors trust. What sounds good through a promise based on trust may not materialize due to uncommon valor and a sense of duty. Thus Neo through his bond with Morpheus and quest for his true purpose with his abilities meets any opponent in the matrix with a veracity. Although the climax meets the plot the essence of Zionism through sociological development does not become fully embraced in my opinion. Or perhaps its the grasp around the public telephone and Neo's characteristic voice imprint at the finally that shows the marriage of society and humanity to the directors final intended vision of how the subliminal plot found between screen-writing and props are used throughout this film.","9"

I'm sure my 7 year old brother didn't understand it, yet he loved it. Why? Because you can just sit back and let the movie take you in. The dialogue and graphics and general feel. You just wanna go. ""Whoa.""","9"

"Aphex97","One of the best sci-fi movies of modern times...","14 June 2001","Question reality. Question everything. Its hard not to like a film that has this much attitude. Rarely does a big budget Hollywood movie send such a strong message about looking deeper into the world around oneself and thinking independently of the crowd. I saw this movie numerous times in the theater. One of the most interesting and original sci-fi premises of our modern technology driven time.

Excellent plot, dazzling stunts, top notch special effects, and great characters all combine to create a wonderful film. Sometimes the dialogue is rather weak, but this movie is so full of kinetic energy, you can't get bored with it. Fans of all genres should enjoy.

Final Rating: 8/10

This movie is proof. The Matrix is real, it's controllers have a movie making code that can bring humans the ultimate movie watching pleasure, and that they can travel back in time in order to enslave our minds with this WHOPPING MOVIE!!!

Which is more perfect?

The story? The Dialogue? The special effects? The action stunts? The ambiance? The acting? The love story that's so unbelievable it could only be believable here? Which is more perfect? my head could explode. . .

Speaking of head-exploding mystery. . . How did the people who made this movie make Matrix 2 and Matrix 3 so bad?

There are movies that are: too violent, too profane, too 'wrong', too sexual, too subversive, too decadent, but I've never seen a movie like this, Matrix is so powerful it boarders on needing to be banned for it's realism, something. Our psyches and intellects are too fragile for this.

"waledemz-62418","Matrix Tricks","23 June 2016","*Deeply exhales* The movie MATRIX was indeed a breaking point for movie makers, and it paved way for both marketers, producers, and film makers generally. The era at the time the MATRIX was released really needed something new and different, and this was what the MATRIX was able to deliver. With ground breaking still motions and effects, it was indeed a movie of the time. While being perfectly casted with Keanu Reeves playing NEO, and Carrie-Anne Moss playing Trinity, while leaving the boss himself in the middle of it all, Laurence Fishburne playing Morpheus. Their roles were imbibed in them as if it were their true nature and this really made a significant difference between the so called science and fiction.","9"
"sside2075","Fantastic","9 August 2002","The Matrix is a superb motion picture on many different levels. The thing that I like most about, which is probably unlike most people, is the plot. Sure the special effects are great, and were especially spellbinding when the movie originally came out, it is the plot that I like best. It makes you think. Although it's highly unlikely, the movie could very well be true. What we perceive as the real world might not be really real after all. It's very intriguing. Also I like how the movie deals with Neo's destiny. I love when character's have a great chosen destiny for them. This is a good movie and everyone should see it. bye.","9"
"rneil95","Whoa!","6 June 2008","I saw this movie a couple of years ago, when all I wanted was to see some people shoot each other and have my mind blown by state-of-the-art effects. I loved it. But, just yesterday, I watched it again. Finally, everything makes much more sense than before. I will be re-watching Reloaded and Revolutions as well, but this is where I'm at. I thought that Keanu Reeves played Neo, who is the only person who can stop the machines from killing the last human city. Laurence Fishburne plays Morpheus, the guy who explains everything about what the purpose of the Matrix is. Carrie-Anne Moss plays Trinity. She is the first character we meet, and starts this movie off with a bang. She's pretty cool. Now, Smith is played by Hugo Weaving, and is part of the Matrix's computer program. He is a cool villain, who is sadly underused. Hugo Weaving is cool and creepy and all around weird. I loved this movie, and I always will. I will always have it in my DVD collection and hope they come out with a 10th anniversary edition next year.","1"
"Neonsamurai","Almost as good as Iron Eagle","7 January 2005","Did this film rock or what?!?!?! Other than 'Iron Eagle' this is probably THE best film ever made! Better than 'Deep Rising' and certainly better than 'Prince of Tides' which it turns out is rubbish.

I really hope that what they say in the film about our reality being an illusion is true, because that would totally rock! I can just imagine it, all my convictions and fines disappearing because that was all thought up by some whacked-out X box or something. Actually I really do hope it's real because just look at my name: Neonsamurai. Got that? All right, now read it without the 'nsamurai'. That makes ME 'Neo' or 'The One'. Oh boy am I ever going to kick ass? You wait until the next time I see Derek Palmers! Backflip, punch, head-butt, uppercut! I've already got the cool name, I spend a lot of time on the Internet doing research and when I did have a job I was always late for work. Spooky eh? Plus, can you imagine Morpheus trying to rescue somebody else from the Matrix, such as Dr Stephen Hawking? I can't either. Firstly he hasn't got a cool name like me and secondly I bet he hasn't even watched 'The Matrix' once. I've seen it EIGHT times. You read that right, EIGHT times. Quick question: Hawking vs. me in a fight. Who'd win? Answer: Me! Even if it was a battle of minds, I'd probably still win. Or a game of snap.

What with me being 'The One' I'd probably make Famke Janssen my 'Trinity' as I'm pretty sure that in the battery farm where I'm stored, she's got the pod next to me. That's probably why we have such a close affinity with one another. In fact I'm pretty sure that on the other side of me would be a pod with Nicole Kidman in it, except her brain plugs DON'T WORK PROPERLY AND SHE DOESN'T RETURN MY CALLS! Well guess what Nicole, when I'm flying around beating up 'Agents' and dodging bullets don't expect me to come to your rescue if they try and read you mind with a couple of electric cables. You had your chance and you blew it. So long sister, you're baaaaaad news.

When I was in 'House of Fraiser' in Milton Keynes last week I decided it was time for me to get out of the Matrix and meet up with Morpheus, or whoever it is flying those hovercraft things around the sewers. Well let me tell you something; if you want to leave the Matrix don't try jumping through mirrors in a department store, particularly if the mirrors are in the ladies changing room, and you're being chased by security guards. When I got out of hospital that night I decided to do a search for 'Morpheus' on the Internet, but got bored and instead did more research on women's bodies.

Morpheus, if you're reading this then hurry up and post me a phone to my mum's house as I'm due in court next week on charges of indecent exposure and criminal damage in a department store.","10"
"tyler-20","The special effects don't carry this DOG...","2 May 1999","This was one of the worst movies I've ever seen. > Overall, the movie is a grotesque union of bad science fiction and bad philosophy. The writers decided to trot out that old ""what if a mad scientist had your brain in a jar..."" nonsense except this time it's a mad computer program and it's your whole body instead of just your brain. The director's view of Man's nature is one of a cross between a virus infecting the face of the Earth and a battery.

The special effects are well done, but aren't good enough to carry the rest of the film.

My recommendation is ""Don't waste your money"", I'm sure sorry I wasted mine.","10"

It's all up to you to choose. In the end, science fiction is actually about the proposition of life. Although the Wachowski brothers are already the Wachowski sisters, and the subsequent rise of Jupiter has received mixed praise and praise, it is no longer difficult to recover the classic of this film, but it is still one of the great directors in my mind!

The Matrix is basically the coating sealed across everyone's eyes that allows them to live a normal life and see normal things. But one man, Neo Anderson, is dragged into the real world, the place behind the Matrix, which is a prison chamber of life and death. The acting was simply impressive, and the effects blew me away.

The acting is very good from all three stars. Definitely a movie worth watching many times!","8"
"flipgirl38","There is no spoon.....","14 February 2002","Let me tell you, a movie like this is hard to come by these days. not only is this the best sci-fi movie ever, it as advanced as one of the greatest movies of all time. Before the Matrix, I thought of Keanu Reeves as a cute looking guy who couldn't act (except in Speed). But no. Instead, I see one of the most complex heroines of our generation. Neo, the One, comes to terms with who he must become. He is awakened after spending his whole life in a reality that isn't real. What is real? what isn't? He doesn't know, until at the end where things fall into place. Don't start watching this film thinking you'll get it the first time through. I had to watch it three times in order to fully understand the movie. And don't just watch the movie because of the special effects (although they too were fabulous). Watch it because of the plot, and the amazing performances by Carrie Ann Moss, Keanu Reeves, and Laurence Fishbourne. This is a movie that has something for everyone. Enjoy!

"Rosebud-39","An over-rated mess","2 May 1999","The Matrix is a mess of a movie, and it is all the more disappointing because it had some really good ideas. I am a big fan of Bound, and of the directors' visual style. Still, what was promised in the previews did not actually occur until 30 minutes before the end of the film.

The concept is intriguing, if not totally original. Half way through the film I kept saying to myself, ""When this becomes clear, it will be really neat."" Unfortunately, after it was over, I was still unclear about many things.

I know that a movie like this should be experienced, if not completely understood, but the experience was dark and the style was too late.

Still, I loved the flo-mo effects, and the visual effects were TERRIFIC. Not enough to carry a feature film, though.","10"

The good things about the movie is that the special effects are groundbreaking, the effects are original and unlike anything you've ever seen before in sf movies, the action sequences are stirring, storytelling is compelling and smartly constructed, it has brilliant ideas, strong human thinking and there is an awesome and completely believable central villain character (definitely putting him on my favorite movie villains list) and there are much more good things still. One thing however is that the Matrix lacks humor and I'm sure that a little dose of humor would have helped strengthen the script even more and make the Matrix even more memorable. Aside from that the film is perfect. My rating: 7.2/10","10"
"Jeremy-93","a neat if philosophically perverse technology demo","25 July 1999","There's something mighty peculiar about the message of this film. In many ways it's desperately conventional, old-fashioned and defensive, an anxious piece of hand-wringing over the new technologies which, as a piece of cinema, it milks for all they're worth. It's self-divided, fetishizing novelty, yet investing its narrative energy in the old faithfuls - shooting at people, hitting people, kicking people and (very, very occasionally) kissing people while wearing skintight leather.

We're battered again and again with the lesson that the real is everything, anyone who panders an attractive illusion to us is in league with a dehumanising, mechanistic future, and anyone who prefers to live in a luxurious fantasy world rather than the bleakest of bleak realities is about to open fire on some of your friends and unplug your remaining friends' life support. And yet (you can see where this is going!) the Wachowskis' film buys into fantasy and the technology that drives fantasy; it only really countenances the 'reality' our freedom-fighters are fighting for because it too is a wonderful, post-apocalyptic design statement. This movie *is* the Matrix, and there is nothing outside it, no reality for which the Matrix is an ideological cover - it is the world, all worlds.

The film looks like an attack on Hollywood's ideological power, but that's like the chairman of the Disney corporation walking around EuroDisney with a big placard saying 'Don't trust us, we stink. Stop me and buy one.'

And for a movie to attempt to enslave you imaginatively while feeding you the line that it's offering liberation from enslavement is about as hypocritical as we should expect from the Hollywood imagination factory. This is thematically so explicit that I can't help wondering if a radical self-critique is actually the point. But I don't think so, because at every technical level it radiates self-satisfaction.

As a *movie*, it's - how can I put this - at a certain level strangely dull. The problem is that it wants your admiration rather than your engagement; its interest is in showcasing the flair of its technologies, both computerised and human (the martial arts). So the last thing it wants is for you actually to get involved emotionally. And you sure as hell don't. Keanu Reeves is perfect casting for a film whose climax is the hero's ability to finish off the bad guy while appearing not particularly to notice.

The films that will come along riding the coat tails of 'The Matrix' (and there are going to be dozens) will fall terribly flat; 'The Matrix' itself doesn't, because there's a real visual and technical intensity, a passionate, purely aesthetic ambition, that the film-makers radiate. And you can be sure that all the sequels (official and unofficial) will ditch that as the first thing they do.","10"
"TheBillionthGuyNamedJack","Thought Provoking","28 April 2020","Most of the Matrix's performances are overall cliche, Keanu Reeves isn't rocked to the core when he learns he's living in a simulation. However, there was redemption beyond that point. The special effects are a bit dated, but they're still interesting. Hugo Weaving gives a cool and intimidating performance as Agent Smith. The characters, although not always sharp, stir interesting thoughts within the viewer's mind. The movie made me question the weight of their world and whether I would want to live in a monotone but safe lie or a bleak dangerous reality. Although dated, The Matrix, like it's world, has more than it seems.","8"

And i was so bored in the beginning... OK a nicely directed action movie... and after a while, it started to reveal me what i am about to see. I have watched this movie since then, more than 58 times. I am not joking. I really loved it. Do i want to watch this movie again? No. After 58 times, i can say that i am satisfied.

"Minocencia","Disappointingly Straightforward . . .","15 April 2022","A few points:

I braced myself for a plotline that would be hard to follow but was surprised to find this movie very straightforward. I do understand that this was very advanced for its time, but that doesn't mean I can't be disappointed with its simplicity.

I like the humans are a virus explanation.

The score was remarkably complex and thought out. Seriously, you should look into it.

The thrown-together romance is where this movie lost me. I know Neo and Trinity's romance developed further in the sequels, but it felt like it just came out of nowhere. Death, pain - oh, and also I'm in love with you and the Oracle totally spoke to me about it long before this moment.

I also recently discovered that we were possibly robbed of a trans experience allegory, so I am a little bitter.","10"
"panchodh_12","First XXI century movie","10 August 2014","1999 was an excellent year movie-wise. American Beauty, Fight club, The Green Mile, Being John Malkovich... all excellent movies. Now this is something different. This is not just a great movie, it also marks the end of the 20th century and the beginning of the 2000s decade. I mean, just how more 2000s does it get than Keanu Reeves in a black robe avoiding bullets?

The Matrix is a classic. It has already become a classic. From the red-and-blue pills scene to the ""I know kung fu"" quote (the decade's ""We'll always have Paris"" or ""I am your father"", if you allow me the exaggeration), going through Neo's awakening schene, this movie is already deeply embedded in popular culture. And it deserves to: it is beautifully shot, the story is very well-paced, it is entertaining and it does include enough elements potentially iconic (Morpheus' sunglasses, Agent Smith's accent...). But what makes this movie a classic, beyond anything else, is the issues it deals with. What makes a classic is its ""timeless quality"", as Wikipedia says. And for something to be timeless, it must relate to Humanity's core, those things that can be reach both me and someone who was born in 2 A.D.

Now something that every human can relate to is feelings. Love, pain, fear of death. Which is why most classics are love stories (just think of Romeo and Juliet). But this is not what The Matrix mainly brings about. What makes The Matrix a classic is that it deals with those big questions that have troubled philosophers (and people in general) since Socrates' times. I'm not gonna list all the philosophical issues in here because somebody has probably already done it, but let me quickly enumerate a few from the top of my mind: duality mind-body, evil genius dilemma, freedom as moral self-direction (I cannot set free somebody else but myself), man-machine relationship, Utopia, the issue of fate, the ""what makes a human being"" question (our own impulses according to Mouse), my freedom's interaction and interdependence with the subjectivities around me... If I was a philosophy teacher, I would totally screen this movie on the first day of classes.

Needless to say this is a must-see, specially that hour between the red pill and the plot's main complication, just before all the action starts. That part of the movie is worth watching three, four times, because it's not something you see everyday.","10"
"mhajs","A great sci-fi movie, that maybe almost matches Star Wars.","5 January 2006","**** out of ****

What a fantastic movie this one is! I'm so amazed at how the Wachowski Brothers were able to imagine such a creative science-fiction world like this one, probably the most fictitious, unbelievable, strange, yet, interesting futuristic world I've seen in a movie. Perhaps I became even more fascinated with this futuristic world than the computer-generated dream world that is the matrix. The way the story is told is simply brilliant! I can't believe this hasn't even been nominated for a ""best screenplay"" written directly for the screen award, but never mind.

For me, this might be the next Star Wars. Many will disagree with me, complaining that Star Wars is much more classic, but the Matrix is a huge achievement in science fiction film-making.

I really enjoy these post-apocalyptic movies where some kind of disaster has changed humankind's fate forever and now, it's up to them to fight in order to survive in a much more life-challenging world. In The Matrix, people now live miles and miles below the ground, near the earth's core, because the surface is all controlled by machines. Inventive, isn't it? The Matrix is the finest example of how good writing can really create worlds.","10"
"uhudsavascisi","What is reality?","18 August 2023","""Matrix,"" stands out as a 1999 sci-fi classic. The film portrays the struggle of the character Neo in a world dominated by technology, as he questions reality and strives for freedom. Its philosophical depth shines through questioning the distinction between reality and the virtual world, and delving into existential questions.

The film delivers a cinematic spectacle through its visual effects and action sequences. However, it could have focused more on character development and emotional connections. Some viewers might find that balancing deep philosophical themes with action scenes left the story somewhat superficial.

The philosophical themes are among the most striking aspects of ""Matrix."" Reality perception, human existence, free will, and control concepts are scrutinized throughout the film. Neo's questioning of reality provides the audience an opportunity to ponder over the nature of their own existence. Yet, some viewers might wish for these themes to be explored more profoundly.

Despite offering a visionary narrative ahead of its time, some technical shortcomings can be observed in the film. Particularly, heavy dialogues and the need for better character development could be pointed out as areas for improvement. Nevertheless, ""Matrix"" remains a groundbreaking work for its era, holding a significant place in the history of cinema.

In conclusion, ""Matrix"" stands as an iconic sci-fi film with its philosophical themes and visual allure. While it could have been more compelling with deeper character development and emotional bonds, ""Matrix"" still provides an unforgettable experience for both cinema enthusiasts and those intrigued by philosophical inquiries.","9"

OK, the special effects are maybe good, but what's the use of it when the story is as far beyond realism as you possibly can get? People that liked this movie have said that this could be the reality in 100-200 years from now on, and even earlier. Excuse me, but how stupid can you get? Nothing of it will even be reality in a billion years. It is impossible to ""fuck up"" brains like that.

To truly appeciate this movie,the only medium worth viewing it on outside a cinema would be a DVD.The DVD is a must for all fans since it provides insight into the making of a mega sci-fi movie.

I look forward to the sequels and I am sure that the Wachowski brothers will get back to work in their usual passionate way to produce trilogy- like episodes.

Lucas would have loved to have this movie to his name but for me Star Wars is still the benchmark against which all sci-fi productions must be measured by if only for the reason that it is a true trilogy.","1"

"Shecky J. O'Pootertoot","Hong Kong/American hybrid done right","7 July 2000","Have you noticed over the past decade or so a lot of American films have been trying to capture that Hong Kong feeling but rarely succeed? Why do most of them suck so bad? Could it be the crappy stories? No, HK films have plenty of those (sorry Mr. Woo). I think it's the American's inability to totally go for broke in the action scenes. The Matrix could have been made without a huge gun battle at the end, but what fun would that be? That was just the iceing on the cake (the cake being the terrific story cooked up by the Wachowski bros).

Okay, buy now we all know what an amazing film The Matrix is, so let me sprinkle a few of my thoughts about it here. Let's start with Keanu. In one of the most interesting reviews I read in praise of this film, someone dissected why Keanu Reeves was the perfect choice to star in this film. Now, if you're like me, you're not a huge Keanu Reeves fan. Matter of fact, before seeing it my opinion of the Matrix was, ""Looks cool. Too bad it's starring Keanu"". Well, he didn't bother a bit, in fact I rather enjoyed his performance in it. Before seeing it, the opinion of a wide variety of people was ""I do not buy Keanu Reeves as an action hero"". Well, that's exactly why he works. Walking in to the movie we don't believe he could be the chosen one of anything. Gradually, he starts to win us over and by the end, even the hard core Keanu haters are cheering him on. Why? Because he doesn't believe he's the chosen one either. We don't buy it and neither does his character, Neo (anagram, anyone?), Which makes his transformation at the end all the more powerful. Making him just right for this movie.

Now, a word to critics who disliked the film because it ""degenerated"" into a mindless shoot-em-up in the last half hour. Some saw this film as a thought provoking science fiction movie on par with Dark City and Blade Runner that lost its brains in the third act. Let's clarify something. THIS IS AN ACTION MOVIE. That is what this movie is, it just confuses some people because it actually has a story (a first for most summer action movie fans). How can we beg for summer action blockbusters that actually have a plot, and then chastise it when it finally comes along? Is that fair? Instead of thinking of it as a smart Sci-fi with unnecessary action scenes, think of it as an action film with a smart story. It's just that easy.

And lastly, it needs to be pointed out that the Matrix is a total rip-off of Grant Morrison's The Invisibles comic book. I know, you're thinking, ""Well, everything is ripped off of something and you can probably trace all stories back to the Holy Bible in some form or another"". Well, that what I thought until I actually saw the book myself. To sum up the book as Grant himself did once, The Invisibles is the story of a group of people dressed in leather led by a bald guy in sunglasses that's trying to make humanity see that the world they know is not the real world, all the while being hunted by a group of inhuman ""agents"" who don't want this to happen. Eerie coincidences, eh? No, not really. The Wachowskis are former comic writers themselves (I even have a few of the Hellraiser stories one of them did). They frequently collaborate with comic artists, recently on The Matrix web site and in the comic book handed out at the Matrix screenings ('till it got pulled), and some top comic artists designed machines used in the movie and did story boards for the film. Oh, and Warner Bros owns DC Comics, publisher of Grant's Invisibles comic. I smell a conspiracy, Agent Mulder. Because of the Matrix, Grant will never get an Invisibles movie made without comparisons being made to the Matrix, and his movie would be seen as a rip off of Matrix, instead of the other way around. Grant himself admits that he loves the movie, but I think he's through with DC saying something to the effect of, ""I won't be used as cheap source of ideas for Warner Bros movies"". He still hasn't received any aknowldgement for his part, and of coarse he hasn't recieved any money from it. It's a shame, really. Would Grant's Invisibles have made as good a film as the Matrix? I doubt it, but it would have been nice to see.

That said, I loved this movie. Can't wait for the sequel(s?). 10/10 stars. G'night!","10"

It has interesting good script and I think it should be nominalized at Oscar for the script. The ideea of this movie is amazing and original. I was so happy when I heared that it took four oscars ! Keanu Reeves play very good just like the other actors. I am so glad that they will make another Matrix. I hope it will take some other Oscars !","9"

"connor-macgregor","The Matrix Review","15 September 2013","Connor Macgregor Reviews...The Matrix

I have only seen The Matrix once and that was when i was about 10 or 11 and i had seen Matrix 2 first. I found Matrix 1 to be boring and drone on. But now i am 16 and with much more useful knowledge i am going to review it properly.

So if you haven't worked out the plot by now here it is in all its glory. Thomas A. Anderson is a man living two lives. By day he is an average computer programmer and by night a malevolent hacker known as Neo. Neo has always questioned his reality but the truth is far beyond his imagination. Neo finds himself targeted by the police when he is contacted by Morpheus, a legendary computer hacker branded a terrorist by the government. Morpheus awakens Neo to the real world, a ravaged wasteland where most of humanity have been captured by a race of machines which live off of their body heat and imprison their minds within an artificial reality known as the Matrix. As a rebel against the machines, Neo must return to the Matrix and confront the agents, super powerful computer programs devoted to snuffing out Neo and the entire human rebellion.

So as story and plot goes it is really cyberpunky and futuristic like. When i was watching it i felt like The Matrix was a Cyberpunk film with everyone wearing shades and leather jackets. It felt really futuristic. Nevertheless the plot was really good and kept me really on the edge of my seat. The Characters each had a different personality and fit into the story well.

Acting. Really well done. Keanu Reeves does his ""Hi I'm Keanu Reeves"" acting by standing,staring and blinking and people just go up and admire him like artwork. Lawrence Fishburne is ace as Morpheus and one of the best bad asses i have seen on the screen in a while. The others are mediocre but the star of the show goes to Hugo Weaving as Agent Smith. I love Smith as a baddie. Just his personality and presence on screen was a complete stand out from the crowd.

The action sequences were also original and impressive to watch,especially the final scene between Agent Smith and Neo. If you haven't seen the sequels then they have more in the future. The slow motion stuff is also well shot and well documented into the film. The Special Effects gave the film a personality in my eyes like no other film did before.

Overall what can i say. I enjoyed The Matrix now and i will certainly get my teeth into Matrix 2 and Matrix 3 (Which i haven't seen yet...except the ending)

Overall Rating - 67% - B - *** Stars","9"
"nunoaraujoduarte","movieinthepark.blogspot.com","9 November 2011","The Wachowski brothers are starting to gain their own space in the American Cinema. The Matrix was their first big hit. The first of this very successful trilogy incorporates one of the biggest moments of 1999 cinema has offered. Would you take the blue pill, or the red one? That applies to almost every second of our life, and whether you want it or not, choosing between the comfort of the easy way, keeping your mind away from the brutality of the cold knowledge or the opposite one. Easy to say, bloody hard to materialise. If you don't agree, you've taken the blue pill way to many times. Keanu Reeves is good, as Laurence Fishburne, Carrie-Anne Moss and Hugo Weaving. I won't analyse the fighting or the incredibly hot chick with amazing skills in fighting that we can presumes since the beginning that will end up in love with the main character, that was obviously included for selling, and obviously resulted. Apart from that, is amazing how you find out great deep thoughts in common movies such as The Matrix, and the pills scene is not the only one, the movie as a great connection with the last year Crhis Nolan hit Inception, as both ask what makes reality more real than everything else that we assume not to be. I don't agree very much Morpheus point of defining reality though, but the idea remains. 8/10","8"
"movielover1989","Best Sci-Fi-Action movie EVER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","9 December 2005","This comment may hold some spoilers

OK this movie rocked but I need to get some thing out, THe did not use bullet time first! besides that i personally loved this movie the fighting sequences were awesome and if you don't get it at first watch it again and you'll get it. Now they originally planned to make 3 but they put too much plot in this one and excluded the need for a sequel which is why the second and third one were just plain bad. spoiler!!!!!!

My favorite seen and i'm sure i'm not alone here but it's just before the helicopter when Neo sees the agent and yells out ""Trinity.....Help"" Bang the agent fires, neo twists the agent fires again and again and neo slowly dodges the bullets until his knees are completely bent then he gets shot and falls then the agent aims at neo and says ""Only Human"" then trinity puts her gun to his head ""Dodge this"" BANG the agent dies. THis movie may not be for everyone but I don't think I'm alone when i say

"MicheBel","The Matrix Has You","2 June 2000","I can't remember the last movie that I saw in the theatre seven times. I just couldn't get enough of The Matrix. Still can't (I just caught it again on cable). It's got everything: cool sci-fi techo storyline, a love story, lots of slam-bang action scenes, great martial arts, wonderful actors, visuals to die for, fabulous Chicago brothers who directed...In short, everything you could ask for in a movie.

But the best thing, for me, is how spiritual the movie really is. I'll never forget sitting in a huge packed theatre, with the entire audience SILENT, struggling to get the concepts being thrown at them between high kicks. There is a reason why this movie kicked Phantom Menace's butt at the Academy Awards this year. And it's not just because of the amazing visuals. It's because the STORY of The Matrix was everything we used to go to Star Wars for: the good guys winning, the connection with the Force, it's all there, and in a very 90s/new millennium way.

God, I just LOVED this movie! See it, if you haven't already.","10"
"Lunchbox-8","Beautiful film","17 January 2001","""The Matrix"" is one of the best Science Fiction movies of all time. It yields a great plot, characters, and action, as well as a theory about human existence and life as we know it and implies a warning about the control of Artificial Intelligence. This movie was released at the perfect time. When it was released in 1999, the world still was frightened of the Y2K problem, which might have become a problem related to the problem in ""The Matrix."" Also, Artificial Intelligence was (and still is) just arond the corner, frightening audiences world wide. The third reason that it's release was impeccably timed was that special effects allowed ""The Matrix"" to become more than a Sci-Fi/Drama, it became a Big Action/Sci-Fi film with a dramatic story.

The way this movie was filmed and directed really made the entire film worth-while to see. The special effects, though made in 1998-99, are still cutting edge. The camera angles actually show a bullets path as well as a way to rotate around a great fight scene in slow motion. The camera angles were just fabulous and turned ""The Matrix"" into an even better directed film than it already was. Another cool directorial attribute that made the film even better than it would have been was that most of the color blue, only in the Matrix not reality, was taken out to make the setting look dismal and show that the Matrix really was a repressive and depressing place.

Many questions are raised after seeing this movie. Although I can't reveal them now, I can tell you that this movie is worth seeing for maybe only this reason if you're not big on movies but you are big on philosophy. The directors created a wonderful picture that was beautifully directed and superbly acted. I can't say enough for this movie, it was just amazing. You could see this movie and enjoy it, but I know that you'll do more than that, you'll see this movie and be amazed.","8"
"kriskrister","Hey! It´s The Turner Diaries - the Movie!","3 March 2002","For starters, I´d like to say that there are lots of films out there that use special effects to make brutal killings look cool, and I have no problem whatsoever with that. In fact, nothing clears the head better than an hour or two of Arnold Schwarzenegger or Wesley Snipes killing baddies and shouting one-liners. As long as an action movie doesn´t take itself too seriously, nor do the audience have to. But the Matrix is one of those really dumb action movies that aren´t content with serving as eye candy. It desperatly wants to be Thought Provoking and Carry A Message. When you start analyzing that message, you almost get to belive that perhaps the Unabomber or Timothy McVeigh filled in as script doctors. Let´s review the facts, shall we (warning, spoilers down below, stop reading if you really want to be ""surprised"" by this film): After the initial action scenes, the movie gets rather boring while three important facts are established: 1: That even thou ""the Matrix"" is a simulation, nearly all the people in ""the Matrix"" are real people who think they live in the real world, except for a small select group of people who know The Truth.

2: That you cannot go from living in ""the Matrix"" to living in the real world without going though excrutiating amounts of fysiotherapy.

3: That if you get hurt and die in ""the Matrix"" you also die in the real world.

And after that those facts have been implemented over and over, the film goes on to show the heroes remorselessly shooting down and killing hordes of policemen, security guards and the occational homless person, ""real people"" who we have to persume are just performing their choirs and duties in what they belive to be the ""real world"". All this carnige is justified in the name of a Greater Cause, namely to ""liberate"" the inhabitants of the Matrix all at once, even though they will have no real chance of survival once liberated. Am I the only one that gets a bit distraught by this?

Oh, and in case you actually didn´t know, ""the Turner Diarys"" is a rather infamous old science fiction novel written by a nazi and treasured by white supremacists. It tells the ""heroic"" story of a little group of self-righteous fascist terroists who overthrow the American gouverment by instigating riots and killing all the evil FBI agents, among other things. Add a bit of trendy cyberspace mumbo jumbo and what have you got? You figure it out.","7"
"hukaiqun","Love it","31 March 2020","I read it used to be one of Tarantino's favourite ones too, but the second and third ones ruined the whole beautiful idea and brought the overall value of the movie pretty low.remembered quite a lot of the story watching it again in 2019 but this time I paid more attention to everything.","10"
"formicidae","Whoa.","18 July 2001","This movie really has it all, and even though that sounds like a bought and paid for testimonial that some crap movie would shell out for, it's the real deal with The Matrix.

It looks good: The Wachowski brothers continue their beautiful work (after Bound) to give The Matrix a visual richness that most directors today seem to ignore. Great angles that let you actually see what's happening, moody sets that really create an atmosphere even before anything is said, and well placed and utilized special effects that don't take over the theme are all examples of where these guys are coming from. I think they call it ""vision"" in directors. Whatever it is, the Wachowskis have it, and they don't just make movies, they craft them.

The characters are solid: Sure, hack on Keanu all you want, but he fits the role of Neo to a tee, and I can't think of anyone who would have been more convincing. (As convincing, sure, but no one moreso.) Fishburne, Pantoliano, Moss, and Weaving are subtley brilliant, playing up their characters without going over the top. There is not a wasted word of dialogue, and it is all delivered in just the right way. Delicious!

The Plot is as cool as Terminator, but with more philosophy: The Matrix actually makes you think, and while that is good in any movie, it is even more golden in an action-driven movie like this. Not only do we have to question the age old dilemma about what makes us exist (We are if we think we are? Would it be better to be a happy brain in a vat or a miserable person?), but we also get to play with the entire meaning of the Matrix itself. Personally, I think The Matrix is actually the mass media/materialistic society itself that has blinded us into being mere consumers. My metaphor has Neo discovering that the real world needs him to be more than some working stiff cog in the machine--it needs him to break out of the consumerist cloud we all walk in to become a modern day revolutionary. But that's just me. The movie works no matter what you read into it.

Finally, the special effects are special: I don't usually put much stock into effects. A movie that hypes tricks isn't usually much of a movie. The Matrix, however, really uses the effects to propel the plot and give the atmosphere some credibility. In other words, I don't think the movie was conceived to showcase some breakthrough techniques in cinematography, I think the story was there and they needed some good visuals to help tell it properly. There's a big difference.

When all is said and done, The Matrix is one of those movies that I can watch over and over again without getting bored, it is just so well done. I give it a perfect 10 without hesitation--I can't ask for anything more.","10"
"al_phillips2000","Revolutionary","4 January 2002","Simply one of the best action films of all time. Only Keanu Reeves mars this production. Good acting (besides Reeves), good dialog, good story, good effects, good combat scenes. You must see the DVD or Collector's Edition, which explains the bullet-time photography concept.

As far as the story and acting goes, it was on the right path, but far from perfect. The ideas were there, but the execution was a little off. If you're a fan of the sci-fi movies and love to see special effects, then i recommend that view this movie in the theaters, but if you're not really interested in these kinds of movies, then wait and save your money for when it comes out on video.","10"
"Zeyders","One of the iconic movies","24 January 2023","The Matrix - hardly anyone has not heard of this movie, or the stories that we live in the Matrix. A film that, in its time, raised a new bar for quality cinema, not only with its plot, but with everything else. The film is one of the main trilogy of Matrix films, but the film itself is closed from beginning to end. Subsequent parts are a continuation and reveal themes from the first part that play a big role.

The film uses excellent special effects for the time (and still looks relevant), memorable music, characters, fights, scenes and much more. The dialogues make sense, revealing the plot, unlike many movies.

However, no matter how excellent the movie was, it has its little flaws, in the form of dialogues at unnecessary times or people who are ""storm troopers from Star Wars"".

The movie is a must-see. This movie is one of the cult films that guarantees a great viewing experience.","8"
"devil_may_cry_ldk_dante_sparda","Don't make me laugh!","9 May 2003","I don't get how you can choose ""surfer boy"" Keanu Reeves to play Neo when somebody athletic like Van Damme could've played it. Also, Morpheus could've been portrayed by Michael Jai White! The story sounds pretty dumb but at least the action would've been better had either Van Damme or Daniels played the part of Neo and Jai White as Morpheus. It's just sad to see athletically under qualified actors playing roles that are clearly physically challenging!","7"
"R-P-McMurphy","One of the coolest movies of all time","15 August 2013","One of the coolest movies of all time, ""The Matrix"" has everything I could ask for in a movie. It has great action in it and thoughtful subtext that will keep you thinking after the movie ends.

The year is 1999... Or is it? It's actually closer to 2199 and humans are being controlled by machines, they have them stuck inside a program that simulates real life called ""The Matrix"" while they feed on them for energy. It's up to a group of people fighting the system and a new recruit, Neo (Keanu Reeves), to free the people from enslavement.

Director Darren Aronofsky thought that ""The Matrix"" redefined Sci-Fi movies, and I agree, what it did has yet to be matched by modern science fiction films that tend to lean towards visuals and give no importance towards action and fight choreography like what we can see here. The use of slow motion is perfect, it's used to highlight the action and give the viewer the feeling that he's right in the middle of it, unlike modern action movies with all the shaky cams.

The underlying themes it deals with are what makes it far superior than any other action or science fiction movies and leaves the audience with something to talk about. It deals with some of the same things Stanley Kubrick dealt with in ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" in the 60's, they're themes that are even more interesting now that we live in a society that depends on technology and for that it's a movie that's way far ahead of its time.

I'm not even going to mention the sequels, I see ""The Matrix"" as a stand-alone feature so I'm just going to ignore they even exist. As Quentin Tarantino said, the sequels ruined the mythology to it, I couldn't agree more, but I think that when you forget the sequels even happened it's a masterpiece.

It's hard to see how Hugo Weaving didn't get more recognition for his performance as Agent Smith, he plays one of the most terrifying villains of all time, his screen presence is always felt and the way he delivers his lines (specially when he says ""Mr. Anderson"") is something that would fit perfectly in a horror film.

If you haven't seen it yet, I'd recommend it to anyone it to anyone, specially whoever liked ""Wall-E"", ""Terminator 2: Judgement Day"", ""Inception"", ""Equilibrium"", ""Dark City"", ""The Wolverine"", ""Twelve Monkeys"", ""Minority Report"", ""Sin City"", and ""Looper"".","8"
"asiduodiego","Somewhat unoriginal, but a visual achievement","20 March 2011","Matrix was, in many ways, the minor ""Star Wars"" of the 90s: an unoriginal and arch-repeated story, but told and crafted in such a creative way, that it works!. The story of the ""chosen one"" in his path to discover his powers is older than graphite pencils, but, the visuals and the setting are impressive enough to makes us forget that and enjoy the ride. Keanu Reeves is a great choice for the role of ""Neo"", and the supporting cast is good enough also. The story is crafted as a mystery at the beginning, and then begins the classic ""hero's journey"". And, at the end (spoilers!), unsurprisingly, the character becomes a ""superhuman"", inside the Matrix and kills the bad dude: a nice closed loop, which doesn't leave much space for sequels, which is the main reason of why the following movies in the ""saga"" are just a shameful mess.

But, Matrix, as a stand-alone film, is very good. The only problems I can think of, are some issues with the acting (Carrie Ann Moss was somewhat dull), the over-pretentiousness of the plot: it took itself way too seriously, being as it was, just an unoriginal sci-fi collage, and the visual style grew old too fast, now a days the characters look dressed as a bunch of emo-kids. But, those are details and nitpicking. It's a good, intense and entertaining action flick. Check it out.

If you haven't rented any of the last year's sci-fi flicks (Lost in Space, Deep Impact, Godzilla, Armageddon), better do it now because after seeing The Matrix they'll look like s**t (Godzilla looks like it anyway, but...).

As any friend can attest, I see a lot of films. I have my own laser disc home theater. I haven't been tempted to see a film twice in the theater since... I think Speed, and that was on account of a girlfriend wanting to see it (no huge Keanu Reeves fan either). Before that I think was T2.

This isn't a review and don't read any comments that are. This sucker does have a story (if maybe a little too thick for older film critics to understand, same as their VCRs) that is spoiled by too much foreknowledge. The rest of its elements (design, cinematography, acting, visual & physical effects, sound, soundtrack, casting, editing, direction) were approached with an absolute love of craft. It might not be a film for all tastes, but for a film lover it is one of the tastiest surprises since John Woo/Hong Kong cinema.

"Starks","This Movie Lived Up to the Hype","11 May 1999","I saw the Matrix this past weekend and I was very impressed by it. While I have certainly seen better sci/fiction films and better action films, it was nice to see the two genres combined so nicely. I would rank it up there with Terminator and Alien (s). The story took a while to get going and there are also a few moments where you try to figure what Larry (whoops sorry, Laurence) Fishburne is talking about, but once everything gets on track it is a fun ride. My one complaint is that except for a few instances you never felt any empathy for the lead characters. In other action adventure films or sci fi flix you care if something happens to Luke Skywalker, or Ripley or Indiana Jones. In this you don't really care (at least I didn't) if Keanu or Larry kicked the bucket. A little more character development would have made me care a little more and would have put me on the edge of my seat. But it is still a fun movie, with some excellent effects and most importantly an interesting story that may make you run out and buy some philosophy books.","7"

"Skeptic459","There is no spoon...","25 December 2003","This of one of the many psuedo-philosophical statements that is uttered by one of the minor character's of the film. The Matrix is a geeky film. Everyone, especially Morpheus speak in semi-priest like ravings. His character is based on John the baptist, isn't it? Everyone has stupid computer geek like names, like Neo or Tank. It should be annoying and cringe inducing. Bringing up images of geeky computer nerd, teenage goths. You know, those ones that spend all their time listening to Skinny Puppy and quoting Nietzsche out of context. The ones that dress like Mortis the Depeche Mode goblin.

However despite all its faults this is an exceptional film. A film that when it came out was thrilling and innovative. This film made the 'Phantom Menace' look like what it is, a piece of crap. The Wachowski brothers have shown their influences to range from Jean Baudrillard, gnostic thought to Japanese anime such as 'Ghost in the Shell.' There is lots of stuff going on within the narrative and its refreshing to see an action film that has something of a brain. See Hollywood you can still make films with explosions and not always go for the lowest common denominator.

The problem was that it was so good that a sequel was inevitably doomed unless more innovative stuff was put into the film. Empire magazine wrote an article on the state of the art special effects that were used in 'Reloaded.' However it was the actual concepts that got people excited and the next film only offered some flimsy philosophical ideas on free will.

This film has been embraced by so many crusty academics and religious zealots who use this film to push their own ideologies. Everyone took this film way to seriously. I mean it's like 'Fight Club,' it is a thrilling ride but thats about it. Christians say that you free your mind by believing in a spiritual reality. Media professors state the matrix is a metaphor for the media, which controls attitudes and perceptions. Psychologists tell me that the matrix is a metaphor for the mind. All reality is perception, therefore when you change cognitions, you change your reality. Free your mind. There are other interpretations but you do you get my drift? The fact that it has got the attention of so many different kinds of intelligent people is a good example of why this is such a good film. It really grabs the imagination of the audience.

The film is competent. I'm not use to seeing competence in sci-fi films. I am still getting over 'The Shape of things to come.' However everyone does well here. One of my favourite characters is actually Morpheus who is very well played by Laurence Fishburne. He pulls off some pretty difficult dialogue convincingly. Keanu 'Whoa! I still can't act' Reeves even manages to be bearable. Carrie Ann Moss as Trinity is also quite good. I liked Cypher as Judas. But the man who steals the show is Hugo Weaving as Agent Smith. He is a bad guy that is unnervingly alike to my work and income case manager. I kept expecting him to look out from the screen and say 'Mr Skeptic, have you found work yet?' His camp demeanor is funny and effective and this is played on more in the sequel.

The imagery is also good and when Neo was being pursued by the bad guys I was reminded of Franz Kafka's 'The Trial.' The Matrix is a world that seems to look alot like downtown Sydney. The s&m tendencies of the directors seems to spill onto this film and everyone dresses like they are off to the 'torture garden.' The infamous s&m club. It certainly is not a way to keep a low profile. I think I would notice a whole bunch of people dressed in PVC with machine guns.

Despite these nigglings this movie is one hell of a ride. Even though it is a hive of geekdom. Recommended. I give it 8 depressed goths out of 10 existential computer nerds.","10"

"shabanavdulaj","A bit overrated.","20 May 2020","It really is thought provoking. They put a lot of thinking into this, I just wished they had put more effort into the writing.

Like Inception, first time watching it you're blown away by the concept, but when you get over the mind-blowing idea they came up for the story and start to point out what makes a great film, it's obvious that The Matrix doesn't has what it takes. The strongest point of this film is the plot. Without the plot this becomes one of the most generic and passable action flicks you can think of. Now we all know that the plot it's not what makes a great movie. In Richard Linklater's 'Everybody Wants Some' the plot almost doesn't exist. Let me describe what the movie is about, 'some guys passing a week before collage starts, hanging around'. You read that and you think, 'there's no chance I'll watch this movie, it sounds too boring'. But it isn't boring at the slightest. Unlike The Matrix, Everybody Wants Some it's written in such a rich way that it's impossible to get you bored. The Matrix doesn't has that. The Matrix relates on it's plot, on what people often call timeless VFX but I think they are beginning to look a bit old and that's that. There is absolutely nothing else in this film that I could point out as great.

Overall it is a good film. It's perfect to watch it with a bunch of friends and have a good time, but if you looking for great filmmaking, look elsewhere.","6"

"cherry-24904","Is the Reality We Accept the Real Reality or a False Reality We Can Handle?","18 March 2016","The film The Matrix is about the journey of Neo as he travels through the mundane life as a low level hacker and software developer of a large company into the only hero that can save suppressed humans from the ""real reality."" Neo's mentor Morpheus introduces Neo into the Matrix, which is the real reality of how the robots took over mankind and use their bodies as sustenance. Morpheus and his team, including Neo's eventual love interest Trinity, guide Neo and help him develop into ""The One"" that can save all. In essence, he is mankind's savior and the only one that can defeat the army of artificial intelligence. The theme in this popular film is the struggle of human dignity and the search for one's own purpose. In the beginning of the movie, we see Neo growing incredibly unsatisfied and bored by his daily routine. For a new scene, he follows his clients (who he recently retrieved hacking information for) into a club, where Trinity begins his journey of what his purpose is and what the true reality is. By mentors Morpheus and Trinity, Neo discovers that his entire life was nothing but a front to keep the humans alive, while the cyborgs continue to feed on them while also populating them only as a food source. Throughout the film, viewers can relate to the struggle of trying to find a sense of purpose. Many struggle through hurdles and may find others' expectations quite overwhelming. The theme that one can succeed and accomplish their purpose leaves moviegoers with a positive note and a can do attitude. One of the high points of the film that is easily forgotten is the point in which Morpheus has been kidnapped by the Agents and is slowly dying as they attempt to hack his brain for codes in order to track the freed humans. Just when we think Morpheus might breathe his last breath, Neo and Trinity arrive with a helicopter facing the opening of the exposed office in the high-rise building. Soon, bullets fly from both the Agents and the team of Trinity and Neo. In this shot, time appears to slow as we see rain fall slowly towards the office floor and we can see the bullet paths as a vacuum of air is created at such a high velocity. This is what makes The Matrix great. It created action scenes and breathed new life into them by changing the way the moviegoer sees it and forces them to focus on details that would be impossible to see at a normal speed frame. It creates a high appreciation for things that we normally would not pay attention to in a typical action scene. The talent of cinematographer Bill Pope is highlighted in scenes such as these, making The Matrix one of the best action films to date. There are two techniques which highlight the theme of the film and keep the story interesting in The Matrix are freeze frame (and slow motion) as well as camera angle. For a majority of The Matrix, the movie was filmed from an objective view and often at eye level. This view helps the moviegoer see the awesome graphics that may have been missed if filmed from a subjective view. For example, when Trinity is first cornered by the local police in the abandoned building, the viewer would likely assume that action is going to take place, but they are unsure of what. Based on many action movies of the past, one can assume it will involve a lot of rapid movement and somebody being hurt and killed, which nothing too surprising, especially at the beginning of the film. On the contrary, in the midst of Trinity fighting the officers, we suddenly see her frozen in mid- air with a kick flying toward and unfortunate officer's face. The camera circles Trinity as we see cops in mid action preparing to win the fight against the lone woman. However, as time assumes to normal speed, one sees Trinity fighting and the camera rapidly moving around her and her victims. From here, the film takes off in the action-plot film. Another example of cinematic effect would be the slow motion of the last fight as Neo fights Agent Smith. As Neo discovers he truly is the one, he seems to fight Agent Smith with overwhelming calm as the we view from a spectator angle the action that keeps us held to our seats. Neo fights slowly but tactfully in slow motion and ultimately defeating Agent Smith. These techniques help us pay attention to the detail of each action-packed scene, and reminds the moviegoer of Neo's purpose, which was defeating the agents. His journey reminds us that we all are searching for our purpose in life and must overcome barriers in order to find it. In conclusion, The Matrix is a great film to watch. The theme of human struggle to find one's own purpose is obvious and can be seen highlighted in the action points. Throughout each physical conflict, time is slowed and characters are frozen to see the detail of each battle. It gives the viewer time to think instead of forcing one to follow a fast motion scene, to focus on Neo's personal struggle to find his calling. The film is a little dated, but the techniques used to enhance the plot and the action make The Matrix a legend.","10"
"evandewangga97","I just can say, it is a hard-work of creativity","6 October 2013","I loved movie that has its own world. You know, like ""The Matrix"" that makes the audience open their mind and start to think of the idea of the movie. I like it, when amazing cinematography of action meets the ideology of science-fiction that unite as one of masterpiece in the end of 20th century.

Actually, I just watched this movie twice. First time I watched, I didn't get what 'Wachowskis' duo means. I mean this is a deep movie and you must pay more attention in its key-scene. And the second times I watched, yes it is a splendid movie I've ever watched. The new breakthrough of science- fiction and the door to visual effects of the new century.

Great movie!","7"
"Rid.X","More than just shootouts and eye candy.","8 June 1999","The sci-fi genre, save for a few entries (""Contact"", ""Pi"", and ""Gattaca"" come to mind), is becoming somewhat hollow. The advancement of digital effects technology has led to the creation of half-realized films that offer great visuals, but little more (see ""Godzilla"", ""Event Horizon"", ""Soldier"", ""Lost In Space"", or ""Wing Commander"" for recent examples.) The Wachowski Brothers, who wrote the tepid Stallone actioner ""Assassins"" and gained recognition with their brilliant 1996 crime thriller ""Bound"", return with ""The Matrix"", a rare mix of intelligence and movie magic.

The last time Keanu Reeves entered the realm of cyberpunk sci-fi was the weak offering, ""Johnny Mnemonic"". Here, as computer programmer Thomas Anderson/hacker Neo, he actually shines. ""Speed"" showed he had a flair for playing the action hero; the movie further proves it.

Reeves is matched by the ever-reliable Laurence Fishburne as Morpheus, who guides Neo as he begins to understand the nature of the matrix, and his reality in general. Carrie-Anne Moss is impressive as Trinity, a headstrong female who can more than hold her own.

It's the technical aspects of the film that have made it a blockbuster. From Bill Pope's cinematography, which incorporates a number of angles and effects, to the brilliantly-staged John Woo-inspired gun battles, to the fight chereography by Hong Kong fight master Woo-ping Yuen, to the eye-popping digital and visual effects, ""The Matrix"" has incredible eye candy that serves the plot, not vice versa.

In short, the film doesn't disappoint. Highly recommended.","9"
"Doc-134","A Great Beginning that Doesn't Pay Off in The End","5 April 1999","Most of the other comments that I have seen on ""The Matrix"" I see have focused on the technical aspects of the film. The technical aspects are prodigious, but I would like to spend some time discussing the philosophical issues behind the film. Philosophers have debated for years about 'reality'. One of the assumptions is that what is real' is what we are conscious of. This seems to be the view that the film takes. In the film Morpheus (Laurence Fishburne) tells Neo (Keanu Reeves) that if what is real is what we are conscious of, then it is true that the matrix does exist. The other view is that in the world there are certain realities that are indifferent to our perceptions. This argument, in my opinion, does not hold much water. We may want to think that there is a specific, fixed 'reality' because we as humans usually see things in a similar light. But, let's take the example of an animal such as a dog. Research has shown that dogs can only see in black and white. If this is true, then we can rightly assert that a dog's 'reality' is quite different from that of a human's. How are we to know which is the true 'reality'? We don't. A dog's reality is black and white and our reality is color. This however does not mean that what is real' is either of these; both are equally real in terms of the systems of perceptions of each being (dog and human). Dogs and people have different modes of perception, thus creating different perceptions of 'reality'. One may argue that there is no 'real' in the material sense of the word, as there has to be a mechanism of perception enabled by a sentient being for any notion of the 'real' to exist. In other words the 'real' cannot exist without 'perception'. I know these ideas are quite complex and the example that I have used isn't directly related to ""The Matrix"", but I think that this philosophical concept in general is explored, and thus what I have discussed is quite relevant.

Philosophical abstractions such as what I have described are fascinating, and are integral to the making of great science fiction film. The greatest science fiction films not only amaze us with their use of technology, they also have a deep understanding and care for the human condition, which according to a Marxist view is incompatible with technology. Many films of this genre present technology as a form of ideology propagated by a ruling class (the bourgeois). Technology is seen as a dehumanizing agent, and much of the great work in science fiction is done as a social commentary in reaction to rapid technological expansion. This response is present throughout the works of writers such as Philip K. Dick and William Gibson, both of whom have obviously influenced Larry and Andy Wachowski's script for ""The Matrix"". I see hints of ideas from films such as ""Dark City"", ""Blade Runner"", and ""Strange Days"" as well. This is not a negative thing though; the story of ""The Matrix"" is fairly original despite all of its influences from previous work.

There is a point where ""The Matrix"" falls short, however, and that is in its action sequences. The action sequences look spectacular, but when it comes down to it, they seem like they are inserted as nothing more than fillers where we could have been acquainted with new ideas. ""Dark City"" was a great science fiction film for many reasons, but one of them is the fact that it didn't overwhelm the audience with familiar shootouts (ie Die Hard films) and fight scenes (ie John Woo's Hong Kong action pictures). When the big action scene towards the finale of ""The Matrix"" occurs, it feels like the Wachowski brothers left the set leaving the direction to John Woo. John Woo loves to see action in slow motion, and trust me, there is plenty of that here. It all looks good, but it feels out of place, as though the producers must have stepped in and said that their had to be a big action sequence to draw upon a wider audience.

Overall, ""The Matrix"" was a good movie, but not a great one. The first half or two thirds of the film are spell-binding with its issues of reality', but it begins to fall apart towards the end, where action scenes take center stage and overwhelm the point of the story. In short, I wanted to see more emphasis on the philosophical roots of the story and less emphasis on adrenaline pumping action sequences. Good, original ideas can build up suspense and adrenaline too. ""Dark City"" and ""Blade Runner"" proved that to me.

"nufffairy","What is the Matrix?","29 November 2001","What is the Matrix? The question upon many people's lips, and on the side of a few buses in Melbourne, I can tell you. Well.I could tell you the answer to that question, but then I would have to kill you. You understand?

The Matrix, besides being abundant in awesome special effects (mainly computer generated) also has quite a fictional tale to tell. The story, without giving too much away, was very computer orientated, a little confusing if not paid attention to, fast moving and a little frightening to wrap your mind around. Unfortunately I don't think I can say much more without giving too much away. ""Oh, come on,"" you're going. No, sorry, I really can't.

This movie was shot in Sydney (so my friends tell me) and quite a few Aussie actors make appearances, including Hugo Weaving (Jurassic Park) and Matt Doran (ex-Home and Away). Keanu Reeves (even though I don't really think that much of him) was pretty good in the leading role and depicted his character as a type of enigma, probably leaving most of the audience to wonder if.right until the end.

After seeing this film and walking out of the theatre, I took a look around me and couldn't help but think, ""Is this real?"" Definitely one of those movies that leave you thinking, ""But, what if it's real?""

If you were pondering the thought of seeing this movie, I would definitely suggest that you see it in a large theatre, with a huge screen and surround sound (or whatever you call it), definitely adds to the atmosphere.

Trying to find the answer to what is the Matrix, he searches for Morpheus (Lawrence Fishburne) to find the answers. What he finds is beyond any. Neo finds out that the world he know is just a computer simulation. Morpheus frees Neo from the matrix and shows him that machines have taken over, and are using humans as an energy source. They keep us in line by keeping us in a virtual reality world known as the Matrix. Neo learns that he is the ONE and he can control the Matrix.

"BigDog-18","I'm in the minority","12 November 1999","I saw this film after hearing much hoopla and hype surrounding it's special effects. Always a fan of good Sci-Fi and well done special effects as well as a coherent plot and strong characters, I laid down my $. My first comment is that the special effects were outstanding. Extremly well done and (as opposed to some other films) an intricate part of the story. What was lacking was a coherent plot and strong characters. I was dissapointed that more explanation of the ""Matrix"" and it's reason for being were not explained in more detail. The movie is very dark and depressing. The scenes of Neo in some type of fetal-hybernation state with the tubes coming out of him were downright disturbing. Most of the actors give pretty standard performances and as usual, Keanu Reeves continues to underwhelm me with his ""Whoa"" style of acting. Quite frankly, I left the theater feeling uneasy and eager to see a bird, a green tree, people laughing, anything that would erase the depressing state the film put me in. Other films have moved me emotionally (Saving Private Ryan was gut wrenching to watch) but most always seem to end on a positive note or at least have me contemplating something positive. The Matrix had me grasping for the Zoloft. Action/Sci-Fi films need to get beyond their attempt at ""eye-candy"" entertainment and start providing something more substantial to leave us with. Thank goodness, George Lucas figured this out over 20 years ago with Star Wars.","6"
"peterafflek","Glimpse of the future","28 July 2022","Well I'm gonna review this film from the perspective of now so let's put it under the the test of the time which really shows the great from the weak

Is the matrix like the people claim deserves to be one of Hollywood icons or not?

Did the movie succeeded in passing the time test?

Does it deserve to continue in a 4th installment after all these years?

Well the answer is (yeah)

Note: I'm not talking about the special effects, CGI and sound mixing everything in the technical and technological side which revolutionized Hollywood and defined a new era isn't here in this review

Let's start with the story which is the main reason the films exist because I do believe filmmaking is the art of telling a story And here it's really deep so it raised the people expectations in receiving sci-fi movies and the whole movies in general

Did the wachowskis succeeded in telling this story?

Yeah, they did they invented a new approach they mixed depth and symbols with action and fun so at the same time you enjoy you learn and think it's simple beside using the colors and mixing them with awesome soundtracks which gave us perfect experience

But is everything is perfect?

No, it's to be blamed for the prospect of the Oracle which was useful in the philosophical side but it's meaningless in the story and for the lame sudden love story despite the chemistry between Carrie Anne moss and Keanu reeves and other plot holes and breaking rules they set in the needed time for the plot with lame excuses and neo's development is awful for sorry the character is icon just because Keanu reeves is beloved.

I hope I added or changed something in your opinions with this awful review pardon me I'm not a good speaker 😅","10"
"epsilon3","Brilliant - but will it last?","2 April 2002","As a huge Science Fiction fan, I really enjoyed The Matrix. When I first saw it I was blown away with many aspects of the film, notably the special effects, cinematography and the philosophical message contained within. I went out and bought it on VHS and have just gotten around to buying it on DVD along with the recently released companion DVD 'The Matrix Revisited.' As such, this review is a retrospective - it assumes you've seen the movie, although it does not contain spoilers.

As I said, The Matrix was truly ground breaking. As a fan of comic books in my youth, I immediately recognised the stylized characters and settings - it was a blast from start to finish. The Special effects were mind boggling - the slow motion scenes using the 'bullet time' effect were innovative and hadn't been seen before.

After repeated viewings, my opinions have changed slightly. No longer do the effects totally amaze me - we can see the bullet time effect on everything now from TV ads to comedy movies (e.g. Scary Movie.) This doesn't take anything away from the movie in itself, it just lessens the impact.

The cinematography looks as good as it did the first time I saw it and is truly the greatest thing about The Matrix. It's like the directors decided to ignore the rules of what you can do with a camera and just dreamed up angles and shots straight from a comic book where imagination is the only limit. Each time I watch it, I'm truly stunned by the sheer inventiveness of these guys - there are few films that come close.

As for the plot and messages within the movie - I'm sot so sure. The idea that we live in a construct and are slaves to the system isn't new - films such as 'They Live' or 'Solyent Green' (and many others) covered this ground a long time ago, although admittedly without the eye candy. The quasi religious message within the movie is interesting but ultimately feels gimmicky, as if it was put there in order that fanboys like myself can endlessly discuss it on usenet. Don't get me wrong - better we have hidden messages and philosophies than a straight 'kill everything in sight' action flick - but at times it felt like it was being self consciously clever.

And am I the only person who noticed the similarities between the plot and that of several 'Star Trek: The Next Generation' episodes? You know, the ones where Picard and the crew leave the holodeck and return to the Enterprise, only to find that they are in fact still in the holodeck and they've been fooled? Sure, a Star Trek episode doesn't compare in it's depth or scope, but still, it takes something away from the idea that The Matrix plot is innovative and new.

To finish, I must reiterate that this is a superb movie. However, my experiences with The Matrix tell me that special effects are seductive and can make the viewer feel as if a movie is better than it really is. There were times when I was enjoying them so much that I half believed Keanu Reeves could act, but after repeated viewings I took the red pill and woke up. Sure - the Matrix is excellent, but when the dust has settled and the effects aren't so stimulating - what do we have left? Stripped bare of eye candy - all we have is actors and plot. It should stand up on these merits alone, but does it? It's certainly a great film but an all time classic? I'm not sure, but I do know that I can't wait for the sequel - roll on The Matrix 2!!!","9"
"ferni-tierni","You ever get the feeling where you do not know if you are awake or still dreaming?","29 April 2020","The matrix... This movie is metaphorically and realistically attempting to, at all moments, inspire you to reach to new limits of your perception. It is inundated with symbolism of awakening, devotion, belief, convictions, spirituality, and perseverance. The movie starts with a mysterious and audacious character that should be feared by even brigades of policemen: Trinity (Carrie-Anne Moss). She immediately shows us why she is so special defying gravity and moving faster than any human ever could. The tension rises and we realize that this movie is gradually enticing us into a rabbit hole especially made for ourselves.

In comes NEO (Keanu Reeves) the hacker/software programmer that seems to be lost in its own alienation, an alienation that is a catalyst for Trinity and Morpheus (Laurence Fishburne) to allure him with spiritual, existential phrases of enlightenment. NEO is a metaphorical version of the viewer, and our dormant state where we are dictated and shaped by outside forces out of our control. The continuous message for NEO is believe, believe and you will have the ability to change anything within the matrix, within the viewer's world, know that you can do it.

Morpheus and Trinity are preparing NEO to contend against entities that have subjugated him for his entire life, powerful entities of conditioning, destruction, and alienation. These entities are the ""agents"" (Hugo Weaving). Programs especially designed to search and exterminate any anomaly within the system. The movie sends a powerful revolutionary message for viewers to believe that they can change events despite the overwhelming circumstances. The program of the ""jump"" is an interesting metaphor of taking a ""leap of faith"". The more they believe the less shackled humans are within the matrix.

You ever get the feeling where you do not know if you are awake or still dreaming? The movie also alludes repeatedly about altered states of consciousness. His intuition was the main tool for NEO to believe in Morpheus and Trinity. ""You are looking for an answer, but the answer will find you"" ""You know that here is something wrong with the world. You do not know exactly what it is, like a splinter in your mind, and it is driving you mad"": the movie targets the viewer's intuitions repeatedly with ambiguous statements that have existential answers and connotations.

The agents are a highlight in the movie. You do believe that they are robots, programmed to destroy. It is really interesting the calculated, reserved, amoral nature of their existence. Their expressions of dedication and feelings of disgust towards the world of humans makes them easy targets of hate for the viewer. The movie is full of characters with blind faith and convictions. They exist for change and construction instead of being blinded by fantasy and consumerism.

Cyper (Joe Pantoliano) is the inverted version of NEO. He is the antagonist within the real world; a self-serving, postmodernist, consumerist villain that will do anything to get another taste of bliss. He wants a new life where he can live happily in his ignorance of the matrix. He wants his knowledge about the reality erased and become someone important, where he can enjoy the pleasures of life in a way that is especially to his benefit. He is an interesting version of the alienated human that is so impacted by his loneliness that becomes addicted to the consumerist culture and belonging.

The oracle is one of the most complex and brilliant characters that I have seen in any movie. The fact that this character can predict, cause, track, manipulate chains of causality is a really massive mind-fame in the minds of people that believe in free will. The oracle perceives everything that exists in the present and the future. Every permutation of elements that can be arranged to change reality she perceives it, but not only that she also uses the idea of believing that one can make a change as a catalyst to modify the reality into something different: Absolutely brilliant.

The oracle directs NEO into the liberation of humans by placing him in circumstances where he has to risk his life for others. He believes that he can do it by placing him in a position where he pushes himself to the limit. Trinity's love in his dying moments is the eruption of all that energy of belief and sacrifice for others. He finally became the ""one"" and was able to defeat the agents.","10"
"88L71","A sensible guy (Agent Smith) vs. a haughty and selfish one (Neo)... I let you guess who could win in this lame world...","24 September 2002","While watching this movie the audience is supposed to join the position of Neo, the freedom fighter, the elected, the one, the saviour of human kind blablabla and his nice company... but, I mean, how the heck can you disagree with Agent Smith when he says: -- "" [...] Every mammal on this planet instinctively develops a natural equilibrium with the surrounding environment, but you humans do not. You move to an area, and you multiply, and multiply, until every natural resource is consumed. The only way you can survive is to spread to another area. There is another organism on this planet that follows the same pattern. A virus. Human beings are a disease, a cancer of this planet, you are a plague [...] "" --

Ok, you can be the typical egoistic/egocentric/selfish type of guy who thinks that humans have the right of exploiting everything just 'cause they can do it, but still you must admit that the (supposedly) bad-guy of the movie is speaking the truth there.

Then again he says: -- ""Did you know that the first Matrix was designed to be a perfect human world? Where none suffered, where everyone would be happy. It was a disaster. No one would accept the program. Entire crops were lost. Some believed we lacked the programming language to describe your perfect world. But I believe that, as a species, human beings define their reality through suffering and misery. The perfect world was a dream that your primitive cerebrum kept trying to wake up from. Which is why the Matrix was redesigned to this: the peak of your civilization."" --

I found myself smiling at this, have you ever noticed the way some ppl without any apparent reason to be unhappy invent some problems they actually have not, create some paranoia or exaggerate little things just to waste their time in troubles? Ha!Ha! More than once I heard somebody saying the world would be a boredom if everything was right, no thrill, no revolutionary ideals to spread, no fights, no enemies to crush... I see Agent Smith is right once again, human beings find their way to progress by taking how more distance is possible from nature, and sophisticating their tastes and needs, that's why the best Matrix is just a copy of one of ours (supposedly) more evolved civilizations, with all its faults.

I couldn't avoid to sympathize with Agent Smith, also because NEO is definitely an unpleasant character with all his self-complacency, haughtiness and conceit, urged and encouraged to this by his similarly unpleasant company. Are you thinking machines here are blameworthy for the way they use humans? At least they induce us in a realistic dream of a real life, we don't do the same with all the animals we grow jailed, we puff-up and then we slaughter for our pleasure. (PLEASURE, not survival, 'cause we don't need to eat meat to live, we just do it because we like it).

So, IMO this movie has a pretty stimulating plot filled with annoying Hollywood-type exaggerate action... all in all I rate it a 6½ out of 10, 'cause it's entertaining and offers some cues for a reflection.","9"

Myself, I'm torn between giving it a 9 or so out of 10 and a 5 out of 10 (I end up splitting the difference, as the movie is at least well above average). I first saw this one a couple years ago and was impressed by the effects as anyone but didn't think it good enough as a movie to merit repeat viewings.

Well, I happen to have a close family member with very good taste in movies for whom this movie rates #1 (somehow I expect this to change as the family member grows older), so I felt compelled to come back to this one to see what I didn't get. So I gave it as much leeway as I thought reasonable, and my thought as I was about 45 minutes in watching it through it again was, ""this is a heck of a movie."" The story really develops well and draws you in. It's the last half of the movie that, upon reflection, is a real let-down. You get the most amazing and memorable special effects in that last half, and, perhaps not coincidentally, the coherence and believability of the plot really breaks down.

I'll just touch upon one that seems to have a gaping hole in its logic (spoilers!): Humans are used for energy. Why humans, in particular, and why bother placating them with a virtual-reality life? Humans may be an energy source, but they ultimately need some outside source of energy, and where does it come from? No sun, remember. It seems that whatever energy source is available for humans to function as batteries -- and remember, batteries eventually run out without an outside source to fuel them -- could just as easily and directly be tapped by the machines who run the Matrix.

You raise questions like this, and the story falls apart or just looks too arbitrarily constructed. I would urge the viewers of this film to really ask themselves whether, as a work of CINEMA, this has enough strength as script/story to have lasting value. In 10 years, something with even more impressive special effects will come along. Lack of script/story quality cannot be covered up by flashiness and ""coolness"" forever. And I just don't see how this succeeds in terms of story. Sci-fi films can really suffer in this regard, though they really don't need to. My favorite film of all time (_2001: A Space Odyssey_) is science fiction, after all, and films like _Blade Runner_ carry immense weight today because of the intellectual value they bring, even when the special effects have become ""dated."" I think that a recent, similar film like _Dark City_ holds up better under scrutiny.

This one has enough entertainment value in it that I give it a hearty 7/10. Maybe it does belong in this site's top 250 (giving it a 7 would probably put it in *my* top 250), but certainly not in the top 40 or so. But will I come back to it again any time soon? I don't think so; the thing that most grips your mind is the special effects, but that's already in my head now. Ask yourself what movie from 1999, in 10 years, will stand out most. The one that wowed or was ""hip"" with audiences then, or something that could wow audiences 10 years from now? As much as it seems ""made for its time,"" I'll probably have to go with _Fight Club_ and a number of other films before this one. _The Matrix_ will likely have the same fate as _The Sixth Sense_: a big hit the time it came out, but more or less lost in the mix many years down the line.","6"
"Andrei-10","Good film, Great effects.","16 October 2001","What can I say, this really is a good film. From start to finish you're on the edge of the seat, the plot is surprisingly original (the TV adverts don't give away much). The opening scene is very good, an action packed scene with the mysterious Trinity and the equally mysterious ""Agents"". The whole film has this 90's conspiracy theory feel to it, the scene in the interogation room is a bit dark and intimedating, 1984 style. The scene where Neo meets Morpheus is also very atmospheric and dark. The effects are, well revolutionary, the use of bullet time photography is incredible I hope this technique is used more often in films, it really improved the fight scenes. Even without BT photography the fight scenes still look incredible, the govt. lobby scene to mention but a few. The plot is very good, without spoiling it its a kind of alternative reality type plot, the closest film that is similar that springs to mind is The 13th Floor but its only vaguely similar. There are however a few inconsistancies in the plot which reduce the credibility which is disappointing. But those aside its still a terrific film a must see for any action fan. 9/10.","9"

"blakartist2000","Matrix is an innovative movie because of its strong story not because of its inevitable outdated special effects.","29 December 2007","Matrix is an innovative movie as everyone knows but for me not because of its special effects and action scenes It had transcend most sci-fi action films because of its philosophy allowing oneself to know that you can take control of your life and not allow society to dictate ones existent if they're brave enough to see it and to work hard to achieve their goal. I enjoy watching movies like this when you have the option to except the entertaining value and also have the chose to be able to look deeper and gain some profound life perspective.

I enjoyed one specific scene, in which, Agent Smith (Hugo Weaving) is talking to captured Morpheus (Laurence Fishburne) and comparing humans to viruses I thought that was interesting when I first saw Matrix in 1999 If you look at today's situation with global warming I think Agent Smith did make a pretty good case.

The special effects in Matrix where the best at that time but for me I don't get caught up into special effects because it always get outdated but a good story never does. You can still enjoy movies like Amadeus, The Godfather and Schindler's List without worrying about how cheesy the special effects are on the screen but I feel that Matrix story is strong enough for a viewer to be more forgiving in the future. The last two Matrix movies unfortunate don't have this airtight story to holdup to future judgments because of little story and mostly mindless special effects","10"
"Flyer78","The Kurt Cobain of films","2 August 2009","The Wachowski Brothers first Matrix film is one of, if not THE most revolutionary film of all time. The special effects, CGI, story, every aspect of this film is something fresh and original, even today, ten years after it was originally released. To use an analogy, The Matrix is what I like to call the Kurt Cobain of films, as my review title says. Any fans of 90s rock music should understand my comparison.

That being said, if you are like me, you won't find this film to be anything truly special the first time you watch it. It's kind of like The Godfather, in a sense. The more times you view it, the more things you will pick up on and you realize that you missed so many things when you watched the movie the first time around. The first time I sat down and watched The Matrix, I finished it and said to myself- ""Okay, that was good. Great? Not so much."" Then, a couple months later, I watched the film for the second time. When I re-watched The Matrix, I came to realize how truly great it is. There were several things that I came to understand that I didn't understand when I first watched The Matrix.

The acting is excellent in all three Matrix films, but it was easily superior in this installment in the trilogy. Keanu Reeves plays Neo well, you simply have to love Laurence Fishburne in his role as the enigmatic Morpheus, Carrie-Anne Moss did well as Trinity, but the show was stolen by Hugo Weaving, who is completely AWESOME as Smith.

These films aren't for everyone. But if you are looking for something original and revolutionary, The Matrix is the way to go.","9"
"stallone-9","Back in 1999 they shocked us with originality.","18 March 2008","And originality means the Matrix.I remember seeing it back in 1999 with my dad and man we were blown away.Original concept mixed with superb acting,amazing visual effects,great fights and an intelligent villain unlike anyone before.Yeah agent Smith is awesome.By now you should know what the matrix is-a computer generated dream world built to keep humans harmless and living in denial.Neo is humanity's last hope for salvation and the leader Morpheus believes in him that he will set them free.The Washowski Bros show respect to Kubrick,Cameron and Scott and create an original and intriguing movie unlike anything before.After the disappointing sequels I appreciated this movie even more.Can't think of anyone who would have played a better Neo than Keanu Reeves.He gives all his heart and soul portraying a man insecure and without confidence in himself feeling the weight of the world on his shoulders.Laurence Fishburne is stunning also as his mentor who believes in him more than anything and is willing to sacrifice his own life to safe Neo's.Waking up from Wonderland is an emotional draining experience and the audience is sucked into the story which gets more and more interesting.The Matrix is undoubtedly one of the greatest action movies of all time.A modern classic.","7"
"ajax-kumar","So.. have you taken the blue pill or the red pill?","6 June 2020","One of the best Sci-Fi films ever made with a solid combination of good story line, great characters, jaw dropping action sequences and some amazing special effects. Even though it's only supposed to be a Sci-Fi, it does make you wonder what do we really know about life and reality. Also tells you that most of our limitations are in our mind and not around us.. so you come back with some good life lessons. A strong recommendation to watch.","10"
"james_norman1981","Jaw droppingly brilliant","15 September 2006","1999 had a great deal to go for it cinematically. Unfortunately, much of what we were all breathlessly looking forward to turned out to be more cold bath than hot stuff... case in point the first of the disastrously bad Star Wars prequels, the Phantom Menace, which apparently is the most successful Star Wars film ever...

However, one film did live up to its hype, perhaps because it wasn't rammed down our throats for months in advance with advertising, marketing and cults far in excess of anything seen before or since... That film was the Matrix. This is not to say that the Matrix was under budgeted. With funds in excess of $100 million it was an enormous gamble by Joel Silver, throwing Keanu Reeves into another Sci-Fi superhero role when the world had only recently recovered from Jonny Mnemonic. But the Wachowskis stood by their nth choice man and Silver stood by them as they tore around Sydney blowing up helicopters and generally misbehaving. No one knew anything about it. Most of the industry insiders, those who even knew about the Matrix, predicted a massive flop. They were wrong. The Matrix kicked ass!

Thanks to a brilliant advertising campaign, (remember asking yourself just what was the matrix!?!) the film opened to full houses and, more surprisingly, rave reviews which were completely justified. Using seemingly brand new effects, like bullet time, as well as the novel incorporation of tried and tested tools, such as wire work, the Matrix took what could have been your average superhero and made him a human being who was both fallible and liable to fail. At no point in the movie does the conclusion feel foregone and, with the brilliant twist around Cypher, there is a real sense that Neo mightn't succeed... and when he does it all the more enthralling because of it.

Credit for all this lies with the Wachowskis, who seemed to have every single moment planned out to perfection before filming. Similarly Reeves deserves praise, for taking advantage of his perceived weaknesses as an actor to create the Anderson/Neo character. Lawrence Fishburne is also great, delivering a performance perfectly balanced between seriousness and pantomime, while Carrie-Anne Moss' Trinity provides much of the soul of the Matrix, especially given that she's no damsel in distress. Of the remaining actors both Weaving and Pantoliano deserve much praise for their roles as bad guys, the latter doing remarkably well to make as odious a character as Cypher three dimensional while Agent Smith has to be the coolest villain since Darth Vader. Finally we shouldn't neglect Joel Silver in all this. Producer of what must have seemed like the biggest loss maker since Waterworld, Silver instead gave us one of the best films of the 1990's and a movie that will continue to excite future generations of action fans. His courage in bringing the Matrix to our screens should not be forgotten, although the missteps made with the sequels are not entirely forgivable.

All in all the Matrix represents the culmination of a great deal of work and thought that, should any of the principle people involved have not believed in it 100%, we would probably have never even seen, let alone enjoyed. The film is second to none for juxtaposing philosophy with martial arts, but drives across its messages about Mankind's over reliance on technology without making the audience uncomfortable at being preached to. Overall there is very little that can be held against this movie and, despite the rather debatable suggestion that violence can be the answer, it works well for the younger and older crowds alike. If you haven't seen it then I cannot recommend it enough, but that is unlikely to be the case for many of you!","3"
"mariammansuryan","Um... Yeah. Idk.","31 August 2018","The first time I saw this film it was truly impressive. Now I'm feeling a sort of a star wars vibe when I see it again. The production is awesome and I love the biblical allusions. But at the same time the film is so Hollywood. It is really predictable to begin with. I also hate movies where there is a ""chosen one"" - just not my thing. At times really cheesy, especially the coding guy's lines.

There were cool effects no doubt. Even a couple funny parts, like when they go up the elevator and the wall collapses. There was a dynamic and the film surely didn't bore, but it was just so Hollywood...","10"
"Hinopio","AMAZING","27 April 1999","This movie was excellent. I was blown away by the effects and the plot. The actors were top notch, even Keanu. I think this is one of the three roles I thought he was good in, the other two being his role in the Devil's Advocate and his role of a stoner in Love You to Death. Lawrence Fishburne finally gets a role he deserves, I think he's underappreciated in his roles. So he's kinda got bad teeth, so did Austin Powers. Trinity was YUMMY and the villains were evil. The fighting scenes were really cool.","9"
"dover","Good, not great","19 October 1999","Clearly, some people disagree with me, but while this movie was certainly entertaining, I didn't think it was great. It had it's moments, but all in all, I've seen better movies.

The one thing all my friends kept telling me: ""The Matrix has a great plot"" I think it's a sign of the kind of brainless movies being released this days that when any movie with a sniffing of a plot comes out, people automatically take it for the next ""Godfather"". The same thing happened with ""The Sixth Sense"". The plot here is passable, but far from excellent.

There are two parts of this movie that were really excellent. Once is the mind-bending special effects, which were extremely well-done. The other is Laurence Fishburne, who is at his best as ""Morpheus"", the leader of this rag-tag group. Keanu Reeves does his best no to overact the part, but it's really Fishburne that stand out.

Would I recommend it? Sure. Is it the greatest thing I've ever seen? Not by a long, long shot.","2"

It's the perfect combination of The Fifth Element, and one of those old nature documentaries with the flower blooming in sped-up motion. Rent it today!!!!","7"
"mr composer","Exactly what I expected..","21 June 2001","I couldn't believe, in going through the first page of user comments, how many negative reviews I read on this movie. How did so many of you not like this movie and yet, as a group, choose it as #30 of all-time!?

Second, what is it with all of the complaints of plot holes, acting, and screenplay? Come on people, were you honestly expecting Casablanca? Would you ever watch a movie starring Keanu Reeves and expect it to top ""Speed"" on an intellecual level?

I get the feeling that so many users on this site don't know how to throughly enjoy a movie just because it is fun. It has to be ""intelligent"" or ""original."" Otherwise it's a waste of your time.

Ok, now that I've vented a bit, let me say what I thought of the movie. It was what I expected to see.. a highly entertaining movie in the style of a video game. The acting was not bad, and I thought Keanu Reeves was far from ""terrible"", as one reviewer put it. Let no one think that he was even close to being robbed on oscar night, but his acting was the best I've seen from him thus far.

And let's not forget a wonderful aspect of this film... Don Davis's score. Don Davis has been contributing with great orchestrations for other people's scores for some time.. including James Horner. But he is a highly sophisticated composer with great technique. It is great that he is finally getting an opportunity to be behind the composer's wheel.

Now the most attacked part of this movie is the plausibility of it. Hey, there is much of it that I found unbelieveable. But I didn't find this distracting. Every now and then, it's good to just enjoy a movie for the entertainment value, which is what this movie is about. It's not what I'd call a ""brainless"" action flick. But I couldn't imagine why anybody would go in to this movie expecting a whole lot more. Just have fun, and don't analyze it to death.","3"
"Jolie","Indescribable","2 October 1999","I honestly do not know where to begin. I found ""The Matrix"" to be simultaneously mind-altering, exhilarating, gasp-inducing, nauseating and maddening. Yet I believe that the true power of the film lies in its ability to make the viewer truly believe in the power of the Matrix. As I watched the film, I lost myself in the world of the 21st century. Yet the most chilling part of the film was the concept that machines could overrun the world. The concept of artificial intelligence with emotions and needs was addressed well in ""2001: A Space Odyssey,"" but this film goes far beyond HAL. The idea of artificial intelligence considering us to be zoo animals, and accusing us of exhausting supplies-since when is artificial intelligence a natural commodity? Since when do computers deserve the earth more than humans? And since when did people lose all worth? I truly wanted to attack Agent Smith as he hurled these depraved comments at Morpheus.

On a lighter note, I loved all of the little allusions in the film. Obviously, ""Follow the White Rabbit"" came from ""Alice in Wonderland,"" and Morpheus' comment about tumbling down the hole followed in the same vein. There was also a great deal of Biblical imagery. Neo was like a present day Jesus. There were also numerous references to religion, including Trinity's name, Adam Road, and the idea that he was THE ONE to save humanity. You could also consider Cypher a type of Judas, who would betray his friends for riches. Yet I also saw a bit of the X-Files in this film, with the theme of conspiracy; Star Wars, with Morpheus as a sort of Jedi master (""Don't think about it, do it."") and Neo as a sort of Luke Skywalker. Even Morpheus' comment had a Yoda-like feel about it.

I think that the film took great pains to demonstrate the values of humanity, and the price they put on life. The artificial intelligence was a sharp contrast. Although Smith confides that he too wants to be free, he hates humanity. Neo and friends aim to preserve life. We hold a higher value on life than battery fluid. The idea of infants ingesting the fluid of the deceased also made me nauseous. Soylent green as a liquid. Fun. Yet despite all of the nauseating blood, vomit and liquid people, I was simply blown away by this film. It challenged my entire viewpoint on life, challenging me to consider the idea that life is but a dream......It was a fine effort, and I hope that the 2 window-washing brothers come up with another provocative film.","10"

"leandros","quite good indeed... but still disappointing","16 September 1999","Yes, one has to admit, The Matrix is maybe ""the"" representative of the new-millenial hype-action movie. It is a well acted, well directed, well ""designed"", and obviously well thought movie. There should be no doubt that the action movies of the 2000s will more or less look like, feel like, sound like and be flashy like The Matrix, IF the producers have enough money as the Wachowsky brothers.

So what's disappointing? Everyone left the theater feeling dizzy and confused, having conversations over their personal pseudo-lives and the ambivalence and vagueness of their perceptions of reality. Keanu Reeves as Neo and Laurence Fishburne as Morpheus dazzled the audience with their superb acting. Carrie-Anne Moss became every guy's dream date (watch the Jiu-Jitsu moves!). But.... but The Matrix is so close to being just the pumped-up, pretentious, expensive, star packed candidate of the ""Kafkaesque Action Movie of the New Millenium"", thanks to Dark City. It was so frustrating not hearing anyone mention this romantic prototype of the parallel world/deceived citizens plot. And, oh! That absolutely cliché, and almost stupid ending with that mindless and laughable monologue! Now that would be more suitable with a 70s low-budget space adventure.

Yes, one must confess that The Matrix is truly and certainly good. It is indeed mind and eye boggling. But, it is not *the* movie after all. For a refreshing retrospective, Dark City by Alex Proyas and Bound by the Wachowsky brothers is strongly recommended.","10"
"DavidGTaylor","What IS the Matrix?","25 November 2003","I'll tell you what it is. It's the most over-rated sci-fi film in recent history. Sure it's got some good ideas regarding reality and existence, but lots of ideas are seemingly forgotten in favor of fight scenes and special effects. There's also the poor writing (ex. ""You can't die, I love you!"" - Trinity), and the stupid leather-and-sunglasses thing, the whole ""motley crew of survivors"" stuff. The last thing reminded me too much of Alien Resurrection (another horrible movie).

My God. This movie could've been SO much better.","9"
"J. Ryan","Myth Meets Might in the Action Film of the Year","5 April 1999","I was impressed. My roommate and I, at the time performing air-Ju-Jit-Zu, came home from the Matrix trying to run perpendicular to the ground. I'm sure if we lived close to a gun range (not really that readily available in New York City), we would have insisted on target practice while wearing sunglasses and trenchcoats.

That being said, the Matrix may fete the testosterone of adolescent teens and immature yuppies, but one can actually find layers of irony and myth in this speciously skin deep sci-fi flick.

First, consider the whole premise of the film, evil supercomputers enslave humanity through an algorithmically generated world known as the Matrix. What appears real, is unreal with the very nature of existence challenged - kind of like Descartes' all-powerful monster theory to debunk the reliability of his senses and therefore existence itself. Then we have a rag tag band of rebels led by a mysterious but unquestionably faithful Morpheus (Fishburne), the god of dreams in Ovid's Metamorphoses, who awakens enslaved humans from their captivity of sleep. Our hero, Thomas (Reaves), like the Biblical Doubting Thomas, is leery of his fate as the chosen One. He is prophesized by the Oracle -- yes, like the one at Delphi -- to lead humans to freedom and see the rise of the last remaining human colony, Zion. Our plucky heroes are aided by the stunningly gorgeous Trinity (Moss) travel on a beat up space craft ironically named Nebuchadnezzar, a Babylonian king who destroyed Jerusalem and took kings and nobles captive in the Babylonian Captivity. Wow! Confused, yet?

But, have no fear. For those who like myth as much as income tax, there is also, Hong Kong-style Kung-Fu, slick fashion, lots of guns, and a pulsating soundtrack that features Marilyn Manson. Eclectic does not even begin to describe the Matrix.

The acting is competent, and with the bevy of special effects it becomes difficult to notice. Keanu Reaves is surprisingly competent, but then again he is supported by the always majestic Larry Fishburne, and beautiful newcomer Carry Ann Moss. With so many themes addressed by the Wachowski brothers, the Matrix could have easily over-committed itself. Luckily, with some incredible editing, this film has all the earmarks of a runaway box-office hit. I hope it makes a bundle.","10"
"mezzb","Don't be fooled","27 September 1999","The hype from this movie was huge. From its surprisingly huge box office to internet fan sites, to constant gushing by friends and relatives, I thought this was a can't-miss.

For me, it missed.

1. They give away the essential secret/premise very early on (there are other revelations of course, but the whole matrix thing gets exposed very early). I thought it would've worked better to keep it mysterious to bouy the next complaint.

2. It dragged in the middle. Big time. Practically nothing happens. no tension. nothing. A bunch of dialog explaining ""the rules"". If they held onto the mystery a little longer, that could have kept this dead part a bit more interesting. During this 70 minute dead spot, all I could think of was how I had to go to the bathroom.

3. Even with all that explaining, it still gets a little confusing, and there were many questions to be asked of the writer, along the lines of ""Why didn't they just <insert more logical action here> instead of <doing what they actually did>?"" The answer was ""To serve the story, not logic.""

4. The last 20-30 minutes of this movie really rock. I think this explains why so many are ga-ga over this film. It just rips out of its sleepy middle and smokes right through to the credits. I (and many others) liked Episode One for the same reason - it leaves you breathless, forgetting that most of the movie was pretty tired.

But the difference between ep one and this (and why I liked ep one better) is they broke up the middle with a pod race. Here there's nothing like that.","8"

We have all, at some point, had that question in our minds, ""Is this really happening?"" We have questioned reality during the worst of times, we have felt like the moment is unreal during the best of times, but after watching The Matrix, people started to question every moment in their lives.

And even more so, the question of whether if given the choice we would continue to leave this possibly fake reality, and wake in our true reality, we would actually take that pill...Not really something that can be taken lightly.

The cast was an top form, each bringing a level of emotion fit for the character, standing out from the crowd was Laurence Fishburne, who's energy when addressing the crowds was hair-raising, his belief in Neo was inspiring, he made people take a good look at what it meant to have true conviction.

But for anyone in the higher social classes this plot is not original. Many say this is the first time they have heard of any idea so original...what we see is false, and there is another underlying world. For me, the plot seemed simply like a modern, popular culture-injected remake of Plato's ""The Allegory of the Cave."" Now that is genius. That is original. ""Guns. Lots of guns"" (A quote by Keanu Reeves from ""The Matrix"") is not original, it's moronic and ignorant. Again, this is a perfect example of how this film was aimed at morons and teenagers. Its only goal was box office profit. The film was loaded with trench coats, bullets, guns, and a hideous script (at times the dialogue was so bad I felt embarrassed watching it), but used all these elements to no purpose...the film had no significance. Where ""The Matrix"" failed and a film like ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"" triumphed was the only thing a movie like ""The Matrix"" has going for it--action. In Crouching Tiger, the fighting is beautiful, wonderfully choreographed, and visually peaceful. The fighting in the matrix is yes, visually stunning, but only because of special effects. Yes, Crouching Tiger used computers, but succeeded in doing so. It used computers to better the film, to make the fighting look like moving art, not to simply support violence and the NRA simultaneously. I think that the acting in ""The Matrix"" was as good as possible based on the script, but that isn't saying much. The film is incredible entertainment, but seemed hollow--when it was finished I didn't feel enlightened or like my life had changed, I only felt like I had made good use of $10 and a few hours at the movies. Like I said, I believe that the Matrix was an incredible action film and fabulous entertainment, but that's about it.","10"
"shawny11_2001","Average Film","4 July 2002","The action sequences are good, but the acting (minus Lawrence Fishburne) isn't that good at all. Keanu Reeves does his best with ""Whoa"", just like his Bill and Ted days. Catherine Moss isn't much to write home about, but she does have some good acting bits. The rest of the cast isn't much. Hugo Weaving gets tiresome as Agent Smith, but his little talk to Morpheus is very well done.

Action sequences...are actually something to write home about. The bullet-time effect is not as spectacular as everyone makes it out to be, but it was quite refreshing to see a different style of slow-motion. The fight between Morpheus and Neo is spectacularly done. The last fight though is delivered poorly. The set-up to that scene is one of the funniest scenes in the entire movie, and funnier because it wasn't intentionally made to be funny. Or when Neo ""dusts"" himself off...that's quite amusing as well.

Major fans of this kind of science fiction will praise the movie with glory it doesn't deserve. Casual fans of this kind of science fiction will do the same. Those who loved ""Blade Runner"" and ""Total Recall"" may see this flick as a total rehash of the past 20 years of science fiction (both good and bad). 7 out of 10.","8"

"scottand","vastly overrated","7 November 2002","One of the most overrated movies of all time. This movie actually started to look dated as I was watching it. I rushed out to see this after hearing a few coworkers RAVE about it. It was the first movie I'd ever seen on the big screen that I almost fell asleep on. I went with a friend and he wasn't impressed either. Later I kept coming back to TOTAL RECALL (another film I didn't like) while trying to figure out why I didn't like this movie. Then I realized that it was pretty much a rehash of TOTAL RECALL;everything from the guy living a ""false"" life, the band of ""revolutionaries', the turncoat and even a psychic. Both films devolved into alot of shooting and the director of THE MATRIX also had the annoying and unfortunate habit of shooting alot of action sequences in slow motion. Nothing robs an action flick of its momentum and visceral kick like slow motion. I also found it baffling that people were making such a big deal about the ""stop and rotate"" photography where a character will for instance jump up in the air and ""freeze"" as though he's in a two dimenisional photograph but then have the camera orbit around him in three dimensional space. I remember seeing this done in a music video YEARS before THE MATRIX came out.

And those three ""men in black""-type guys-what was up with them? I don't know how long it took me before I realized that I was supposed to be taking these guys seriously. The three of them together could not muster a thimbles worth of menace. They just looked goofy with the way they'd show up in a scene and look around SO SERIOUSLY.

Finally, I started to realize at some point that the task at hand for our heroes could not possibly be achieved in the time that remained so there was a lack of suspense that I only became fully aware of after I'd left the theatre. There was simply nowhere for this film to go except Sequel/Franchise Land and my interest would not survive the trip.","10"

Aesthetically pleasing, sure, the Wachowskis have always been great tacticians of their filmmaking endeavors (hello, has anyone here seen Jupiter Ascending)! Historically important, I would say the film was lightning in a bottle and had more nuisances in its favor than other internet movies (ala Hackers). Culturally significant: It astounds me that zoomers believe in a Metaverse, millennials believe in cryptocurrency as a legitimate investment, and GenX thinks we live in a simulation while my boomer dad thinks I need to get off my lazy butt and help him shovel the snow off our 43 acres of land!

"jeffchan","Mildly entertaining, not great","29 December 1999","The Matrix has excellent special effects, ok if exaggerated action scenes, mixed acting, an ok premise and somewhat weak story. Fishburne is quite good; Reeves is flat. I found the screenplay threadbare, giving the actors not enough meat to work with. The premise is marginal and a bit watered down to make it as science fiction. The story and direction leave holes big enough to drive trucks through.

About half way through the movie disbelief kicked back in and the film seemed merely a platform for special effects. In comparison, Mel Gibson's Payback is a more intriguing and better directed revenge/action flick, and Johnny Nmemonic (also featuring Reeves) has better Cyberspace science fiction.

This is a violent film, which I have little problem with in general, but here it's particularly de-humanizing which I *do* object to. Payback is extremely violent and profane, but the violence is focussed and meaningful in that it serves to advance the plot and has human consequences. The violence in The Matrix blends a cartoon-like disregard for its consequences with an elitist notion that it's all ok because the human victims have been brainwashed by the bad guys and are essentially pawns in a larger game. Violence should have a moral dimension or at least move the plot if it's to have meaning. If not, it desensitizes viewers to violence which can't be a healthy thing for society. It also makes for a boring movie.","9"

The story line was wonderfully original, taking the Terminator plot line to new levels, and the acting was terrific. Reeves did a great job as the confused NEO who is thrown into this world unsuspecting of anything to come, and his end fight with the Agent Smith is one of the only times I ever believed Reeves could be a ""hard a%%"". The actor who played Agent Smith was a great villian and the actress who played Trinity did an outstanding job. Though the story can be confusing at times, and the constant references to what is real and what is not can spin your head, the movie makes up for it with amazing action sequences and some of the best effects I have seen in year.

Only complaint would be thinking to hard with some of the blabbo mind job talk.

Anybody remember the old Ray Bradbury cartoon ""Little Nemo""? Was watching with my child the other day and busted a gut when Nemo goes asleep and enters ""Slumberland"" and meets up with King Morpheus!

I'm thinking -- Okay back in grade school the little Wachowski brothers read the same book and said ""Hey!

But a small band of pale, renegade humans have figured out the truth and are trying to subvert the computer-master's plans.

The Wachowski brothers, Larry and Andy, have created this premise as much more than an excuse to stage some of the finest fightr scenes and effects sequences ever made; the plot works very well on a number of levels. First, it's an intriguing sci-fi thriller with plenty of unexpected twists and turns. Second, it's a dramatic, suspenseful mind-f**k with a through-the-looking-glass plot. But most effectively, it's an allegory - a religious metaphor - with one man (""the One"") called upon to harness his gifts in the service of humankind.

"ptwomey","Pure Genius!","5 May 2003","The Matrix is nothing short of an absolute cinematic masterpiece that will re-define modern filmmaking. It is a once in a lifetime special event that nobody should miss.

The elegant combination of mystery, suspense and action with a dark religious and social under-tone combined with a genuine shock factor create a visual and intelligent tour de force of celluloid not to be missed.

The story follows a computer Nerd or hacker named Neo who seeks the answer to a question that he cannot yet comprehend. Not feeling right in the world, as if something is wrong, Neo searches for a man named Morpheus who can answer the question: ""What is the Matrix?"" What follows is a horrific and realistic vision of our technological futuristic hell that more than parallels our own existence.

As Neo discovers the true meaning of his question and the shocking reality of his existence we are treated to some of the most stylish and exciting action sequences ever to make it to the silver screen. It is rare that an all out action film can create and maintain a sense of intelligence and social commentary without feeling completely poxy and contrived.

Despite all its complexity, deep and meaningful parallels and the questions it raises, The Matrix can still be enjoyed and completely superficial Saturday night entertainment basis, thus making its re-watch ability extremely high.

Each and every shot, scene, musical piece, sound effect and piece of dialogue feels perfect as if someone wasted endless hours ensuring it was all perfect from vision to reality. There is hardly a fault in its complete construction, pacing, editing, cinematography or any other filmmaking aspect for that matter.

The acting is more than sufficient on the whole save for two noteworthy performances: Hugo Weaving's perfect and extremely likeable Agent Smith and the exception Laurence Fishburne's Morpheus who is almost like a religious prophet instilling a sense of faith in audience, helping us to suspend our disbelief.

Finally the special effects, which have been copied and spoofed in countless films since, will simply stun. Admittedly as the film ages, so will the effects, but at least for the time they are nothing short of amazing.

In the end the film is a rollercoaster ride of everything that is good in a film, and certainly some of its financial success must be attributed to the fact that this film was not hyped at all, in fact it almost left the cinemas before the mainstream discovered it. Warners Brother even predicted that it would fail and the first comment from critics would of indicated as such. Now it is the single biggest grossing film that Warner Brothers has ever made.

This is filmmaking at its best, and as the film races on from climax to climax and you get sucked into the fantastic world of The Matrix, we can all feel something special Intelligent action can work  and Hollywood can make a film that does not insult you either.

The sfx were out of this world, the fight scenes were the best I've probably ever seen. The plot kept pace with the non-stop action by making you question the reality of which you live in. The Wachowski brothers have completely redefined what great sfx can do for a movie. Keanu puts in a great performance, mainly because they limited the amount of dialogue he had, as Neo the reluctant leader of a resistance to free humanity. The movie immediately grabs you and holds you for the remainder, with the exception of your mouth dropping open during the mind blowing action scenes.

I love it and it does get you pondering some of life's biggest questions, as most good sci-fi does.

The overall aesthetic is undeniably cool and it's loaded with awesome characters and memorable dialog. Agent Smith is an all-time great movie villain and Morpheus is unforgettable. The casting was perfect all around and I can't imagine this movie with anyone else in it. The martial arts choreography and gun fights are incredible and still look absolutely terrific.

The general premise isn't ""new"" but it brought a lot of different things together and really broke a ton of new ground. At 22 years old, the visual effects certainly show their age in some spots but overall hold up well and don't detract from the experience. It's a new classic for the genre and will be enjoyed for decades to come.","10"

If you're looking for an exciting and thought-provoking movie, The Matrix is definitely worth seeing.

The Wachowski brothers were heavily influenced by the work of French philosopher Jean Baudrillard when making The Matrix. In his book Simulacra and Simulation, Baudrillard talks about how modern society is increasingly reliant on simulations of reality. He also talks about how humans is becoming more detached from the physical world and more immersed in virtual realities. This idea of humans losing touch with reality and becoming immersed in a simulated world is a central theme in The Matrix. In the movie, human beings are trapped in a simulated reality known as the Matrix. They are only able to break free when they are unplugged from the Matrix and exposed to the harsh realities of the real world. The Wachowskis have said that they were heavily influenced by Baudrillard's work when making The Matrix and that they wanted to explore his ideas about simulations and reality in the film.","1"
"tom-43722","Not bad, just overrated.","25 October 2021","I can see why this movie has such a passionate fanbase. Amazing action scenes, a decent albeit flawed script and a fascinating idea which holds it together.

However, I think The Matrix's legendary reputation is exaggerated and it's objective quality doesn't match the hype. This is mostly due to Carrie Ann Moss and, to a lesser extent, Keanu Reeves (God bless him, he's a wonderful human being but he's one of those ""slow burn"" actors who didn't achieve his potential until his later years). Put simply, they sucked in this movie. Kudos to them for their martial arts prowess but unfortunately, Moss and Reeves acting prowess wasn't up to the task. Reeves' innocence and naivety did bring some charm to Thomas Anderson AKA Neo but his bland performance didn't exactly make Neo a riveting character. He only seemed to be invested during the mission to rescue Morpheus. As for Trinity, she was just a bland chick in a leather outfit who had no chemistry with Neo. I think there was potential for a decent character if they had gotten a better actress but even in scenes where Trinity's friends were being slaughtered right in front of her, Moss failed to convey the pain, grief and anger that Trinity should have been feeling.

Even Laurence Fishburne had a rather stilted and bland delivery but to his credit, he still carried a fatherly sense of authority. After being taken out by Agent Smith, Morpheus inner strength showed through his resistance to the Agent's torture techniques. I can understand why some people would be disappointed that Morpheus isn't the unstoppable badass he was hyped up to be, but I think that's precisely the point. It's a ""never meet your heroes"" situation. I also like that it was hinted that Morpheus' blind faith in Neo could have resulted in disaster because it made him a more nuanced character who, despite his reputation as a wise and powerful man, is still capable of making mistakes.

Hugo Weaving's performance as Agent Smith has me slightly conflicted. On one hand, his strange delivery is not what I would call a good performance if he were playing a human character. On the other hand, Agent Smith is NOT a human character. He's an AI program who walks around wearing the facade of a human so I can't in good conscience call it a bad performance. My favourite scene from Smith was when he admitted to Morpheus that he hated the Matrix and wanted to break free. If I'm not mistaken, there are theories that Smith might have been The One instead of Neo and I think that scene could be used as evidence of that. Not conclusive evidence, but evidence nonetheless.

I think the main problem with The Matrix is that the characters around Neo and Trinity seem interesting. Neo and Trinity themselves do not. With stronger lead characters, this could go from a great film to an outright brilliant one.","8"
"LuvsFood","I liked the Matrix, but...","5 April 1999","I liked the Matrix, but disagree with everyone who's so nuts about the action scenes. Yes, there is slow-mo, but saying things like ""better than The Killer"" are misleading at best. John Woo's sense of editing and framing are far better than the Wachowski's. Their use of slow-mo slows things down, rather than giving the action sequences an interesting cadence. (I'm not referring to the ""time slice"" effect, btw, but the slow-mo used during the gunfights.) If you want to go back to what I believe is the best use of slow-mo, watch the shootout at the end of the Wild Bunch. If you really watch Peckinpah's artistry, you'll notice what the slow-mo is really for: to capture the essence of men fighting desperately for their lives. Watch as the Mexicans appear in doorways, perfectly framed, and then taking a lethal dosage of lead. See a strategically perched soldier get picked off with a quick burst of machine gun fire. And feel a rhythm develop as these little acts of violence are interspersed with quick shots of men firing, reloading, killing and dying. The Wachowski's use slow-mo to make their gunfights ""cool"" and to pay homage to their cinematic idols. And that's it. What's more important than the action, is to create a surprisingly interesting and engaging story, with likable characters. And the Wachowski's succeeded at that without question.","8"

Yes, I know that it's a fictional story. I'm just not a fan of films that mess with your head for a while after you watch the film. This one wasn't too bad but it makes you think.

"Theoron","A Review of the Matrix from a Christian perspective...","22 January 2000","WARNING - THIS REVIEW CONTAINS PLOT SPOILERS. DO NOT READ IT IF YOU HAVE NOT SEEN THE MOVIE!

I finally watched ""The Matrix"" on DVD -- I give it a solid 8 out of 10.

This movie is a heck of a lot a fun! Let's face it, the most appealing things about this film were the awesome fight scenes, the shameless glorification of automatic weapons, the black leather, and Carrie-Ann Moss.

So far I haven't seen many films in 1999 with a particularly outstanding performance by an actor, save Richard Farnsworth in ""The Straight Story."" But Mr. Fishburne would certainly get my vote for best performance! I can't possible imagine anyone else better in that role. He played it to perfection. And Hugo Weaving's performance as `Agent Smith' was absolutely brilliant.

However, I did find some faults with this film; the main one being the recycling of the most cliché' of science fiction plot lines, the ""messiah-deliver who was prophesied to free us all...blah, blah, blah...."" Now that it's been done 14,000 times over, I think it's clearly time to finally lay that plot line to rest....

Also, the film was way too upbeat concerning the superiority of humans vs. machines. Everyone knows machines are better. (Speaking of clichés', how many times has the conflict of man vs. machine been explored in film-literally history? About 50 million times??? Puh-lease....)

Warner Brothers should have forced the Wachowski Brothers to include an apology to the makers of `Dark City' and `Terminator 2' in the opening credits. (Not to mention `Dune,' `Metropolis,' H.G. Wells, and Stanley Kubrick.)

And to be perfectly honest, that guy who made a deal with the agents to be put back into the ""matrix"" was the only intelligent one of the bunch. (Say, isn't that `Guido, the Killer Pimp?') He knew a good thing when he saw it. Too bad he was such a jerk. (Philosophical note: If the dude asks to have his memories completely erased before taking on his new identity, then how does that differ from him just putting a bullet to his head and ending it right then and there???? Isn't the exact same thing accomplished? OK class, who'd like to answer that one?)

Besides all those negatives, this was the best martial arts film I've ever seen. Jackie Chan finally has some competition.

And yes, the agent's line about the failed ""Utopia"" matrix was very interesting; but if you think about it, it makes absolutely no sense. The best way to keep a human being enslaved is to play off their ""appetites"" for food and sex. Just keep giving them enough to want more, but never enough to reach complete satisfaction. Those in the drug, porno, and entertainment industries know all about human enslavement.

It's not that a Utopian society would have failed because everyone would have considered it to be a fake, they'd be too busy satisfying the cravings of their flesh to notice.... but a Utopian Matrix would fail because of the evil, sinful nature of human beings. Man is just too selfish to be able to create a successful Utopia here on earth, or even in a computer simulation.

That's why ""Forbidden Planet"" is such a classic movie. It shows that even when a society has everything it could possible want, there's no way to eliminate the wildcard of the ""id"" or sinful nature of man. (Or, in the case of ""Forbidden Planet,"" the sinful nature of Krell....) It was the Krell's inability to check their ""dark side"" that caused the destruction of their society. So the A.I. machines built a world where humans could indulge their evil nature, a world identical to the one we currently live in.

I liked the whole concept of the realization that the world around us is not all there is to reality. On that point, the film scores some major bonus points in my book.

Truth is the world that we see, feel, touch and smell everyday of our lives is a ""matrix"" of sorts. Yet you won't find a bunch of amoral A.I. robots behind the curtain running the whole show, no matter how hard you look. Rather, our world is run by a rather benevolent spirit whom most like to refer to as God. He has sent many prophets, and even his own son to let us in on the secret, much like Morpheus acts as a prophet in this film, letting Neo and others in on the secret that is the Matrix.

And much like Neo, God offers us the choice of the red and blue pills. Either we can throw our lot in with him, or continue on in our quaint little deception that what we taste, see, feel & hear are the only things that are ""out there,"" nothing more.

Throughout the course of human history, we have various examples of individuals who decided that the blue pill was for them: Hitler, Stalin, Mao, Mussolini, Fruede, Nietzsche, T.H. Huxley; to name a few. All of them devout atheists. All of them believing all there is to this world is what their senses dictated to them, nothing more.

Then there are those who took the blue pill, like Mother Teresa, the Pope, Billy Graham, Albert Shcwietzer, C.S. Lewis, J.R.R. Tolkien and J.S. Bach. All of them believers in a spiritual world more real than the world around us. All of them committed, in their own way, of proclaiming this great truth to any that would listen.

As for me, I took the blue pill and threw my lot in with the benevolent higher power. I don't regret it for a minute.","10"
"niksb","""The Matrix is what Matrix does""","15 February 2023","This movie is weak in story, dialogue, character development, and even coherence; it's strong on special effects and brooding paranoia. Both the spectator and the movie's characters may struggle to understand what is real and what is a part of a sophisticated, artificial cyber-reality in THE MATRIX. But it's undoubtedly the best option for the kind of youngster who fantasizes about the possibility of video games coming to life. The majority of teenagers 14 and older who beg to watch it should be able to take it without any issues, despite the fact that film is labelled R for language and violence (some quite unpleasant, including an icky bug that enters the hero's body through his belly button).","7"
"rickytrapp","Reloaded was better","29 March 2009","Neo. Trinity. Morpheus. You have three interesting characters and a very interesting plot. But at times it can become boring? What I mean is at times, don't you get bored listening to the characters explaining every new part of the story like they want to burn it into our brains? The plot: Thomas Anderson/Neo (Keanu Reeves) receives different messages from a man named Morpheus... I was bored until the action scenes. The cast is no problem. Its the sometimes boring plot that stops and starts again. Reloaded was much better as it had the same kind story as the first Matrix, but balancing it with excellent action scenes. The less said about Revolutions the better.

So there you have it. Reloaded better.","10"

"kevin-miller447","Every generation has ""that movie""","7 August 2011","Growing up, this was one of those movies that people said I had to see if I loved movies. I waited a long to watch this because it was rated R and I was only 7 when this was released. So after waiting long enough and convincing my parents to let me, I finally watched it. This is one of those cases where the movie is so hyped up that when you watch it, it's good but nothing special. I was impressed by the movie, and they seemed to be throwing all these new ideas at you about the world and how it works. I've always wondered after watching this, if there are people that actually believe what the movie is telling them. The scene people constantly refer to when talking about this movie is the bullet time scene. It's over in a matter of seconds, and my response was ""what, that's it?"" I did like this movie, I just didn't think it was a profound masterpiece or anything. It seems to me that people only recommend watching this movie because of that one scene that is now cemented into movie history. The Wachowski brothers wrote a very intriguing piece of work, and I admire their exploration outside the norm of reality. The cast is good and Lawrence Fishbourne is great as ever. The guy who stole the show for me was Smith who is played by Hugo Weaving. This is an action packed science fiction movie that I think most can enjoy, though some may not want to invest their time into.","10"

Like an onion. And like an onion, it potency is unmatched in its own family of similar genre'd films. It begins, as society shapes the roles we play within in. A cycle, hopelessly dependant on the system, but slowly and surely, we learn the truth. And from there on, the rest is history. My go to film, no matter what the mood.

The reason this movie is such an achievement is because it achieves all the cool things that people want to see in movies, but at the same time, is NOT mindless.

Not since T2 have I seen such great special effects coupled with action, only this was better in some aspects. I don't know, I just kept laughing a giddy little laugh throughout because of awesomeness of scenes (i.e. the lobby). Sure, the dialog could have been better, but that's true with almost every film. But the effects and action make up for it without a doubt. You say you don't like Keanu Reeves? Yeah, I know, he's not an actor, or at least not a good one. In this though, he fits, and makes a pretty cool bad-ass. So, if you like action in the slightest, I highly suggest this movie.","10"

Overall an immensely satisfying cinema experience.","8"

Although it is no means as powerful{obviously} as films like Saving Private Ryan and Schindler's List, it is a very imagnative, exciting, superbly acted, film. I have a new respect for Keanu Reeves. This film, I hope, will get nominated for some awards. It deserves a few, at least. I had huge expectations, and this film BLEW THEM AWAY. It is violent, but the language is very tame. There was not a single use of the f-word anywhere! That's impressive. This is one of the best movies I have ever seen. I mean it. I won't try and describe how amazing it is. It can't be done.","4"

Here's 1999's: The Matrix. Whether it's the hokey idea of robots using humans as batteries rather than harvesting power chemically or geochemically, the dissolution of the trying-to-be-hip science fiction movie plot into a typical action/shoot-'em-up vehicle, or the bedamned Hollywood ending, there's much to annoy the serious film-viewer in The Matrix. Its basic plot (human discovers he's in a faked, alien-generated reality/ discovers he has super-powers to fight aliens) was used in 1998's Dark City, a more stylish film that also suffers from a Hollywood-esque ending. Invest your $7, $8, or $9 in Duracell stock.","9"
"a.v. boy","Great Sci-Fi premise, squandered in a merely pretty good action movie.","9 May 1999","This coulda been a contender. Actually, it kind of was, at least the first two hours. What starts out as a mediocre hacker movie rapidly reveals itself to be a full-bodied, classic, sci-fi story for the ages. But then it gets side-tracked, stepping away from the complicated story and getting comfortable in the special-effects enhanced, but basically old-fashioned, shoot-out and marshall-arts sequences. What could have been a great sci-fi film ends up as an action movie. Plenty of pulse-pounding action to be sure, but not what this film could have been.

To be fair, this film mainly suffers by comparison with those truly great dark sci-fi films: ""Dark City,"" ""Blade Runner,"" ""City of Lost Children,"" ""Brazil."" Not being able to measure up doesn't make it a bad film, but the first two hours of this 144 minute epic promised so much more. It COULD have been in the same league, all it needed was a better ending to pull together a bunch of loose ends and to emphasize the sci-fi premise. Instead, and not a bad condolence prize for fans of Hong Kong action movies, Keanu Reeves gives a performance in the shootouts that would make Chow Yun Fat envious.","9"

Keanu Reeves usually acts and looks the same in all his movies but this time he really fits the character, and even better than he did in ""Johnny Mnemonic"". The visual effects are incredible but in no way done just for the sake of having visual effects, they're all completely justified and the story wouldn't have been the same without them. And the story is probably the only truly original story for a movie I've seen in a long time (just when I thought I couldn't be surprised), it had me in suspense from beginning to end. If I was to choose one movie that I was forced to see every day for the rest of my life, ""The Matrix"" would be it. It really kicks butt in every way, go see it now!!!

It introduced you into the world, and gave a chance for the audience to understand and be in that world. When the amazing action sequences came, they didn't seem as if they were the reason for the movie (which is what I feared). Everyone always disses on Keanu, but he was alright in this movie.

Bound, one of my favorite movies ever, as you already know was the Wachowski brother's first pic. The Matrix has the same style and wit, but more plot holes and the curse of hollywood (occasional dumb dialog and scenes that seem forced).

"LeonardZelig","Don't Trust What You See","20 September 1999","""The Matrix"" is the kind of movie that really shouldn't be taken too seriously, I think. Either that, or it's not being taken seriously enough. If you wanted to get all supernatural and philosophical about ""The Matrix,"" you could. I just wouldn't recommend it too much.

The movie itself is one of the finest sci-fi/action films I've ever seen, if only because of how much it wracks your mind. The special effects are simply out of this (and probably any other) world. Half of the time, you're not quite sure what you're really seeing, and you're not sure if you even want to be, for that matter. The special effects are so good, in fact, that I can't at the moment think of any other film with any quite as good. I really don't have a clue as to how any of them were done. All I am sure of is that the Wachowski Brothers must have had a lot of fun playing tricks on the audience, and they do one heck of a job on it as well.

The story itself is great too, and very well acted, particularly by Keanu Reeves (Neo) and Laurence Fishburne (Morpheus). Their characters are three-dimensional in that they are sci-fi ""heros"" with feelings, emotions, and believable personalities. I say ""feelings"" and ""emotions"" with caution, because this is surely not a mushy film whatsoever. This is the type of storyline where everything (eventually) makes sense, where things fall into place without being contrived, and the end result is actually quite believable and convincing.

After I stepped out of the theater in which I saw ""The Matrix,"" I looked around myself. The result was similar to ""The Truman Show"" in that I suddenly started to wonder what was real. The feeling passed, of course, and I began to see ""The Matrix"" as simply a great sci-fi/action film. Still, that's bad at all, is it?

***1/2 out of ****.","9"
"mdnrules","Great sci-fi/action flick","30 December 1999","I finally saw this one, and I'm glad I did. Some people didn't like the acting, but I thought it was fine. The storyline seems to get in the way of the action at first, but if you take the time to watch this 3 or 4 times, the storyline ADDS a lot to the film and shows you that the awesome gun-flashing scenes had a reason to them.

Agent Smith was cool, the kung-fu action scene was cool, the guns were cool, and the special effects were great. I don't want to dissapoint anybody by giving them high expectations before they saw the movie, but this is a great movie. How can you resist the idea of being able to download ANYTHING you want to learn in an instant? 10 years of kung-fu experience downloaded into your brain in 7 seconds!

"Big D-2001","The most entertaining and energetic action adventure of the 90's.","2 September 1999","""The Matrix"" is, without a doubt, the most entertaining and energetic action adventure of the 90's. The action sequences are absolutely mind-blowing and inventive. It is, in a word, AWESOME. And now, a few words of discomfort. This film has major loopholes in the plot. It left so many questions and possibilities open-ended. The film drags for about an hour while the characters go through and explain the plot. Keanu Reeves is NOT the greatest actor on the planet, and, at a crucial moment in the movie, it abandons its potential in plotting and becomes a standard action picture. But, you know what? I really didn't care. Once again, the action sequences and special effects are top-notch and involving. I give major credit to the film's directors, whose previous outing ""Bound,"" was much heavier in plot, character development and pay-off; a much more superior motion picture. The film is still playing in second-run theatres and will be out on video September 21st. Buy the DVD for extra ""goodies"" about the production and a running audio commentary by the filmmakers.","6"

"Dignan_Tenenbaum","Total Recall crossed with a Gap commercial","27 June 2001","I was on my way to see this movie when my car died. It just shut off on the highway and started smoking, never to start up again. I really should have taken my car's warning on this one. I suppose I really should have known this would be a bad movie when I asked other people about it. They all said the same thing, ""It was great. Absolutely amazing special effects."" I would ask about the story. Not if it was any good, I just asked what it was. I would always get the same response, ""The special effects were great.""

When are we going to realize the difference between a movie being an excuse to do special effects (ex. Spawn), and special effects being a sorry excuse for a movie (ex. Twister and The Matrix). One is fun to watch regardless of the story, while the other is pure torture that even a 1976 Ford LTD knows is bad.

A bad or unoriginal story isn't what killed this movie. What killed this movie was the fact that it took itself so seriously. Anyone who has ever even known some one who knew some one who's done drugs has thought of this story line. What if I'm not really here? What if this whole world is just some sort of fantasy? PUT THE WEED DOWN!

And all the people who fancies themselves serious film connoisseurs, simply because they caught a couple Bible references in this waste of celluloid, should just give up, admit that Adam Sandler is their god and they will never have any useful contributions to society.

I do have to admit that I really enjoyed the Judas character played by Joey Pants. His 'ingnorance is bliss' comment just sums it all up. People watching this movie will think, ""Hey, that guys a jerk. I certainly would rather live free than to think that everything is okay. That's why I see such wonderfully original films like this. That reminds me, I need to check the box office ratings in order to tell me what movie to see next."" Irony is the coolest special effect of them all.","1"

Of course there were tons of new special effects but unlike some movies where it seemed the writers were told write the movie around the special effects the Matrix is different. The MATRIX uses the special effects magic to tell a story. Never not once does this this movie let you catch your breath. There are no long ponderous dialogues or dry spots in this movie that allow you to think about mundane things of your life like did you feed the cat, will you mow the lawn this afternoon or tomorrow as you watch this movie.

No this movie rips you out of your seat by your throat and once it grabs you it simply does NOT let you go and thats its charm and claim to fame. The movie is fast paced, action with a strong plot supporting it, the cuts be they of action or dialogue are fast paced information cramed bits you must almost work to collect in keeping up with the movie. You don't just sit down turn off your brain and let the Matrix happen to you. The Matrix like few other movies I have seen in recent times fully engages your senses in a most visceral and primal manner.

"Hypotheses","I say--without hyperbole--that ""The Matrix"" is the best action/sci-fi film so far this year.","3 June 1999","I say--without hyperbole--that ""The Matrix"" is the best action/sci-fi film this year so far. Roger Ebert can kiss my proverbial a@#$! for not making his review strong enough, because I was not convinced at the time. Of course, the film has its flaws, which I will point out later, but overriding that is the film's complete ambush to the senses. I knew, for example, that once Trinity flew into the window of that building from the roof of another with such dazzling SFX accuracy, that I was going to enjoy the film with or without lousy acting.

Although critically, the Wachowski brothers' previous film ""Bound"" is wholly of more merit, ""Matrix"" delivers for its genre. You simply check your brain at the door, let the deluge begin, and pick it back up when the lights go up. Combining, to various degrees, good acting (many exceptions), intense action, and a terrific sci-fi/fantasy story, ""The Matrix"" has secured a place for itself among some of the more truly satisfying action/sci-fi films, such as Terminator 2: Judgment Day, Blade Runner, Dark City, Total Recall, GATTACA, Back to the Future, Star Wars Trilogy, X-files: Fight the Future, Aliens, Men in Black, Eve of Destruction, The Puppet Masters, Star Trek II: The Wrath of Kahn and so on. Moreover, although the special effects are key, there must be balance. One need only remember failures such as Waterworld, Star Trek V: The Final Frontier, The Postman, Virus, Starship Troopers (Sorry, I read the book), Lost in Space, Deep Rising, Johnny Mnemonic, Vitruosity and so on to know this.

The brilliant special effects and action sequences carry the film, but to its detriment are cartoon characters, the trite (and almost comical) aphorisms with Biblical overtones from Morpheus, the weak lead Keanu, a truly promising story line that is never really fulfilled or elaborated upon, i.e., there is no third act, and the film's clear avoidance of the serious question that Cypher, Joe Pantaliano's character, raises. Aside from that, the effects and other elements work well to balance out these flaws.

The plot, although not completely original--see Dark City--is quite surreal, dark, pulpy, and most comic book-like. There are some literate allusions to Alice in Wonderland such as follow the white rabbit and through the looking glass, but also to the Bible. Neo, for instance, is a weak Christ-like character whose name is an anagram for ""One."" Morpheus rearranges into ""Push Rome"" and Agent Smith into ""I'm the Angst."" And, characters with names such as Trinity and Apoc are obvious enough. In addition, the two worlds in the film make a striking contrast. The wholly bleached, grim, and gothic city seems almost idyllic when compared with the graphic and hellish ""real world."" Nonetheless, the Gestapo agents of the Matrix practically steal the show. Hugo Weaving's ominous portrayal of Agent Smith is outright superb character acting. Last, but not least, Keanu's marital arts are unintentionally hilarious. I know you laughed, come on now.

Yet, even after you combine this hodgepodge of elements, ""The Matrix"" will still leave you thoroughly entertained--as much as any rollercoaster ride, but for a lot less money.","10"
"Kylic","One of the best sci-fi movies of all time, however questions abound. (spoilers)","12 May 2000","The Matrix is truly one of the best sci-fi films that I've ever seen. It combines superb special effects with a somewhat original premise (machines taking over the world) with a Internet spin on it. The violence isn't as bad as the critics say; although, the lobby shoot out scene may've been pushing it. Those who find fault or confusion with the plot as being paper thin obviously weren't paying attention, because Morpheus (Fishburne) practically spins the entire length of the film explaining WHAT the Matrix is. In fact, the film was so good I was able to overlook Reeves' marginal performance.

The film also inserts a Christian them of presenting Neo as a Jesus like savior; Morpheus' scripture like quotes; even a Judas character. My only complaint is that the film present a slew of unanswered questions. For starters...

1.) Why would the machines even need humans as a source of energy in the first place? Haven't they heard of geo-thermal or wind energy?

2.) Is it true that the machines are literally creating-er ""growing"" human beings in their endless ""fields""? If so, then that opens up an annoying can of worms that I'm not gonna to touch. But if they have the whiz to grow humans, then they should be able to develop a more productive energy source.

3.) I really find it hard to believe that humans would take such an extremely, dumb action of destroying their own Earthy environment (via somehow ""scorching"" the sky) just to win a war against the machines. Didn't anyone ever think of using a EMP (electromagnetic pules) back then when it was REALLY useful?

4.) You'd think the machines would eventually catch on to humans mysteriously being awakened from their pods; and instead would immediately terminate them as apposed to dumping them into the sewer--only to be fished out by the rebels shortly thereafter.

5.) Wouldn't the traitor (Cypher) had been a little concerned that he'd be caught by his crewmates when logged on to the Matrix to perform his under-the-table dealings with Agent Smith? And HOW was he able to log off with out any assistance?

"star69","poor plot, unoriginal quotes, plenty of stereotypes","10 April 1999","`I hate those movies based on special effects with a poor plot,' I told my friend when he suggested me to go see `The Matrix' on its opening night. But when I kept hearing excellent reviews of the movie, my curiosity increased, and I decided to give it a try. Well, I was right: not only I did not enjoy the movie, but I also could not wait to rush out of the movie theater.

First of all: the PLOT was truly poor, and it is clear that most of the scenes were designed merely to show special effects, rather than to transmit a precise message (and at least twenty minutes of the movie could have been cut because of this). The first rule of screenwriting is to satisfy the audience's need for orientation, clarifying since the very beginning who are the characters of the movie, and what is their function. I had to wait an hour to understand that. This method (increasing the suspense of this audience by postponing a real explanation of the characters' roles) could have been effective, only if they were introduced in a more clear way. I often felt lost, as many key aspects of the movie were clarified too late (i.e. the phone transportation).

The DIALOGUES were truly lame and unoriginal (except for some funny references to the Wizard of OZ).

The CHARACTERS were not developed at all. Still now, thinking about the movie, I cannot really say what was a peculiar trait of each character: their personalities did not stand out at all. They were rather divided into the stereotypical `good' and `bad' categories.

Still mentioning STEREOTYPES, I think the whole movie was a TT (Temple of Testosterone): the ideal place for the satisfaction of a male audience. Why? Because of great fight scenes, vigorous men with a perpetual grimace who want to either save or `own' the world, women with big breasts who don't talk (the woman in red), and strong but yet submissive women driven by sentimentality (Trinity).

What I SUGGEST is to go see it if you like video games and want some entertainment. But if you are one of those persons who want to step out of a movie theater with a new awareness or  even better  a call to action, I suggest you'd save the 8 bucks for a better cause.","10"
"Alan One","Subverting a media monster","3 January 2000","What message to draw from a film packed with pseudo-religious metaphors? It's clear to me that the Wachowski brothers are, at least on one level, calling for subversion of the media-industrial complex of which they now find themselves a celebrated component.

Their film extrapolates our current state of media suffusion to an unsettling conclusion, in which humans from birth are hooked into a sort of a massively-multiplayer RPG, one so convincingly real that they don't realize it isn't the only reality. The matrix is presided over by an evil robotic intelligence, which uses the oblivious human participants as a biological energy source. The first step in fighting back is to ""wake up"" and enter the real world, where free humans stage attacks against the matrix and its minions.

In our own increasingly mediated world, the brothers tell us, our consciousness is dominated by corporate media environments, which nourish themselves by enmeshing our lives with theirs - whether it be through Phantom Menace merchandizing, or ""synergy"", or hopeless schmucks posting movie reviews to IMDb. The media provide our lives with meaning, but deaden us to pain, and separate us from reality. Agent Smith, when explaining to Morpheus that a past matrix, which had depicted an idyllic world, was rejected by its human hosts, sounds suspiciously like a studio executive explaining why his movies are excessively violent - because it's what the people want.

How do you subvert a media monster? Taking lessons from the music industry, you can either go Frank Zappa (and be unlistenable) or Rage Against the Machine (and rock). Neo goes the Rage route, popping up with bigger guns and badder kung fu. And The Matrix does the same thing. It tries to subvert the predominance of the action film by out-doing it with a whole new class of bells and whistles. (As a friend of mine used to say, ""You have to get behind the man to stab him in the back."") Will it work? Not a chance. More likely we'll all be drooling over the idea of a sequel.","10"
"deputydoofus","Good thrills, but the Wachowskis can do better.","31 January 2000","This isn't one of the greatest Si-Fi movies ever made, but it was the best one of '99. The story takes so many turns that it's easy to enjoy and think about. However, it saddens me when the obligatory violent scene is the scene the audience appears to like most. The scene, for me, didn't need to be there, as it goes against the characters' morality.

Overall, it's good for a few thrills, but there's nothing in it that other movies haven't done better. If you liked the violence and anarchic ideas in the Matrix, see Fight Club. If you liked the mysterious world and gradually revealing plotline, see Dark City. If you liked the films overall style, see Bound (The Wachowski Brothers' first movie). Each one of those films serves it's particular purpose much more effectively than The Matrix. The Matrix does combine the three elements in a cohesive way, and does produce one heck of a thrill, so it offers something few other movies can give. See it, and, if you like it, see the other ones I've mentioned, you'll find they have a lot to offer as well. My rating: 8/10","10"
"exterminator_99","It is all around us...","21 March 2002","A welcome addition to the pantheon of revered science fiction movies, ""The Matrix"" is already a modern classic. Made at the tail end of the 20th century it's a meshing of genres, with a vice-tight storyline and script and an abundance of amazing special effects. It separates itself from the slew of recent science fiction thanks to its adhesion and capability to portray one of the more original takes on a post-apocalyptic netherworld, where man is not in control of his destiny, but is controlled by machines  another example of man creating his own destruction.

The most striking aspect of the ""The Matrix"" is its amazing pacing. Brothers Larry and Andy Wachowski, who both wrote and directed the film, obviously take their cue from comic books. Such is the narrative structure, the film reads like a graphic novel. Its composition is made of a great number of close ups, emphasising the emotional toll of something that is unexplainable, something like the Matrix. When the attention isn't placed on the characters, the vista opens up to amazing special effects and action sequences. The Wachowski brothers pull back and let the action flow, generally in slow motion. You could be mistaken for reading it as a comic, soaking up every piece of design and production in the frame.

Like so many other comic book style films and stories, the core character of ""The Matrix"" is a superhero, a man who will save mankind. No one knows exactly who he is, until one day, his cover is removed. Neo (Keanu Reeves), aka Thomas Anderson, could be the one, but all we have to go on to know this is the prophecy of Morpheus (Lawrence Fishbourne). Morpheus is the leader of a ragtag bunch of human resistance fighters. Their battle is against the machines, who breed humans for their energy, which in turn powers the machines in their domination of the remnance of Earth. The world in which we exist is nothing more than a computer programme, designed to pacify our souls as we are drained for power, much like a battery.

Neo, who lives his double life as software programmer by day, hacker extraordinaire by night, has always felt his life is different to everyone else's. He's been intrigued by finding out just what the Matrix is. Where he got the original knowledge of the concept of the Matrix is unknown  it's almost as if he knows by osmosis.

His suspicions are confirmed when it all coalesces in a short space of time. Neo's life as Anderson is removed. Morpheus is revealed to Neo by Trinity (Carrie Ann Moss), a beautiful heroine and messenger. When he is finally introduced to Morpheus his journey into the real' world and out of the Matrix begins. It's a thrilling ride that combines a number of classic cool' movie themes, including martial arts, action and sci-fi paranoia to name a few.

Morpheus is presented as a Zen-like, Yoda-style sensei. He speaks in contradictions and double meanings. ""Don't think you can hit me, know you can,"" he says when training Neo in martial arts. The way in which Neo learns' is a slight copout. All his newly acquired knowledge is planted into his brain via computer. While he may be the saviour of mankind against the tyranny of the machines, his intelligence is programmed' via a hook-up to his brain. In that sense Neo becomes artificial intelligence as he has not learnt his craft but has been programmed with it.

This aside Morpheus trains Neo to remove himself from his human vessel, to become more of a spirit that can transcend his earthly cadaver. Neo (an acronym for One, aka The One?) becomes a Bruce Lee style action superhero, complete with an arsenal that would befit two Arnold Schwarzeneggers. His main enemies are Sentient Agents  created by the machines to travel in and out of the Matrix to destroy the earthly Neo as Thomas Anderson. When they fail and Morpheus' training of Neo begins, the Agents (led by Australian actor Hugo Weaving) realise their task has become a great deal more difficult. It all results in some amazing action sequences of special effects and bullets that make for an effective and uplifting ending.

Science fiction angle aside, ""The Matrix"" has enough to please everyone. Its subplots include romance, a little comedy, social commentary and a great deal of action. It draws on a number of similar films such as ""Zardoz"" and ""The Terminator"". Once again, it befits the sprawling nature of a comic book, touching different nerves when needed within the narrative.

The special effects are brilliant and far outdo the efforts of George Lucas' ""Star Wars: The Phantom Menace"", which was released the same year. While Lucas' film was created to almost look unreal  far too fantastic to be believable  ""The Matrix"" is more plausible, if a science fiction film of this ilk can be believable. The fluidity and positioning of the effects works because we do not have to convince ourselves we are in what we are witnessing. Costume design borders on S&M, with its black leather and synthetics perhaps touching on some underlying sexual overtones the film seems reluctant or unable to pursue.

The acting, whilst not the focal point of the film, is strong enough. Reeves is effective, Moss credible and Fishbourne majestic. Weaving's Agent Smith is an odd but suitably evil character and sports possibly the most cosmopolitan accent I have ever heard.

""The Matrix"" was a huge hit on release and has subsequently dominated VHS and DVD charts around the world since. Its combination of sheer entertainment and an in depth (if slightly diluted for the screen) story is enough to keep all audiences happy, from popcorn munching teens, nerdy sci-fi fanatics to the film enthusiast. ""The Matrix Reborn"" will be an interesting concept upon release in 2003 and we await to see if it matches the originality and progressive nature of its accomplished prequel.","8"
"Ben_BeanBag","Ott action is a plus","20 May 2022","The action was all over the top and I loved it. The music worked really well in context but as a soundtrack was kinda bland. The lore and world building was solid and left good room for the sequel. I do wish that the side characters got a bit more development. 8.9/10.","10"
"nic_allardice","Also over rated!","19 July 2002","This movie is nothing special. The effects are crap. The acting is Crap. Reeves is one of the worst actors I have ever seen. WHY 2 SEQUELS???? I thankfully missed this awful movie at the theaters and sadly saw it on video. I began watching this movie with high hopes and I was sorley dissapointed. What is the point??????????????????????? Saying that humanity is a computer generated life style. What kind of an idea is that??? It kind of ruins the way that you look at life!!!!!!!!! The soundtrack sucks and so does the cheap special effects!!!! This movie is almost as bad as The Godfather. The thing these 2 movies have in common is that they both suck and are over rated beyond belief. WHAT IS SO GREAT ABOUT THIS MOVIE!!!!!!!!!!!!!! My answer is nothing. If you want a good movie look at the Spiebergs and the Lucas and the Camerons. Lets not forget truley good movies of Baz Luhrmann and Tim Burton. Think about it people this movie is CRAP!!!!!!!!!!!!! Why are so many people into this movie??? It not so good!!!","9"
"phoenixmetro187","What's the big deal?","9 November 2003","I don't see why everyone loves this film. I admit it has great special effects and a moderately unique plot, but that's all. Laurence Fishburn is the only decent actor in the cast, the dialogue is beyond horrible, the cinematography isn't that great, and the music makes me want to vomit. And who the hell let Keanu Reeves into the screen actors guild?","8"
"livingyourpassion","Re-invents the Sci-Fi Genre","13 July 2002","This is one of my personal favorite action films. It sets a new standard on sci-fi films, much like Star Wars did back in the late 70's. The plot is intriguing and the action is probably some of the best cinema has ever seen. When the film was in theaters, I paid to see it 3 times. I just felt everything about this film was right. The plot, the action, the cast, score, effects, everything played together perfectly. Obviously, the originality on what the matrix is makes the movie extremely unique and special. People seem to like bashing Keanu Reeves as dopey, but I feel he did an excellent job as Neo and seemed to be a perfect fit. Who knew Michael Keaton would be the best pick as Batman back in 89? What did Keaton do before Batman, Mr. Mom? I really enjoyed this film and it is one of my favorite in my DVD collection. Even if you are not into sci-fi films or action films, this film is worth checking out. If you liked this film, I suggest you rent Dark City, another dark sci-fi gem.

Grade: A","10"
"Bob_647","An expertly crafted action film from the formula; with some redefining action mark trimmings.","7 June 2020","""The Matrix"" is a visually dazzling cyber adventure, full of kinetic excitement, it uses formula when it's getting interesting. It is not a letdown when a movie begins by redefining the nature of reality, and ends with a shoot-out. We want a leap of the imagination, so it does not mind in case of obligatory climaxes with automatic weapons fire.

Acting wise the film works excellently. I won't say that there aren't any issues because there are but overall the acting is pretty flawless. Keanu Reeves plays the main character, Neo, or Thomas A. Anderson and while he is not the perfect actor I think he does a pretty good job in The Matrix (and the sequels). He doesn't have the longest of lines which was probably a deliberate choice from the directors and it works because this gives him a better opportunity to work on posture and facial expressions and I must say that overall his body language is very good. Very clear and well defined. Laurence Fishbourne plays Neo's mentor Morpheus and he does an excellent job of it. His lines flow with a certain confidence and style that makes his character somewhat unique and interesting. Carrie-Anne Moss does a good job as well and succeeds in looking both cool and sexy in her leather outfit. Joe Pantoliano, a critically underrated actor does a brilliant job of bringing his character, Cypher, to life. I can't say much about him because his character is pretty essential to the plot and I certainly don't wan't to spoil it for anyone. Gloria Foster appears in a relatively small role that will have greater significance in the following films and she does a very good job. The best acting is provided by Hugo Weaving, however, in his portrayal of Agent Smith. It is really something to watch him act out the changes in his character. Agent Smith gains some human traits like anger, sense of dread, hate and eventually even a sly sense of humor (mostly in the sequels). Two thumbs way up to Weaving who has created one of the finest screen villains of all time.

But what makes The Matrix several cuts above the rest of the films in its genre is that there are simply no loopholes. The script, written by the Wachowski brothers is intelligent but carefully not geeky. The kung fu sequences were deftly shot -- something even Bruce Lee would've been proud of. The photography was breathtaking. (I bet if you had to cut every frame on the reel and had it developed and printed, every single frame would stand on its own.) And the acting? Maybe not the best Reeves but name me an actor who has box-office appeal but could portray the uneasy and vulnerable protagonist, Neo, to a T the way Reeves did. But, come to think of it, if you pit any actor beside Fishburne, you're bound to confuse that actor for bad acting. As Morpheus, Fishburne is simply wicked! Shades of his mentor-role in Higher Learning, nobody exudes that aura of quiet intensity than Fishburne. His character, battle-scarred but always composed Morpheus, is given an extra dose of mortality (He loves Neo to a fault.) only Mr. Fishburne can flesh out

Effects wise the film is simply stunning and it deservedly was awarded the Oscar for best effects (and was regrettably cheated out of a nomination in the Best Film category) ahead of even Star Wars. The reason that I think The Matrix deserves the Oscar for best effects is simply that the effects in The Matrix are more innovative than the ones in Star Wars. Just take a look at how many times the effects have been spoofed and you'll probably agree. The effects also help in the symbolism of the film and in creating a very dystopian atmosphere not unlike the one seen in Blade Runner and this works brilliantly. The film looks beautiful at all times and today 6 years later (my God has it already been 6 years?) the effects still hold their ground against new science fiction films. Add the effects to the brilliant editing and you have a visual masterpiece on your hands. Very well done.

The reason that I think The Matrix is more reviewable than pretty much any other film is the story and the philosophical and religious elements of the story because with every viewing I catch something I didn't see the previous time I watched it. Without spoiling the film I think I can mention a few of the more obvious elements. Obviously the film draws on the Messiah myth as Neo is a clear reference to Jesus with the analogy of his name (Neo = one, as in The One) Aside from the Christianic elements the film also gets its inspiration from Budhism, Gnosticism (Gnosis = knowledge) but is also inspired by Plato and his analogy of the Cave and Jean Baudrillard's essay, Simulacra and Simulations. Explaining these elements would make this review go on forever so aside from mentioning them I will not comment on them further.

People will say what they want to say about how good The Matrix is but the bottom line is this: finally there's a philosophical film that has cut through this generation. My generation. The Wachowski brothers probably scribbled a little P.S. note when they finished the script saying: think for a moment about your existence. What is the Matrix, you ask? Something that's closer to reality than you think.","8"
"sendoh15","The modern film that intensely impacted on raising the bar even higher...","25 May 2007","im_veritas_photo = a critical, lonely, ignorant, needs to chill out person. Who would watch matrix again you say? Well too bad cause millions of people have and I'm one of them. You wonder why your not impressed, because of how your mind works thats why. I'm sorry for not accepting your stupid comment but, your putting down a modern classic of film history. When matrix graced the screens it has impacted highly throughout the world more than most films. Not everyone can be as critical as you, stating every flaws you can see.

Ask yourself, why do people watch films? Well if you have no slightest clue then here it is, simple, so your closed mind can understand. BECAUSE WE WANT TO BE ENTERTAINED AND WANT OUR MINDS TO BE OCCUPIED IN ORDER TO GET AWAY FROM OUR REALITY. Truly matrix has done so in more ways opening up an interesting concept of the future ahead, it's projection of reality within reality is interesting.

The whole message really is simple, our present world has been taken over with technology to ease our lives. Only in the matrix they vent to the possibility that with what is going on now it can create superior advancements of machines if were not careful. Reeves and the rest gave a great performance for their roles as well as being convincing with the fight scenes. And who can forget bullet time!! If you can't appreciate this film for it's amazing take on the sci-fi, kung fu, action and romance, then clearly it isn't for you. So do all the fans out there a favor and not put out hateful comments(without acceptable reasoning), because naturally all those who appreciate this will disagree and waste their time too defending this film, like me.","8"
"connerg-2","Unbelievable???","4 October 1999","""The Matrix"" is definitely not Unbelievable. It could have been allot better, but, not even better enough to be Unbelievable.

The only thing I liked was the ending, which reminded of the ending of ""The Transformers: The Movie"". I couldn't understand what Fishburne was talking about, he kept saying something about ""Real is real, real can't real, but real real real..."", get what I mean. And Reeves' acting sucked. And the script was horrible.

""The Matrix"" is an action movie tangled with special effects and confusing scientific plots.","10"
"Spiffy-Tiffy","The Matrix Kicks ***","1 May 1999","I thought this movie was amazing. Sure a few of the scenes made me tired just looking at them, but isn't that part of the fun? I also thought that Keanu Reeves was perfectly cast, as well as Moss and Fishburne. The effects are absolutely awesome. I don't know why so many people didn't like this movie; it was pure entertainment. It is one of the best movies I have seen in a long time, and I think that anyone is looking for 2 hours of sci-fi action and adventure should also check it out.

I still say, if you want a good movie, check out The Matrix.","8"
"jn-14100","Most overrated movie in Hollywood history","16 November 2021","Hands down the most overrate movie in history. Terrible story and plot, jerky scene flow. Cast is subpar at best with the second most boring actor (K. Reeves) Hollywood has ever seem ( only Matt Damon is worse). CGI is over the top and inspired many terrible clones in subsequent movies. All in all this is a D listed movie that stumbled its way into a box office hit.","3"
"ohiocarbuyer","Socialist Propaganda Garbage","12 August 2006","A film which smacks of Riefenstahl! This miscarriage of film is little more than a vehicle for a twisted, dead, ideology. Let's get past the eye-candy of bullet time special effects and realize that the Wachowski brothers are hacks and shills for a political system that has murdered more citizens of this world than fascism, aids and cancer combined! Their melodramatica is being taken seriously as Brechtian art in our sound-bite society and I am here to tell you it's not even in the same genus! And I won't even trivialize this review by commenting on the ""acting"" that took place in this farce. Also, if you weren't aware of it already, the buzz is (was) that they lifted this work from another source (read as, ""any good idea is worth stealing!"") Editing was adequate as was the DP. Good fight sequences set against ground-breaking special effects...all wasted on this ""story"".

However, it was poorly directed by a pair of neophytes who had little to nothing to their name before and deserved less afterward....their trilogy has since gone down as one of the worst set of films in history, no further proof needed.

The ending, flying into the sky? How utterly sophomoric.

Save your money, and your stomach medicine, don't bother with this load of Bibical-revisionism with its Mauist theme.

Rent ""Logan's Run"" or ""Equilibrium"", if they don't provoke more thought in you, at least you'll be entertained far more than this waste of cellulose.","1"
"bigben-3","An excellent sci-fi action !!!","17 May 1999","An excellent, non-stop sci-fi action ever. Keanu Reeves, and the rest of the cast delivers a stand out performances. Fighting scenes, were great and will leave you breathless. Visual and sound effects are one of a kind , and will really take you off to the edge. The story is not spoon-fed on this film, but as it progresses, you'll have the wildest idea of what's going on. If you are into some sci-fi action, Well, buckle up, this is going to be some ride!","10"
"Delerium","Too much fun.","25 April 1999","This is the film that everyone is flocking to, and with good reason. I cannot recall when I have had so much fun at a movie.

Usually big blockbusters like this put me off because the need for special effects eclipses good acting and writing. Fortunately, as a pleasant surprise, this wasn't like that. Yes, Keanu Reeves still cannot act, but Laurence Fishburne and especially Carrie-Ann Moss make the movie work on that level..

The story is way out-of-this-world. A computer crook seeks the answer to the question ""What is the Matrix?"", and finds it. What he finds out is that his reality is not actually reality itself. The story gets more complicated than that, and as far as Science Fiction goes, this is as good as it gets.

The Special Effects are spectacular. To say the very least. There is plenty of fighting (Keanu's facial gestures during the fight scenes are hysterical), shooting, cool weapons, and some awe-inspiring effects shots to arouse the interest of almost any moviegoer. And all the characters look especially cool in their dark clothes and custom sunglasses. For me, the best parts of the movie were with Carrie-Ann Moss. She is definitely the character every one liked the most in ""The Matrix"". This is a movie that will keep you on the edge of your seat and leave you breathless. A guaranteed good time.","3"
"wolf_beautell","This is what sci-fi is all about.","26 October 2001","On May 1999, I read on a Spanish specialized magazine some info about a sci-fi that was cracking the US box-office. It was the second film of the Wachowski Bros., unknown at that time, and Keanu Reeves starred. It included some amazing photos, but it reminded me of another Reeves' movie, ""Johnny Mnemonic"": a sci-fi with a good premise and presentation, but irregular and not very hooking...

That film, however, had the abstract and yet attractive name of ""The Matrix"". And it had to have something special to smash the box-office so heavily.

July came, and I discovered that you mustn't make any judgments or comments about something you know very little or nothing about. Because after watching this movie, I just couldn't believe what I had just seen.

After having watched the film almost 15 times, I can list all the excellent aspects of ""The Matrix"", but the plot and the Visual FX (Oscar) obviously outstand. And it is after watching the Wachowski's first movie, ""Bound"", that you can explain many things.

These brothers really have a lot of talent. They have kept the style of their debut in ""The Matrix"", but, what's best, it is a style that's easily distinguishable. A sophisticated directing, in which cinematography is their best support. The film is actually decolored, and that matches perfectly with the film's spirit. But also their conception of thrilling stories with a touch of film-noir, that make the viewer think and wonder about the plot or message. I came out of this film with a certain paranoia, asking myself if this apparent reality is not what we think it is.

And I OBVIOUSLY know it is only fantasy, but that's one of the successes of the film: transport the viewer, and activating his brain to think for once in his life about what a film can tell us, developing in some way our imagination and getting him away from this world for at least a few minutes.

That's what's sci-fi all's about: making us think in what we know it is not real... or it's still not real. And this film can conceive hundreds of ideas and thoughts in our heads, which would be impossible to list. At least mine's...

The script as I said is original and polished, and containing its correct doses of action sequences and, what's best, a great majestic ending as I hadn't seen in many years. I'm not telling nothing about the plot because I hate spoilers (I don't want to be one), but trust me if I say it's amazing and incredible. The film keeps an excellent rhythm thanks to the Oscarized editing. There's an excellent, superb example of editing that maybe most of you haven't really recognized: the bomb arming sequence. That's editing made art. And you can see there is a good production design for the whole lot.

The directors make their part then, and also the actors do. Because unlike many other supposed great production films, such as ""Lost In Space"", in which actors are secondary, here they don't get absorbed and wiped out by the Visual FX department. Keanu Reeves may be considered by many people as a cold actor, but that's just because he doesn't fit in many comic or romantic roles he's played since ""Speed"": he's a natural born action actor. And in ""The Matrix"" he does quite a very good job indeed as Neo. But the best is Laurence Fishburne, giving Morpheus all throughout the film the mystery, patience and wisdom that surrounds the role since the start, when he's just known as a myth. Other characters are OK, but I want to remark Joe Pantoliano's job (haha, been naughty as usual!).

About FX... I am a great ""Star Wars"" fan, and ""The Phantom Menace"" and ""The Matrix"" were nominated both for 1999's best FX. However, I wanted the second one to win (another Oscar), because of their innovation and originality. Fantastic. How could someone ever imagine a man dodging bullets? Wow... The greatest thing about them is what I said before: they don't overtake the whole film, they INTEGRATE in the story, they are necessary for the plot to progress and transmit the story. The action sequences (the kung-fu training, the Hall cross-fire, the heli blast...) are superbly sequenced and and are massive. Please don't watch the film on full screen: get the Widescreen version or don't watch it. Simple and clear.

In the musical aspects, there is a correct balance between Don Davis' score (a pity it's too short) and the songs, some of the best metal, hardcore anthems of the last years, which are present because they fit with the film's spirit (they all belong to a determined genre), rather than as a mere compilation of big hits, the typical soundtrack ""structure"" these days... Sound and FX were carefully worked out, and watching (or better say listening to) it on theaters was a real pleasure...

No better end for this comment than the label many have given to the film: the perfect End Of Millenium movie, as it reflects many of the fashions of the 1990's (comic book homage and manga, Hong Kong cinema influences, cyberpunk and computer technology... ) as well as that apocalyptical sensation society experienced at the gates of 2000 (don't forget the many biblical references in the film). ""The Matrix"" apart from satifying and impress, will leave you with a quite sweet taste with the powerful epilogue gloriously accompanied by Rage Against The Machine's ""Wake Up"". Don't you dare missing it.

Thanks to the Wachowskis for reviving a genre that was almost devalued in the 1990's.

No doubt my vote's a 10 ;)","10"
"iron t","*1/2 stars","19 May 1999","I generally don't like sci-fi movies about computers and/or VR. There are always exceptions, but unfortunately there's nothing exceptional about this film. The villains are bland and non-intimidating, Keanu Reeves is a terrible lead and the matrix itself along with the characters inside of it just aren't interesting. the influence of Hong Kong cinema as well as MORTAL KOMBAT is evident in the action scenes. I still look forward to future offerings from the Wachowski Brothers because I liked ASSASSINS and BOUND, but I doubt I would watch any sequels to this.","10"

"sultan1","""out of this world action""","21 March 2000","When one watches this movie he/she must stop and think what a reality he believes they live in!!

Overall this movie is very entertaining and well thought out, the Wachowski brothers demonstrate a stroke of genius in this film. However their are a few things i didn`t like about it, first being Keanu Reeves. I really don`t care for his acting that much, he`s like the frankenstein of hollywood. He is so ""stiff"" this guy doesn`t know the meaning of expression. He`s got the same look on his face the whole movie. And what is with those guys with the stupid sunglasses on?? Their like something out of a bad ""B"" movie. And last if you don`t know much about computers or virtual reality this movie is hard to follow. Other than the little things this movie is worth seeing, Despite the poor acting from Reeves it`s still very good, thanks to the directors!! rating (best of 5 stars) .....3 1/2.....","4"
