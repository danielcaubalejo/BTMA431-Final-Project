"RJBrez","Best movie of the MCU, incredible from start to finish.","24 January 2021","Infinity War is remembered mostly for how it ends, with good reason. But for me, the entire movie is incredible. Action, humor, cinematography, heartbreak, etc. It was a culmination of 10 years of character development. The benefit of that hard work? The movie can start with incredible action and never let up. Most wouldn't agree because of the ending, but I feel it's the best movie of the MCU (so far). Endgame was awesome, infinity war was better. I think the best part of it was the fact that we had so many cool character meet ups that as fans we never thought we'd see. Thor with the guardians? Wow. Star Lord and Iron Man? Rocket and the winter soldier? We could go on and on. They also mastered the art of humor to help offset some deep deep hurt throughout the story. Thor and Star Lords interactions are pure gold. Thor calling Rocket ""rabbit"" pure gold. Dr Strange and Tony going toe to toe is worth the price of admission as well. I'm going to stop now or I could type forever.

My only goal of writing this review is to help sway some others. Try to appreciate this movie for more than the gut wrenching ending. It's nonstop awesome from beginning to end. Enjoy!","10"
"MrHeraclius","Great","23 February 2020","This movie portrays a villain that by far has been the best out of all the other Marvel antagonists. It shows his personal conflicts, his purpose, as well as his cruelty. The heroes of this film are overshadowed by this, but the ending really makes a mark on the audience.","10"
"Alex_Lo","Best Cliffhanger of all Time","5 February 2021","A meticulously planned film down to the last detail, where you can see how much love is behind it. Of course, the film delivers impressive show values and action, but besides, it is above all the interactions of the characters that are well thought out. Surprisingly, no character is neglected, and all the storylines of the previous films are brought together amazingly logical. The end is for me one of the best cliffhangers of all time, after the movie I was whacked. In the end, I have to ask myself: What more do I expect from a comic book superhero film? I was perfectly happy, so I can also give a comic book adaptation 10 out of 10 stars.","10"
"grztxks","Better than Endgame","14 March 2021","Infinity war is one of the best MCU protects. It has a great story, great acting, and awesome looking. If you aren't a Marvel fan or haven't watched most of the previous MCU movies this however, won't be something for you. Let's start with Thanos, definitely one of the best villains, he has a motive, is well played, you can even say that Infinity war tells his story and not the story of a hero. But also most of the other cast members were great in their role and again, if you love Marvel, watch this movie.","9"
"andreascaloni","EMOTIONAL ROLLER COASTER","16 February 2021","Avengers infinity war is an emotional roller coaster. Using the strength of its powerful and interesting villain, the movie successfully brings together the past 10 years of Marvel movies into a largely effective cocktail of super-heroic dramatics. Joe and Anthony Russo create a superhero movie that it's every bit the epic that it needs to be. However prepared you feel, you are not ready for Thanos. Infinity war is stunning, hilarious and heartbreaking.

Rating: 9.6.","10"
"uzair-36867","To this day one of the most impossible films to pull off","8 February 2021","This film is an achievement unto itself. Unlike any other marvel movie, this deserves to be praised for bringing around 25+ popular characters and putting them all in a cohesive narrative thats unlike anything that came before it.

At least 20 movies filled with characters and storyline nuances were successfully kept intact here yet the main character was the villain that had barely had any screentime previously, yet was written in a way that you could empathise with him and tied him into prior events like the new york invasion.

The movie itself is structured perfectly, from the perspective of Thanos putting him in a heroes journey making him go to different locations to collect the stones from different heroes weve come to know, and pairing different combinations of heroes in an insanely well written way so every character stood out and had an iconic moment to shine.

All in all the scope of this film is beyond anything that has come before it and even more so than Endgame, but they kept the narrative grounded and paced it perfectly. And the ending of the movie is one of the best endings ever. The best superhero/ comic book film of all time after The Dark Knight.","10"
"lalit28595","EPIC","27 July 2021","Infinity war seemed much better than endgame to be honest.","8"
"Abdulxoxo","A superior avengers sequel","5 February 2021","Although this film has 'Avengers' in the title, it ultimately belongs to Thanos. It's his story that drives the whole plot. He is the main characters of this movie, not any of the heroes. Thanos in my opinion is the greatest villain the MCU has ever produced. as a character he is truly threatening. In most of these movies deep down I know the hero will always win. For the first time I wasn't sure if the hero would win or not. Through the movie's entirety I was on the edge of my seat wandering whether my favourite characters would actually make it out of the movie alive. To have a villain with that level of genuine threat I thought was fantastic. I also felt slightly conflicted by his motivations. On the face of it, planning to eliminate half the universe's population is obviously a bad thing; however, after we learn his motivations for wanting to do so, I'd be lying if I didn't say I understood where he was coming from. There are two tones at play in this movie. One of them is a comical tone, mostly coming from the Guardians, Thor and Spider-Man. Predominantly though this movie is dark. Because of the level of threat created by Thanos, there is an emotional aspect to this film that will take the viewer by surprise. There are plenty of large scale action sequences, which are amazing; but there are also some shocking moments that were difficult to deal with. What I can say is that, the running time of two and a half hours absolutely flew by.

Overall, Avengers: Infinity War did well in balancing the screen time among the characters in a way that every member of the Avengers get at least a moment to shine. There are also lots of great action, comedy, performances and a massive cliffhanger at the end that is well earned.","10"
"Puroo","How MCU should have always been like","21 April 2021","It was only after the release of Infinity War that I got interest in MCU. Before that I wasn't very much into superhero movies. So a couple of months after this movie released, I skimmed through all the MCU movies from Iron Man to Black Panther. I didn't put much focus into watching them all, since most of them were just following one pattern. Iron Man? A guy gets superpowers, beats the bad guy who wanted to take over the world and saves the day. Captain America? A guy gets superpowers, beats the bad guy who wanted to take over the world and saves the day. Thor? A guy ""loses"" and then gets superpowers, beats the bad guy and saves the day. Even in The Avengers and Age of Ultron it's just ""now all those guys come together, beat the bad guy who wanted to take over the world and save the day"". But Avengers: Infinity War is very much different.

The movie begins from where the post credit scene of Thor: Ragnarok ended. Loki dies in the very beginning of the movie while he was trying to unsuccessfully deceive Thanos. This clearly shows that this movie really means business. It's not afraid of killing off the characters we have grown to like in all these years. Thor's hammer has broken so he gets a Mjolnir. Meanwhile Iron Man's team faces Thanos in yet another very brutal attack. Captain America's team is able to get out of their imprisonment after the events of Captain America: Civil War. And in spite of having a huge threat looming before them, Captain America and Iron Man still feel guilty of what happened between them previously.

Thanos is undoubtedly the biggest threat to have ever been shown in any Marvel movie, MCU or otherwise. Unlike the comics where he's just simping behind Death to show how many people he can kill, this time he actually has a motivation. And that motivation is so powerful he is even ready to sacrifice his own daughter for it. He has fought for many years to find the Infinity Stones, and there is no way that he will sacrifice his lifetime work over morals or ethics. Concepts like humanity, empathy, conscience don't hold him back anymore, as he was brought up by the Eternals and in spite of being treated as one of them, he chose to part ways. Mortals don't matter to him anymore. His ambition does.

Every scene from this movie is shot very well. The story, the colour palette, the choreography, the costumes, the score, everything is absolutely perfect. The only part I had a problem with earlier was when Starlord learnt about Thanos having killed Gamora and then he punches Thanos till he wakes up and is stopped. But later on I realised that Starlord has always been an emotional crybaby, and this kind of a behaviour is absolutely suited on him. He cannot be expected to think rationally, considering his track record in both the previous Guardians of the Galaxy movies.

And finally in the end when Thanos snapped his finger, half the universe was gone. Even though we did know that they are all going to come back, the emotions that were conveyed by the characters clearly gave signs that something bad will surely happen in the end. I won't be getting into the spoilers because I want to keep this review spoiler free. So if you haven't seen it yet, don't just see who all disappear. Notice how they react when they disappear.

Avengers: Infinity War is the kind of the Avengers movie I always wanted to see. I really don't like how The Avengers and Age of Ultron have aged so terribly (just like Joss Whedon's credibility lol) because of how campy they look by today's standards. Sure they did hold their legacy back then, but Infinity War will hold it for decades. It's the best MCU movie of all time.","10"

The actions better The writings better The dialogues better The cgi is better More shocks and more emotional. Watching both in the cinema , the reactions to this in cinema was unbelievable compared to endgame. Dont get me wrong endgame is good but to say its the best marvel film is jus marvel fan boys being stupid. I just dont see how people are saying endgame is the best marvel film when theres clearly other marvel films better than it! But trust me this is the film that changed the mcu , lol maybe it because i wanted them to lose because thanos is badass!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","10"
"Jesper2801","Somehow they pulled this off","26 April 2018","I consider myself a big comic book marvel fan. My favorite films from the franchise so far, are Cap. American: Winter Soldier and Thor: Ragnarok. As this movie was directed by the same guys as Winter Soldier and Civil War, I went into this movie with sky-high expectations.

I am gonna keep this brief: Avengers: Infinity War blew me away! If I should mention just one thing that really amazed me was the character of Thanos. He is so well developed and makes for a super interesting and complex villain. As an audience, we are actually capable of sympathizing with a guy, who wants to kill off half of the universe. It's not about power or dominance. It's about preserving life in a Universe with finite resources - a goal with leads him (and the avengers) into several interesting moral dilemmas.

I agree with the other reviews here. This movie is such a beautiful calamity of 10 years of the best superhero entertainment there is. Thinking about it, I can't really grasp how the director pulled this off. So many well developed characters from different story lines are working together in a true cinematic symphony.

I give this movie my highest recommendations. It's a must-see for anyone with just a remote interest in the franchise.","10"
"shawneofthedead","This movie will blow your mind and break your heart - and make you desperate to go back for more. Brave, brilliant and better than it has any right to be.","25 April 2018","Over the past decade, Marvel has earned itself the benefit of the doubt. The studio has consistently delivered smart, funny, brave films that both embrace and transcend their comic-book origins. The 18 blockbuster movies produced since Iron Man first blasted off into the stratosphere in 2008 have not only reinvented superhero films as a genre - they've helped to legitimise it. Indeed, Marvel's two most recent films - Thor: Ragnarok and Black Panther - have received the kind of accolades usually reserved for edgy arthouse flicks.

And yet, it's perfectly reasonable to be apprehensive about Avengers: Infinity War. This is a blockbuster film that's been ten years in the making, its plot hinted at and scattered throughout 18 other movies. It features 30 or so characters, each with their own complex backstories and motivations. And all of them are coming together in a bid to stop a giant purple alien dude from destroying the universe. It sounds ridiculous, and feels impossible.

But that's precisely what makes the final product such a monumental achievement. Masterfully directed by Anthony and Joe Russo, Infinity War is bold, brainy filmmaking at its very best: the kind that will lift your spirits, blow your mind and shatter your soul - occasionally in the same scene. It demonstrates on an epic scale what Marvel has known all along: that special effects and tightly choreographed action are there to serve the story. For all its blockbuster spectacle (and there's almost too much of that), the film works because it's anchored by the heart, humour and humanity of its characters.

The film's basic plot is simple: Thanos (played via motion-capture by Josh Brolin), intergalactic purveyor of death and destruction, has long been on the hunt for the six Infinity Stones that will give him complete control over the elemental building blocks of the universe. He dispatches his acolytes to Earth to retrieve the Time Stone, currently in the possession of Dr. Stephen Strange (Benedict Cumberbatch), and carve the Mind Stone out of the forehead of Vision (Paul Bettany). It's a literal existential threat so terrifying that all the heroes we've come to know and love - from the Avengers to the Guardians of the Galaxy - must put aside their differences and unite against a common foe.

From the outset, it's immediately clear that neither the film's directors nor screenwriters (Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely) are interested in playing it safe. Most other superhero films are bled of high stakes - the hero in the title might suffer untold trauma, but it's a super-safe bet that he or she will make it to the end alive. There's no such guarantee here. Within the first ten minutes, we are confronted with the dark, twisted depths to which Thanos and his acolytes in the Black Order will sink in order to achieve their goals. Death, as well as genuine loss and sacrifice, is intrinsic to the narrative drumbeat that drives Infinity War ever forward, and the film is all the better for it.

That's not to say the movie is a morbid and depressing experience. What's so impressive about Infinity War is how it expertly juggles its constantly shifting tones and moods. When it's funny (and it very often is), it's deeply, truly funny. The film finds maximum joy in flinging characters together with merry abandon, mixing and matching ones you'd never have expected to share scenes or trade banter. Peter Quill (Chris Pratt) is floored by Thor's (Chris Hemsworth) godly muscles. Bruce Banner (Mark Ruffalo) is charmed by the wit and intelligence of Shuri (Letitia Wright). And it'd be impossible to not be utterly delighted by Peter Dinklage's inspired cameo. It's a blithely tongue-in-cheek sensibility shared by Marvel's best comic books, which understand that humour can make you care when it really counts.

And, boy, does Infinity War make it count. There are many heartbreakingly human moments threaded throughout the film: from the charming surrogate father-son dynamic shared by Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr) and Peter Parker (Tom Holland), to the undeniable love that ties Vision and Wanda Maximoff (Elizabeth Olsen) together. In many ways, the film stands as a testament to the human capacity not just to love, but to love fiercely and beyond all logic. It's right there when the unfailingly noble Steve Rogers (Chris Evans) declares, ""We don't trade lives"", even when giving up one could save billions.

There's even a chilling echo of it in Thanos himself. A lesser film would have turned Thanos into a one-dimensional villain, much the way he's all monster and maniac in the comic books. In Infinity War, however, Thanos' end goal is surprisingly relevant when it comes to thinking and talking about the staggeringly overpopulated world in which we live today. There is, as it turns out, method to Thanos' madness. It makes the tragic twists and turns in his relationships with his estranged adopted daughters, Gamora (Zoe Saldana) and Nebula (Karen Gillan), all the more unsettling.

For the most part, Infinity War does justice, too, to the many heroes who have been assembled for the film. The Russo brothers displayed great skill at interweaving multiple perspectives and character trajectories in Captain America: Civil War, and they do so again here, with twice as many characters. Even the most minor of supporting players, like Don Cheadle's James Rhodes/War Machine, are given story beats that land. It helps that Marvel has always taken care to cast genuinely good actors in roles that might otherwise come off as silly and slight.

Even so, there are a few standouts amongst this enormous and enormously talented cast. Emotionally speaking, this is Downey's film. He plays every note of Tony's reluctant courage and bone-deep trauma, as he embarks on what he's convinced is a suicide mission. He's ably matched by Cumberbatch, who finds vulnerability even in his character's most cunning and calculative move. Hemsworth, meanwhile, is given free rein to import the big-hearted comedic swagger of Thor: Ragnarok into this film - while also layering it with a deeply-felt, jagged grief for the losses he has suffered at the hands of Thanos and the universe.

In a film with so many moving parts, some elements don't work quite as well. A couple of characters that you might have expected to be right at the forefront - including an original Avenger or two - fade into the background. The film tumbles from dizzying fight scene to dizzying fight scene, and while most of them are fantastically choreographed, there are some purely dumb moments that literally revolve around attempts to prevent Thanos from clenching his fist. In effect, this is a superhero mêlée that's part over-the-top and part overkill, and might prove too much for those who don't already care for this franchise and the characters in it.

Minor quibbles aside, though, Infinity War is yet another step in the right direction for Marvel. It continues the studio's tradition of placing a premium on rich, complex storytelling that respects both its characters and its audiences. But it also refuses to make things easy for itself. The film ends even more bravely than it began, with a final ten minutes that will haunt and horrify you in equal measure. It's a stroke of bold, brilliant genius - a narrative risk so audacious that you'll want to follow Marvel wherever it goes next.","8"
"Filmdokter","It all led to this: superhero film at its best","25 October 2021","#MCUrewatch. A confrontation that has been in the making for dozen of films. Thanos finally arrives. And boy he doesn't disappoint. He is by far the most interesting MCU villain: strong, nuanced and perfectly performed by Brolin. This really is HIS movie. The film has a train like speed and one impressive sequence is followed by the next. Especially the banter between Thor and the Guardians and Iron Man vs Strange is what makes these Marvel films so fun to watch. Great climatic ending (a well ending...). As a stand-alone film it might not be as good as some others but as a showcase of what MCU has achieved, it has never been better.","9"
"Platypuschow","Avengers Infinity War: Marvels crown jewel","4 May 2018","Let me be clear Infinity War is not flawless, it has its faults but thankfully they are overshadowed by two hours of awesomeness.

Every movie in the Marvel universe for the last decade has ultimately been building up to this therefore expectations were through the roof and for the most part it delivers.

Almost every character from the MCU teams up to face its most dangerous foe yet, the mad titan himself Thanos and if you know anything about the comics then going in you'd know to brace yourself for heartache.

With all the hype as to who wouldn't survive the film I'm left wondering just how many deaths are permanent, this is a superhero universe after all so never say never.

Though the story and Thanos's motivations differ from the comic this can be forgiven as the new story is wafer thin but competent.

As you can imagine one of the most exciting things about Infinity War was uniting heroes we've never seen side by side and that certainly delivers on all fronts. The action is thick and fast, despite the dark overtone we have plenty of comedy and teenage Groot didn't ruin the film like I feared he would.

Obviously this is not a big finale and merely a high profile chapter in a much larger story but the movie is highly climatic regardless.

I am saddened that this wasn't a two parter, alike Civil War (2016) this was a huge story and perhaps should have been broken up across movies.

Infinity War is a contender for the best Marvel movie and instead of feeling burnt out after the never ending stream of films this has wet my appetite for more and I can't wait for the next film.

Excellent stuff, though where in the blue hell was Ant Man?

The Good:

Children of Thanos

Thanos

All out action as expected

Ties everything together nicely

The Bad:

Peter Dinklage (Never thought I'd say that)

So many characters were spread too thin

Things I Learnt From This Movie:

If Thanos and Cable ever meet its going to be super weird

Dishonest footage/photos are commonplace now (Look up the footage of Hulk in Wakanda running with the rest of the team) Seriously, never happened.

Somewhere out there right now are DC fans claiming this is a bad film","10"
"cartermain","A film that pulled off the impossible.","20 January 2021","Avengers: Infinity War is a film that should be utter crap. A franchise stretching almost twenty films is unheard of. And making a great and satisfying climax to that franchise is nearly impossible. Considering how many characters Marvel had to juggle together with this movie, there was almost no way this movie wouldn't suck.

But it didn't. Marvel pulled it off. All of the characters were balanced seemingly effortlessly. The action was amazing. The characters were funny. The story was compelling. Marvel made what should've been an overcrowded mess into one of the best superhero films ever made.

This movie will sit you on the edge of your seat for 2 and a half hours. Hats off to the writers, directors, producers, and Marvel Studios.

"TheLittleSongbird","Extravagant clash of the titans","2 May 2018","Have found myself liking or loving a lot of Marvel's previous work, while finding a few faults with most. It is very easy on the most part to see why they are highly regarded critically, though those more critical of their work have raised criticisms that can be agreed with by me.

Loved the first 'Avengers' film, while 'Age of Ultron' was more problematic and generally a lesser Marvel effort though still having a good deal to admire. 'Infinity War' for me was the best one, or the one enjoyed most. Would also go far to say it's one of Marvel's overall best, and a perfect example of how to do a superhero film and how to balance a large cast of characters and a lot going on. Can totally see why it has been so positively reviewed and it deserves the positive hype from personal opinion, though would hesitate in calling it flawless or one of the best films ever.

More could have been done with the very end, which felt like it ended a little too suddenly without resolving everything to full effect. It may very well have been leaving room for a follow-up, but to me it's always been dangerous somewhat to do that just in case a follow-up doesn't happen.

Scarlett Johansson also has far too little to do, with too short screen-time. Black Widow is the only character to me who felt underdeveloped and Johansson struggles to do much with it.

However, the rest of the cast are spot on. A big shout out goes to Josh Brolin, who makes for a menacing and melancholic Thanos. Speaking of Thanos, Marvel have tended to underwhelm with their villains, underwriting them and giving them vague or inconsistent motivations. Thanos is easily one of the best Marvel villains along with Hela, one of the most interesting and of surprising complexity where he is a threat but one can see his point of view.

Robert Downey Jnr, Chris Evans and Chris Hemsworth are also standouts of a near-uniformly great all-star cast. There are a lot of characters here, but somehow on the most part it didn't feel like there were too many (a big danger with films with many characters and a trap fallen into quite a lot). They hold a lot of intrigue and manage not to be too sided and true to character.

Likewise, the story is very eventful with a busy main story and several subplots. Yet it didn't feel sprawling and managed to make sense and never lose engagement. Basically it's a non-stop thrill-ride and tautly paced, with some reveals that leaves one gasping, twists that genuinely shock, rousing entrances and some of the finest action sequences of any Marvel film or any film recently, that are truly exciting and big in scale without being too noisy or exhausting. The climax is truly epic, in scale, spectacle, thrills and emotion.

'Avengers: Infinity War' hugely impresses in the script too, with snappy banter, hilarious quips (along with 'Thor: Ragnarok' this is one of the funniest Marvel films, Thor has the best of it), tension and an emotional poignancy not seen to this extent or as strongly in Marvel films. It's all intelligently handled and the humour didn't feel misplaced or inappropriate to me, this is a Marvel film that delivers on the spectacle and thrills while also having brains and heart.

Marvel never disappoints when it comes to the production values. 'Avengers: Infinity War' is not an exception. It's beautifully and atmospherically designed, slickly filmed and edited and the special effects, not overused or abused, are some of the most extravagant and spectacular for any film seen recently. It's tightly directed and dynamically and rousingly scored.

Overall, an excellent film and one of my standout viewings of all the films seen so far from the first half, and overall, of 2018. 9/10 Bethany Cox","8"

"garethvk","A Summer Film That IS Even Better Than The Hype","24 April 2018","Summer movies often hype themselves as spectacular events not to be missed and their ad campaigns use words like ""epic"", ""spectacle"", and ""smash"" as ways to build the hype to increase advanced box office sales. The summer 2018 film season kicks off in a big way with ""Avengers: Infinity War"" and it is the rare summer film that exceeds is lofty expectations and delivers a crowning achievement for the Marvel Cinematic Universe. When Thanos (Josh Brolin), embarks on a deadly campaign to find and possess the Infinity Stones, he leaves a path of death and destruction in his path. When his pursuit leading him to Earth, Bruce Banner (Mark Ruffalo), and Doctor Strange (Benedict Cumberbatch), who enlist a reluctant Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.), to the cause just as the minions of Thanos arrive. With The Avengers fractured and scattered following the events of ""Captain America: Civil War"" the teams find themselves dealing with the threat in various groups as fate steps in to divide many key members of the team. This allows for a great entry by the Guardians of the Galaxy and allows the film to take a very enjoyable path. Essentially the movie weaves separate storylines into one cohesive and very satisfying epic. You have a story with the Guardians as well as one with many of the key Avengers, as well as others with characters old and new. As such it is like a Guardians, Avengers, and Marvel film all rolled into one and each one supports the other very well yet has the charm and identity you would expect. While the tone is very dark as you would expect with literally half of the known universe facing destruction, there is also some solid humor in the film that never once undermines the story or pacing. Naturally the effects are stunning as you would expect as Marvel has put a significant amount of money into the film and it shows in every eye-popping action sequence. What really impressed me the most was that the Russo Brothers never let the FX of the film overshadow the characters and with a very large cast, it was nice to see everyone got their moment and you did not see members of the cast trying to one up each other. There are some real surprise moments along the way and the action is easily the best of any Marvel film to date. Many fans had expressed disappointment with ""Avengers: Age of Ultron"" for me this film is significantly better than the prior film and is everything that a Marvel fan would want in a film. I was also surprised by how well Thanos was portrayed as while you hopefully will not agree with his deductions and methods; you could actually understand his motivations and it help him transcend from the usual megalomaniacs which are so common in films of his type. I am really looking forward to seeing what comes next and make sure you stay through the credits for a bonus scene. Believe the hype, ""Avengers: Infinity War"" is an epic not to be missed and is an example of what a summer event film should be. 5 stars out of 5","10"

"jordanthomas_2009-346-914758","Breathtaking","12 June 2018","Infinity War does a brilliant job by seamlessly combining the last few films together. It picks up where Ragnarok left off on the space shuttle with Thor, Loki, Hulk and all the remaining Asgardians. It opens with a distress call as Thanos and his Dark Order have slaughtered most of passengers including some of the remaining Asgardians. He interrogates Thor and beats Hulk so bad he is too scared to ever turn green again. A defeated Hulk/Bruce Banner is then transported to Doctor Strange's Sanctum Sanctorum so he can warn him of Thanos' arrival. It is down to Doctor Strange, Wong, Tony Stark and Spider Man to prevent Thanos' evil minions from destroying New York and taking the time stone. It's a thrilling action sequence that introduces Starks cool new nano-bot armour that creates its own swords and shields.

Thanos has been teased since 2012 and the wait has paid off here as he is by far one of the best villains. The story is more about him achieving his goals which is refreshing to see as the villains are normally sidelined in these films. He is so determined to get all six gems, each gem making him stronger. The Avengers and Guardians have to race against time to stop him from finding all six. One sequence on his home planet 'Titan' is worth mentioning and like most of the film, it is breathtaking and tense. His crew (Dark Order) also seem unbeatable as they battle the rest of the Avengers in Wakanda with their alien army which also proves difficult. Thanos gets some interesting backstory, it would have been even better if the menacing Dark Order got some backstory themselves as we never really understand them or their motivations.

Even though it enters familiar ground, it is often done differently and most of the time it's unpredictable. It's full of surprises and twists which will leave you exhausted by the end. Although Infinity War feels over stuffed with characters and storylines, the Russo Brothers do an exceptional job by giving each character enough to do. Its great to see some focus on characters like Gamora and Thor as previous films have kept it prominently on characters Iron Man, Hulk and Captain America. That's not to say they don't get anything to do because they do, it's just not as much as usual. This entry really does require you to see all of the ones before it as it can become confusing. They often call back to previous events and storylines, so it's a better experience if you are familiar with all of them. There are also so many fun references like Rocket Racoon's need for artificial limbs, Thor's new haircut and Drax's constant quips.

There are too many visual effects shots which could have been avoided using practical effects. The CGI shots don't look bad, but sometimes they can be distracting. However it's a technique that is quicker than any other, and with studio films of this scale that's just a small price to pay. The action scenes are so well directed accompanied by a music score by Alan Silvestri who always adds that extra level of excitement to them. It is a relief to say Infinity War runs well over 2 hours 30 minutes which is the longest Marvel film. There is no point saying its ""baggy"" or ""overlong"" as fans of the franchise will greatly appreciate this and with so much going on the runtime is justified.","9"

This went where no other mainstream superhero movie went and killed everyone, allowing Thanos to win. The biggest flaw I can think of with this is that there are other ways to achieve Thanos's goal without killing everyone, and there were some plot grievances like Corvus Glaive somehow sneaking all the way to Shuri in the battle unnoticed, and them not just digging under Wakanda's shield to begin with (they did later in the battle). Also, destroying an infinity stone should cause the universe to collapse in some way as explained in Endgame about taking stones from universes, so I'm not sure why none of the main cast raised this issue when destroying the mind stone was ratified into their gameplan (they might have not known better, though). Otherwise, great pacing, a great soundtrack, crisp visuals, seamless comedy, a compelling and humanized villain, and a haunting ending.","8"
"Horst_In_Translation","Taking the genre to the next level","4 May 2018","""Avengers: Infinity War"" is the newest addition to the now already long-running Marvel superhero franchise and in my opinion this movie is a definite contender for best installment of all. These 2.5 hours were directed by Anthony and Joe Russo, who started with Community and then entered the Marvel world with Captain America and for this new Avengers movie, they reunited with writers Markus and McFeely. Let me start by saying that I was a bit critical about previous Marvel films, especially Avengers movies as they frequently united way too many characters without properly elaborating on most of them. And the stories about them failing on their own against the villains, but eventually managing to succeed as a team after overcoming their conflicts and differences was gently-speaking not too new or creative. But this one here is different. Almost all characters have their moment to shine really, well Black Widow could have had a little more than that Hulk moment, but she is the exception. Even those they added new now like the Guardians of the Galaxy and the characters from Black Panther add their fair share of material worth seeing. Peter Dinklage is pretty interesting and memorable as a dwarf (yep!), the stories on romance and male friendship are nice to watch too and even Benedict Cumberbatch is tolerable for once.

I think that movies, especially superhero films, often stand and fall with their villain and here we have Thanos played by Josh Brolin as the main antagonist and he is just utterly great and memorable. Maybe you could say that his (self-perceived godly) ambition to erase half the planet is a bit too mathematical, but everything else about him is outstanding and I have virtually no doubt that he will end up as one of the most memorable villains of the movie year 2018. Even in his weaker story lines, like the part with his ""daughter"" that does not feel entirely convincing early on, he shines and elevates the material to a level where it really saves this entire part of the movie. So yes huge thumbs-up for Thanos. And another thumbs-up for virtually everybody else. Except Starlord unfortunately because honestly his grief may have been huge, but the how he basically destroyed the Avengers' effort that had them close to victory was just ridiculous, so to some extent you can blame him for billions of people dying eventually. Or are they really? I believe there will be a new Avengers movie in 2019 by the same team of writers and directors, so the ending may not be as finite as it seemed to be. You can almost call it a duology. Is all hope really lost? We have to wait a year and see. Honestly I doubt it because there will be a Black Panther 2 for sure at some point, so I guess they will find a way to get things right again for the good guys. It will also be interesting to see if they bring back those who died earlier too, not just those that vanished at the very end.

Anyway, this film we have here is one that will make a huge impact come awards season 2018/2019 in all technical categories, especially Visual Effects where it is maybe a lock for an Oscar nomination with a great chance to take home the win. Another thing I would like to say about this film is that it is also a triumph in terms of the comedy, which is not always a success in Marvel works. But here there are some really hilarious scenes and as many bad things as I said about Chris Pratt's character earlier, his banter with Thor is hilarious. And there is a lot more of course. Drax is also amazing in that one scene where he stands there doing nothing. You will recognize many other pretty funny moments when you see them. So what is it that made this film so amazing. I would say it is the script this time. It is bold, daring and not scared of anything while never becoming too absurd or unrealistic (and yes that is possible for superhero films *cough* Deadpool *cough* glad we did not see him in here). But the outcome here is the exact opposite of too many cooks spoiling the broth, both character- and writer-wise. You absolutely do not want to miss out on this one and good thing is you really don't need to have seen any other Avengers or Marvel movie to appreciate the quality we were given with this one. I am truly very curious about the sequel and cannot wait to check it out. This third Avengers movie is my favorite 2018 release at the point of April. And it has a huge chance to stay in the top5, probably top3 until the end of the year. It never dragged, which is always a success for this running time and it gets better by the minute the longer it goes. And the way things turn out eventually reminded me a bit of the last Wolverine film ""Logan"". Happy endings are no longer essential. Realism is what it is all about. Highly highly recommended.","10"
"Dello_","The standard for every crossover movie","6 September 2021","Though this is not my favorite MCU movie I think ""Infinity War"" is the best product the studio produced both because of the really high scope and because of the execution itself. I think the movie is so great because it contains almost everything you could ask (action, humor, heartfelt moments, great CGI, fantastic score, ...) in a balanced way. Furthermore even if the culmination of the MCU happened in ""Endgame"" it was here that every piece of the Marvel Universe was brought together for the first time. I remember to have an astronomical hype at the time and the fact that the movie resulted to be even better than what my hype was making envisioning me is something that I highly count. But the best part of this movie is its villain, Thanos. I loved him (and still do) and he absolutely stole the show and sets up Endgame perfectly. Clearly ""Infinity War"" has its flaws and I am not here to say it is perfect like a 10/10 rating would usually mean, but for what it represented at the time and the way it was delivered I think we couldn't have asked for more.","9"
"pranayjalvi","Infinity War deserved to be the best and grand","25 April 2018","The most anticipated movie of 2018 has now been released and my word, I have to say that Infinity War was brilliant on each scale, whether be its story, Visual Effects and the ensemble cast consisting all the Marvel characters. Every Marvel Fan needs to watch the movie as words cannot describe the magnificience of the movie.","7"
"pjgs200","An objective review of Avengers: Infinity War","12 May 2018","I don't mean to be negative here, but Avengers: Infinity War's 8.9 on IMDb is entirely undeserved. Marvel superfan or not, this movie has nothing on films like The Dark Night, La La Land, Pulp Fiction, or Inception, all films which it either outranks based on it's 8.9 rating or comes close to. I get that there was an insane amount of hype around this film, and it's awesome to see our favorite Marvel characters come together (The Guardians of the Galaxy, Thor, Spiderman, Captain America, Black Panther, etc.), but we shouldn't let our excitement over all of our favorite characters coming together cloud the fact that ""Avengers: Infinity War"" is an overly long movie that relies on cheap, unbelievable deaths to generate excitement and that isn't particularly well written or edited. I commend the directors and writers on being able to successfully interweave so many stories, but the movie just felt too long.

It's fight scene after fight scene, and while the performances are good and the script is pretty funny, the film isn't really original and its only redeeming factor is that it's full of characters we all know and love. It's funny to see Thor poke fun at the Guardians of the Galaxy and to see Iron Man and Spiderman interact with Doctor Strange, but when we look at the film objectively, it's really just a standard superhero film (with more superheroes than normal) that relies on cheap plot twists to generate excitement and emotion. No matter how much we love Marvel, we all know that there's no way any of the characters who ""died"" are actually going to die. The filmmakers expect us to believe that Black Panther (who just made Marvel over one billion dollars), Spiderman, and the Guardians of the Galaxy have all met the end of their respective stories, even when there are publicly announced sequels for all three franchises. I hate to say it, but all the character deaths at the end are just there for shock value, and it's cheap.

From a technical perspective, the fight scenes are directed well, but that's about it. The editing isn't particularly great and the film feels too long at 2 hours and 40 minutes. I feel like half of the time spent hopping from planet to planet could have been cut and the movie would have been about as good if not better.

OVERALL: ""Avengers: Infinity War"" could have been amazing, but it's too long and relies on cheap deaths to generate hype. This film is not deserving of it's 8.9 rating on IMDb. I think that Captain America: Civil War was a *much* better movie.

"MrDHWong","A celebration of ten wonderful years of entertainment and overall fun","25 April 2018","Avengers: Infinity War is the seventh film in Phase Three of the Marvel Cinematic Universe and the nineteenth film overall. Directed by The Russo Brothers (Captain America: The Winter Soldier and Captain America: Civil War), it is truly a terrific film of its kind and a near-perfect culmination of everything the cinematic universe has been building up to for ten years.

Two years after the events of Captain America: Civil War, the Avengers team remain a fractured group of heroes, with some completely dropping off the radar altogether. However, one day, the powerful intergalactic tyrant Thanos (Josh Brolin) arrives on Earth to complete his collection of Infinity Stones, which upon acquiring all six, will allow him to control half of the known universe. With time quickly running out, The Avengers must reunite and team up with the Guardians of the Galaxy to put an end to Thanos' unquenchable thirst for power.

Avengers: Infinity War is more than a typical MCU superhero film. It is a celebration of ten wonderful years of entertainment and overall fun. While the film does struggle with some tonal shifts during the first act, its brilliant action scenes and clever dialogue more than make up for these shortcomings. The film's ending will be overwhelming to some and most likely will divide fans over how it is executed. Directors Anthony and Joe Russo do a superb job developing Thanos' personality outside of simply wanting universal domination. His motivations feel somewhat morally ambiguous and at times even make him seem sympathetic. Despite the film's darker tone, there are still some hilarious scenes of banter among the heroes, particularly between Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr) and Steven Strange (Benedict Cumberbatch). As is the tradition, be sure to stay after the credits for one bonus scene.

I rate it a solid 9/10","5"
"lisafordeay","Good but too bloated","6 May 2018","OK I loved the sequel Age Of Ultron as it focused more on the Avengers themselves but I will get into the negatives later.

Avengers Infinity War is the prequel to the 2015 film and tells the story of the Avengers who are no longer working together and must try and defeat a giant half monster/ human called Thanos (Josh Brolin)who wants the stones known as the infinity stones. Each one makes Thano more powerful and it's up to the team to somewhat get back together and join the guardians of the galaxy(Chris Pratt, Zoe Salvada,Bradley Cooper). Will they stop Thano?

The special effects are very good along with the cinematography. However the film itself is 50/50 for me. The downside of this film was that there was too much going on and I was so dissapointed with the hulk played by Mark Ruffalo as you never see him as the hulk at all this time. Jermery Renner who played Hawkeye was absent in this and the film was so hard to follow e.g what happened to Thor's eye. I felt like it was skipping or whatever.

Overall do yourselves a favour and watch the 2015 version instead or try and watch all the Marvel films to get used to the story.

Also has Tom Holland,Robert Downey Jr,Gwyneth Paltrow,Don Cheadle,Chadwick Boseman,Karen Gillian and even a cameo by Stan Lee.","2"

As usual, story-line was confusing, too wrapped up with own issues other than saving peoples lives, which is what these films have missed the point of over time, not to mention bad editing, & poorly executed narrative. They weren't speaking English as I had no idea what they were talking about half the time or should I say most of the time! Maybe if they cut the cra[ & made the film snappy it probably would've made more sense & instead of dragging the climax out in such a choppy changing like manner (what climax, I'll get to that later) anyway, as well as repetitive, the climaxes ending was all over the place! Bad guys gets ""killed"", comes back again, gets killed, comes back, more chopping & changing, then a slow dragged out scene, then back to the climax! The end outstayed its welcome, & well as soon as it got to the 2hr mark, you knew they need to wrap it up, but it took another 40mins to do that! Damn!

Avengers 1 was the best superhero movie ever made period. Avengers 2 fell into the problem I just noted. Avengers 3 has just way too many important characters, story lines, plot twists, issues, blah blah blah. And the motivation and plan for the villain is about as sophomoric as you can get.

I see that as a self-destructive element in the story, because well... nothing matters.

Whats good in this movie is, it felt more grounded to me. In other superhero movies i usually get these moments of ""wait, where are we?"" or ""wait, why are they fighting again?"". This one felt more compact to me. GOOD JOB!

"blparker-31738","The amount of people that don't understand the movie is astonishing","27 April 2018","All the reviews that say this movie has no plot are either trolls, idiots, or didn't are to take the time to watch previous marvel movies. Every single one of those ratings and reviews should be taken down and not added to the rating for Infinity War because of their fundamental lack of understanding. It's like coming in and watching the last 2 minutes of an hour long drama show and saying this episode sucks because it has no plot. It's utterly ridiculous!

There have been 31 marvel movies leading up to this point. All 31 has have some plot that leads to infinity war. Infinity War IS the end game movie. There is nothing left to explain, nothing left to discuss, it is all-out fight for control of the most powerful items in existence, the infinity stones. There have been 31 movies to explain in someway the power of these stones and/or the heroes that come together to fight Thanos in this movie. It's like a long game of chess where Thanos finally makes his move, and it's a huge one.

So I beg of any of you who reads this. Don't listen to anyone who says this movie has no plot, has no reason and is only fighting. They aren't worth listening to, Infinity Wars has roughly 60 hours of plot from 31 precious movies leading up to this monumental fight for life or death, and the movie is done to near perfection. The movie is glorious, the CGI is fantastic, the battles are awe-inspiring, and Thanos is made worth of your fear from the very beginning. He is truly the Mad Titan that captures your heart and crushes it right in front of your eyes. Anyone who doesn't think this clearly didn't see the same movie.","6"
"brianjohnson-20043","Solid Jokes, Solid Heroes, Good Aesthetic, Stupid story and villian","8 May 2018","I like the stand alone Marvel Movies more, but it almost feels like an obligation to see all of them if you want to see the ones you like, or else, you'll have no idea what's going on when the ones you like continue. I'm prefacing with that so readers understand that I'm not just a hater.

First off, I want to address the villain. My opinions I've heard/read asserted Thanos is a strength to this film. I found that to be the opposite.

I found his motivation more convincing than the Justice League villains, who were so bad, I can't even really remember their motivation, and a bit less stupid than Ultron who was the AI thing that might have seemed like a real issue in the 80s or early 90s. But today it seems clear that the misuse of technology to our demise is going to be gradual rather than sudden.

The vulture from Spider Man Homecoming, or the villain from Black Panther were much more compelling In my Opinion. Thanos felt like a cartoonish version of the villain Samuel Jackson played in the first Kingsmen movie. Except that Thanos didn't work like how the similar villain in Kingsmen worked.

They're both trying to save everything by killing off a sizable chunk of people before people kill their planet or planets. The difference is that Thanos wants to randomly and painlessly kill half of everyone everywhere, and Valentine wants to save a few chosen wealthy friends. Overpopulation and idiocy is a real issue on earth. But in the Marvel Universe, it's a planet to planet issue, and it seems stupid to just kill off half of everyone on some planets which might not have any actual problems. And this issue is never even questioned by any of the characters. They just try to play the card that Thanos should try to save people, not kill them. Not a bad point. But it didn't seem like any of the Avengers seemed even remotely interesting in addressing Thanos' concerns. Not even Gamora.

Plus, if someone gets two or three of these infinity stones, let alone all of them, can't they use that person yield that power to do good rather than evil? It just didn't settle very well with me. Loki was a much better villain because he's like the Joker. Destruction and chaos is his high. That's a real thing in people that an audience should be able to understand.

The strength of this movie is the humor. I laughed repeatedly and was certainly entertained in that regard. It also, no surprise, looked really good and had great music. I was surprised how well the Guardians characters fit in with the other Marvel characters. But to me a feature length movie, even a short one, can't be good if the story isn't compelling. And this movie is long.

If the villain's story was halfway decent it would have stood a good shot, but just getting characters together that one likes and making a spectacle, won't make up for giant flaws in the story.

I didn't expect everything to be concluded, because these movie all set up more to come. But with an ending like this film has, it should have been advertised as the 1st part of 2 movies from the start. I really don't get how the next Ant-Man movie is going to work after what happened here in Inifinity Wars. Unless it takes place prior to the events of Infinity Wars, I don't see it working. But if that's the case, why not have Ant Man 2 come out first?

I'm not a comic book reader. I open them up, look at the picture and think:

""I'm supposed to take these silly-looking overdramatic characters and pictures seriously? Do other people see how goofy these images are? What am I, 10?

But I've heard from friends who like the comics that much of the events of this film unfolded as they did to stay loyal to the events in the comics. My response to this is that every form of entertainment's first goal should be to work within its own form. To me Infinity Wars' narrative doesn't work for a feature movie. I was upset with how it ended. And I know I wasn't the only one in the theater upset. And I find it disgraceful that, at the moment, this movie has 8.9 stars out of 10. Black Panther doesn't have 8 and it's actually good. What's wrong with people? This movie is currently ranked ahead of movies like 12 Angry Men, Casablanca, Dr. Strangelove, It's a Wonder life, American History X, The Prestige or Every Single Pixar Movie. What is wrong with people?","2"

Marvel have a different way of building product, and the Avengers universe has spread over many instalments. And while the last two Captain America films have escaped popcorn and can be seen as real achievements, the Avengers have kept to a more Disney comfortable spectacle.

We ride from fight to fight, changing scenes but staying firmly locked into a fantasy present with no solid meaning, much better explored in comics. But even this limited form is broken here - with the idea of a villain who is neither camp nor fickle. By developing Thanos the film actually makes it's normal limitations feel worse. There is an empty parade that is supposed to support the narrative but can only manage sputtering buddy humour and colourful mayhem. From this thin gruel we are expected to construct a framework in our minds to justify the story. While enjoying the expensive antics, the attention wanders through the inevitable plot holes, pointless scenes and rolodex of similar heroes.

Better to keep to the single dimensional tunnel of the continuous spectacle, or dare to write a proper film. This fails to do either, rendering the final scenes like a Monty Python sketch without a punchline.","5"

"nodlimax","To long - to many characters - lacks focus - boring","28 April 2018","This movie has various problems and the first major one is the lack of focus. We keep jumping around to various places and I can't even keep where all of them were.

One moment, we are on earth, the next on Knowhere, the next on some other planet to which I can't even remember the name. And it's not just the places, it's the characters too. There isn't one lead or even 5 lead characters we can somewhat focus on. They try to focus on everybody which means nobody is the actual lead character. There was another movie that was initially praised but in the end was heavily critizised for lacking focus on a real main character - that was Star Wars The Phantom Menace. I see the same problem in this regard here with the story.

Due to the lack of focus the movie also has pacing issues and therefore to me felt boring. And then this goes on for 150 minutes. And the biggest problem at the end of the movie is that there is no payoff....

...ok stop, I have to correct myself there. The payoff (here comes the spoiler) is, that the bad guy wins. Everything the heroes tried to do failed and you know what I was actually kinda rooting for Thanos, because I couldn't care enough about any of the other characters. He became the protagonist for me, which makes me feel terrible as well, because he kills half the population in the universe.

In the end I was just happy that the movie was over. However the writers put themselfes in a corner. Thanos is pretty much god at this point and objectively speaking there is no way anyone could defeat him at this point except if they go for something like ""his glove lost the power after he used it"" which is cheap. That will then result in the heroes trying to get back the time stone and then turning back time or something similar stupid.

I will not see the next one in cinema. At this point I am pretty much done with superhero movies. I guess I can thank Disney now for first pushing me away from Star Wars and now Marvel.

"hawkins_saints_rock","Everything we could've hoped for","25 April 2018","Oh. My. God. What an incredible film! I've never done a review of a movie before, I've only done TV shows. So bare with me, I'm gonna discuss the major points and chuck in a theory or two. But to start off...

Wow. This film could be the best Marvel movie ever! But I will give it a few days to digest and probably a second viewing before deciding on that. It absolutely lived up to the 10 year build up since Iron Man 1, how far we've come in a quick 10 years is remarkable.

The Thanos character absolutely hit the mark. He was menacing, intimidating, vicious and so much more. Props to the actor who played him. Thanos' plan succeeds (for the time being) and we get a whole lot of ""death"" because of it. In this movie there was death, and ""death"". The former refers to characters such as Loki, Vision and Gamora. We saw these characters die and there bodies be left behind. For this movie not to lose credibility, these characters, in my opinion, must remain dead. Now ""death"" refers to what we saw at the end, Thanos, with all infinity stones, clicked his fingers and half of humanity, including half of the avengers (important to note that all the original avengers are still alive) dissolved into dust giving the impression of death. I expect these characters to come back at some point during the next Avengers film, most likely due to the originals saving them.

My final theory regards Doctor Strange. On the ship with Stark and Spidey, Strange said that if it came to it he would save his stone over Stark and Spidey's lives. However, in the end we see Strange give up the stone to Thanos on the condition Stark stay alive. My prediction is that when Strange saw all the possible futures, the only future in which they win must heavily rely on Tony Stark. Which makes sense, Tony started it all so he should finish it.

Incredible film, can't wait for the next one to see how it all resolves.

"eden-rabatsch","Great popcorn film, surprises the series with fresh takes","25 April 2018","Well, Well, Well....

I was so ready to tear this down - 19th MCU film, too many stars, bloated CGI, first of a two parter, and so on and so on...

Yet, this is so much fun. Pure popcorn...now in the dictionary under ""popcorn film"" is just the poster for this film. Somehow, the Russo Brothers have juggled all the parts to give everyone some time in the sun. They are helped immensely by two things: the premise is so pure Mcguffin that you just watch Thanos look for Infinity Stones which gives a primal momentum and that the film's stars/characters are looking to move on - that means, actual stakes for once as people could really die and not just comic book dying either.

The DC people must be kicking themselves. The lightness and comedic touches are brilliant. You are laughing out loud, comedy level, but at totally organic character humour. It means you are so entertained throughout its rather long running time.

The other big surprise is Thanos himself. Normally, I hate CGI characters but somehow they have made Thanos and Josh Brolin work enough to give the character an actual arc. This is one of the better MCU villains and I never thought I would write that.

The stakes are real, the charisma levels are amazing, it is like ""Oceans 28"" and I can't wait for the sequel...that says an enormous amount considering the challenges this film faced.","9"
"numenorsniper-66396","Marvel's best","25 November 2021","I saw Iron Man in the cinema when it first released in 2008, and still remember it being ground-breaking and awesome. Since then I kind of lost interest in Marvel movies in general, as their quality was very variable, with a few gems here and there. Ultimately in hindsight, the MCU is a really fun and generally well-made series of movies, with the persistent flaw of deflated stakes, contradicting rules and muddled plot points. Not quite brainless entertainment per se, but sometimes feels like that.

Avengers Infinity War reignited my interest in the MCU, as the movie itself was really well done in pretty much every way. It's genuinely a very strong movie, that is deeply rewatchable, and one of the best Space movies ever made.","1"
"r96sk","An outstanding watch","23 January 2021","This is exactly the sorta thing I want from an Avengers film! Full blown, no punches pulled action. In that regard, it's an outstanding watch!

Despite knowing practically little about the MCU up until a few weeks ago, I still knew this was a film that was going to see - so to speak - excrement hit the fan... and boy did it! It's a great ride.

Like 'Captain America: Civil War' did, 'Avengers: Infinity War' does an incredible job at juggling the gargantuan number of characters. It's ridiculous, but totally awesome, how many faces we see appear again. I thought they got the screen time for all, more or less, down to a T. Not an easy job, that.

Speaking of the cast, it's Robert Downey Jr., Chris Hemsworth and Josh Brolin who stand out most in my memory. Them three are excellent, especially the latter. Away from those lot, it's very cool to see all the other worlds - including from 'Doctor Strange' and 'Guardians of the Galaxy' - come together into one film. As for new additions, there aren't many - Peter Dinklage being the pick.

There are many references that I had already become aware of just via the internet, so it was quite amusing seeing them all unfold here and there. The effects looked great to me, as they have basically all the way up until this point of the MCU. The comedy is good again, also.

Needless to say, I can't wait to see 'Avengers: Endgame'!","4"
"UltraMaximal","10 years of insipid","6 May 2018","Keep in mind that just because s movie makes billions, that does not make it a good movie. Like most of Marvel movies this is an insipid mess. The entire plot took 10 years to develop and is summed up in this latest entry in 4 or 5 sentences. Acting isn't necessary or required, just grimace and look sweaty and vacant. Meanwhile we'll fill the screen with 50,000 CGI lights and explosions and convince you what is happening matters. Well it doesn't.","1"
"Lursa","Plot Holes, Jumbled Action Sequences, & A Big Let Down, Oh My!","6 May 2018","SPOILER ALERT!! I am a Marvel Chick. I totally dig the whole Marvel Verse and wave my 'fangirl flag' proudly. I was looking forward to this movie so much...then something happened. I went to see it today. I did not read any of the reviews before I went. I never do. I always view a film without input from folk that usually don't know what I like. So there I was, popcorn and coke in hand. Two rows back from the screen ('cause I'm into total immersion, okay) in my reclining seat.

Ten minutes in and I know we're in trouble. It's not the fact that two of my favorite characters didn't survive the opening credits. This is Infinity War, right? People are gonna die. It's just seemed so pointless. Loki dies but Thor survives? How is that fair? Hemdall dies saving Hulk of all people?? Not that I'm hatin' on Hulk...but come on, Hemdall! You have sworn an oath to the 'Thone of Asgard' and you don't save EITHER of the princes? Really?? I know Hulk is refusing to 'come out' after Thanos kicks his butt that no one ever has before but still...

The movie goes rapidly downhill from here. Thanos and his twisted cult of psychopaths got on my nerves early and they danced all over them until the end of the film. We bounce all over the world (and off it) to keep Thanos away from the Infinity stones. Who decided that two of the most important stones be 'hidden' on earth? Not a good idea.

Our Merry Band of Marvel Heroes needs to take a page out of the Star Trek verse. 'The needs of the many out weigh the needs of the few or the one.' This could have saved SO many lives. Loki gives Thanos the Tesseract to save Thor. Thanos tried to kill them all anyway. Actually succeeds in killing both Loki, Hemdall and all of the Asgardians. Thanos sacrifices Gamora, the daughter he loves. (Thanos has a really weird idea of what love entails...but whatever) He does this so he can gain access to the Soul Stone. Dr. Strange gives Thanos the Time Stone to save Tony Stark. (Tony Stark? Wasn't his expiration date up like a couple years ago?? ) This gives Thanos the power to turn back time whenever he wants. Which he does after Scarlett Witch kills Vision (her lover) to destroy the Mind Stone. He just turns back time. Rips the stone out of Vision's head and heads off to wipe out life as we know it. So Scarlett Witch went through all that gut wrenching heartache for nothing.

This could have been a good movie. Maybe even a great one but it's not. It's a mishmash of the worst parts of just about every Marvel movie over the past 10 years. There are a few notable omissions. Most of the gang is on deck but they're so ineffective. They rehash the same differences they had in their other movies showing little or no growth or development aside from the superficial 'romantic' themes. I get that Pepper and Tony are an item. We knew this already. I get that Black Widow and Bruce are an item. We knew this two movies ago. Same with Gamora and Peter, Scarlett Witch and Vision. and on and on and on. This is supposed to make their loss more poignant but it doesn't. The fight sequence in Wakanda and on Thanos home planet were so predictable. Such a waste of excellent CGI and actors.

The only surprise in the movie is who survives. Thor, Tony Stark, and Steve Rogers survive. I know this is to set up the next part of the Infinity War set that is scheduled to hit theaters later this year. The Russo boys need to step up their game. This disappointment does not bode well for the new film. Guys. sometimes too much of a good thing is a bad thing. Just FYI. You just know that someone is going to get hold of the time stone and turn back time so we can blah, blah, blah. Been there, done that.

I really wanted to love this movie. I really, really did. But I left the theater feeling used and not in a good way. I felt like Marvel turned up the manipulation meter to eleven. Because, you know it's eleven which is one more than ten, right?

I rated the movie a '4' because I wanted it to be good. It just wasn't.","7"

Judging by the way it has been positively reviewed by some other IMDB members, I cannot help but wonder if we watched the same movie.

"Prismark10","The Marvel punch","3 May 2018","When I was a kid just after watching Superman II that one day there will be a film that will have in it, Batman, Superman, Wonder Woman as well as other DC Comics superheroes but it will knocked out of the park by a Marvel film starring the Hulk, Spiderman, Thor, Iron Man and others I would had not believed you. Heck Black Panther did twice more business in the US box office than the Justice League film.

Usually villains in superhero films want power just to destroy everything. Thanos the villain wants to bring chaos and destroy what seems half the population of the worlds in order to bring a new order of peace and prosperity. No more starving kids scavenging for food. It is a Nazi way of thinking, we get people in social media platforms who go on about how we need to control the population growth to save the planet. So reduce the population in Africa, in Asia in the Middle East. You know find a way to get rid of those black and brown people! Well Stan Lee who created a lot of the Marvel characters is Jewish and knew about the perils of this Nazi way of thinking.

Thanos wants his infinity stones to get ultimate power. You might think he has never loved something or anyone but he need to make sacrifices himself. His quest for the stones sees him battling Thor at the start of the film. Along the way their are casualties which leaves you wondering what will happen to those individual Marvel films in the future.

The Russo Brothers have certainly made a film where the various characters from the Marvel universe coming together feel natural and organic. Just look as to how well the Guardians of the Galaxy characters gel with Thor or Tony Stark.

They also have made the film so well paced although the running time is a tad overlong. It starts with action scenes and the action scenes crop up in this film relentlessly but we also get humour and brief character moments but always you know this is a comic book adaptation.","1"
"gcarpiceci","Heavy Indigestion","2 May 2018","Sometimes when you cook a dish for your guests, you think that you'll make it more tasteful if you keep adding ingredients over ingredients; so, you have made this nice pizza, you have put your tomato sauce, your mozzarella cheese, maybe some ham, then you think why not some mushrooms, and well peppers will be just perfect on top it, and don't forget olives and cappers, hey we have some sausage in the fridge just slam it on top of it....etc. Most likely your guests will spend the night wrestling with your heavy-loaded pizza, trying to digest it. Well, that is how I feel after watching Avengers - Infinity War; it's not by cramming piles of different super-heroes into one single movie that you make a great movie. It just results in a huge loss of focus and in the inability to pull together a cohesive story as you have to make space for this crowd of stars. Note that I'm not even complaining about the ordeal of CGI: they have by now become a commodity in contemporary movies and not even only sci-fi, so their abuse in this case was in the expectations. But geeez, the plot....the plot is so thin that one might claim there is not one; just an infinite series of punches, hand-fights, bang-bang, etc...

"TheSeaLion","""Avengers: Infinity War"" is dishonest, idiotic, and simply awful in almost every aspect of its handling.","1 May 2018","While all of the heroes from across the Marvel cinematic universe united in a joint effort to stop Thanos, so too did all of the problems you can think of unite in a joint effort to bring down ""Infinity War.""

It should be noted that I am not the biggest fan of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. For the most part, I find the movies to be passable while there are a few I have really liked, such as ""Black Panther"" and ""Captain America: The Winter Soldier,"" and some I have despised, such as ""Iron Man 2"" and ""The Avengers."" ""Infinity War"" could have fallen anywhere on the spectrum for me, and unfortunately, it fell at the way-down low side as the second worst movie in the entire franchise.

The opening scene of the movie is the perfect setup for what is wrong with ""Avengers: Infinity War."" Thanos (Josh Brolin) is attacking an Asgardian ship with all of the main characters from ""Thor: Ragnarok"" on it. Thanos has killed everyone aboard, except for the few characters necessary to help keep the plot moving. Heimdall (Idris Elba) is left wounded so that he can be killed off by Thanos on screen after using his powers to send Hulk (Bruce Banner) to Earth in an effort to warn the Avengers. It is supposed to be an emotional death scene, but the laziness of the writing and the showcasing of character stupidity for the purpose of plot progression is all too evident. Why didn't Thanos just kill Heimdall during the attack on the ship like he did with everyone else on board? It's simple: the plot would not be able to continue if he had done that.

Character stupidity is at an all time high in ""Avengers: Infinity War,"" and it is not just restricted to Thanos. There is a lack of communication between characters for no reason other than for the movie to happen, and Star Lord (Chris Pratt) goes so far as to screw everything up in what is easily the worst written scene in the entire movie.

The stupidity of the characters can all be attributed to an awfully written script. So much of the dialogue in the movie is the Marvel quips, but a lot of it comes in the form of characters throwing personal jabs at one another to the point of wondering why these heroes can't set aside their differences and not be annoying for even five minutes in order to stop a villain who wants to wipe out half of the universe's population.

Yep, that's right. Thanos' goal is to wipe out half of the population of the entire universe. One complaint that people have had with Marvel is how safe their characters all feel. So, Thanos killing off half the population would seem like it was putting their characters in danger, right? Wrong. All of the characters who are killed by Thanos are the characters who had already overstayed their welcome in the franchise or do not feel permanent because, let's be honest, they are needed for future installments to the Marvel universe. It is ironic that the movie that seemingly takes the most risks is the movie that played things the safest.

Even if these deaths did feel like a risk, it would not really matter. With so many characters to focus on, the movie has almost no time for character arcs (which is fine) and instead must show its characters through their speech and actions. However, so many of these characters act so annoying or stupid that you are just wishing for them to be killed off, and then the characters who are killed at the end by Thanos destroying half the population lacks any emotional weight because after nearly three hours of unbearable characters and dialogue, it is just a relief that the movie is almost over.

The two things that ""Infinity War"" did well was not making the story feel jumbled and clustered with all of the characters, and they did do a good job with the characters of Scarlet Witch (Elizabeth Olson) and Vision (Paul Bettany), but that is it. When it comes to everything else, the movie falls prey to a term film critic Roger Ebert used, which is 'idiot plot.'

Idiot plot means that the only way for the plot to happen is for the characters to act like idiots, which I already went into a little bit to explain how even the smartest of characters have to act like morons in this movie for the plot to progress, but the entire plot of the movie is an idiot plot as well. Thanos' plan to wipe out half of the population only makes sense to the point of his backstory. In execution, it is a plan that falls apart and becomes dumber the more you think about it. This might be, though, because the movie tries to paint Thanos and his plan off as having depth to it, but this sort of plan would only make sense and work for a generic super hero villain who just wants to destroy the world because he is evil. So, with a villain with faux-depth and an evil plan that would only work for a generic super villain character, the overall plot of the movie is a dumb villain scheme that has awful juxtaposition to it.

""Infinity War,"" to put it simply, is just awful. Nothing more, nothing less. And for a movie this big that had a decade of hype and buildup and planning, that is just sad.","6"
"phoenixinvictus","Worst Marvel Movie Ever With a Huge (or tiny) Plot Hole","6 August 2018","I can almost guess how the sequel is going to go... they are going to use some ridiculous time travel trick to undo all of Thanos damage. This two and a half hour movie was nothing more than a ten minute cameo for each actor to fight some alien. The HUGE plot hole in this movie is Thanos ""plan"" and Ant-Man's mysterious absence in this movie. Let's see how absurd the plot hole of this movie is... Thanos' master plan is to wipe out half the population of the Universe because according to him there aren't enough resources for us all. Have you seen the size of the Universe??? The resources are almost endless! The Universe is a BIG place people! How can anyone not point that out to him? With his magic gauntlet complete he can just ""magic"" all the resources he wants with the snap of his fingers. Duh! But that is not all... Ant-Man possesses the technology to END WORLD HUNGER!!! All he needs to do is supersize ""a steak"" to the size of a ""truck"" and presto you can feed an entire city for weeks. Right there is the weapon to end Thanos' dumb logic. Almost right in the beginning of the movie Thanos kills off the Asgardians on the ship, except for the main characters because... well just because we'll dump logic out of window and not bother the audience. Thanos then kills Loki-for REAL this time. Let me please have a moment to laugh out loud ha ha ha ha ha ha ha HA HA HA HA HA! Even if Loki is really dead this time I cannot feel anything but amusement at this ridiculous death for he has died so many times that I have lost count! Why should I feel sorry for a guy who wanted humans to worship him as a living god? Wasn't this the guy who literally placed his father in an old folks home to rot away? Wasn't he the one responsible for starting a war of genocide? Wasn't he the one who was responsible for the death of tens of thousands of people and caused the near destruction of New York City? Wasn't he the one who caused the invasion of New York City by aliens? Let's face facts! Nearly every Marvel character has died and been brought back to life that it actually is getting boring! Heimdall who is wounded uses the last of his powers to transport Hulk\Bruce Banner to Earth in an effort to warn the Avengers instead of-I don't know- beaming the tesseract away from Thanos. How about sending it to the edge of the Universe? It's not like he has a locating beacon to find these things. Gamora wants to stay away from Thanos because she knows something that he wants and makes Star Lord promise her he will kill her (yeah right). Gamora then does the very thing she said she wouldn't do and runs directly to Thanos to engages him in battle where we all know that she will lose. Aliens attack New York again. What an unlucky city. Doctor Strange is abducted and Wong doesn't seem to care that his friend is in danger and returns home... Really Wong, I'm so disappointed with you! Why doesn't he open up a portal to rescue his BFF? I know that Doctor Strange wouldn't have abandoned him... of course there is the fact that Wong's ten minutes were up and the studio couldn't afford him. Okay Wong I forgive you. Doctor Strange doesn't use his magic gem to turn back time and ""bargain"" with Thanos. Why doesn't he do it? With the help of Iron Man, Doctor Strange, Spiderman and Star Lord they hatch up a ""plan"" to remove the magic gauntlet off Thanos rather than just cut off the guy's arm off! Star Lord being the screw up that he is screws up the entire plan. Doctor Strange simply gives up the time gem because it's the only way to prolong this agonizing movie for another hour! Why didn't I just stop watching this movie? Captain America who is a fugitive is suddenly pardoned because he is just so darn good looking and awesome in his costume. Vision says that he won't trade a life for a life but there were so many lives lost during the battle to remove the stone from his head. Wakanda is invaded and the Hulk refuses to come out of the closet... So why was he saved and not someone else? Does anyone care? Why didn't Wong and his friends appear in the final battle and lock the evil alien army into the ""mirror dimension""? I'm just saying... Everyone dies and we all know that they aren't going to stay that way. These movies get worse and worse each year.","10"

"pete-murphy97","Bordering on a comedy, ""Infinity War"" is overhyped, lacked direction, but at times impressed","3 May 2018","""Avengers: Infinity War"" may well have hit the consumer sweet spot formula: the all-important kiss to boost the box office, heavy emphasis on comedy, loads of explosions, and a story that enthralls above all else. That being said, this latest installment plays it safe and rode on a long hype train spanning back over a year - Infinity War opts for the tried and true with the odd tweak thrown in, it's ambition is to be an amusing superhero popcorn flick, nothing more, nothing less; and on that count - it perhaps succeeds.

Not really accessible to new viewers of the franchise.

Infinity War is not for the entry-level viewer (if you want to fully understand it, at least) - lacking accessibility, it offers little explanation of the prior plot to the newly introduced - 31 movies have led up to this in one way or another: to an all-out fight for control of the most powerful items in existence, the infinity stones. Infinity War assumes you haven't been living under a rock and have seen (at least some of) the previous movies, to some viewers this will be a deal-breaker. So, for those reading who have no prior investment in the universe and its characters - this may be a disappointing watch. To those who have seen previous films, it still may be disappointing - the story is nothing to shout about.

Great CGI.

No, really, I will praise the special effects. Staggering stuff, and no doubt what helped make it one of the most expensive films of all time to produce.

Too many characters.

The Russo brothers were tasked the impossible job of covering a very broad cast of some 35 characters to the best of their ability within the 2 hours and 40 minutes run time, and to say the least, they were stretched thin. For the average fans, more characters is a major selling point - to those more concerned with the fluidity of the film-making and storytelling, it didn't work. The story felt somewhat fragmented as the plot's focal point kept shifting to accommodate the sheer number of characters.

It bordered on a comedy.

For some that's okay, in a film that is meant to be a culmination, the big showdown of epic proportions - I was surprised how dependent on comedy it was. I would have liked more story-building dialogue and character development instead. It didn't match the vibe of stopping a dude (Thanos) that could potentially kill trillions of people. While some of the slapstick humor was welcome, at times it went too far, it felt as if it didn't work alongside the serious scenes and situations that it often tried to segue into seamlessly - to no avail.

Geared towards a younger audience.

As a heads up, this movie without a doubt is meant to appeal towards Marvel's biggest target market - kids and early adolescents.

It makes little to no provision for those into well-written, sophisticated plotlines that transcend shooty guns and big explosions. Most of us have outgrown the cliches.

Poor ending.

Most of the audience remained seated in the cinema expecting some closure, but the credits just kept rolling.

A poor cliffhanger ending that just tries to sell the next film.

The film was literally;

Villian comes on the scene, whichever avengers is around flies or runs at them. Gets bounced back. Flies again, gets bounced back, flies again gets bounced back, flies again gets bounced back.

Then an escape happens, as the villian always gets what he come for as even his minions are way too powerful for every single avenger in the film. Cue literally 2mins of wisecracking and jokes. Next scene cuts eslewhere, villian comes on the scene, avenger flies or runs at them, gets bounced back, then 2 more mins of wisecracking and jokes..... for 2 and a half hours.

The diaglogue is minimal in the extreme. Possibly only 200 or so words get said in total throughout the whole 2 and a half hour movie. Almost all of it is just filler wisecracking jokes.

Watching this movie honestly felt like watching someone else play a video game, with the 2min cut scenes kept in.

I don't know if I am getting old, or if it was just this film but I did not enjoy this. I loved black panther that I seen a month ago. But also hated Justice Leage so am not sure.

Winter soldier and Ragnarok , one being very serious the other choosing a very light and sarcastic approach ( almost parody like ) for their subjects , both i think did a far better job than this . As infinity war stumbles between being dark and fun and ends up tedious and stupid , characters do stuff which makes zero sense Heimadall can see all but he could not see Thanoses big ass ship ? Loki is holding the stone and he sends Hulk to earth ? Thanos acquires all the stones , becomes the most powerful being in the universe but has to kill people to save the universe ? cant he.. i don't know make the resources infinite and be everyone's hero ? If no , then why did it take him this long to act upon his plans ? Heroes run head on towards the bad guys LOTR style ? Its the 21 century guys humans don't fight that way you know , Thor has the power of lightening and thunder but needs an axe ? then why didn't he just chop off Thanoses head ? And the most important question , who invented these stones and don't they have something to say about how these things are used ? You see this is what makes a movie this big this bad . And since we are sure that the people who died are bound to be revived again ( don't bring visions back that guy is a nightmare ) there is no sense of tragedy or loss just a very lame move to pull on our heart strings .","5"

The writing got worse when the Guardians of the SJW Galaxy took the screen - cardboard characters wisecracking their way through vacant scenes.

In fact, that's most of the movie. Most of the men act like 12 year old boys, arguing at the drop of a hat. That's supposed to be Stark's gimmick, but most of the heroes (males) act that way. There's no difference between Stark, Peter Parker or even Dr. Strange or even his Buddhist buddy.

Most of the dialogue is banter. Mostly the so called actors pose their way through scenes. The fight scenes are so CGI and camera movement heavy that it's impossible to tell what's happening.

"realmuthaf","Infinite Mediocrity","6 May 2018","Infinity War is the same predictable mediocre flick for children as usual, only one that's too big for its own good.

The previous team-up movies had a generic structure: some unmenacing bad guy arrives so the heroes have to unite - the heroes do unite, but the bad guy seems to take the upper hand - the heroes regroup and defeat the bad guy. Since IW was planned as two movies (more movies = more cash, not like there's some story to be told here), the structure is split between them, so the first one ends with the heroes seemingly defeated. But since we know that a sequel releases literally next year, the many character deaths feel cheap and pointless, kind of like that of Superman in BvS. And there are way too many heroes to give everyone proper screen time and things to do anyway.

There's literally nothing to see here apart from these forced deaths - there's no original plot involved, it's just another CGI purple Homer Simpson lookalike who wants to kill everyone ""for balance"" with added amounts of forced drama and tedious dialogues. He also has some CGI minions that look like early-2000's video game villains, but I don't think those were even named. Also the film's largest battle is that between some CGI 4-armed monkeys and an African tribe armed with spears. Yeah.

Also, still remember Thor Ragnarok? You know, the one which was mostly pointless as usual, but it did have Thor lose his hammer and eye? Well now it's completely pointless as he has both back. Just like IW will become pointless next year when the follow-up comes around.

I quite liked the first two Avengers movies, and while the third one (Civil War) was already slightly overstuffed, it was still serviceable. This, however, just continues the downward trend of movies like Guardians 2 and Thor 3.","10"

"ProfGenki","IT'S NOT A MASTERPIECE..","31 August 2020","..but still 10/10. Or 9.5 if its possible.

The MCU has been very consistent in their filmmaking and I am happy that Infinity War absolutely delivers. I am happy that it feels like and is a Thanos movie, a movie about a giant purple men who is here not because to kill smth but to fullfil his deep inner beliefs which is well written and understandable for the audience. The level of how well they combined so many important characters in one movie is immeasureable and still have the ability to craft a good story around it.

This movie is not perfect. Jokes are sometimes heavily missplaced and Peter Quills occurence with Thanos at Titan is not well thought out. I wish there would be a better solution.

Still. 10 years developement of a consistent franchise. And in the end a purple men with a not so empty heart wins. ITS GREAT.","10"
"SnoopyStyle","in good hands","11 May 2018","The Avengers face their most powerful opponent yet in Thanos. Thanos is collecting the six Infinity Gems for his Infinity Gauntlet to execute his evil plan. The heroes of the MCU struggle to stop him.

It is amazing that this works as well as it does. This could be best described as The Empire Strikes Back portion of the MCU so far. The heroes get their butts kicked from one end of the universe to the other. It ends with a mass disintegration which is honestly even sadder and much darker than TESB. TESB ends bittersweet but this is just dark. Although anybody with a brain would see that the snap will be reversed in some way. There are many deaths that cannot happen which does diminishes the shock value of the ending. They can't kill off Spider-Man because the MCU doesn't even own him. Sony would never let it happen. They also can't kill off Black Panther due to his future movie and more importantly, his new popularity. Obviously, some characters will not make it but I think the vast majority will rise from the dead. The constant death reversals in the MCU saps away the shock value and that's probably this movie's main drawback. If they picked different characters to disintegrate, I might have doubts about reversing it.

The advantage of the MCU is that these characters are so familiar that none of them needs introduction. In fact, this one starts from the end of Thor: Ragnarok and is no worst off by it. The relationships are well established. It's great fun to have them run into other heroes they've never met. Thor joining the Guardians generates a whole lot of hilarity. Drax is especially funny. Quill's insecurities is fun. There is an interesting pairing of Stark and Dr. Strange with Spider-Man as a fun sidekick. Relationships continue to be the strength of this franchise. The heroes are so well defined that the movie can spend its time with the villain. One of this franchise's weakness has always been the lackluster villains but Thanos is allowed to have his character development. His view points and his love for his daughter Gamora give him real depth. In many ways, this is Thanos' movie and it is more compelling due to the development.

I do have some other minor issues. The giant Dinklage may be oddly cute at first but it's just odd. That section doesn't have the same action as Wakanda. Thor holding open the iris is not much of an action scene. I'd rather have that section finish quicker without flipping back and forth there. I would push that section back into the middle. The plan for Vision's stone seems like a low percentage play and his reasoning for sacrificing himself seems much more poetic. There has to be a way to do a ""needs of the many"" scene earlier and end in the same place anyways.

Overall, this is well-constructed, well-conceived, and well-made. Despite the darkness, it still has its fun. The plot never stalls. The villains are great. The heroes are never in doubt. The franchise continues to be in good hands.","3"
"robert-85923","Too much and not enough at the same time","11 May 2018","I'm probably going against the general reception for this film but for me this film was just too much and not enough at the same time. Marvel fans will probably disagree with me. There is a star studded cast and clearly a lot of money has been spent to make this film a real spectacular.

However, for me there were too many obvious special effects, too many leading characters and far far far too much action. It just keeps coming at you relentlessly.

At the same time there's not enough real story and characterisation, not enough time to take in what's going on and definitely not enough warmth or comedy which is the hallmark of many Marvel films I've seen before.

I just wanted it to end but it kept dragging on for yet another battle... When it finally did end I felt cheated of the time.","9"

Who or how or why does one no see that they make him go to sleep so they have every opportunity to just kill him or chop his arm off or anything they want to stop him. Why would no one think that's a ridiculous thing to put in the movie. Just really gets on my nerves.","8"
"antialias11","Sub par","13 May 2018","*** Warning, mild spoilers ahead ***

Ok, what sticks out about this movie? Nothing much. The acting is lackluster. No character has a character arc - understandable because none of them are given any significant screen time. The whole movie is basically one endless 3-hour brawl (with some battle scenes blatantly ripped from Star Wars/Lord of the Rings). Some of the brawls are so over-the top that they are ludicrous (even by comicbook standards). Example: When you break a moon into pieces and hurl all of them at someone on the planet below within one second then the impacting pieces should not just make a puff of dust when they land.

The motivation of the villain makes no sense (after achieving his goal the universe will just be back to the earlier situation soon enough). Given that it's hard to emote with a villain in the first place having a full CGI villain makes it even less likely. Some of Gamoras mood swings in the matter where we're supposed to emote with him or her make even less sense.

Speaking of CGI: It's on a level we've come to expect with some weird exceptions. E.g. in one instance we see Bruce Banner's head in the open cockpit of the Hulkbuster armor while he's standing around in the background - and it looks like someone just copied it in with MS-Paint. Seriously. Not even Photoshop quality but MS-Paint.

The humor is relegated to one-liners and most don't land. The serious one-liners are predictable and pithy. The music score is effective if somewhat over-the-top pathos-heavy (but that's not unusual for US films, so it' one of those things we've come to expect to have to endure)

The overwhelming feeling is that this movie was ""designed by comittee"". The boardroom idea seems to have been: ""Take the things that people enjoyed in other movies and make them non-stop"". Problem is: It doesn't work that way. Gems in movies are that because they are rare. Taking the time to lead up to them makes the payoff all that sweeter.

After coming back I rewatched the first Avengers movie just to see if my memory deceived me. But no: It is a way, way, WAY superior film in every respect.","8"

They cooperate and defeat their common enemy, Thanos. The movie is awesome and this movie represent how the consequences if the villain won, the main villain himself. The plot twist that nobody saw coming is delivered well.","2"
"Jared_Andrews","The Villain makes the movie work","5 May 2018","Infinity War is movie number 19 in the current installment of the MCU. Some say that the movies have lost steam. Or that they're burnt out on superhero movies. To those naysayers, Infinity War may not be enough to revitalize their interest. But to anyone who still loves Marvel movies, Infinity War is a welcome and satisfying addition to the collection.

There was good reason to be concerned about this movie. The marketing pitch pegged it as the most ambitious crossover event in history, which sounds kind of cool but also comes with its share of challenges.

Crafting a story that juggles this many characters seems impossible, and choosing the correct combinations of heroes to group together is tricky. Finding a villain worthy of taking on the entire universe worth of Avengers is perhaps the most daunting of all.

I worried about each of these going in. After seeing the movie, I can comfortably say that Infinity War delivered on all fronts.

Thanos (a commendable Josh Brolin), delivers in a huge way as the star baddie. He's the key to whole movie. It does not work if he doesn't deliver. Fortunately, he does.

The plot revolves around Thanos and his pursuit of the six Infinity Stones, which he hopes to use to eliminate half the population of every planet in the universe. Most would call this genocide. He calls it mercy. He believes if life remains unchecked, populations will grow too large and civilizations will eventually suffer and starve.

So, it's up to the Avengers to stop him. You get the idea.

For as crazy as Thanos may sound, he comes across as a somewhat reasonable guy at times. His past even makes him empathetic. Also, and this is absolutely crucial, he's scary. Every time he appears on screen, the audience knows that anyone could die. Any Avenger could die. Thanos is that powerful and that ruthless.

Though all characters did not receive as much screen time as they deserve, this was only the case because so many characters deserve and have had their own movies. Kudos to the Russo brothers for handling the situation as well as could possibly be expected.

The character pairing choices were brilliant. Fortunately, Marvel benefits from the fact that the funniest Avenger, Thor, also happens to be the Avenger most likely to end up in space for a meeting with the hilarious Guardians.

The group immediately strikes a comic chemistry, as Starlord struggles to maintain his confidence as his crew oohs and aahs over the hunky Thor. Spiderman and Ironman boast a similar dynamic. Peter calls Tony ""Mr. Stark"" and Tony calls Peter ""kid."" There's a certain father-son/mentor-protégé sort of never completely clear vibe that lends itself to comedic gold, especially when Spiderman proves himself to be as capable as anyone else, despite his age. Tom Holland is distinguishing himself as far and away the best Spiderman ever.

Nearly all the good guys and gals have their chance to showcase their skills (except for a couple absences, which I won't name). Captain America, the Guardians, and Black Panther all receive well-deserved grand entrances. The filmmakers did such a great job using music to smooth the transitions in a few key scenes without overdoing it. You can probably guess which ones get their walk-up music.

Looking back, this movie opens with a bang and never really lets up until the credits roll. It's fun, funny, thoughtful and fulfilling. I only have three complaints.

1. I don't care about the romance between Vision and Scarlet Witch. They seem like fine people, but I just can't get there. Romance is not why I watch these movies. Also, her calling him ""Vizz"" is objectively hilarious, even though that wasn't the intention. 2. There's one scene with Thanos and Gamora that felt clunky and thin. This becomes problematic because it's pivotal to their relationship and the rest of the movie. You'll know what I mean when you see it. 3. The movie has a problem with stakes. Are there any? Again, you'll know what I mean when you see the movie.

Despite my minor gripes, I thoroughly enjoyed the movie. It seems like most viewers did. Join the phenomenon and see Infinity War today. If you love superheroes, you will probably love this movie.","9"
"gavinp9","Near-flawless action/space epic","25 April 2018","SPOILER: 'Avengers: Infinity War' is the third Avengers film and the 19th Marvel Cinematic Universe film overall, serving as a culmination of the last 10 years. Will not a full-stop (Avengers 4 comes out next year), it does a great job of bringing the much-teased infinity stones/Thanos storyline together. Lots of knowledge of the previous MCU films is assumed, especially the two most recent films which lead directly in to this film - 'Thor: Ragnarok' and 'Black Panther'. It might make some sense if you haven't seen the others, but probably not too much.

The stakes are certainly high, with a number of deaths of key characters throughout (no spoilers) and the opening scene literally taking no prisoners. The vital part of this film is the villain, Thanos (Brolin) who - despite being large, ugly & purple - gets enough backstory and shows adequate ethos to almost empathise with his reasoning for wanting to destroy half the universe (via the infinity stones). While there's some deaths and plenty of tension/darkness in parts, there's still lots of laughs, mostly thanks to Thor (Hemsworth), Starlord (Pratt), Rocket (Cooper) and Drax (Bautista).

The CGI is fantastic the entire film, with plenty of scenes in space and on new planets, which is always great to see - as is Iron Man (Downey Jr.)'s inevitable new suit. The way the team-ups are handled is done really well, with Dr Strange (Cumberbatch), the Guardians of the Galaxy, Spider-Man (Holland), Black Panther (Boseman) and the Avengers all split up, so there's always different scenes moving things along at a good pace. The third act battle is not predictable and the ending is hugely shocking - certainly no cop-out.","1"
"wesseldj-48581","Totally overhyped....","5 August 2018","This movie was slow paced and tied together with improbable coincidences, like getting the soul stone, Thanos needed to sacrifice the one thing he loves, let it be that that thing was standing besides him, how convenient! Other than Black Panther and warriors from Wakanda, but it shows more the often that The Avengers and the Marvel Universe lack diversity and is white privileged. It is yet again white people saving the Universe! Where did we hear that before! Also why does Marvel incorporated Thor, a greek god in their series and not for example the God Krishna from India? Towards the end there were so much of the same going on that you don't feel any empathy anymore of the entire Avengers crews when they died one by one, and you start to think the Universe might aswell be perished, who cares....cant stand the fact that this movies continue to go on and on, and wishing for it to end!

"Leofwine_draca","A rollocking good time","29 December 2019","So, here we have it: AVENGERS: INFINITY WAR, the Marvel climax to a string of approximately twenty prior movies and considered by many to be the crowning achievement of the genre thus far. And I do admit it makes for a rollocking good time, a two-and-a-half-hour rollercoaster ride of thrills, spills and excellent special effects to tell a story of good and evil, chaos and destruction, with a massive and awesome span across the galaxy. Just seeing all of the returning characters is a delight in itself, and they're all given their own moments to shine. The humour is fast and witty as you'd expect from an Avengers film, and the startling CGI work is endlessly enjoyable. The story ably mixes together character interaction with big battles and showdowns and there's never a slow moment from beginning to end. I can't wait to see the follow-up!","2"
"maruugaa","Long and Boring: Worst movie of 2018 so far","18 May 2018","I'm not a fan of Marvel or DC or basically anything that Disney creates. Unfortunately, my friend wanted to see it and I figured: 1) There's a chance it could be good, considering there were other movies I thought were going to be bad, such as(Blockers, The Purge, Keanu, and even Wonder Woman) that turned out to be good, so I shouldn't pass this off right away just because it's Disney 2) I figured it couldn't be worse than Red Sparrow.

Anyway, I was wrong to both of those. This movie is 2 and a half hours of weak plot, little script, visually unappealing CGI, bad acting, and continuous violence.

The only person in this movie who had acting skills was Robert Downy Junior. Benedict Cumberbatch was so insufferable that it's shocking that he's the same person who starred in The Imitation Game, which is one of the best movies I've seen this decade.

The entire last hour was nothing but fighting, killing, and brutal violence. I honestly don't understand how they can get away with rating movies with this much murder PG-13, when movies with significantly less violence and murder, like John Wick and The Hitman's Bodyguard, are rated R. Apparently our backwards society has deemed that killing and violence is an acceptable thing for children to be exposed to, but hearing the word Fvck will traumatize them for life.

With the exception of Robert Downey Junior, the way the people talked reminded me of 11th grade English class when we would read Shakespeare aloud in class. Also, as someone who was forced to go to Catholic Church as a kid, if you've ever gone to the Good Friday or Palm Sunday mass where they all read that dialogue in monotonous voices that's so insufferable you're in pain? That's how I felt in this movie. I would've rather been a child at Good Friday mass again, because at least then there was prospect of a Cream Egg for sitting through that drawl.","8"
"Shadowboy_25cm","After ten years of MCU build-up this is the impressive first finale","23 November 2021","""Avengers: Infinity War"" culminates the 10 years build-up of the MCU to this first part finale:

The villain is very powerful, complex and interesting to watch, although his final art design is not that impressive as other impressive versions of Thanos.

There is a lot of super-hero drama, a lot of apocalyptic atmosphere, a lot of smart subplots and impressive locations, there is a lot of surprise.

The movie is very watchable and constructed somehow around best-of-scenes, very fast-paced, jumping from one important fight and conflict to another leaving behind some logic. The action and the SFX are impressive, I as a viewer have nearly none time to chill out, it's a tour de force till the final battle. Very courageous by the makers to finish this movie as a Part 1-movie of a 2-part-finale (just like the new ""Dune"" movie by Denis Villeneuve in 2021).

It's a good MCU movie (it's better than the second part ""Avengers: Endgame"") that relies on the former MCU movies to keep it as a fast-paced, gripping story till the end.

Highly recommended.","3"
"PedanticEditor","Evil will always triumph, because good is dumb... apparently","2 June 2018","This movie is shockingly bad, especially compared with the other avengers films, and is the absolute worst Marvel movie ever made. Almost as bad as the Batman vs. Superman movie was for the DC universe.

Fair warning, this review is all spoilers - not that it really matters since you shouldn't see the film anyway.

I saw the film today and I can't help but conclude that the writers of this film were just lazy. For shame! I get that Infinity War is supposed to be the first part of a two-parter, so pretty much all the good guys had to die. But there are ways of making good guys lose without having them act like lobotomy patients throughout the whole story and literally die from stupidity every step of the way (oh, except for Spiderman who is inexplicably the only intelligent character in the story). In what ways were the good guys unbelievably dumb every step of the way, you ask? I'll tell you. And then I'll tell you what some better written alternatives could have been. This is just from memory, so there are probably more instances of bad writing that I've forgotten.

1. Loki gives up a stone to save Thor, even though it may be possible to resurrect him later and Loki knows half the universe will die as an eventual result.

2. Loki goes after the more-powerful-than-gods Thanos a moment later with a knife. An effing knife!

3. The first thing Dr. Strange does is as Ironman for help. Whaa?

4. Dr. Strange gets tangled up in weeds and faints, then to be carried off like a swooned and helpless fairytale maiden.

5. Gamora attacks Thanos first, by herself, even though she knows she alone holds the key to a stone.

6. Gamora gives up the final stone to relieve her sister from momentary torture, knowing that half of all life in the universe will die as a result.

7. Wakanda opens its forcefield, and the super-duper powerful lady stops guarding the last stone in order to fight.

8. Star Lord prevents the other good guys from removing the infinity stone holder from Thanos by deliberately saving Thanos from the mind control lady.

9. Ironman didn't punch Star Lord's lights out when he saw that he was getting ready to do something moronic.

10. Neither did Dr. Strange.

11. Thor stabs the Thanos through the chest with a super-axe (which was obviously stupid in the first place, but even then he has time to pull it back out and chop off the baddy's head), and instead the baddy says ""You should have gone for the head"" and sucks himself into a portal to escape.

12. Last, and least important but still annoying, the Hulk is effectively impotent for no good reason.

Here are 3 Possible solutions off the top of my head that would have been less poorly written:

1. Dr. Strange is distracted by something even more important for the entire movie, so that the other heroes can die tragically, and in the second movie he stops being too busy and just rolls back time and undoes Thanos' acquisition of the stones - also causing the heroes to not die.

2. Same thing, except Dr. Strange or his compatriot could have opened up and closed one of their portal thingies to snip off Thanos' arm with the stones on it.

3. Thor could have died trying to make the super-axe, or he could have cut off Thanos' head and someone else evil could quickly put on the stone-holding glove thing instead. Either way would have been an improvement.","2"

"bob the moo","Works better than it has any right to do","27 August 2018","I bought the hype a bit for this one, which is unlike me, but it did seem like an 'event' that this would be part of the end game for a series of films that have dominated the landscape for about a decade. Of course, it doesn't get to that point by doing much you don't know it will do, and as such there is plenty of action, special effects, witty dialogue, and big moments. So, in some ways it is the same as what these films have always done, but then again it deserves praise for not being what it could easily have been - a bloated failure of excess.

Instead it is surprisingly light on its feet for a film that has so many characters in so many constant action sequences, that carries a lot of supposed darkness but yet has to do it with humor and entertainment value throughout. I know it is a mass produced product, but there is still plenty to admire in the construction of it. As a narrative it has a lot to offer, but the demands on it are too great to allow it to bring out what it could have been. The darkness of it is the best thing about it. Thanos is conflicted in a satisfying way, and the film is never better than when we get to see this - although that is not often enough. The other darkness is the loss of major characters, which is impacting in the moment, but is undercut by the knowledge that all or most of them will be recovered - not least hinted by the many character-specific sequels lined up in years to come. I still enjoyed the darkness these brought, but enjoyed it with the knowledge that it was probably all for show.

The film runs long and probably has too much consistent action for any of it to really raise pulses, but it does the job for a blockbuster - with the characters, darkness, and humor all covering it pretty well. It is far from the brilliant film that some will tell you, and too much of it does feel superficial (which of course it is), but it works much better than it really has any right to do.","2"
"SamALMan","I am not disappointed and the main character is memerable!","9 May 2018","I am not a comic fan.. I never read printed materials on infinity war and now after watching this movie I feel if I have the chance to read it, I will.

Anyway.. the movie started where one of the most recent Marvel studio movies ended, Thanos is on quest to collect all the infinity stones to proceed with his plan and while doing so he faces opposition attempts by the avengers and others.

You will definitely feel shaken by the first scene in this movie and the shock won't wear out by that scene.. Thanos is determined to collect all the infinity stones even the one that is unknown whereabouts to Marvel movies fans to fulfill his aim.. the aim that made his quest to collect infinity stones understood and analyzed. It hold a real nice philosophical thought that really worth all the time to analyze.

The visuals were amazing in this movie, specially for Thanos and the new characters. You can read emotions better on the main ""computer constructed"" character, they are very close to the emotions that you may be able to read from human real face.

It is a fast based movie with few ""quiet"" scenes and short scenes with slight laughs here and there to lighten the mood. The characters who appear in this movie have varied screen time but it is noticeable even when some characters get longer screen time, they do not overshadow the efforts of other characters that have lesser screen time. The movie is definitely aiming to please group of audience that appreciate certain types of jokes and references.

********** SPOILER Begin************** There were no introduction to Thano's snap.. by looking back at Thano's reasons to kill people, I never find it connected to the moment where he snapped his fingers.. he snapped as a impulse or reaction to an avenger attack.. his reasons where corrupted by emotions!.. but definitely showing that Thanos would do anything to have this power in his collection. ********** SPOILER end**************

Marvel studios started a huge project with multiple layers and stages that will make it impossible to wrap it as a perfect project.. you will definitely see slips here and there specially when the other Marvel studios productions seemed connected to this movie.

At the end I would say that this movie is more suitable to young audience (to me 40 years and younger). Comics started as a ""relief"" and ended to be an ""art"".. This movie is one of the good examples of a nice modern comic movie.","9"

I went to see AIW in the hopes of washing away the taste of mediocrity of Black Panther. Having seen pretty much most the other Avengers franchise and predominantly liking them I thought BP was a deviation from the norm but, I now see with AIW's this might be the new normal.

This color by numbers film is probably what the average fanboy would hope for: formulaic plot, a who's who of super characters, an odd and apparently solipsistic villain, a barrage of special effects, machines of destruction and a few melodramatic emotionless bonding moments.

The entire two hours and twenty odd minutes ends up being nothing more than a long, boring commercial for the sequel (which will also likely dupe the same crowd of lemmings) into forking over $10, $15, $20? for a ticket.

The ""deeper"" interpretations will probably dwell on the conflicted nature of Thanos and his complex subtextual commentary of the state of diminishing resources in their world (hint, they mean our world) and the Orwellian double speak where, when he and his henchmen/women go on their intergalactic killing sprees they pronounce (without irony) that they are not murdering, they are liberating.

This is the language of dictators, despots and mass murderers (Pol Pot, Stalin, Hitler). His insatiable goal to collect the infinity stones for his special glove/gauntlet will give him ultimate power. How serious is this villain about gaining ultimate power? Well he actually trades away his soul (technically its not his) for the ""soul infinity stone"". Oh well, you've got to break a few eggs to make an omelet.

In this rendition, our friends from prior Marvel movies seem to be not marvelous at all. This is the foundation for every 8 yr old boys ""fighting argument"" (eg: Who would win if Aquaman fought Spiderman? Or ""who's stronger Hulk, Superman or Batman?) fun and engaging sure, if you're an eight year old boy.

But what makes this movie such a mess is exactly the notion of more is better. You could put all your favorite foods together on a plate and one look would make you say, ""Yuck, this is disgusting""

But its the weight of expectations, need to generate huge box office, and this kind of ""ultimate hero fantasy"" that makes you feel like ""lets simplify"".","10"

"bradykitchen-33648","The Best MCU Film To Date","15 March 2022","This film is phenomenal. I have no other way of putting it, they do a amazing job especially with how big this film is. The Russo brothers do a crazy good job with managing this huge cast. Every character is given some sort of purpose and their time to shine and it makes for through the roof entertainment but also a well written movie.

This film has a really big advantage over other MCU films, all of the characters except for one have been developed. It allows the movie to focus far more on the plot and making a quality story and less so on showing who these characters are. This movie is very fast paced, which creates what is the most entertaining MCU film.

The one character that was developed was Thanos played by Josh Brolin. He is the best MCU villain because he was developed. Almost all of the MCU films have one issue and that is the villain. Most MCU villains are not given enough development to be considered a good villain. Thanos is the polar opposite. This film does an amazing job of explaining his character and explaining his motive. There are a few times where you actually ponder whether he is right and that shows how well written Thanos is.

The action in this film is insanely well managed. You get to see each character have their action moment and makes for a really entertaining watch. The comedy was also very good and I feel they managed it a lot better than other MCU instalments. I find a lot of MCU projects use comedy at inappropriate times whereas this film did not.

In terms of gripes there were a lot of plot holes, which is hard to fault them on because of how much they already have to deal with but plot holes are there and they need to be mentioned.

Overall this film is amazing. The Russos do an insane job with managing this giant cast while providing the best MCU villain to date.

""Avengers: Infinity War"" (2018) was a pretty fun and good movie overall. The ending kinda saved it for me to be a 7/10, ending was good and that is why i'm giving this movie 8/10. But i do not believe that it will end eventually the way it ended in this movie, common - there a more bucks needs to made from this universe. That said, i do not understand what is this movie making on the IMDB 250 list (currently at 30th position) - its definitely not that great. You can trow a rock at me if this movie is better then ""Terminator 2"" or ""Apocalypse Now"" - this only shows how many fans this movie and franchise has - not the quality of this product itself.

Beginning back in 2008 with iron man, we are finally seeing the results of all the movies have been pointing to; and it did not disappoint. Thanos is a complex villain, with deeper and more interesting desires than just ""world domination."" The dilemmas all the characters face in this movie (both the heroes and the villains) are truly thought provoking and leave you on the edge of your seat. No other set of movies has beeen so involved, so expanded, and encompassed so many story lines/characters and previous movies. The sheer amount of star power alone in this film is insane; and they do a masterful job of weaving all these unique and various characters into a common storyline.","1"

That is not true and if you're too blind to see that this movie was worse than Age of Ultron, which comparably was pretty bad itself, but this takes the cake and you shouldn't watch, or rate, superhero movies. Don't for a moment think that Avengers: Endgame will be any better. When you write a film so full of plot holes that it may as well have been filmed through a cheese grater, you should not be praised as great directors, or even called writers at that point either. You should be bent over the knee and spanked and then scolded for writing, and directing such a bad movie.

"warren-87235","Did I watch a different movie?","20 September 2018","Having missed this at the cinema, my other half and I finally got round to buying and watching it (in 3D). Wow... what a mess. I'm glad we didn't pay to see this at the cinema. I'm quite honestly amazed at how many good reviews it's been getting. It's disturbingly close to 'Last Jedi' level bad (but not quite... that would still take some work). There's no real plot to speak of, things just seem to happen 'because', any sense of logic or consistency goes out the window (And that's in comparison to most of the other Marvel movies, which are hardly that great in the logic stakes in the first place!), power levels constantly change to fit a particular scene, rather than match what has been established for characters previously, etc., etc.....

To top it all off, after all the build up, Thanos turns out to be one of the least interesting Marvel villains, with face-palm-inducing 'woke' motivation.

The only good thing I'll say, is that it manages what most Marvel movies usually manage: the character interaction and banter is fun for the most part, and amusing. Oh, and most of the effects are good (except for Banner pointlessly in the Hulk-buster).

I understand and applaud the desire to try an 'Empire Strikes Back', but there are a few big differences (A story, for one). Empire works so well because our heroes get their posteriors kicked. They struggle tooth and nail to survive, and even when they do get a chance to fight they are soundly defeated. Infinity War falls flat, because the villain and his forces never feel particularly strong, and our heroes get repeated opportunities to defeat Thanos and simply don't take them because it would end the film early.

To be honest, despite its very obvious flaws (and a certain top lip deserving second billing), I actually found Justice League more enjoyable. I genuinely began falling asleep at the end of Inifinity War and closed my eyes, just listening till the end, I was so bored. Such a shame and a wasted opportunity after the build up of so many movies.","10"
"radursm","I expected more","3 May 2018","Not everything that glitters is gold! I'd say this often to the script-writers of the past years successful SciFi franchises. I mean, not every story that ends dramatically is profound, good or emotional. You do not become a name of the universal literature if you repeated the recipe with Romeo and Juliet. Neither applauded, nor famous, even rejected by some, and, definitely, you would polarize the audience. On the other hand, you get some franchise fans who will accept you uncritically, guardians of everything that's included in the story. Look at what's happening with Star Wars. Returning to Avengers, I see the scenario getting out of the accepted framework: they gave us 18 movies with the heroes of the Marvels universe (and movies about them) to kill them suddenly, unbalanced, easily. The last ""Avengers"" resembles an episode of Dr. Who (older). I paraphrase it: in the last episode they destroyed the universe to revive it the following season. Yes, it would seem. Although, there are some excuses for the TV series: the time crisis, the continuing production for several months (each season), the pressure of the producers, or of the heads of the TV station. The Rock-n-roll machine.

But the ""Avengers"" franchise had almost everything: a huge budget, PR, enormous production resources, an army in the back. ""Infinity War"" is not even that movie that you can say about: is not so bad that if you take it out from the bigger story, it could be OK, but it ruins the larger universe ... No. It's a dry sum of mini-stories (for the many characters), some of them gathered together to die like fools.

"hotjanuary","Marvel needs to keep their characters true and watch sloppy writing.","13 May 2018","Infinity War is a good super hero movie. But I thought Thor: Ragnarok and Black Panther were better.

Marvel has a problem with level and types of power of the super heroes in their movies. 1) if a battle between the Hulk and Thor in Ragnarok nearly destroy an arena made for super powered combat I'm pretty sure Hulk vs Thanos in a spaceship would last one punch.

2) Star-lord is just a dude, he does not catch and hold Spider-man.

3) If Tony Stark can have dozens of flying robot iron men helping to fight bad guys in Iron Man 3 why not have 100s of them to help in Waconda? I'm sure War Machine would have access to activate them.

4) If Scarlet Witch can pickup and drop 1000 ton alien attack blades near Wakonda why do 2 dudes in Scotland give her a hard time?

5) Steve Rogers isn't invulnerable. When swarmed by alien soldiers with sharp claws and teeth he's apparently unharmed after Thor's hammer clears the baddies away. They had time to rip Steve up but didn't?

Don't take the easy way out when writing the story. A lot of it was good but some of it was not. Writing poorly can break suspension of disbelief. 1) When an elaborate plan pins Thanos in order to remove his gauntlet so he can't DESTROY THE UNIVERSE nobody would stop to talk to Thanos about anything until that gauntlet is removed and someplace safe. At the very least you shut up and HELP REMOVE THE GAUNTLET so Thanos can't destroy the UNIVERSE!

2) Gamora really thinks Thanos doesn't love her? All that time she was talking about Thanos not loving anyone made no sense. I kept thinking, Gamora, you're being really stupid, everybody knows what's going to happen... maybe you should try running or anything?

3) When Thor arrives at Wakonda he apparently can crush 100s of those alien baddies with one jump/smash. Banner even feels he has time to stop, open his helmet to say ""You guys are so screwed now!"". But when all the heroes go to protect Vision from Thanos.... Thor arrives AFTER Thanos gets the last stone?

I know I'm picking. It's because to much of these things can degrade a movie a lot and I'd rather not have anymore X-men The Last Stand or Fantastic Four (2015).","3"
"npfares","Overrated","6 July 2018","I know a lot of you trolls out there are not going to like this review but whatever. 1. To big of a cast. Had too little screen time to be an effective character (all characters) and fit in the plotline effectively. 2. This ties in to not enough screen time, lack of emotional connection to the characters. I simply didn't care that half of the characters died by the end of the movie. Because we all know that most if not all characters are going to return anyway in future movies, it's a financial decision on Marvel's behalf. We all know that these characters are cash cows for Marvel studios so why care that they died when we all know they are going to come back anyway.... 3. Plotline, it had potential but due to time limits done by the studio and editing team it wasn't fully developed (Yes I understand half of you are going to say 'but I want my movie to be an hour and half and mindless fun'. and to rebut that, you can look this up here on imdb, 90%+ of movies that have made the most money and have the highest ratings are at least 2 and half hours long, most being over 3 hours so don't claim to represent the majority). 4. I would have liked this movie a lot more if they would have split it up into 2 movies, which would have been warranted with the material they were using in the movie.

--------------------------------------------------------------

Wow. Just wow. For a film that generates so much hype in the months running up to its release, it's incredible when it not only meets expectations, but exceeds them to the point where even more hype is garnered. There are so many words to describe Marvel's latest - emotional, epic, fun, stressful, scary, hilarious, incredible. In about 2 and a half hours you will laugh, you will cry and you will cheer. It's a phenomenal achievement, the biggest marvel of Marvel yet, and a huge round of applause is warranted to everyone involved in the film. You don't need to be a fan to love this film.

It's a very simple story without lots of twists and turns, making it very easy to follow - that is, provided you've seen all (or at least most) of the films so far. For those who have been at least casually following this monumental cinematic series, everything will make sense and the characters are already known. By letting the previous films set everything up, that allows Infinity War to pack so much more in the film and just get on with it from the word 'go'. The ever-important Infinity Stones themselves are much more than simple McGuffins - the film makes the audience care about them, Thanos visibly becoming stronger with every one he collects. It's not just as simple as Thanos collecting six stones, however. Instead this doesn't follow the usual superhero story or structure, instead being utterly unpredictable, allowing the audience no respite or way to prepare for the madness that occurs. This is a very different type of superhero film, Marvel able to break away from the mould. This is a strength of the film and they absolutely do not shy away from it. This is best seen in the ending which will go down in history, along with the likes of The Italian Job. It's a bold, brave finale - in a way I would have preferred a slightly more rounded end, but the film is too daring for that, instead setting things up for Avengers 4 perfectly (even in the post-credits scene).

Considering there are over 30 characters the audience will recognise, the directors and writers have done an excellent job of balancing the characters, all seen through the structure of the film itself. Structured more like an episode of Game of Thrones, we follow different groups of characters as the climax slowly comes to a head. One moment we'll be with Iron Man, Dr Strange and Spider-Man, the next we're journeying across the galaxy with Thor and the Guardians, and next we find ourselves with Cap, Falcon and Black Widow. No character seems particularly side-lined or unimportant and the structure allows for each and every character to make a solid contribution and get their fair share of screen-time.

Whereas Age of Ultron had more of an emphasis on story rather than characters, Infinity War is the complete opposite, the characters coming together instead being the main point of the film itself. It's a relief then that, besides all characters having a fair amount of time, they are all fantastic and an absolute joy to see all together in one film, every group seeping excellent chemistry. It never feels forced or gimmicky, but instead authentic and natural to see them all team up and work together. It also emphasises how perfectly cast all the characters have been over the years, able to hold their own and interact with everyone else so brilliantly. With so many characters, a film like this shouldn't work, but incredibly it does and is all the better for it. None of the groups are ever the default boring one (unlike Frodo and Sam in Lord of the Rings), but they are all lovable characters with exciting plot lines. On top of that they're all hilarious. As ever, Drax might be the funniest; but there are jokes from Stark, Strange, Quill, Groot, Rogers, Okoye... the list is endless. In a film with so much heart and action, it's amazing they managed to fit in so much comedy. It's beginning to sound like a cliché, but this is absolutely the funniest Marvel film yet - certainly funnier than the majority of ""comedies"" that come out these days. Even the new character Eitri played by Game of Thrones' Peter Dinklage gets his share of laughs. The biggest surprise with regards to characters however is Thanos. While his cohort may be formidable yet fairly bland (with the exception of the brutally sinister and downright scary Ebony Maw, played by Tom Vaughan-Lawlor), Infinity War's central villain Thanos is an exceptional antagonist, brilliantly played by Josh Brolin. As terrifying and intimidating as the monstrous purple alien may be, there is a quiet, emotional side to him. Unlike many villains, he's not looking for power for the sake of power. There's an element of humanity to him and he genuinely believes that what he's doing is for the good of the universe. This is not an antagonist to add to the ever-growing annals of forgettable villains - Thanos is the formidable foe we needed and wanted. No longer will Loki be the best Marvel bad guy by default. Will he go down as the best superhero villain since the Joker?

Of course it's not all laughs and chasing stones. As expected in a film like this there's action - lots of action. It's appropriate that the word 'war' appears in the title since this is by far the most action-packed Marvel film we've seen. Despite the nigh-on non-stop action, it never gets boring or seems like too much. With a rich plethora of characters comes a wide variety of action and fighting styles. No two characters fight in the same way and so the action always seems fresh. It's a pleasure seeing all these characters we have grown to love come together and fight with one another. The CGI and fight choreographing is incredible and the battle scenes are beautifully filmed. Definitely worthwhile being seen in IMAX!

The biggest downside is having to wait a year to find out what happens next, with no clues in the upcoming Ant-Man and the Wasp or Captain Marvel in the interim (since they're set before the events of this film). Still, if the next Avengers film is anything like Infinity War we're in for another incredible treat. With terrific character interaction, hilarious comedy, sublime action and a shocking ending that will keep you awake at night - it's all perfect. The 10 years Marvel has spent leading up to this has been absolutely worth it. A splendid and monumental achievement. All hail Marvel - but beware, Thanos will return...","4"
"s3276169","A franchise is a franchise is a franchise.....","30 July 2018","The biggest problem facing franchises is the fact they are a franchise. They offer up a product that looks and acts in a certain way and the net result of that, is it can be very, very hard to reinvent that proposition in a manner that's new and novel.

This is precisely the dilemma I believe is inherent in Avengers:Infinity Wars. If this was the first film of its kind it would probably have gotten peoples attention for presenting an outlandish and to a degree stylish concept, that's new and fresh. Unfortunately, there is nothing new in this formula and its been a long, long time since its been fresh.

The premise is effectively always much the same. Super skilled heroes versus one or more super skilled villains, with the stake being the salvation of a country, a planet, the universe. That's pretty much it. This film does deviate a little from the expected theme, with a surprise ending but that's not enough to save it from being yet another film in a franchise that looks ""all the same"".

On the upside the special effects are excellent and there is some reasonable if not show stopping acting from the collected cast. That I'm afraid is it. I do sympathise with the production house, its hard to know what to do with this concept or where to take it next. I certainly have no answer.

"kaaffilm","""Avengers: Infinity War"" Raises the Bar for All Superhero Films","28 March 2023","""Avengers: Infinity War"" is a stunning achievement in the superhero genre that has raised the bar for all future comic book adaptations. Directed by the Russo brothers, the film delivers an epic, action-packed adventure that is both thrilling and emotionally resonant.

The film boasts an impressive ensemble cast, featuring a vast array of iconic superheroes from the Marvel Cinematic Universe. The characters are expertly woven together in a complex and layered story that is surprisingly cohesive and easy to follow. The performances are top-notch, with each actor bringing depth and nuance to their respective roles.

One of the film's standout elements is its stunning visual effects. The action sequences are breathtakingly choreographed, with the use of CGI seamlessly blended with practical effects. The film's colorful, vibrant palette adds to the sense of excitement and wonder, while the use of music creates a powerful emotional connection with the audience.

Despite its heavy action and special effects, ""Avengers: Infinity War"" does not skimp on character development and emotional depth. The film's exploration of complex themes such as sacrifice, loyalty, and the nature of power elevates it above the standard superhero fare.

Overall, ""Avengers: Infinity War"" is a masterful superhero epic that is both thrilling and emotionally impactful. It's a must-see for fans of the genre and a testament to the power of the Marvel Cinematic Universe.","1"

"walentys","Self-parody, but not funny nor original","3 July 2019","The modern Marvel cinematic universe's excuse for ""comedy"" is a bunch of one-liner wisecracks that take on one of two forms: 1) camaraderie in the form of friendly jabs between characters, whether extant or to build up new friendships, or 2) to actually make fun of the movie itself. Functionally, the wisecracks are tacked on to make the movies take on a ""lighter"" feel to contrast the darker themes they sometimes tackle. There's nothing fundamentally wrong with this approach, except that executionally the lines just aren't that funny, too frequent, tryhard, and awkward, sometimes even going as far as to ruin a potentially epic moment by cheapening it beforehand or afterwards. Not to mention that this formula for ""comedy"" is carbon copied across almost all modern Marvel movies, so it gets tiresome quickly. Just because the filmmakers themselves point out how bad or cheesy a scene is does not somehow make it better. A self-parody without the humor therefore becomes a farce of a film.

Another problem modern Marvel movies face is that they rely on the viewer to have seen each and every movie that has ever come out in the entire franchise, else risk great confusion. This makes each movie not stand alone on its own merits, but only in relation to the other 40 or 50 behind them. Television would perhaps be an objectively better format for these kinds of long-winded many-charactered chapters, but the ticket sales keep coming in, so why fix what ain't broken? It is a challenge to even critique this film as it stands on its own, without also critiquing ""modern Marvel movies"" as a whole. Indeed nothing felt different or unique about this particular installment in the series, more of the same formula.

The biggest problem in this movie was simply its sheer number of characters, and once again most other modern Marvel movies share this problem too. The scope was so large that nothing seemed to have progressed whatsoever until the last 30 minutes of runtime. The first 2 hours took on too broad a scope as it slogged forward into a big confusing jumbled mess constantly hopping from character to character, almost rendering it pointless to even bother. Certainly it must have been challenging to incorporate every single character the franchise has ever seen, but was there really a pressing need to do so in the first place?

Robert Downey, Jr. had a surprisingly down-trodden role this time around, rather than his typical comic relief sharp-witted self. He can act in any capacity so there was nothing bad about the acting, but it also didn't leave much of an impression, nor stand out in any way. He was just kind of there. In fact, every character in the entire movie besides Thanos felt like they were ""just there"". No character really had a chance to shine or be themselves, instead melding into ""one united Avengers"" character. Perhaps this was intentional, as all needed to unite against Thanos to stop him, but it just went too far: every character's individuality was severely compromised, and the only truly indelible impression left on the viewer's psyche after watching this movie was Thanos, Thanos, Thanos.

The ending at least picked up a little bit and finally had a focus, even a bit of a shock. But it doesn't feel fully believable, as we all know deep down it's not permanent. After all, this is a fantastical universe with many excuses to undo it.

Lack of individuality permeated throughout: as a movie, in the action & choreography, in the directing style, the composition, cinematography, even the characters.","4"

"pink_floydilia","Average","10 February 2019","So to preface this review, let me start by saying I'm a massive Marvel fan. I've lived, breathed, written and read Marvel since I was eight years old. The Marvel franchise went downhill since Iron Man 3 which hurts so bad considering he is my number 1. But this movie took the cake. There were so many inconsistencies, so many random characters which weren't introduced in the MCU (only in the comics). There were far too many big egos and sub plots to try and cram into one movie. And to the masses, it was good. So hats off to them for making a crowd pleasing movie. But to the others who like some sense and substance when they pay good money to see a movie, try harder.","10"
"Crazy_Cracker17","GOOD ONE BUT WITH MANY DISAPPOINTMENTS","1 May 2018","All over movie is good. better than AOU. but the problem remains same. they keep cracking jokes which makes . I liked only one character doctor strange. he was only serious about everything. banner trying to make hulk out and hulk dont wanted to, that part in starting and in end were so stupid. no good music, no avengers theme, no any sequence there is no any fight I see from captaion and black panther, just a few punches. even end was not that good. I thought this movie will be better than first one but now I know first one will always stay best from all.

Tony didn't stay in earth and I didn't like it. action scene were good but not compared to what we saw in civil war. This is very big movie, there must be some scenes and actions which supposed to be unforgattable. You will also feel at least one time that this isn't movie about avengers or saving earth/universe. its about thanos and gamora story. good time wasted there. No complicated plots. plot holes. no combination of music/sound. no interesting and emotional plot like civil war and doc. strange movie.

I hope next part will be better than this. it has its flaws and big disappointments, but still its watchable movie and forgettable movie too.","4"
"glofau","Incomprehensible Unless You're a Fan","2 May 2018","A movie should stand on its own two feet as an entertainment experience. You shouldn't have to watch 18 other movies first in order to enjoy a film. Unfortunately, to enjoy Avengers: Infinity War, you really have to have seen all the other MCU films or this film doesn't really make any sense. Hell, they rarely even introduce characters by name, let alone give you any clue as to who these people are. It really takes shalllowness to a whole new level of yawn-inducing ennui.

It's not like I haven't seen any other Marvel superhero movies; I've seen several. When I was a kid, I read the comic books. And I still had no clue who most of the characters in this movie were! And I certainly didn't give two hoots whether they lived or died.

The film is a spectacular, eye-popping kaleidoscope of sumptuous costumes, special effects, and MONEY spent lavishly on just about everything. The salaries for the all-star cast alone must have sucked up a huge portion of the film's budget. But who cares? If you weren't already invested in the characters, you aren't going to become invested in this sea of nameless wisecrackers spewing rather clever (but pointless) dialogue endlessly.

I couldn't make it to the end, I walked out about halfway through. I hear the end is the best part but I couldn't summon enough interest to care. They lost me with the meaningless major death early in the picture. Snore! I don't go to a film to see favorite characters bite the dust! Especially since they'll just have to resurrect people so they can make their various contracted sequels in their own franchises. This film is an expensive waste of time unless you're a rabid fan.

It's all about the story, man! Without a good story and some time spent up front getting you invested in the main characters, a movie is nothing. Black Panther was terrific because it had a terrific script but this film sucked rocks because its script was a shallow, mediocre snooze despite the witty repartee. Don't bother unless you're a big fan of the MCU.","9"
"jessfaith-45971","Not something I would watch again","8 June 2018","While Avengers Infinity War has some cool action and funny lines, its many death scenes of beloved characters including scenes of characters in pure agony can make this movie very challenging. This is emphasized due to the fact that not all characters will come back and that the characters are popular and well known by many. Add to the fact that the story can be unpredictable and a few tonal shifts, such as an emotional scene suddenly cutting to Tony Stark and co. cracking jokes and one- liners, and you got a movie that's overall not worth watching again.","10"
"RoBiN_SinGH211221","One of the best Movie MCU","30 September 2020","A tape of incomparable magnitudes. An unprecedented superhero odyssey. This seems to me the best way to describe this film, which takes the limits of the genre to a new level. In a world like today where superhero cinema dominates the market, even more so the movies from Marvel Studios, it can often be difficult to surprise. However, Infinity War not only creates this emotion inherent in a movie of these characteristics, but it brings together the best that Marvel has built over ten years and mixes it in an organic as well as frantic and impressive way every second. It is a film that is practically constant action, like many of the genre, but with a speech and an emotional weight greater than that seen on other occasions. A special care is appreciated in forming a convincing story with enough dramatic and sentimental value, at the same time that the narrative action does not stop. 'Avengers Infinity War' is first and foremost a superhero movie that embraces the genre and exploits it to the fullest. A film with great ambitions that is capable of surpassing itself, resulting in one of the best films in the studio and in the genre itself.","10"

Overall it was just a huge mess. A basic cliché formula which consisted entirely of several over-the-top action sequences with snarky one-liners from the ""characters"" every now and then. The plot barely made any sense, in fact most of the time I barely knew what was going on and the villain's motives were unoriginal and cliché

There was apparently supposed to be a lot of emotional weight to this film but it just wasn't there for me. The balance between all the humor and high stakes was just completely off so I didn't know which scenes to take seriously or not.

I think the weirdest part of this movie for me was that the Avengers felt oddly out of place for most of it. The Guardians Of The Galaxy are featured far more prominently so the rest of the characters just feel like random background soldiers who show up every few minutes to kick some ass.","10"

The nailed it. Against all the odds of juggling THAT MANY balls in the air, they pulled it off and it just gets better every time. It is imperfect, but it's still great.

Josh Brolin is great as Thanos, he is a great villain!! Too many Marvel movies have weak villains. Not here. He is a great character, it is pretty much his movie. Continuing how great he was in Thor: Ragnarok, Chris Hemsworth steals the movie as Thor!! No mean feat in a movie with this many awesome characters. Robert Downey Jr is as awesome as always (when isn't he??) as is Tom Holland, he made me cry, it not going to lie. Mark Ruffallo has more to do than normal as Bruce Banner.

Chris Evans and Benedict Cumberbatch are more supporting here as is Elizabeth Olsen and Paul Bettany (even though I was crushed with there final scene) Sadly, Scarlett Johansson is wasted here!! She does not really have much to do.

"ssatvaya-16480","Much better than END GAME","19 June 2021","AVENGERS:INFINITY WAR,to say in one line,is perfectly balanced as all things should be. It was the most anticipated movie of the decade,and it had to deliver what seemed impossible-bringing together two dozen superheroes,combining plot threads from the previous 18 films,introducing the biggest villain onscreen and perfectly balancing humor with emotions and action with drama-all in a single film-and the russos nailed it.... Mild Spoilers follows... The main attraction of the film ,is no doubt the Mad Titan. Thanos is not your usual villain. He is complex and multi-dimensional. He is cruel,ruthless,kills but at the same time, he mourns,shows compassion,and above all-he has a reason for his actions-and that's what makes him the most interesting and dangerous villain. He gets the most screen time than any other hero...It is as if he is the central character. Its as if we are following his journey of collecting the six infinity stones so that he can destroy half the universe. He wants to wipe out half of the universe,not because he sees fun in it nor he wants to rule. All he wants is to achieve balance in the universe. According to him if the universe is left unchecked,then the universe might destroy itself due to overpopulation. He wants to do this action so that the other half and the future generations can thrive....he describes it as mercy. Along with him ,the film also gave us sidekick antagonists in the form of black order. Among them,Ebony maw was cool to watch. The actions and choreography were amazing. If you thought the actions in the trailers were awesome,o boy...u aint seen nothing. The people behind the camera ..they did a fantastic job. The art work was good ...and the cgi and vfx looked realistic. They did a remarkable job in capturing all the facial expressions in josh brolins face. Nothing to say about screenplay...its just ....I cant imagine how they delivered it ..and like a star wars movie we got to see different parts of the galaxy-From the sanctum sanctorum to New avengers facility. From wakanda to New york. From Nevidilir to knowhere and from vormir to titan and finally to wakanda...The shifting of story from one scene to another scene and location without confusing the plot was executed perfectly. The dialogues were sensible..and the film is filled with lots of pretty and punchy one liners that will fill you with laughter,and some that will make you emotional. The character interactions...well this was what we wanted to see more than anything...and trust me ,the russo brothers delivered more than what we expected. Not only that, the film gives adequate time for characters to grow and develop in such a short time frame that you feel for each and every character ...its a treat for those who have followed all mcu films and had made the characters part of their life.....the interaction between these different characters is what makes this film unique.....there are reunions...there are first meetings..the plot is written as such that each and every character is vital to the story... The guardians get a lot of screen time...and Thor-guardians interactions are one of the best and most entertaining moments in the film .The trio formed by dr strange,peter parker and tony stark was also very amazing..The first meeting between earths mightiest heroes and the guardians of the galaxy is very funny ...The thanos-gamora relationship is very well explored ..the film also gives ample time to vision-scarlett witch romance that was teased in the trailers... captain america has a grand entry ..we get to see black panther...bruce banner ..o well he has his own arc in the film and is funny.. and so on... Its the darkest and most emotional movie in the franchise..as the first scene itself sets the tone for the entire film. The stakes are higher than ever and the ENDING will just make you numb ....., Its not just a superhero movie..Its a movie about love,relationship,sacrifice and above all asks a moral question- ""under what condition is it just to trade one innocent life to save others"".","2"
"RogerGlassFilm","Still the best","29 July 2021","Even after endgame i still think this movie is superior.","10"
"TheNabOwnzz","A brainless & cringeworthy cliché fest","2 August 2018","Since i am not a little boy that has an absurd kind of fondness for Marvel comics & thus its movies, i am able to judge them objectively without being prejudiced by a couple of adults flying around in capes. And with this knowledge, it is quite obvious that Infinity War is indeed objectively a terrible movie.

As stated before i am admittedly not a Marvel fan, and i did not care to watch any of its predecessors before this one. It ofcourse should never be a requirement to watch about 18 films in order to comprehend this one better, but to be honest you really don't miss anything during Infinity War's simplistic narrative if you have missed all its previous films, except for maybe knowing the characters in it. But judging from what i have seen none of them are even slightly relatable even when having watched previous films. So even if you have watched previous films, a connection with these characters is impossible since they are so terrible written and often times poorly acted.

First off, i cannot fathom enough how terrible the screenplay is. A couple of characters try to be funny and come up with lines of dialogue a 8 year old could have though of, such as: 'Dude, you're embarrassing me in front of the wizards' or 'Why is Gamora', or the discussion about Thor's new haircut. The plain stupidity in its dialogue and writing is basically an insult to the audience's intelligence, and thus it is a very dumb and low IQ motion picture due to this. The acting is mostly terrible, except by perhaps Josh Brolin ( Which is saying a lot, since he was a pure CGI character ). Especially Robert Downey Jr, Chris Pratt & Tom Holland all hand in absolutely atrocious and horrendous performances. All of them try to be funny and joke around in serious times, but it is never funny, instead its terrible pretentious attempt at creating wisecracks results in loads of cringeworthy scenes that will make the audience embarrassed to witness. Although in the three actors's defence, the abysmal script didn't help their performances either, and they are only partly to blame.

The only interesting character in the film is Thanos, and while it does help a little bit that he has the most screen time of all characters by far, he still seems to be a victim of the cliché fest that is Infinity War since his reasons for wanting to take over the world are hardly original ( Sacrifice the few to save the many kind of motivations, which we have all seen before ), and can probably be found in the 'Standard Hollywood villain rules guide book' anywhere. None of the 'Good guys' are relatable because their dialogue is so ridiculous and since the only intelligent person in the film seems to be Thanos, as everybody else seems to be lacking in self awareness and self consciousness on every level ( Especially all the times people who know what Thanos is capable of keep attacking him like they think they have a chance, what a joke that is ).

There is once again a lot of sub par plastic cinematography with many artificial backdrops, especially in Wakanda. None of it seems particularly natural, and thus the film also has this visually artificial kind of feel that further decreases your immersion ( Although the characters already decreased this pretty far down with their terrible dialogue ). There is no depth or real sub text in the film except perhaps Thanos showing little Gomora his knife balancing which symbolizes his view of a world in balance, but that is pretty much all the cleverness in it. It also has a lot of melodramatic scenes ( Especially with Vision and that redhead woman whose name i forget ) between characters that you cannot relate with, and the only thing that i wanted to see happen was Thanos killing them all, as he was the only individual with even a slightly bit of depth or character, thus making only him, the villain, relatable. Ofcourse as is standard in modern films Infinity War is also very politically correct in that it uses a lot of women warriors fighting like men against eachother in order to negate gender differences like there are none, which further enhances the notion that this is ultimately an irrelevant film.

Admittedly the only strength this film might have comes from Thanos's character, and everything else seems irrelevant due to terrible acting & writing. In the end, despite that a lot of characters meet their demise, it still feels as though nothing is really at stake because all the characters are frequently making unfunny jokes & dumb decisions, which in turn leads to the question: 'Why should we care?'","10"
"kuaci89","ABOVE MY EXPECTATION.","26 April 2018","Just WOW , The Russo nailed it, hand down from me they did it again. Part by part is interesting to watch , some of scene make me shock some scene make me wanna punch people so bad. Thanos is the best villain I've ever seen. He not just normal villain to kill bunch of people because he love but his motivation so clear why he wanna do that and most people know he is collecting all the infinity stones.

One of the best part of it the team up Guardian & Avengers just amazing, full of humor cannot stop laughing watching their scene together. For 1st time my brain cannot process what going to happen in Avengers 4 really hype about it.

Really worth watching it , if u non Marvel fans or superheroes fan this movie is worth to watch , really enjoy it . Of course every good movie always have some issue with it but just MINOR issue can close eye and let it go. Going to watch it again soon . Love from Malaysia.","3"
"judemcrobbie","You've seen it","20 March 2021","I have basically nothing but praise for Avengers: Infinity War. Considering the rest of the movies in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) are very safe and don't take many risks or deviate from their generic formula, this does. These movies will go down in cinema history, for better or for worse, and I do truly believe this deserves to be there. There are plenty of reasons this is the best MCU instalment and one of the better movies of the decade: The primary reason is the villain, Thanos. He played spectacularly by Josh Brolin, who even in motion capture gets all the acting through. The MCU has had such weak villains throughout so to see Thanos done so well is a great change. I think the genius behind how Thanos is the best villain is because the way the movie cleverly poses the question ""Could he be right?"". This gives him not only a sense of moral righteousness to us but we can truly see the ""No one thinks they're the villain"" philosophy making him so compelling. The opening scene of the movie shows the mad titan effortlessly slaughtering families in his quest to destroy half the population of the universe. He seems completely unfazed by this like he's done it before countless times. There is a clever line of exposition in this after this, not only backing it up that he has (That we will see a flash back showing he's been doing it for at least 20 years) but also how he got the first stone. I like this decision to say rather than show this as it puts us in the action of the people we actually have emotional resonance with, The Asgardians. Throughout this scene we see the two previously strongest characters, Thor (Chris Hemsworth) and The Hulk (Mark Ruffalo), get not only beat down by Thanos but humiliated. This is especially prevalent in the hulk as we don't see the fight between Thor and Thanos. We do get to see the fight between The Hulk and Thanos however. This is one of the best set pieces in the franchise as not only is it bombastic action but also shows character for both of them, but especially Thanos. Through a mere few counterattacks, Thanos decimates The Hulk. This shows the brains he has, not fighting like the animal The Hulk does, and showing he also has the strength to go toe to toe with the previous strongest avenger. The genius behind the decision to show the brains is that t circles back to when in the final fight he says ""You're not the only one cursed with knowledge"". In this scene we also see the smarts of Thanos, outsmarting the God of Mischief-Loki (Tom Hiddleston). He ultimately kills both Loki and Heimdall (Idris Elba), the final remaining people from Thor's previous life before the first Thor and the avengers. I think the next time we see Thanos on screen is in the Knowhere scene. In this he uses his grip over the weapons he has gathered, showing their abilities and his ability over them by cutting through The Guardians of the Galaxy (Chris Pratt, Zoe Saldana, Dave Bautista, Pom Klementieff) with ease and going as far as to turn our beloved Mantis and Drax into Spaghetti and just blocks respectively. There is a lot more in this scene which I could talk about, Peter's arrogance and the Guardians dysfunctional family ultimately leading to their downfall to the hand of a competent villain, but I will elect to talk on the emotional climax of the scene, Peter Quill attempting to kill the love of his life in order to save humanity but getting the rugged pulled out from underneath him. This leaves Peter in a complete state of disarray as if he had killed he would have felt immense guilt for killing the one true love of his life, and if he hadn't then he may have just doomed the universe. No win situations like these are perfect for developing character as we get to see them in difficult situations. This drives Peter and the rest of The Guardians the rest of the movie. There is two more Thanos scenes I would like to would like to talk about: the first of which is the Nebula torture scene. This is a truly perfect scene compared to the many others. Marvel has a tendency to crack jokes unnecessarily, which I'll get into later, but this is just completely devoid of all that humour which is just perfect. The fact Gamora says ""I always hated that chair"" and Thanos deciding to bring himself to the lower level, not feeling the need to assert his dominance over her sets up the next scene perfectly, and then the other thing in this scene is the decision for the 'Mad Titan' no to torture Gamora and instead torturing Nebula, again this makes the next scene perfectly. Then the final scene of the Thanos chat is the Vormir/Soul Stone scene. This scene is just chilling. When Red Skull (Ross Marquand) pronounces that you must give a soul you love for the soul stone, the reactions from both Thanos and Gamora are just amazing. Thanos goes completely silent, null and void he thinks over what he must do. The tear shed shows the pain perfectly set up in the previously alluded scene, but understanding he must do what he must do. In his eyes it means crossing the fate over the universe over his daughter and the only person he ever truly loved. Gamora in this scene is fantastic as well. She originally believes that Thanos doesn't love anyone and therefore he will fail, going as far as to taunt him about it. At the beginning the taunts come thick and fast but they slow down with her voice realising there's only one thing he loves. The climax of Gamora trying to kill herself instead of having to give the stone to Thanos is what makes the scene so great, giving the moral compass of The Guardians and she carries that to her grave ultimately. Another reason for this being this being the best instalment in the franchise is because of the writing and acting for/from every character: Iron Man is the man who started all this and Robert Downey Jr. gives a trademark performance. He brings the narcissism and arrogance that comes with the character. He also shows the swagger but more he brings arguably the fourth personality trait of Iron Man's tenure. This iteration brings the most human Iron Man. He has always had obsessions but in this the obsession is with having a child. This is started as far back as Captain America: Civil War (2016) with the introduction of Spider-Man (Tom Holland). In this Spider-Man was easily the youngest superhero, he was still in high school, so Tony Stark saw him as a child, which later became his child of sorts. This is emanated as the same you want to push your child but not to the point of harm, Tony brings Peter Parker into the fight to expand the help for Team Iron Man or whatever it's called, but at the first sign of real danger he tells him to leave. This is carried over to Spider-Man: Homecoming (2017) where we see Iron Man as the mentor, Uncle Ben figure of the MCU. To those who don't understand that, Uncle Ben in Spider-Man is the man who teaches Peter humility and ""With great power comes great responsibility"". Tony Stark has this trait in this as he teaches Peter not to thrill-seek and do it for the greater cause, what Tony Stark had to learn 9 years prior in the first instalment of the MCU, Iron Man (2008). I say all of this because he gets annoyed at Peter for getting on the spaceship as he is fully aware that it could be a one way trip. The line Peter says ""I can't be the friendly neighbourhood Spider-Man if there's no neighbourhood"" encapsulates the lessons taught to him in the previous instalments of his character in other MCU movies. Then to see Peter die in his arms has to be the killing blow, comparable to losing a child. Not only does Tony feel this, but because of all the time spent developing their relationship in other movies and this one, we the audience also feel this like the dagger Tony Stark has just been stabbed with, both physically and emotionally. The back and forth between Doctor Strange (Benedict Cumberbatch) and Iron Man is brilliant, it evokes the feeling when two of the worlds greatest but heads, like Messi and Ronaldo or Lebron and Curry. The ""I speak for myself"" from Doctor Strange is completely unnecessary and he just affirms Tony Stark's point but it shows however on the same tea, they are very much at each other's throats. This is even more apparent when in the spaceship Tony and Peter save Doctor Strange by blowing a hole and releasing the vacuum. Doctor Strange doesn't thank the pair but proceeds to make an indirect threat to them, saying he will not hesitate to not save them in aid to keep the Time stone. Also another 'alpha' character in Peter Quill joins them on Titan. This throws another problem as he has no willingness to listen to anyone but himself. Thor is clearly fighting out of vengeance towards Thanos. Though not all by the hand of Thanos, in the last 3 features of Thor he has lost his father-Odin (Anthony Hopkins), his mother-Frigga (Rene Russo), his brother-Loki, and his four of his best friends in Heimdall and the warriors three (Jamie Alexander, Zachary Levi, Ray Stevenson and Tadanobu Asano). This man has seen everyone die around him so the guilt he must feel is through the roof. This is said by Mantis when trying to empathise with him. He is very much motivated in this by vengeance, it is because of this he is so powerful as he has ""Nothing left to lose"". This gives Thor the reckless abandon needle to take on Thanos alone or take the weight of a star to form his weapon. The will to take the weight, heat and energy of a star shows how much he was connected to Mjolnir. In very much way the the Tardis feels like a person in Doctor Who (1963-Present), Mjolnir had a sense around it that it was more than just a weapon, not just how Thor and it interacted but it's perfect timing and the noise it makes feeling like a language. Speaking of people Thor has lost, Mjolnir in Thor: Ragnarok (2017) was destroyed early by Hela (Cate Blanchett). There isn't enough words doc for me to get it all in","2"

There is not much one anticipates from a superhero movie. Spectacle (with lots of CGI), iconic characters, some basic story arc, and saving the world in the end. Infinity War didn't deliver. And I hate to utter that. I hate to command movies to stay within they genre... But if they don't, there must be reason. There must be good reason. The makers stripped this movie of the most important superhero-flick-features and what remains, just falls apart.

First of all, there are way too many characters (could this have been the reason behind the ""end result""?). And then the story arc: it's a downward spiral. The heroes try to stop the villain(s) at multiple locations only to fail one time after another, letting the villain march through with his plan and collect each and every one of the stones. And finally the world is not saved. The end. Cast. Oh, wow. Thank you.

Now for the spectacle: that was ok - though most of the fight scenes were too shaky and chaotic for me. I would have preferred less and more detailed scenes, but I don't complain. It a little bit felt like a Japanese anime though, where one combatant pulls a big ass weapon only to have their opponent pull an even bigger ass weapon, and on and on, until one time an entire moon (!) was dropped onto our heroes...

For the positives: we did have some good laughs, and the main villain is well detailed (for a superhero movie). Also, Peter Dinklage!

Lastly I hate to be blackmailed to watch next episode like this. So no, I will not watch the next one, at least not in the movie theater.","7"

I had no idea what was going on and the tedious CGI and probable impossible situations and loud music and interminable explosions made this a tortuous event to sit through.

"BA_Harrison","That ending...","28 April 2018","A mean, ugly purple dude scours the universe for the pretty gems that fit into his snazzy metal gauntlet, intent on using the power of the stones for his own nefarious needs. It is up to a team of brave superheroes to try and stop him.

I've fallen way behind on my MCU, and am probably not the best person to comment on this latest instalment; or maybe, just maybe, my objectivity makes me more suited than most avid fanboys.

For the best part of two hours I was reasonably entertained by what unfolded, despite not knowing the backstory to several of the characters. The plot was pretty easy to pick up, the action scenes were visually impressive, and there was never a lull in pace. It was slick, big-budget popcorn fodder designed to appeal to the masses, but which hardly qualified as revolutionary or indeed, all that memorable. Eventually, I could feel tedium creeping in. And then the last act changed everything...

The finalé, in which half the population of the entire universe ceases to exist, makes Avengers: Infinity War a movie that lingers in the mind long after it has ended. Spiderman, gone. Dr. Strange, gone. Black Panther, gone. Groot, gone. And many more besides. Well-established characters vanish in the blink of an eye, and I have to admit feeling a lump in my throat at their casual dismissal. It's a bold move, for sure, and one that will guarantee discussion from all that stay the distance (which reminds me, be sure to remain seated for the now obligatory after credits scene).

6/10 for the first two hours or so, but that ending... I'll be generous and add a couple of extra points for Marvel having the balls to go ahead with it.

***EDIT*** Having pondered the fate of so many superheroes, I now expect Marvel to bring most of them back to life in the next film via Dr. Strange's powers of time manipulation-not such a ballsy move after all. My rating might be reduced to 7/10 if this is the case.***","6"
"plasticanimalz","As Mediocre As Expected","15 July 2018","I wasn't going to bother with a review but then I read the first review by blparker that said everyone giving this a bad score were trolls who didn't see the film, then went on to praise it like it was Citizen Kane. I found that rather humorous. My suggestion is to see this in the theatre as the VFX are the only thing it has going for it and won't translate on the small screen. I had no idea this was a 2 hr and 40 min film until I bought the ticket and I seriously contemplated walking into another film because I just did not expect much from this film. When the film started it poorly leapt straight into a scene as if we were in the middle of the movie rather than the beginning. It didn't make a lot of sense other than a set up for on of the long-standing characters to die. Once we moved past this terrible scene it got a little better, which kept me in my seat 'cause the first 10 mins of the film made me want to leave the movie as I was afraid the rest of the film would be like this. It doesn't get much better but at the very least it manages to be entertaining.

There is a plot, though, there is very little to it. If you know anything of the Infinity comic, which also was not that great, you know that a lot of characters die. The difference is they killed characters in the comic I cared about and the movies they don't even bother to have those characters, so, whatever. Secret Wars was a much better comic and tells how Spider-Man got his black suit, but it had actual story, so, I guess they didn't want to use a better comic. Infinity truly is one big dude fight. But not even that exciting of action. I thought the Black Panther action was better. I'd read that a bunch of guys don't like Rey from Star Wars because she's a Mary Sue, which I learned means a woman with ultimate, unstoppable powers. Funny, I've never heard a name for guys but they bothered to come up with one for women. Basically, every dude in this film is a Mary Sue. If Thor has the power to resist a star how is it he can't get out of a couple steel girders a wizard wraps around him? How is Captain America always so invincible? He was always kind of a lame character but now he's all-powerful in this universe. Why is Spider-Man suddenly Iron Man? What is the point of Vision, for someone so powerful he doesn't seem to do much other than whine.

I did think Dr. Strange was cooler than his own movie in this film. Tony Stark, always likable. Thor was very enjoyable, and I loved his scenes with the Star Jammers. Peter Parker's humor was funny and I liked him better in this film than Homecoming. The best scenes for me were the Guardians of the Galaxy crew. Pretty much everything they do is good. The best comedic line was from the bald Black Panther woman, which, unfortunately they didn't show that much of her. In fact, this was a 2 hr 40 min movie with only 2-3 minutes of screen time for the few female characters they've bothered to add to the film Marvel Universe, who are mostly only in the films to make the guys not look gay. The Scarlett Witch seemed to be one of the most powerful characters yet her few scenes were only dedicated to talking about how much she loves Vision and fawning all over this boring robot guy who doesn't seem to have emotion. Yep, a real attractor for women. Black Widow has been lame from the start. A Shield Agent with no powers whom they've given laser guns to, on the team with a bunch of super powered dudes and a god. Lame. There's a long assortment of Marvel super power females they could have added to Avengers but they literally just added someone to look hot. It really annoyed me how underused all the female characters were in this film. Black Panther's sister was the star of the Black Panther film and she has no purpose in the Avenger film other than to cut out Vision's stone. She's basically an extra.

I've never kept much up on Thanos 'cause he's a relatively boring character who wasn't very often used in the Marvel universe for the 10 years I read Marvel comics. I think he was more of a Silver Surfer or Rom villain...which, did anyone actually read those? I thought the idea that balance is used as bad and evil was a bad message. What is he now, an eco-terrorist? He didn't seem so much crazy as a Green Peace dude with too much power. Thanos chose people at random so he wasn't a racist, a bigot, or anything else, he was by the films portrayal an environmentalist. Humans thin out animals when they ravage the terrain. How is it different? I go to films to be entertained, not have these poorly plotted out existentialism by stoners moments. In the past 6 months, Infinity War, Jurassic World, and The Last Jedi all had these nihilist themes or moments where they are trying to express some weak, childish form of morality but it is actually anti-heoric, selfish, immoral, or just lame.

I, in some way applaud the writers for making the film mildly entertaining despite the amount of characters they were working with. That is a challenge. But, overall there wasn't much story going on or actual emotion so I really didn't care when they killed off a good chunk of the heroes. All I could think was, ""Oh, his contract is up, so they're killing him off. They didn't use her anyway, so, of course she's dead. Oh, well, he's a new actor every 2 or 3 movies, so, no surprise."" Didn't care. The entire film was fairly unmemorable and my life could have continued just fine without seeing it.","9"

"jtindahouse","It's good, but it's not Top 10 on IMDb Top 250 good","2 May 2018","There are some films that simply can not be reviewed without going into spoilers. 'Avengers: Infinity Wars' is one of them, so fair warning. I watch roughly 150 films each year and yet this is the first MCU movie I have seen. Not a single one of them up until now appealed to me. What finally got me along to see this one? Well the fact that it is currently sitting in the top 10 of the IMDb Top 250 had a little to do with it. I had to see what all the fuss was about. There are some truly tremendous and groundbreaking films in that list and the top 10 in particular holds some of the greatest films ever made. 'Avengers: Infinity Wars' has no business being there.

There are a lot of characters in this movie to keep up with and it is frankly exhausting at times. Admittedly, the film actually does a pretty god job of balancing everyone and giving them sufficient screen time and a purpose for being in the movie. There are so many characters though and so many story arcs that it can become a little frustrating waiting for the good ones to role around again. What I've learnt is that there are some incredibly strong characters in this universe ('Iron Man' was the stand-out for me) and some phenomenally weak characters too ('Captain America' probably being the weakest from what I could ascertain).

The strongest thing the movie has going for it is the character of 'Thanos'. A genuinely intimidating, menacing and threatening villain is always the key to any superhero movie being good. Josh Brolin plays him brilliantly (as he always does) and this film owes a lot to that character alone.

Now let's get into those spoilers by talking about the ending. Basically 'Thanos' wins and with the click of his fingers kills half the universe. We then see roughly half of the superheroes crumble into nothing and ""die"" (supposedly). I suspect this has a lot to do with the film having such a high IMDb rating. It turns out people love an ending where the bad guys win. That makes me happy, because it doesn't happen anywhere near enough in Hollywood today.

My problem with the ending though is this. If you really think those characters are dead, never to be seen again, then you are sorely mistaken. So in that sense it is incredibly cheap. I hate movies (universes) where a character dying doesn't actually mean they're dead (DC is just as guilty of this sadly). As if this isn't obvious enough to 90% of people, the film actually reminds of you of this fact not 5 minutes prior when a character is killed only for 'Thanus' to go back a few moments in time and thus bring him back to life.

Enjoy this film for what it is. It's a great looking flick, with some excellent action sequences, funny one-liners and a menacing villain with a clear and simple plot that is easy to follow. It's done well no one could deny that, but don't try and claim that is something truly great and worthy of the IMDb top 10 because that is simply not the case.","3"
"yaszi-83296","One decade of build up","10 November 2021","This is the movie! A decade of build up for this, and it was really good! The movie is just 2. Hours and 30. Minutes of pure action, people that were fans, were not fans or think they are fans watched this movie around the whole world, their are groups of characters that fight for the same thing and as the movie goes on, more and more characters group together until there is only pretty much 1 big group of heroes. This movie is unique because the heroes aren't the protagonist, it's kinda the amazing villain Thanos, he is emotionally driven and his story is great, he is kinda a hero, he thinks wiping out half the universe is necessary to safe the universe from problems caused by overpopulation, he knows it is crazy and solving a problem means trying not to hurt anyone but he believes he has to do it! He is constantly getting hammered by the heroes and you kinda feel bad for him, there is no villain. This is why he is a great villain, he is not trying to be a menace out to blow the world, he is trying to do his part and save it.

Another thing I love is that anyone can watch it, anyone can enjoy it even do they don't care about marvel, the MCU works in a way that someone only has to watch some movies to understand that there is a connection with these stones, and someone going after all of them is a big deal! The movie is it's own think and is pure fun superhero action, it is great and truly has a infinite amount of fun.

The movie is a must watch and is the big event in a way, it is kinda the first part and the second being Avengers Endgame, both movies are their one story at the same time as being a part of this now over a decade long franchise. This is basically perfect and even do it might not be for everyone, this is just amazing!","9"
"bora_mustafa","Do not believe the planted 10/10's, this is a disappointing movie overall.","28 April 2018","I was really excited to watch this third Avengers movie, being that they were going all in with both the Avengers and the Guardian characters but ultimately the movie is just one big mess of a movie. The movie is more of a Thanos story which is fine as we need to know as much about this Titan, however the rest just didn't measure up.

I understand getting some 30 characters together in one movie was always going to be a stretch, but I really didn't enjoy the movie. I won't delve into the plot as many reviewers have done so, I will just say that some of the action sequences were pretty good especially from Iron Man and Dr Strange, but ultimately the ending really agitated me and yes, we all know there will be another movie soon to complete this story but it just felt like a setup movie.

Not as epic as everyone is making it out to be. I still rather watch the first Avengers, the Winter Soldier and even Ragnarok over this any day.","2"
"nogodnomasters","No Resurrection this time.","5 May 2018","This is an easy film to spoil, so I will keep it brief. Thanos (Josh Brolin) gathers a group of bad guys with the quest of obtaining all the infinity stones. His goal is to save the universe by killing off half of its life with the snap of a finger...and enjoy the sunset. The film combines all the Marvel characters available to do a film to fight the villains and Stan Lee to play a bus driver. The feature assumes you have seen all the other films as there is zero introduction of character, and hopes you have forgotten a few minor details that conflict with the current film.

The film is generally darker than previous films, but still has the humor. I wished Star Lord had discovered a new tape whereby he could defeat Thanos. Not thrilled with the plot or ending. The production works with 3 subplots for much of the feature. The ending...well we know what happens next with a go back in time and let's hose this series up like they did X-Men.","9"
"l-r-patrick","Total let down","2 May 2018","Firstly, special effects were really good, cast was also very good! I grew up reading these comics and Thanos along with Doctor Doom were my two favorite bad guys! Thanos is very good in this film, it's just the writers obviously don't know the comics very, or just think they are better than the likes of Stan Lee and Jim Starlin who was the person that created Thanos. Thanos kills to please Lady Death, he does not kill just because he thinks there's to many people, what a stupid idea that was. I mean if he is worried about there not being enough resources for the population, once he has the infinity gauntlet, he can solve that by creating enough resources for everyone! It would have been so simple to have Thanos worshipping Lady Death, her just silently watching, and him, as in the comics trying to gain her attention by killing to please her, but that was to complicated for the writers to put in, as audiences would not know who she was, lol. Self explained by Thanos, easily done, we've not seen the dwarf before, but he magically appeared, I mean, that was another waste of a whole sequence, Thor trying to get a hammer made (Beta Ray Bills hammer btw), I mean WTF, just have his proper hammer rejuvinate and hold the power, oh yeah, these writers wanted to change that part of the story as well. These writers need to know, Stan, Jack Kirby, Steve Ditko etc etc wrote and created these characters and they should stick to the original elements that made them what they are today. They think they can come along and rewrite these stories in their vision, just like JJ Abrahams with Star Wars and Star Trek, they think they are better than the original creators which they are not by any means!

For me it's getting to the point where I don't really care if I see these films anymore, they just let me down every time, where these writers don't do the proper research and just create it in their own way. The comic fans made the comics a success, without us over the years, there would be no films, so maybe you should try to please the fans before the random cinema goers?

Bits that really annoy me, no Lady Death or any celestial power beings of any kind, Red skull appears on the planet galaxies away to Thanos about the sould gem, great writing there, true to the comics, NOT! Boy that sucked, I thought, why is this not at least Mephisto here or Lady Death, Red Skull, it's so bad I want to cry. The Hulk was not really in the film, just the first few minutes, they just wanted to give the actor face time, so just had him jumping around in the Hulk buster outfit, yawn!

This film is an insult to The Infinity Gauntlet Comics, go and read Thanos Quest, then The Infinity Gauntlet 1-6 and wait for this on normal TV.

Totally ruined one of my favorite story lines, these writers need to get over themselves and not write it as if they think it's their creation, it's not!

Best bit in the film for me, was Stan Lee's cameo!

Many of the characters are likeable esp the Guardians of the Galaxy, the Hulk and Tony Stark BUT, there are just too many groups involved with too much repetition.

I could go on and on but 10/10 says enough.","3"
"milleniumlogan","Overrated and bloated","3 May 2018","This movie was an underwhelming, chaotic blend of several different movies. I'm going to break down several of the different elements of the movie and why they either worked or really did not work. I'll start with the villain:

Thanos, as a whole, is a pretty good villain. He is intimidating and the movie gave him a good script. The problem is that his powers are so freakin inconsistent. Guardians of the Galaxy already established just how powerful infinity stones are, but Infinity War seems to forget that. In the battle on Titan, Iron Man and about five others are able to hold Thanos down and nearly get his gauntlet off. At this point, Thanos has four infinity stones. Sorry, but there is no way they could restrain him at that point.

Infinity War also includes four other villains which the directors apparently felt had no need for an introduction. Collectively, they are called the Black Order (or dark order) and their names are never said so, I'll give them nicknames. There is Noseless the Terrible(who is terrible), Avatar Lady with Horns (also terrible), Rock Dude (basically Korg but bigger with a goatee), and Guy with Pointy Axe. The only people who understand who the heck these characters are, are Marvel comic fans.

The biggest problem with Infinity War is the character developments and inconsistencies. I'll describe the worst cases:

Star-Lord: When the first Guardians of the Galaxy came out, Star-Lord was a great character. Infinity War completely ruins him. He turns into a jealous jerk and an actual idiot. There are brief flashes of the old Star-Lord but mostly he is just a character that you despise. At one point during the battle on Titan (Thanos's home planet), Iron Man, Doctor Strange, and the Guardians of the Galaxy have Thanos held down and they nearly remove his gauntlet (which makes no sense in the first place because at this point Thanos has four feakin infinity stones). As they are removing the glove from Thanos's hand, Star-Lord finds out that Thanos killed Gamora earlier in the movie. Star-Lord then starts punching him and this wakes him up from Mantis's mind powers and this time he demolishes them before going on to destroy half the galaxy.

Vision: The development of Vision is also really, really bad. In Age of Ultron he is strong enough to wield Thor's hammer but in Infinity War, he has developed and updated to the point that he never wins a single fight against anyone because it fits the plot.

Thor: So in Thor: Ragnarok it was established that Thor is the god of thunder and doesn't need a hammer to be powerful. Then in Infinity War they completely forget this and make him get tossed around like a ragdoll. In fact, he never even uses his lightning abilities until he forges his new weapon. Did the directors forget about what got established in Ragnarok or did they just make Thor weak because once again it fits the plot and Marvel can get away with whatever the heck they want?

Scarlet Witch: Wow! Her character was inconsistent. One minute she is getting demolished by some dark order member and the next she is holding off Thanos (who has five infinity stones at this point) for an extended period of time. Once again her powers are only as powerful as the directors need them to be for any given scene.

Hulk: So apparently the Hulk is now scared to come out? Ahh, poor little guy. This is a terrible plot twist and really doesn't make much sense.

Another thing that did not work about this movie was the sheer amount of characters. I was worried that it might be too many and it was. As a result, there were too many different subplots going on and they couldn't even have one final battle. They had to have two climactic battles going on at one time and the result was a bloated mass of CGI filled action for the last forty-five minutes of the movie.

Now, I'll discuss the action in the movie by rating each of the major battles with a brief description:

New York battle: 2/10 This battle was absolutely terrible. Noseless the Terrible comes in with the Rock Dude and tears up the city to take Doctor Strange away and nothing about the action is even slightly thrilling. The action in Alicia Vikander's Tomb Raider was better than the action in this battle.

Wakanda battle: 8/10 This battle was actually pretty thrilling with great background music and some really cool action. The first half of this battle is a lot better than the second though. It also gets annoying because it's only fed to you in short segments while flashing back to the battle on Titan or Thor forging his hammer-axe-thingy. Overall though, this battle was good and part of the reason that I give Infinity War a 6 and not something much lower.

Battle on Titan: 6/10 While, there is some good action in this battle, there are also a ton of inconsistencies revolving around Thanos and how powerful he is. Overall, I wasn't super impressed.

I also need to discuss Thanos's plan for a second. He wants to wipe out half of the universe's population because the universe is overcrowded. Then he can finally rest. Did he think of the fact that the universe will repopulate again and all his hard work will be for nothing? I definitely prefer a storyline that involves the threat of total destruction of earth.

Finally, I am going to discuss the characters that are killed in the movie and why it makes Avengers 4 really predictable. So at the end of the movie, Thanos snaps his fingers with all the infinity stones and half of the universe is killed. Somehow by random selection, all the original avengers survive. The odds of that happening are 1 in 64 assuming Hawkeye survived the dreaded finger snap of Thanos or 1 in 32 if he died while having his epic gaming session with friends (guess he got bored of the whole avengers thing). The characters that die are almost all new characters like Black Panther, Spiderman, Doctor Strange, etc. Several of these characters already have planned sequels so we know they are going to come back when the original Avengers find a way to time travel and reverse everything. It's just too predictable.

Overall, Infinity War was not a very good movie. I do not understand the hype. It was choppy, inconsistent, overcrowded and overall just not the great movie it's cracked up to be. I would not recommend going to the theater for this one. I left feeling exhausted and tired of the MCU.","10"

"TK32","This is the worst of the Marvel Universe","28 April 2018","I love all the Marvel movies - well, until now. It doesn't seem that the movie ends so much as two-thirds of the way in the writers got bored and said ""let's just phone in a bunch of failures and quit. Note: bad guy winning doesn't automatically make dramatic tension. And you can't just write the characters acting stupid to make them lose. If you'd done your job, there could have been legitimate reasons for failure, not just you writing ""even though their lives are at stake and they are seconds away from getting off Thanos's glove, let's have Chris's Pratt say 'No! I will not hold on one second and beat on him after you get the glove off, I will do it now!' because darn it, it's too tough to expect us to come up with a good reason they fail."" How about having some of Thanos's followers show up and prevent it? There are so many other problems with the last third, I swear it was written completely separate from the rest. AnAndd what about a simple ""The battle continues in..."" All in all, skip this one and wait for the next.","3"
"searchingfortao","Terribly disappointing","27 April 2018","I've watched every MCU movie at least twice. I love them all, even Iron Man 2, but this was terribly disappointing. This whole thing gave me the impression that the writers watched a lot of Game of Thrones and thought: ""I know what people like, let's kill a bunch of heroes!"" Even if the fight scenes devolved to the absurd, it didn't matter, we had good guys dying, so this would be a win.

Now obviously it's a comic book movie, so it's a safe bet that most if not all of the heros they killed will somehow miraculously be resurrected, but that's not the point. I just paid £12 to watch characters I fell in love with get murdered for 2 hours only to have it wrap up with half of everyone dying. Now I get to wait an entire year to find out how they're going to fix it.

There's a big cell phone game app fan out there named Thermos, he loves Bejeweled and Pokemon Go so much, that he decided to combine the two... search for the jewels in real life!! Collect them all, get free gifts, lives, reverse previous mistakes, you've played the games you know how they work. But little does Thermos know, the game apps feel him as a threat, once he collects all the gems, Thermos snaps his fingers and poof all the game apps Thermos doesn't like poof! Gone! So what happens is another app called the Avengers go after Thermos. Now I've played the game apps before, and I always thought that each Avenger had their own unique powers, which after watching this, they're all pretty much equal, and in most cases its the uniform they wear that gives them the power. So Thermos wants to delete half the apps because his cell's memory is almost full. Logical. But the Avengers being just an app themselves feel threatened, but luckily they can power up anytime, somehow they can change the pre existing uniform they wear to combat any situation they are in! Awesome. it all takes place within the Sims universe, obviously, because only the Sims would be oblivious to the alien invasion happening all around them and still go to work the next day, and the Avengers know they are just Sims, otherwise they wouldn't be throwing out one liners while the city and its population are being destroyed around them. In the end Thermos gets his way and kills off half of the apps!! Until he gets an upgrade on his cell for Avengers: Endgame, and/or Disney contracts are negotiated. Also loved the recreation of the battle scene from Star Wars: Episode 1: The Phantom Menace. Droid army Vs the Naboo... only now it was Thermos' computer viruses Vs Wakanda... you're sayin that wasn't intentional? Filmbufftim on FB.","8"
"sangomiguel","THE BEST SUPERHERO MOVIE OF OUR TIME? (2020)","14 April 2021","With the participation of almost every member of the MCU, this movie redefines the Action genre, setting the bar higher up than ever before.

Special effects are out of this world (2020) the whole cast and crew delivers an excellent job, it takes you to every specter of human emotion the cinematics are great & soundtrack is compelling.

The story is very engaging, the script is hilarious and the movie doesn't follow the regular Hollywood formula it is with out a doubts not only one of the greatest super hero movies but one of the best achieved films in history hands down. 10/10.","10"
"TheMovieDoctorful","...Is That It?","14 November 2018","No matter what people think about me or my opinions, I wanted to like this film more than anyone. I love superheroes, I love Marvel and as much as I criticize the MCU for being safe and formulaic, there are several Marvel Cinematic Universe films that I've loved (The Guardians of the Galaxy movies, the first 2 Captain America movies, Avengers: Age of Ultron and Black Panther to name the big ones). And I love that this movie enthralled and captivated many of my friends, a good number of them calling this one of their favorite movies of all time. However, the truth of the matter is that Avengers: Infinity War disappointed me. It deeply let me down. It's not an absolute failure and I certainly wouldn't call it irredeemable, but I can't say I find it to be a good film either.

In terms of positives, the first one to come to mind would obviously be the jolly, purple giant himself, Thanos. He's undoubtedly one of the most interesting and developed villains in the MCU to date and he's acted phenomenally by Josh Brolin. I commend the creative team for keeping Thanos utterly despicable and villainous while still making him a compelling enough lead for us to be invested in his dark mirror of the Hero's Journey. It's fascinating to see an arc like this, full of sacrifice, struggle and personal loss concluding in an ultimate triumph, be translated to a villain without losing any of the qualities that keep him monstrous. He is a fully rounded, fully realized, human character; just not one who's a good person.

As someone who hated Tom Holland's Spider-Man in both Civil War and Homecoming, I actually liked his performance and characterization here. The high stakes consequences of the story allow Holland to go to emotional places he simply wasn't allowed to before and his relationship with Tony Stark carries much more emotional weight, relatability and humanity to it than either of his previous two films. Maybe there's hope for this Spider-Man after all.

Most (Keyword; most) of the content regarding the Guardians of the Galaxy is done wonderfully. Dave Bautista's Drax and Pom Klementieff's Mantis act wonderfully off of all the Avengers they get to interact with and it's nice to see that MCU teamup movies have moved and matured beyond thinking that every teamup movie needs all the team members to hate each other and fight over nonsense for 2 acts. Chris Pratt's performance as Starlord is truly heartbreaking and I commend the team behind Infinity War to have the guts to painfully strip away everything this character ever loved. For all my problems with the film, Starlord's emotional breakdown at Thanos after learning of Gamora's death is actually a major highlight of the movie for me. It's a deeply human and relatable moment that Pratt acts with such intensity and power.

I also found myself really invested in the love story of Vision and Wanda. Elizabeth Olsen and Kevin Bettany have beautiful chemistry and their calm, soft moments before the storm bring a real gentleness and quiet beauty to the film. Scarlet Witch being forced to kill the only man she ever loved to save half the universe was by far the most emotionally powered moment of the movie and it's such a shame these two got so little screentime.

That's the biggest problem of the film for me. Characters getting little screentime. Infinity War is deeply overstuffed, it has characters by the dozens and no idea what to do with a good half of them. Captain America, Bucky Barnes, Black Panther, the Hulk; all of these characters (As well as the side characters they're associated with) could be completely removed from the film and nothing would change. And yet, I'm supposed to feel the epic weight of their massive battle with the army of Thanos despite their importance to the story being minimal at best and non-existent at worst?

The ending felt cheap to me rather than dramatic and emotional. The only deaths to really affect me were Vision and Spider-Man. The rest (Minus Gamora, whose death is too awkwardly edited and weirdly toned down from a violence standpoint to affect me until Starlord's reaction, and Loki, who has been seemingly killed and brought back to life so many times that I hardly buy he's finally dead) die with little to no reaction from their friends and comrades when that's exactly what we needed. We don't get to see Rogers react to losing both of his closest friends or the rest of the Guardians all dying together. It's all such blatant sequel baiting, especially with many of the characters (Including Loki) already having future MCU films or TV shows announced. Gee, I guess they're all just going to center on piles of sand, huh? This kind of sequel baiting conclusion is hardly ""new"" or ""bold"" or ""inventive."" In fact, it's pretty much what the MCU already did with Captain America: Civil War.

Speaking of, as much as people want to give Guardians Vol. 2 crap for not balancing the comedy and drama well, where were your criticisms here? Towards a movie that starts making pop culture reference jokes almost immediately after Gamora's death, hardly even giving us a moment of mourning or reflection? A movie that hardly ever gives us a moment for pause for Thor to mourn Loki? I'm sure there was ambition in here somewhere, but in the end, everything got overpowered by the Marvel formula and tone for me.

No, Infinity War isn't terrible, but I simply think it bit off more than it could chew. However, everything is set up for Part II to blow me away. I'm still holding out hope for this stage of the MCU to end in a high note for me.","1"
"hp-33729","You must be a die hard Marvel fan to appreciate this","6 August 2018","I'm not really a Marvel fan, but I did enjoy some of their movies and like some of their characters. Apparently this movie is a culmination of all the previous storylines in the Marvel universe, so this time they made sure to _really_ go over the top with it to please the fans. All your favorite characters are there doing their own thing to fight against the main villain in an end game that feels like it's 7 hours long.

With so many characters and so many parallel storylines I found it hard to focus or care about anything and just tuned out, like when you're watching a very long battle in a Transformers movie that has no consequences whatsoever and the movie loses you and you start to ask yourself why you're not doing anything useful with your life instead of watching that nonsense.

It's probably just me as I'm not really interested in this universe in general and the main villain is kind of disappointing in my opinion, but be warned, if you're not a die hard fan either, you will probably be bored to death just like me.","9"
"Mr-Fusion","Goes down (too) easy.","29 April 2018","High on battle scenes and low on actual substance, ""Infinity War"" is the culmination of ten years' hype. And that kind of buildup is embodied in the CGI; this is a visual feast (or marvel, if you will). I mean, this thing bursts with color.

But it's also fairly empty. I mean, hey, that's a *lot* of characters to stuff into a movie, but it feels like one huge chessboard, whisking away certain faces to accommodate others. In that sense, this Marvel galaxy is fractured, and the movie feels choked with characters as a result.

If I have a problem with this movie, it's this: the stakes are never real. Size notwithstanding, Thanos is especially weak here (given his buildup in the Guardians movies), and I didn't walk away thinking that (most) of the deaths are permanent. It's almost antiseptic in that regard; c'mon, they just fade away? Everyone's comparing this to ""The Empire Strikes Back"", but that's only because it's a downer. And only mildly.

I don't mean to harp on the movie. It lives up to the demands of orchestrating a boatload of properties while delivering the high production values. And it's a solid Summertime distraction. And that's about it.

"haydenluz","Avengers: Infinity War","13 August 2020","Long behold, the film everyone has been waiting ten years for, is finally here! This is one of those Marvel films that anyone can enjoy, while the Russo Brothers also brilliantly utilizes all that we've learned in the past MCU films, to create the most cohesive, emotional, and high octane, story yet! The Russo Brothers utilized some of the best tones the MCU has set, to really enhance the emotion and tention in every scene. They put a great deal of heart into this film, but sometimes it got cut thin by the over abundance of jokes, that Marvel seems to think is necessary, every opportunity there is. The Russo Brothers had both hands on the wheel at all times, setting this fast, yet brisk pace, incorporating countless memorable scenes! There wasn't a scene that goes under appreciated, adding in tremendous risk, from the most menacing villain yet, but at times, it can feel a little clunky with the scene placement.

With this still being a story-based film, the characters moved the story really well, being the driving force of the film! While having all of these characters on screen at once, it's impossible to balance everyone equally, but the Russo Brothers were able to create so many amazing character moments, to get you really invested into what's going on, and not so much, what they missed. Even though they can step on their own toes at times, creating some inconsistencies and plot gaps, they still did a good job of understanding where these characters come from, and used them to their strengths. The cast as a whole does a great job, displaying seamless chemistry, even from some of the side and new characters.

The screenplay by Christopher Markus & Stephen McFeely, was very good overall. There are a lot more high points to the writing than bad, but there are still some forceful pieces of dialogue and jokes at times. Markus and McFeely have had their hands in most of these films, creating some hit or miss screenplays, but they put on their best work here.

So far, Infinity War undoubtedly has the best action sequences of the saga. The Russo Brothers crafted so many high octane action scenes, backed up by some amazing stunt work. The effects were done pretty well for the most part, but there are some points where you can tell they got lazy, and didn't completely polish things up as well as they could've.

Overall, Infinity War is THE BEST film of the Infinity Saga, bringing these films to new heights!","10"
"ryfin","My Favorite MCU Movie","8 November 2021","I adore this movie, and it is by far my favorite MCU movie. Each character gets at least one great moment or memorable line, they perfectly mesh all of the different tones established in the respective universes, and Thanos is an iconic villain that was truly given the respect he deserved. This movie has quite a bit of humor, but pretty much all of it worked very well to me. Normally when a marvel movie gets this long, it starts to get boring or it heavily drags during some points, but this movie is constantly moving towards the climax and really keeps you invested. I was so surprised by this, as I saw it with all of my high school buddies without many expectations of it. While Endgame will be remembered as the iconic end of the franchise, this will always be my favorite because of the attention given to each of its characters, and the excellent ending that subverts expectations and perfectly sets up our characters for the finale they needed.","1"
"hello-181-893413","Absolutely bored.","30 April 2018","Maybe I'm just getting massive franchise fatigue but I found the moving totally borIng. The story is linear, the stakes don't seem real by foreshadowIng the fact that they can change the past, and there's a LOT of backstory they fill in to get you up to speed on all 500 marvel super hero's from their various franchises that it's hard to feel emotionally engage. The power balance between characters strength and weaknesses seemed flawed. One character would be in peril from X weapon in one scene but then beat a more powerful weapon Y in another scene. Movies attain suspension of disbelief by setting and following rules. These rules seemed sloppily applied but all in all it wasn't as bad as Venom...","10"
"FabledGentleman","All in","25 April 2018","MAJOR SPOILERS!! DO NOT READ IF YOU HAVEN'T SEEN THE FILM!

My headline is the easy way to describe this movie. It is grand, majestic and spectacular. Just like Thanos towering everyone else with his physique this movie also stands above everything else, at least most of it. Because wow, this movie is really something to behold. Marvel went all in with everything here, the cgi is phenomenal, the acting is great, the story is well told, the pacing is near perfect. I have seen this movie twice in IMAX 3D and once in 4DX now, and i have never seen a movie with better image quality than this one, never.

Ever since the MCU started with Iron Man i have seen every film released, most of them are good, some are outright great, a few are mediocre and very few are bad. But for the most part it has been a hell of a ride, and I've eagerly been awaiting this movie for quite some time, we all knew that it would come down to this, but were you prepared for what would be the outcome? Not many were, though many of us knew several avengers and other major characters would die in this film, i did not expect it to be this many.

This movie truly didn't waste any time getting down to business, as before ten minutes had passed, Heimdall and Loki are killed, and we see the Titan kick the crap out of Hulk, this set the tone for the entire movie right of the bat, and was IMO a smart move, now we knew for sure what a badass Thanos is, and this was before he got all the stones.

What the Russo brothers have done here is to overdo themselves. Winter Soldier and Civil War are two of the best MCU movies to date, and you got to wonder how Marvel found these guys, and knew what they were capable of, because Infinity War just lifted the bar even higher. This movie is sort of Michael Bay's wet dream, this is what he wants to achieve, but never can because he has no idea how to tell a story or handle emotions. This movie is a 2 hour and 30 minute spectacle, which has action scene after action scene lined up, and it never feels too much, somehow they managed to balance it, and that is a feat not many directors can pull off.

But also the music is masterfully composed, and fit every scene perfectly. And the costumes and props design are state of the art, everything looks and feels so right in this film, all the people involved has done an outstanding job.

And i really have to give it to Josh Brolin. Thanos is easily the best villain i have seen in quite some time. He is a complex villain, that is so well portrayed i almost start rooting for him, and that is saying something come to think how many years i have grown to love the avengers and the guardians. This is also big thanks to the amazing cgi that just brings so much life into the character. I can understand his motivations, i can side with his thoughts, i both agree and i disagree at same time. Such a great character, easily the best MCU villain so far, and i had Loki as my favorite before him.

At the end when Spider-man, Doctor Strange, Scarlett Witch, Nick Fury, Star-Lord, Black Panther, Mantis, Bucky Barnes and many others are killed because he gets all the stones, i both felt a sense of pride for Thanos completing his mission, he truly is a determined badass. But at the same time i felt great sadness that so many of the characters that i loved, are dead.

But MCU has killed characters before, which has been brought back to life, so i guess that will be the case here as well, as the next movie most likely will deal with time travel and fight Thanos in the future and the past. Dr.Strange gave up the time stone because of the 14.000.605 outcomes that he saw, only one lead to victory for the avengers, and giving up the stone was the beginning of the victory path. So even though this movie ended on a cliffhanger, it left enough hints that will be talked about for a whole year, and it will build the biggest hype in the history of cinema. So at the end of the day, this movie just delivers on so many levels, and it will make way for the rise of many new characters to enter the MCU, and finally take down Thanos and undo some of the damage he has done.

It's quite amazing that this movie actually managed to live up to the hype, that should not even be possible when you think about it, but it did. The movie is absolutely amazing.

I can't wait for Avengers 4.","5"

"tommy5677","Great Expectations","29 September 2018","That's what you enter the theater with. Especially when you're going to see a Marvel movie. In this case not a single one was met. By the middle of the movie I found myself asking, where is it going and when is it going to get there.

Three quarters in I found myself realizing it needed to be over. Every scene became a drag because that's what they did. On and on, one after another, with no endpoint. It was like the writer had a vision and then went blind.

A simple plot that was easy to follow but it never seemed to develop. And you would think that in 2 1/2 hours you might get to know your characters a little. There was so much constant action and CGI, there was little or no time for that.

If you enjoy being on the edge of your seat the entire time, this movie will do it for you because the action is never ending. A shining example of overdone CGI, lots of violence, and not enough time to tell if anyone can actually act.

All of this nonsense to be left in the end with an incredible sense of loss. When I go to a superhero movie I want the superhero to win. In this case, The Avengers are nothing but a bunch of losers.

And then there was the End Credits. They were giving credit to employees of the studios, like the CEO of Disney. WTF! This went on ad nauseum just like the movie itself. Don't waste your time waiting for the scene at the end, you'd be better off leaving the theater before the credits start to roll. In my opinion, this movie is an abysmal failure. Don't waste your 13 bucks on such trash.","2"

More heroes, villains, battles, worlds, stars and CGI do not make a better movie. I really liked the first two avengers movies wich also did have a lot of heroes, but it had it's own style. This was a mix of everything that didn't really match. Thank god part 2 of this movie wich had a lot more of what Hollywood movies often tend to forget : a story, emotions, a twist, a plot,... That could explain the very high rating here, allthough a clickfarm also could. If I get the chance to see the sequal for free I would, but if I miss it, that's just fine.","10"
"AlsExGal","Marvel scores again","26 August 2018","Epic superhero team-up from Marvel Studios and directors Anthony & Joe Russo. When an alien named Thanos (motion capture and voice performance from Josh Brolin) begins to collect all six of the Infinity Stones, incredibly powerful artifacts that grant their possessor unimaginable abilities, it's up to the galaxy's greatest heroes to try and stop him. Original Avengers Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.), Thor (Chris Hemsworth), Hulk (Mark Ruffalo), Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson) and Captain America (Chris Evans) join forces with newcomers Dr. Strange (Benedict Cumberbatch), Spider-Man (Tom Holland), Black Panther (Chadwick Boseman) and even the Guardians of the Galaxy, among others, but will their combined might be enough to stop Thanos' apocalyptic plan?

The culmination of plotlines 10 years in the making, this is one of the biggest gambles in movie history, and it seems to have paid off. The directors and screenwriters somehow manage to juggle this many characters and keep the balance just about right, with memorable moments doled out to all of them. The plot itself is very basic (""Stop Thanos""), and much time is spent on well-executed action scenes and eye-candy science fiction set-pieces. The dialogue is very humorous, and the various character combinations are amusing. There are usually three or four story directions going on at once, with the action switching from location to location frequently, but never in such a way as to become a distraction or disorienting. The biggest question mark of the film was how well Thanos would turn out, a villain that's been teased for the last 6 years in these movies. I was dubious about Brolin's casting, as while I like him in many things, he never struck me as intergalactic demi-god alien appropriate. I'm happy to say that he works out fine, and while the effects work done on him is very good, his voice sells the character, arguably one of the best developed out of any of the Marvel movies thus far.

I won't go into spoiler territory, but I will mention that the ending may befuddle or even anger some viewers. As a former comic book reader, I wasn't upset by it, and even expected it (even before the internet spoiled things for me). But those going in blind should be prepared for an unconventional finale.","10"

I went out of the cinema and couldn't believe it. For me it's the peak of the superhero genre alongside with Endgame.

"tyrantlizardthad","The Best MCU film; a masterpiece","19 August 2021","Avengers: Infinity War is a film so powerful and good that instead of being crushed by the weight of its expectations, it lifted them up and launched them out into space. Packed with epic, intense action, fantastic character work, and a powerful ending, it doesn't get much better then this. It's especially remarkable when you remember just how much buildup there was to this film and how massive the expectations were, you would think it would be almost impossible to meet, but Infinity War does it so well it makes it look easy.

The story is exhilarating, it moves at a brisk pace which really makes you feel the immense stakes and how urgent the situation is. Every single character is handled extremely well and are all in character. The film makes sure to pay attention to what spot they're in in their character journey since the last film each respective character was in and continues their development. It maintains continuity and brings every character together in a way that's organic and serves the story perfectly. Tony Stark finally gets to fight the thing he has been tormented by and preparing for years to fight, Steve Rogers and most of the other Avengers are fugitives of the law and thus are more rugged, Bruce Banner is still dealing with his conflict with the Hulk (continuing what was established Thor: Ragnarok), Thor is dealing with the grief of losing everything, manifesting in personal vengeance towards Thanos, and much more. But perhaps the best thing about the film is the characterization of Thanos, one of the best villains in cinema since Darth Vader from Star Wars (which was the intent of the Russos, specifically saying that the wanted to make ""the next Darth Vader""). He is a ruthless, insane and narcissistic monster, but he still has honorable traits, respects his enemies, he has a very flawed perspective of how to save the universe but believes it whole-heartedly, and even a fatherly love towards Gamora. He's terrifying but also humanized, and it just works perfectly.

The computer generated effects, especially those that brought Thanos to life, are perfect, as is the soundtrack. While MCU scores are typically regarded as forgettable, Alan Silvestri's score for Infinity War is anything but. The performances are impeccable as well, there's not a single unsatisfying or uneven performance. Josh Brolin as Thanos, Robert Downey Jr. As Tony Stark, Chris Hemsworth as Thor, Chris Evans as Steve Rogers, Chris Pratt as Peter Quill, Benedict Bumberbatch as Doctor Strange, Elizabeth Olsen as Wanda and Zoe Salanda as Gamora in particular stick out to me and knock it out of the park.

In conclusion, Infinity War is the best MCU film and one of the best films to have come out in the past 10 years, and I don't think you could ask for more. Infinity War (along with its sequel, Avengers: Endgame) isn't just a movie, it's an experience.","1"
"pal05052003","A superhero movie that really makes you fear for the lives of superheroes","29 April 2018","Avengers: Infinity War manages to fix and upgrade superhero movies on many levels. First, it manages to deliver a truly intimidating villain with a good motivation. Thanos, played by Josh Brolin, is an upgrade of great Marvel villains such as Killmonger, who is human, and Hela, who is a goddess. Brolin's delivery is perfect, his voice is calm but intimidating and his performance makes you actually root for him. P.s. he gets to manhandle some of the most powerful Avengers. Second, Infinity War manages to raise the stakes like never before. Even Thanos' henchmen are formidable fighters and can take on any Avenger any time. Never before have I really feared for the lives of a superhero in a superhero movie. Third, all characters have enough screen time to allow them to shine and to remind you why they are heroes. Unfortunately, Black Widow does not get much material to work with, but she has a kickass fight in the end, so I am cool. Finally, despite the destruction, the movie manages to lighten the mood periodically so it does not get too depressing. The stirring musical score by Alan Silvestri is so well integrated to the movie that manages to rouse you without you noticing it. All in all, Avengers: Infinity War is probably the only movie where you really fear for all the heroes, but somehow also root for the villain.","10"

They're all ""super"" so no one is super anymore. And I feel some character have lost their true nature. Iron Man for example: what defines the character is his suit of armour, high tech sure, but still ""clunky"" and ""solid"". This new nano tech suit fits and looks like a soft glove: transition from a knight in armour to a well dressed, tailored character. Of course the movie is visually striking, but again, from the first scene to the last: I got used to the visuals after about 20 minutes, the rest felt to me like repetition.","10"

Basically, if you feel obligated to view it for your favorite characters, just beware, there's not much screen time for them, so don't push yourself, or feel like you have to do it.

A film that has so much going on and still manages to be boring just has to be some sort of a record. I went to the cinema with so much hope and enthusiasm and left wishing I'd kept my cash instead. The fact that so many characters leave no room for any sort of character development probably comes as a surprise to no one, and yet every single person in the film managed to annoy me at one point or another. The only exception to that rule was Stephen Strange, whom I've come to completely adore. I've always disliked Tony Stark so I was truly sorry I didn't get to see him disappear in a cloud of poop-colored dust but at that point I was almost beyond the point of caring. Black Widow, another one of mine top runners for the character I despise the most, thankfully did not have much screen time, and yet more than most. Spider Man - more like Pathetic Spider Boy, amirite - was once more delegated to being Iron Man's most faithful groupie, and poor Bucky had maybe three minutes of screen time (after finding out that Hawkeye was not actually in the movie, he was basically the main reason why I really wanted to see this steaming pile of hot garbage, so another disappointment there). Also, considering the number of characters who died in this, we can be almost certain that they won't stay dead, otherwise Marvel wouldn't have anybody to make movies about anymore, unless they want to bring about Squirrel Girl. So any emotional impact any deaths may have caused was non-existent. Most of the jokes fell flat, and even though the storylines were woven together almost masterfully, it did nothing to disguise the fact that this flick was basically just another pathetic cash grab. And boring to boot. And to add insult to injury, after I sat through the entire credits, I was treated to the promise of Captain Marvel. Horay. We don't need another character up in here, we really don't. And especially not Carl Manvers. Not worth the cash, not worth the hype, not worth another word.","7"

"KikiF7","BEST AVENGERS MOVIE TO DATE!","8 November 2021","I'm a huge comic movie junkie and I could not wait to see this movie. I always see them on opening day in the theaters no matter what! This one is so action packed with all your favorite avengers. I had every emotion and feeling under the sun while watching this. I got goosebumps, I cried, I laughed, I got excited, I had anxiety, I was nervous, I was angry, I was happy. This movie will definitely give you whiplash in the emotion department. But it is by far the best avenger movie to date! And considering that it's their last one, I'm happy about that. But I'm extremely sad that this is the end of this MCU universe and I will miss all of them so very very much. At least we still have Thor, who should be appearing in the new Guardians of the Galaxy movie.","10"
"mistramicizia","Quite possibly the most overrated movie of 2018... maybe the entire decade","29 June 2018","Before I bought the tickets for this, I was amazed, to say the least, by the high ratings at this site. Still being rather skeptic, the ride started, and it actually seemed promising in the beginning. As the movie proceeds, however, it felt for me like a bunch of characters fighting, in a typical ""good vs. evil"" manner, while the bad guy, who had so much more potential, seems to be utterly evil with some seemingly emotional moments of redemption mixed in. The atmosphere in the movie IS dark, much darker than the previous Marvel movies, actually. There was an ""apocalyptic"" feeling throughout the entire movie. However, I was still shocked by the public that showed many emotions during the screening. There was something I probably missed in the movie. I have the feeling that Marvel Studios simply used some ""plot holes"" inside this movie for the sake of commercialization and further production of the MCU movies. Regardless, I would recommend watching this because many people find this to be the best thing that ever happened to the MCU.

Avengers: Infinity War culminates 10 years of the Marvel Cinematic Universe(MCU)'s world-building and makes a TREMENDOUS pay-off in this two-and-a-half hour action adventure epic that is part swashbuckler and part space-opera. The Russo Brothers deliver the screenplay of a lifetime from Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely; and boy the two duos that have single-handedly shaped the MCU into what it is today. They direct a star-studded cast featuring the likes of Robert Downey Jr., Peter Dinklage, Benedict Cumberbatch, Josh Brolin, Bradley Cooper, Tom Holland and Mark Ruffalo. That's only PART of the ensemble cast this film has to offer. And the story; my god the story and scale of this movie: IT'S INCREDIBLE; and it's basically a full-fledged space opera now!

For those of you who aren't ardent superhero nuts but passively love Spider-Man all the same (like I do), get this: SPIDER-MAN IS IN SPACE! From the ambitious union of characters built around 10 years of multi-billion-dollar filmmaking culminates in one of the ultimate cinematic experiences your hard-earned money can buy and be considered a well-earned investment all-round. Witty quips, Beatles references, a Flash Gordon quip from Peter Quill, it's just a great-great time at the movies.

Infinity War is a space-opera with superheroes; and it's comparable to the likes of The Star Wars Trilogy, The Lord of the Rings Trilogy and, (heck, maybe even) The Dark Knight Trilogy. This is cinema bursting at the seams; but it's GOOD bursting as opposed to muddled bursting (Suicide Squad is one such misfire).

MARVEL; you've made quite the pay-off this time. Keep it up!","5"

People have just have just made up their minds that it's avengers so it must be a very good movie. The pervious avengers movie were better than this one. In this movie everything was scattered, the good thing was that they connected everything with the previous marvel movies that is why I gave it a 5 rating or else I wouldn't have given it that also. The end especially, people are left clueless as to what is about to happen. Only that person will know who has actually read the comics. I was shocked to see that this movie is above Fight Club!! I mean what on earth are people thinking? This is just my view on it though but I don't think this was a good movie, there was just a lot of hype created for this movie because which people actually started believing that this is the greatest movie ever made while in reality it was just an average movie.","10"

"mikocot","Disturbing experience.","11 May 2018","I am not a comics specialist and unlike most of the others I have no emotional connection to any of the hereos... so I might be biased.

I have never expected much of a story line or intrigue from a movie solely based on the heroes presence, but being recommended as a revolutionary and number one of the series I hoped for at least a bit of cheap humor and great pictures.

Yet, in the movie I've laughed twice, first time when Thor called raccoon a rabbit, and second time... when he did it again. The ending is surprising, especially for an American movie, but besides this the movie neither offers scenography comparable with Star Wars or Avatar nor any unique special effects.

There is no consistency in action, power distribution or whatsoever. One minute the same character can die from a fist hit, the other he survives an explosion of the whole planet. Once he travels the space barefoot, the other he dies from being sucked from the ship. The colorful light goes back and forth but the evil character doesnt use any of his powers most of the time just to prolong the boring fights.

Watching this movie is just distubring and frustrating.","10"
"bogdanrc","A Michael Bay infantile movie...","27 April 2018","Awesome visuals and CGI, but this is not 1990s. Terminator 2 was awesome back then. Now CGI just does not impress anymore. That's Michael Bay territory, and this movie sure looks like that - awesome CGI and dumb plot.

Character and plot wise, I just want to say that I am sick of heroes and villains having their abilities appear or vanish from one scene to another just to justify the plot. Not to talk about stupid character decisions that completely change the plot...

It takes away from the soul of the story which becomes simple, forced and artificial.

SPOILER:

Just one example for abilities (but the movie is full of it): in one scene Thanos beats the pulp out of Hulk, but in the rest of the movie all the other heroes receive punches from him like it's nothing.

And one example of stupidity: Quill becomes responsible for the grim ending by saving Thanos in the last second, as Thanos was on the verge of being stripped of its powers.

"adeckofcards","Superhero odyssey","25 July 2020","A tape of incomparable magnitudes. An unprecedented superhero odyssey. This seems to me the best way to describe this film, which takes the limits of the genre to a new level. In a world like today where superhero cinema dominates the market, even more so the movies from Marvel Studios, it can often be difficult to surprise. However, Infinity War not only creates this emotion inherent in a movie of these characteristics, but it brings together the best that Marvel has built over ten years and mixes it in an organic as well as frantic and impressive way every second. It is a film that is practically constant action, like many of the genre, but with a speech and an emotional weight greater than that seen on other occasions. A special care is appreciated in forming a convincing story with enough dramatic and sentimental value, at the same time that the narrative action does not stop. 'Avengers Infinity War' is first and foremost a superhero movie that embraces the genre and exploits it to the fullest. A film with great ambitions that is capable of surpassing itself, resulting in one of the best films in the studio and in the genre itself.","1"
"nicar127","Avengers: Infinity War - Review","13 May 2018","Kill kill kill. Death. That's what this movie is about. To their credit, the actors in this film were all great, despite each being given minimal screen time, with near zero character development. There are just too many characters and angles, each with the same ultimatum: KILL. (They are all trying to kill the villain Thanos, of course, but it's still Kill Kill Kill!)

I never felt any passion for any of them until Gamora was thrown to her death by her POS step dad Thanos. When we see movies we want to feel the passion of the characters we are watching. None existed until this moment. My favorite character in this film is Peter Quill. Way to go Chris Pratt. He brought depth and passion, sorrow and love, to his role. He is the stand out in this film. I cried when he cried. I was pissed off when he was pissed off. Peter Quill / Star Lord was the sole representative of human emotion in this film. And he did it well.

On the technical note, Thanos just looks like a cartoon character. (No offense, Josh Brolin, you were GREAT as Thanos!!) CGI always looks fake. I watched the entire movie imagining the ""green screen"" behind all of them. In a few years, actors won't be needed at all.

Iron Man could have just gotten a huge eraser to erase Thanos The Cartoon. Have a great summer!","2"
"oliverdimitri","THE BEST SUPERHERO MOVIE EVER!!","26 April 2018","Engrossing, Epic, Emotional. Those are the three E's that define this movie. The latest instalment of the Marvel Cinematic Universe franchise is at its very best, culminating ten years of marvel adventure and spectacle with the biggest and most boldest movie in the superhero genre. So let's start with Anthony and Joe Russo, the geniuses that made this beast of a movie. After announcing that they will be directing the next two Avengers movies, Marvel fans knew at once that this will be the darkest Avengers movie yet. Yes, it was very dark with more of a serious tone. More than Winter Soldier and Civil War (previous marvel movies directed by the Russo Bothers) combined but they also had what the other Avengers movies had as well, the humour and it was not at all tasteless. Nobody really cared if it was necessary or not because the humour worked along with the edgy parts of the movie. This is by far the Russo brothers best work among the Marvel movies completely raising the bar of superhero movies to it's highest. Praise to Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely for writing the amazing script (they also wrote the scripts of Captain America, The Avengers, Winter Soldier, Age of Ultron and Civil War also known to be the best marvel movies). Now, the characters and story. Practically everyone that you've seen in the previous marvel movies that aren't dead, are in this movie. Everyone had the chance to shine even if it's the smallest way possible. There were so many character arcs in this movie and none of them were cut short or boring. Every scene is in the movie was worth digesting and deciphering, along with the surprises and the twists and turns that will get audiences on the edge of their seat. Everything from character development to the pacing of the storyline, makes you jump, scream, gasp or cry. And of course, the one and only, Thanos. The villain that has been teased one too many times is finally here and he delivers. Josh Brolin officially portrays the best villain in the MCU, completely pissing on Marvel's villain problem. He brings all out on the table with everything he's got. Not only will you hate Thanos by the end of the movie, but you will understand him and maybe even feel sorry for him for a few seconds. They brought layers into him that no one has seen in a movie portrayal of a Marvel villain. They made him scary and strong at the same time vulnerable and understandable. The motivation of his doing and his character development made him the best character in the movie, making the movie all about him. I cannot tell you anymore about this movie because then I would be spoiling. All I have to say is that whether you're a marvel fan or not, and if you at least know what has been going on in the previous marvel movies, GO AND WATCH IT. It will not be a waste of your time or money. Digest this to prepare for what's to come.

I may be bias once again but I just have to. I have to rate this movie 10/10. If I don't, I would be betraying myself.","10"
"dezsokekovacs","This movie isn't entertaining (exept maybe for the Thanos fans)","28 April 2018","If you like to watch for 2.5 hours how your heroes get beaten and even killed then this movie is for you, otherwise it will not entertain you. At the beginning Thanos has only one Infinity Stone but at the end he has all the stones and therefore he snap his fingers, half of the population dies (Avengers included) and ... THE END! This means that there are 5 fights for the 5 stones and Thanos wins all the fights by beating and/or killing the Avengers.

All MCU movies structures are the same. They are split in 2 parts: in the first half the heroes get beaten and the villain wins all, but when all hope is gone it start the second half when the heroes recover from their wounds and they win (almost every time) with a big ""idiotic"" bam. The Avengers: Infinity War is the first half.

I think it will be entertaining to watch it when the Avengers 4 will come out (just like The fellowship of the ring + The two tower). It's very likely that in Avengers 4 they will use the time stone to reverse the time to resurrect the dead Avengers. Or maybe another stone (honestly I don't really know what they can do) but the resurrection is for sure.

Bottom line: this movie is watchable if you see it only once. But to watch several times how your heroes get killed means that you need therapy.

PS: When Dr. Strange looked into the future to find a positive solution, he found only ONE from millions of possibilities and they didn't used it. Why? Or they used it but Strange didn't saw in the future that Peter Quill is coming?","1"

"ocr-94520","Silly movie","10 May 2018","It totally wasn't how i expected it to be. It's just a silly film with only action. Many cringy dialogues and dumb moments ruined the film. I felt really bad when yondu died in GOTG 2 but in this film never felt anything for anyone. So many died but i don't know why this film was in a rush and that's why their death didn't made me feel bad for them. They should have increased the runtime of the film. One of the worst thing is characters were not balanced. Captain america hardly had any dialogue. Hulk was shown only for 30 seconds in the entire film. There were many ways to stop thanos but hey he should look badass so let's make heroes dumb. Cgi was okay but in many places it looked cartoon-ish. In one scene it looked like Mark ruffalo's face is pasted on hulk buster. The film is full of plot holes.","1"
"Shakor77","Pointless","18 July 2018","To a certain degree most super hero movies are pointless as they are mainly about beings with super powers and in flamboyant costumes duking it out at each other. And, seeing as I grew up reading super-hero comics, that is just fine.

However, without getting into any spoilers, this movie could have ended the first minute as the end-result would have been the same as watching the whole thing for 2+ hours. So I guess you could say that this game was a setup for the next Avengers movie, which seems to have become the norm these days.

But disregarding that, there are a number of other weak points in this movie such as:

Hulk was a massive disappointment and made his weakest contribution so far of any Avengers movie. And it was never explained why.

Vision was another disappointment as apparently the Black Widow, who has no super powers, could hold her own against someone who was mopping the floor with Vision.

Some young girl in Wakanda, who I never heard of in the comics, is apparently more intelligent than both Bruce Banner and Tony Stark as she came up with a solution, in about 5 minutes after been presented with the problem, that those other two hyper-intelligent people could not come up with. I suppose that is because of feminism?

Loki made a very uncharacteristic choice which quickly made him irrelevant in this movie. Why then even have him in the movie to begin with?

Dr Strange, who was pretty good in the movie, didn't seem to stand much of a chance against a Thanos henchman but apparently could go toe to toe with Thanos himself?

Thor was easily swept aside by Thanos, in the beginning, yet by the end seemed to be the only one who could actually defeat Thanos, just because he had a weapon. Yet in Thor: Ragnarok Odin suggested that Thor, was more powerful than Odin and did not need any weapons as he said: Are you Thor: son of Hammers?

I could go on and on but this is basically a very nice action movie with some great performances from actors such as Josh Brolin as Thanos. But don't think too deeply about it as it is just an action movie and not much more.","1"
"billking6666","Not the Marvel I remember.","29 September 2019","Disney really went all out on this and the sequel. Thanos was a character introduced AFTER my time reading marvel Comics. His character is what we in the gaming world would call OP (Over Powered). How does destroying 50% of all life in the universe bring balance? The whole blasted plot was based on that silly premise! I am pretty sure I need to blame some obscure writers at Marvel for this ridiculous plot and character. The entire movie makes a mockery of science and even science fiction. Spoiler: The idea that you could collect 6 stones (which were created during the Big bang) and then snap your fingers to wipe out 1/2 of all life EVERYWHERE in the known (and probably unknown as well) universe takes witchcraft, sorcery and the supernatural to levels beyond anything within reason. Now where do you go Disney? You gave us a worst case scenario and any future villains will be mild by comparison. As with Thor Ragnarok you destroyed a future where Marvel has skipped over many villians and leapfrogged to the top, leaving a barren wasteland for future enemies to ""marvel"" at.","1"
"three_dead_crows","Do not believe the ratings, this movie is not nearly as good as people claim it is","5 May 2018","In the end this movie proved to be an absolute slugfest that never stops. The action is nonstop and there is neither any buildup or climax to the action. This could have been redeemed if the actors had any time to do their jobs but they were never given any time to perform and so the characters are rather disconnected from their surroundings and their reactions ridiculous. The only character that is given time to evolve in this movie is Thanos, and he is an interesting figure and I fully approve of how they chose to adapt his motivations instead of following the comic books. But one character is not enough and as usual there is nothing on the line which is hardly surprising since they need to milk every cent they can out of the franchise, and I do not in any way blame them for this. But when the movie ends and not a single character have been killed except for heimdal I really can't bother with their cash grabbing ways any longer. For the people who actually believes that half the characters died i pity your stupidity, because it is painfully obvious that they will be revived in the next movie and everything will continue. The day marvel decide to actually have the heroes sacrifice crap and take responsibility for their actions is the day I will respect marvel. After watching this movie I feel that the correct way to continue is to make an entire movie about what an complete and utter failure Peter Quill is, just like they did with Danny Rand in the defenders.","6"

So when watching this with my movie theatre-working friend, we were very excited to watch all those awesome characters come together to fight one really Big Bad one who cannot be easily defeated by just any one of them, one who goes by the name of Thanos. I mean, at the very beginning, someone is already defeated and by the end, well, it's not pretty, that's for sure! That end also seems to be a cliffhanger for the inevitable sequel that I know has already been made and is due next year. Great mix of humor and drama!

"DaytonaBob","The WHOLE Universe? SERIOUSLY? Silliness abounds. SPOILERS","17 January 2019","The movie was mostly a lot of CGI and a lot more fighting. ALL neat to watch. BUT the idiocy of believing there are a handful of little stones that control the ENTIRE UNIVERSE? All the neat outer space scenes and strange alien landscapes all of that.

BUT to say he would be able to control the ENTIRE Universe?

I am sorry but that is beyond ridiculous.

I am huge Marvel fan and can actually say I have been reading Marvel since FF#4. And at one time had almost every single issue of the comics they put out until the mid 70s. They were great fun.

This movie on the other hand is silly. One person with a handful of stones controls the ENTIRE UNIVERSE.

Do the writers at Marvel et al have any clue as to the size of the universe and that is just what we have been able to see? The bazillions and gazillions of GALAXIES, the number of planets would be a ONE followed by millions of zeros. The amount of beings, and all sorts of life forms would be a One followed by a number of zeros so large it is unfathomable.

I would have bought say, the galaxy. But this stupidity of the entire universe was just that.

Seriously lame. Silly and beyond any sense of rational thought. YES it is comics and just a movie but the primary belief in how to enjoy a movie is the SUSPENSION OF DISBELIEF. Sorry, NO. And on top of that it all centered around a small planet in one of the arms of the Milky Way closer to the edge of the end of the arm than otherwise. Really? HOW did we get so lucky in the ENTIRE UNIVERSE.

We are supposed to believe the Thanos character would have the ability to wipe out half of that? BWAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA

I love Marvel but this should have been an insult to anyone with more than 2 brain cells to rub together. Oh well I hope we don't get a conclusion that reminds me of an old Saturday Morning serial of Jungle Jim where at the end of the episode where we had to come back next Saturday to that theater to find out how he got out of the predicament of being caught in a HOLE half way done and below him were lions ready to tear him apart and above him were natives ready to rip him apart and cook him.

So how did he get out of it? Well Next Saturday's episode started with the voice over stating: ""After Jungle Jim got out of his last trap he headed towards the nearest village"" Seriously that is how they did it.

So are we going to get either this was an alternate universe? A dream that when one of them gets out of the shower his wife says I had the strangest dream? Or .....? ""Thanos you bad boy, Where have you been? Your father and I have been looking all over dozens of universes. Now you put things right or you are going to get such a paddling when we get back to home!""

Thanos: ""Aw gee mom you never let me have any fun""

This will be the only interesting part is what silliness they use to restore the universe to its natural order minus some nutjob like Thanos.

Gods above and below that was an awful movie but it was cool to see all the Superheroes in one movie.

. So glad I could watch it at home and fast forward through all the fighting.

Don't get me wrong, originality alone does not make a good story. This movie continues to try squeeze water from a rock and I leave wanting so much more.

"myema77","Avengers a flutter","17 May 2018","Marvels studios Avengers: Infinity War certainly lives up to the hype it generates. Now take a slow peek beneath the 'hype' and what do you find? You will see a repeat of what previous MCU chain movies offered: Slick action and stunning visuals. The producers know this mix works very well at the box office and so it comes to no surprise they apply this same formula again here.

Supposedly the culmination of previous MCU movies, Avengers: Infinity War is where superheroes gather to prevent the main villain Thanos from acquiring a set of supernatural stones in order to become the most powerful being in the entire universe and beyond.

With a disjointed plot, mediocre story line and poor character development for the main villain, Avengers: Infinity War falls below expectation as a standalone movie. The story line totally fails in building up the viewer's eagerness for their superheroes to give Thanos a good thrashing. (The exception maybe fanboy's for Bruce Banner) The supers are made to look as if they are a bumbling bunch, caring more for their kin than saving the entire universe. On the opposing side, Thanos is a grey brooding being waiting a chance to tell his (or it's) dull life story....yawn. Thano's screen presence doesn't invoke anything out of the viewer's emotions. No fear, anger or even sympathy; Nothing!

Towards the end of the movie I thought it would have been just super if Dr. Strange opened up a portal from the 'other' alternate superhero universe for the man of steel to come and beat Thanos out of his boring stone hunting life.

As of previous MCU movies, nutty one liners are a prerequisite and here in one glaring instance the scriptwriters stooped low for this.

Is Avengers: Infinity war a great movie? Opinions differ on opposite ends and with respect to that, let me say that Avengers: Infinity war is not great and not even good a movie.

Parents (If family values are high on your list) with young kids wanting to see this, be aware that Avengers: Infinity War has a dark underlying theme.

"aikenkatie","Meh","22 May 2018","Not that great- WAY too long, too unengaging and too many plot holes-just too much period. I'm notorious for crying in movies;didn't even sniffle, and there were many ""deaths"" of my fav characters. ""Poignant"" scenes were all flat, I didn't buy into any of them at all. Always a bad sign when I'm checking my watch and realizing I still have to sit there for 45 more minutes- didn't even stay for the bonus at the end. Yawn! Knew I waited for a reason, and I'm sorry I saw this- the individual movies are light years better- would still pay to see Black Panther/ Captain America/ Wonder Woman again, and I've seen them multiple times already. Jmo, but meh. Pretty disappointed.","1"
"Vartiainen","How can this be so good?","21 June 2018","Quite honestly this shouldn't work. Marvel has been approaching its breaking point for a while now. By conventional wisdom there are too many characters, too many storylines, too many warring threats and points of interest. We could even kind of see it in The Age of Ultron. Too many plot points, too vast a scale, too far-reaching a scope.

But somehow Marvel broke through. This is an amazing movie. It is everything that was promised and more. A third installment that actually manages to raise the stakes, to deliver something that feels bigger, grander, more epic than anything we've seen before. And keeping in mind that this is Marvel, and that we have seen some truly astonishing things already, that is saying something.

So what exactly did they do to pull this off? Well, for one, they absolutely nailed the villain. Thanos (Josh Brolin) had already been teased multiple times in previous films, but he had always been a big question mark for us. Would he truly be that threatening? Would he actually have the menace, the charisma and the ambition to stand as the biggest threat the Avengers had ever faced? I'm glad to report that he does exactly that, and more. Thanos might very well be the best villain Marvel has ever produced. That is not as high a bar as it perhaps should be, but it's still plenty assuring.

The usual tricks are also in full display and they work marvelously. Beautiful CGI, good character moments, lush backgrounds, fun character interactions and a real sense of adventure. Granted, the storyline is one of the grimmest yet seen in Marvel, but that merely makes it all seem worth more.

Now, to be fair, this is only the first part. The Infinity War will continue in the next Avengers film. But this is one of those rare Part Ones that manages leave you begging for more. That ending... We will be talking about that ending for decades to come.","5"
"Lewis_Heather787","I don't know what to say!","28 April 2018","What did I just watch???? To be honest I don't think I can process everything and I'm not such if that is a bad thing or a good thing. To get it out there straight away I'm not a die hard fan of these films actually if anything I've losing more and more interest in the MCU as its gone on. I'm not quite sure why, just a lot of them are not for me but I can see why general audience love them, they are vey appealing.

Positives.

The Russo brothers were given an almost impossible task and that was to bring together a huge amount of characters in one film and tell a cohesive story that works. For the most part I think they have achieved that, the directing of the film is faultless and is a real achievement considering the number of things that could go wrong with a film like this. Personally though I would put it behind ""Winter Soldier"" and ""Civil War"" for the Russo's , those films have less problems than this one.

The cast for the most part is good, I cant mention them all because there are so many however there are a couple of standouts. Firstly and I'm really shocked to be saying this, the best character in the film for me is Doctor Strange. Now I personally didn't like the character in he is own film, but thats another story, in this film he is the heart and plays an important role. Acting from Cumberbatch is obviously going to be great, but I was blown away by how good he really was. There is a fantastic fight scene between him and Thanos on his own, wow. The other standout is Thor, Hemsworth again knocks it out of the park and has really cool scenes towards the end of the film which are worth the wait. The others are all really good as well for the most part, but those two definitely stood above the rest.

Negatives

This is where this review gets a unhelpful mark because it goes against the consensus of this film. For me there are four main negatives film the film, ok bare with me. Firstly its the same old same old problem I personally have with the MCU and that is the dreaded humour. Extremely cringeworthy at times and once again far to much of it especially with the Guardians, which also really don't like. I know Im in the minority on this, and I have no problem in people thinking this is the best part of the film its just not for me. The humour of the film links to the next negative and that is the tone of the film, which to say the least is all over the place. One second we have cringeworthy jokes and the next second its all trying to be serious. I think the Russo's really struggled with this element of the film because the humour and jokes undermine the seriousness. Do one or the other?? The third negative is the end which is a complete joke right? The end was looking at first glance to be a fantastic emotional punch and shocking end to some characters. However instead they decide to ""kill"" off characters that we pretty much know for the most part will be back for the next Avengers film next year. Marvel have already announced sequels and other solo films for characters like Black Panther, Spiderman and maybe even Doctor Strange. So their deaths are meaningless and carry no weight, brings up the question what is the point in the whole film really when we know a reasonable amount of it is going to be reversed in the next film.(I could be wrong) The final small negative is the length of the film which is far too long, the film does definitely drag in some parts.

Overall the film is probably just about good enough for 70% out of 100 or 7 out of 10, when the film is good it is very enjoyable and good to watch however I have my reservations. They are mainly my own fault and I'm definitely in the minority when it comes to them. However I'm wondering whether even the most die hard fan is not a little disappointed with this film like hasn't this been 10 years in the making. Finally if you like these types of films you will absolutely love it however if your not to bothered like me then you might not enjoy it as much.","10"
"CubsandCulture","Better than expected, but still a narrative and thematic mess","12 December 2018","Everything about this movie was portrayed as bigger and more. Bigger Action! More heroes! The problem with that eventually more becomes less and the story collapses under its own weight. That happens here but not as much as I expected. The final film is coherent so there's that. It is also largely fun. There's that too. However, there is still too many sequence of the same stuff (get the stone!) and a lot of the film is very unwilling to play with the world it has set-up. Of note Dr. Strange and Thanos (post reality stone especially) are far too punchy. You can change the fabric of reality. Why do you insist on just punching people?

A film like this lives, or this case disappoints on its villain. Thanos is OK as a villain. He is played well by Brolin. How he is written leaves much to be desired. His radical environmentalism simply doesn't connect with anything that is actually happening in the world today. It makes the film feel insular and escapist in the wrong way. Moreover, the logic of the character requires him to be either a eugenicist or a ""eat the rich"" radical; the screenplay does neither. The writers try to split the different by applying the big moment randomly. (but somehow random means 1/2 of each significant couple among the heroes). It simply doesn't work. It is not chilling. It is not human. It is silly.

The deaths (""deaths"") are overdone. I simply do not believe Disney is going kill off a bunch of Golden Geese. It simply doesn't have any emotional weight because too many characters that have sequels in the works ""die."" The ending only gets a hearty chuckle from me.

This film is fun. It moves and most of the action is good. But it is shallow, hollow and expects us to forget how capitalism works.","10"

The scenes were outstanding, Thanos fighting all of the Avengers and then some who wasn't Avengers joined in to beat this evil foe. I just hated in how it ended the death of Tony Stark (aka Iron Man). Now for me, I wasn't much of a Robert Downey Jr. Up until his role as Iron Man, loved the way he brought some intelligence to the role of Tony Stark as well as humor to. I just hated that they had to kill him off.

"geislekm","The Oscars need a new category for CGI actors","15 March 2020","For some reason, the Oscar voters will never vote for a CGI actor because ""it's computer generated'"". That's BS. The character is brought to life by a real actor, and if the acting is flat, so is the character, regardless of how good the CGI is. Josh Brolin deserved at least a nomination, if not the statue itself. This movie was about Thanos, and Brolin brought the character to life, showing that he was a man, but had a vision that would not be denied. The CGI was just adequate to keep up; it was the actor that made the character real. I was almost rooting for Thanos by the end. Almost. Chris Hemsworth and ZoeSaldena also both pulled out magnificent performances, but this was Thanos's movie. Oscars, make a new category for CGI actors!","5"
"Brandon_Walker_Robinson","Competent directing style creates a strong balancing act that pays off well","10 June 2018","I know I'm extremely late to the party, but I waited for a time to sync up and see it with a friend (we both have too many obligations in the education realm), plus I had to see Doctor Strange and Thor: Ragnarok beforehand.

Now before I leave any impressions, know that my experience was dampened by students with a moronic goal of sabotage by deciding to blurt out anything about the film they knew that I wouldn't want to know. I mean... what can I do to them in retaliation? Fail them? Strike them down with the hammer of Thor? Nothing, they're untouchable and they know it. It's sad, and I thought I've taught them to be better than that. Unfortunately, that select few is out there and always will be. I've waited nearly thirty years of my life for a film of this impactful magnitude to come out in its respectful genre, and individuals half of my age decide to play the card of indecency upon me and essentially impede on the level of my viewing experience.

All that being said... it was a very good film, even better than I liked it (the problem was the spoilers). In fact, if I were to list negatives for this film, it would really just be all in one lump-sum bullet point regarding the lack of grounded material: a lot of space related stuff, nanotechnology (and I really don't like the Iron Spider compared to regular ol' Spider-Man), whims of inexplicable magic sources, levels of seemingly unbeatable friends and foes where I don't understand the devastation of a punch or explosion onto the individual taking the blow, and the recurring MCU element of death not necessarily being a finality for characters' ends.

Conversely, there were many things that I really appreciated about the film. The first thing I would like to mention was the balance of everything, starting with the balance of characters and their moments. I thought this was going to be a massive issue going into this film, where it would just be one endless action battle and people wouldn't be able to serve their parts correctly, or they would only serve aspects as a moment of convenience to further the plot. Instead, where everyone was at during any moment seemed very natural to the overall MCU progression of items, and interactions that were had (on top of some that have yet to occur, lying in wait for the fourth Avengers film) were nicely played out. Villain encounters even appeared late in the film, which is kind of nice so that the legend looms larger as the movie goes on instead of playing beats such as: ""We need three fights between hero and villain, so let's spread them out."" Even characters who are physically inferior weren't just suitably matched up with other characters of that nature, and instead they found a way to possibly hold their own or team up to make things equal enough so that the fights could be anywhere with anyone. None of this works just in script alone; this was done by the hands of great directing. The Russo Bros have found a way to serve this great kind of balance for two straight films, though in Civil War it really felt a little more like: ""Let's force the issue and get everyone on screen at once, even in a bit of a friendlier brawl."" Admittedly some characters miss the boat of even appearing in the film, but it was few and far between, and they are explained away where frankly it worked just fine.

Another great form of balance was in the light versus dark emotional moments. I have been on Marvel for having too many lighthearted moments in their films, or really too much levity for the sake of entertaining the crowd on their first viewing of a film. They really pushed the envelope with Thor: Ragnarok, and honestly I was not appreciative of it. They needed to find a way to strike the right balance of when to say what and what surface level of comedy they need to inject during the characters given the moments, but most importantly every light moment needs to be balanced with a dark moment for emotions to hit the right heartstrings. Infinity War does exactly that. I wasn't eye-rolling when they injected humor, and only one or two comedic bits were out of place for the moment they were in. That is a fair price to pay for the overall structure. They had enough characters to find those moments with in the 160-minute running time, and for once they didn't have the villain(s) either be demoted to that same level of yuck-yucks nor did they subject them to another character's comedic relief as a way to actually victimize them.

This is a great time to transition to this film's villain: Thanos. I have had my quips with MCU villains being rather underserved in scope compared to that of the larger picture at play, like where they may be more of a pawn so the rest of the chessboard could do its thing. Thanos, however, appears as the king of this universe's chessboard. He was the main character in this film, and probably had the most screen time. He was not just a villain seeking ultimate domination of everything for the sake of it, he has his own goals and purposes in an attempt to restore a harmonious balance (there is that world again) for all species. It was not only believable, but it was also sympathetic. He shows remorse for his (attempted) actions, he shows mercy to those who beg for it so long as they aid in furthering his cause, and he speaks with a level head in a way that if we haven't already had eighteen other MCU films liking our heroes so much that we would actually root for the bad guy here. Definitely the best served comic book villain in a decade, if not right alongside the Joker for 'overall' status. Granted, Heath Ledger has given us the performance of a lifetime, though that character is very one-dimensional (and really good at that dimension, no doubt). Thanos really surprised me that he was more than just a large purple alien wanting ""MOAR.""

I want to give the directors credit for making an extremely long running time feel extremely short. I don't know if I'm sitting here saying that I'd like to watch a whole 'nother hour of the film, but they hit the right beats and paced it so evenly that they really made time fly by in a manner that other films really can't speak for in the same vein. For all the movies I own on Blu-ray, I sometimes stop short of watching something that runs this long because I tell myself: ""This is a long film man, you are going to be devoting a lot of time to this."" I don't think I'll be saying that about Infinity War. If I were to show this to a friend who hadn't seen it yet, I wouldn't be warning them about the duration of it nor would I fear they would be looking at their watch every fifteen minutes wondering when it would end. The more you get into the film, the more you lean forward on the edge of your seat. Yes, sometimes they do cut away from characters to get to others because they have to, but you never forget your place where others are at and you aren't dismayed at the next grouping's story line. It all worked so very, very well.

I'll cap this off with one thing that wasn't as strong as I hoped it would be, and it was in the movie's action. There was nothing wrong with it, but outside of some last-act battles I wasn't ever really wowed by anything either. All visual effects were top-notch, though (ehem, Ragarok was not good here too). I do think I'm putting this on a relative scale though, because it's interesting that I say that looking back at the whole picture that I think the moments outside of the action were actually better than the action points themselves, not in terms of entertainment but just in overall value. That's a good thing too, so now you're not just sitting around waiting to be getting your money's worth again. This jumps back to how the film's length is not a concern. No action scene overstays its welcome either, or it has enough dynamic elements and cross-cutting that it fits properly (again, jumping back to Civil War, that airport scene was just way too contrived... this doesn't have that). Age of Ultron was much more of a popcorn flick for me that I really do enjoy, and The Avengers has all of its lasting appeal in the final third of the film when they all assemble together, so I think I can say this one is the most consistently put together.

Overall, I would say that my experience was definitely a great one and it is likely hitting inside my Top 3 of all the MCU films (The Winter Soldier still wins). I'm not ready to officially rank it just yet and I still have a lot of questions about what I saw in this one, but again that's a good thing about this film's natural depth where I'll have to watch it more than once to understand and appreciate those items. I really think the thing that brings this movie down a notch was my experience because of spoilers beforehand, and I didn't want to believe many of them to be true but unfortunately many were. This is a movie that I even avoided watching trailers for. Any knowledge about an event I am already interested in does not help ramp up the hype by me learning more about it. Shame on them for doing that to my theatrical viewing, but thankfully this film did not only rely on its spoiler-bound moments to be as good as it was. It was very ambitious, and I can't wait to see what they come up with next because I really have no idea where they want to go from here.","8"

Then you have that assasin girl (stupid, not even a super hero, just some average joe with moves stronger then aliens? Cmon hollywood!) Speaking of spiderboy (he doesnt deserve to be called man) He should have enough strength and then some to pull that glove off that Thanos hand easily. As i was saying too many plots to pull off. Too many unknowns left on table because of Dr. Strange. No antman was strange too...No real explanation of some things too, like the reality stone. The movie worked, but sloppily in terms of things. Without Thor this movie would have been not very good. There is a reason why Asgard was set on top of the Tree, as they are the most powerful. I really think they are headed for clash with like Galactus and other bigger enemies and when Fox is bought out by Disney it will lead to the Xmen joining too, gets bigger and worse. Good luck.","9"

While admittedly, this darker chapter in the Marvel movie-verse is oddly paced and suffers from the occasional tonal inconsistency, all issues can easily be forgiven as almost each scene is a sizeable dosage of fan service. Josh Brolin as Thanos deserves all the attention he gets, as he is a villain with a tragic story to tell.

"Pjtaylor-96-138044","Bold, brazen and ballsy stuff that isn't afraid to go dark; incredibly thrilling, nail-bitingly tense and satisfyingly unconventional.","29 April 2018","'Avengers: Infinity War (2018)' is bold, brazen, ballsy stuff that's dark, daring and manages to deftly dodge all of the deep chasms that come with having the sheer amount of characters it has, all with rich histories and personalities as different from one another as their respective films are from this. It's remarkable how well it keeps each of these in focus while also keeping them true to who we know them to be, amalgamating their presences perfectly with this new tone so that nothing is lost yet nothing stands out. Admittedly, many of even the key players don't have much to do but all of them are well drawn and exist within the world in a tangible space, fulfilling their roles in the best way they possibly can. It feels as though this is the best version of a film with over twenty core characters that could have been accomplished. Besides, it's actually Thanos that's the 'star' and that is an unconventional and unexpected move. It's also one that pays off as he is easily the best, most intimidating and most understandable villian in Marvel's history. You empathise with him, on the most human of levels at times, and can even understand his point of view, just not his methods, whilst fearing his might as it lives up to all the hype it's been given. There's a real sense of forward-momentum and a proper pacy tension propelling the picture, leading to a series of confrontations that may be almost entirely digital but feel fully palpable thanks to excellent CGI and phenomenal writing. The script sets the stakes pretty much perfectly, weaving the interpersonal character motivations with the overall universal threat, and it paints a picture of a layered, all encompassing situation in which all our players play a part. It all comes to an unexpected and deliciously downbeat close, too. This is only dampened slightly, in execution and perception, because of the flick's 'Part I' nature - as well as the announcement of a few post-'Part II' MCU titles - which is actually the source of most of the film's minor issues. Without the context of the next film, there are some elements that don't quite seem 'real', but this could just be that they haven't sunk in yet because we don't know if they will be backtracked by the sequel or if they will be solidified by it. Still, as it is, this entry in the series is perhaps the most unconventional and unexpected flick the MCU has ever produced, one that stands on its own as a ballsy blockbuster unafraid to divide its audience. The tone is almost perfect, incredibly dark but with a dash of levity where it's called for (this is how you do 'serious', DC), and the pacing is great, too, even if it feels a tad long at times due to the unusual structure. It's just a breathlessly entertaining, incredibly thrilling, nail-bitingly tense, hopelessly jaw-dropping, edge-of-your-seat roller-coaster that does all of its characters, and its legacy, justice. Not to mention Alan Silvestri's phenomenal score. 9/10","5"
"danjstanley","Just an awful waste of 2.5 hours","6 May 2018","I don't typically write reviews; however, someone needed to balance out the over the top love for this bad plotted film with way too many stars. For me, it all comes down to this question: ""Can this movie stand alone without having seen at least 75% of the other Marvel movies?"" The answer is NO! I know I've seen most of Marvel's movies (loved Black Panther) but I think to enjoy this film you have to be a serious Marvel fan. Even with as many of the Marvel movies that I've seen, I still didn't have enough back story or character recognition to pull together this plot which seemed to me to just be an excuse to have CGI battles over and over. Then, to make matters worse, it's sooo looong. Add to that, that I need to see a sequel to see how this story ends and I hate it - 1 star out of 10 - done and done.","5"

"arthuradam","Terrible","5 May 2018","If I am to get to the point, the movie was noisy audibly and visually. It felt like a Michael Bay movie where he creates a false sense of excitement by wildly swinging the camera around with nauseating shots that last a few split seconds, leaving the viewer confused as to what is happening on screen. There's a balancing point in a movie with CGI and this movie has too much of it. Nothing feels real or organic. Much of the movie is like watching a children's morning cartoon. Too much was crammed into the movie. Every minute you're in a new area in space or on a ship. I savoured the non action scenes where people were talking to each other. Wakanda? I never read the Black Panther comics and I am not sure if the movie represents the comics, but wow, what an embarrassing part of the movie for black people. These Africans are so advanced that they fly spaceships and tell Bruce Banner, a genius, his folly in relation to brain surgery while working on Vision. Is this supposed to come across as condescending to blacks because it was super cringe-worthy. I mean, it's kinda like dressing up a 5-year old as a professor and telling him he is the smartest person on the planet. And for these people to be so advanced, why are they using spears? I realise why Black Panther was always a 3rd tier comic now. Anyhow, there are some good parts in the movie, but it's rushed and just awful. I preferred Justice League as a movie; the pacing was a lot better.","1"
"Floated2","A lot happening","12 March 2019","Avengers: Infinity War has become a massive box office success and occasional worldwide phenomenon. Following the success of Age of ultron, it was clear this film was intended to be a massive success and bigger than the previous.

Infinity War is quite good yet somewhat disappointing in the slightest. Difficult on rating since one did enjoy the film but at the same time, it felt somewhat predictable and unengaging.

The film boasts many characters from each of their respective films and jam packs them into one. It is interesting to see everyone else involved in the interactions in which we haven't seen, such as the cast of the Guardians films messing with Thor, Iron Man, and Spider-Man. Overall Infinity War does offer much different occurrences, a lot if characters and a lot going on.

Though one can't help feel that it wasn't as great as advertised. Perhaps a second viewing is needed down the line.","6"
"Film_star","Perfectly fine entertainment","27 April 2018","I have rated this 5 stars, predominantly because I think 9s and 10s should be provinces reserved for truly great movies. This is an entertaining one, which kept me interested for most of its overlong running time, but which won't leave me with much lingering sense of a tangible movie - it felt like a solid episode in a series I'm binge-watching, but I'll struggle to treasure many specifics of this movie from a line-up of Marvel titles.

There are a ridiculous number of characters in this; the film is using that as its ""event"" selling point, but in truth it was the factor which made me most apprehensive before watching it. To the filmmakers' credit, the juggling of storylines and superheroes (and their endless sidekicks and sub-teams) was almost impressive - it never felt as though many were shoehorned too awkwardly into the forward trajectory of the overall narrative, though some characters - including leading players like Spider-Man and Black Widow - inevitably get shortchanged.

The series' most rewatchable movies - for me Avengers, Winter Soldier, Civil War, Ragnarok and Black Panther - all have something compelling that feels unique to them. I'm not sure this has a unique selling point beyond a huge cast jostling for billing position on the poster, but whilst it plods along it's perfectly decent, and fans of the franchise will likely lap it up.

At the time of writing, the film is ranked number 10 on the IMDb list of the Top 250 movies OF ALL TIME. I'm certain it will plummet once the general public start to supersede the fanboy rush, but this kind of kneejerk over-ranking in the context of cinematic history is a nonsense.","10"

"austin0731","The cumulation of a universe, 10 years in the making","25 April 2018","Avengers Infinity war was great for me as a fan of both the comics and the MCU ever since its inception. However, i can absolutely see the flip side of this, being a celebration for the past 10 years of the MCU it manages to embody the theme, tone, emotional stakes and attachment established in the past 10 years. Thus, for an audience who has barely seen any of the MCU films they might find it difficult, confusing and even just a storyline mess with no emotional stakes or attachment to the characters that I as a fan embody.

Infinity war embodies all that comes before it and because of that it was able to deliver action, spectacle and a complete combustion of stories that it wouldn't be able to without this rich background and journey that has culminated to this moment.

Despite all this, infinity war does still manage to weave in character arcs and development, characters like iron man, Scarlet witch, Star lord. All got meaningful character building arcs. While many other characters were unfortunately rather lost in the mix. But, these are just minor complaints considering how good of a job the Russos have already done in balancing stories, characters and handling brilliant action scenes. Considering the astronomical task of crafting the film there has to be characters that are more in the background and playing second fiddle, and I think that is perfectly acceptable.

But arguably the films greatest victory is in Thanos, this is very much his story. Not only did we get a pure world conquering, villainous villain but we got to see so many sides to him. We saw brief moments of tenderness, but still see the menacing all conquering 'mad titan' that he is.more importantly, he had a motive that isn't of selfish origins. Thanos actually has a point and that creates an ability for audiences to understand where Thanos is coming from. This is something that marvel has had a huge issue with in the past but with Thanos and even the recent Killmonger perhaps marvel has finally found a way to fix its notorious 'villain problem'.","9"

"namashi_1","Fun. But its the same old story!","29 April 2018","The sequel to 2012's The Avengers and 2015's Avengers: Age of Ultron, and the nineteenth film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU), 'Avengers: Infinity War', which assembles almost ALL of its Superheroes in one single film, is the biggest Marvel Blockbuster to date. Although an event for us cinema-lovers & the biggest film of 2018, 'Infinity War', despite being truly fun, is the same old story. There is not much difference between Avengers 1, 2 or Infinity War. Its the done to death Good versus Bad story.

'Avengers: Infinity War' Synopsis: The Avengers and their allies must be willing to sacrifice all in an attempt to defeat the powerful Thanos before his blitz of devastation and ruin puts an end to the universe.

'Avengers: Infinity War', which has taken the biggest box-office weekend globally in history, becoming a milestone at the ticket windows, is truly an event. I, myself watched the film yesterday in an almost packed house, here in Hollywood, Los Angeles. The audience, including me, found ourselves at times clapping & whistling for the superheroes, who at every point, try their best to defeat the menacing Thanos. It was an experience, of course!

But, here's the thing. There is a difference between being excited & enjoying, and there is a difference on what the story is all about. While the stakes are higher here for its multiple heroes against one villain, the baddie here too, like Ultron or Loki, is out for destruction of the world. Or maybe half of it. And that's where 'Infinity War' fails to rise above its mediocrity. I am not expecting a Masterpiece here, but at the end, I feel as I'm watching the same film again & again. And while I WILL NOT give away ANY SPOILERS, all I can say that 'Infinity War' isn't even brave enough to take giant strides in its storytelling. Its the same film, with more action, more heroes & more havoc.

That being said, this isn't a bad film from any angle. 'Infinity War' is a fun watch. The action-sequences are fantastic, the graphics are simply terrific & the humor & banter between its heroes, raises many richly earned laughs. I wasn't bored here, despite its predictable narrative structure. Its an entertainer, for sure!

Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely's Screenplay is a good mix of fun & maddening action, but plays it safe overall, despite raising the stakes. Anthony and Joe Russo's Direction is extravagant. Cinematography is superb, while the Editing could've been a bit tighter. The film is a bit too long at a 149-minutes! Art & Costume Design are perfect. Alan Silvestri's Score is excellent, as always. And the Production Values, are top-notch!

Performance-Wise: Josh Brolin as Thanos & Zoe Saldana as Gamora, shine the brightest. Brolin gives the villain a character beyond the bad, while Saldana adds heart & depth to her part. Of the heroes, Chris Pratt as Peter Quill / Star-Lord, is very entertaining & his comic-timing is spot-on, Chris Hemsworth as Thor, continues to raise laughs & portrays his part heroically, Robert Downey Jr. as Tony Stark / Iron Man, is good as usual, Benedict Cumberbatch as Dr Strange, is painfully one-note, Chris Evans as Steve Rogers / Captain America, is efficient & Tom Holland as Peter Parker / Spider-Man, is extremely likable. Special Mentions for Dave Bautista as Drax the Destroyer & Peter Dinklage as Eitri, who stand out in their parts.

On the whole, 'Avengers: Infinity War' offers a bang for your buck. But its the same old story, once again.","1"
"coreyjdenford","To Infinity","26 April 2018","This review of Avengers: Infinity War is spoiler free

***** (5/5)

IT'S ALREADY CLEAR that the Marvel Cinematic Universe has installed a lot of pressure on themselves, with social media it's hard enough to create an ongoing trend, but as soon as the trailer for Marvel's 19th and biggest film Avengers: Infinity War launched it became the largest trailer ever on the web with more than 200 million views in just 24 hours. That was a monster record in itself as no other trailer has ever done that, addition to that the pre-sale tickets were selling like hot cakes. The pressure was perhaps too much at this point and there was quite a bit of speculation whether the film would live up to the almost infinite (sorry) hype, well, the time is here as brother directors Anthony and Joe Russo have created an unmissable Marvel film that delivers a dark storyline featuring shock to shock.

Firstly, Infinity War isn't just the culmination of the last few years of Marvel installments, it is the culmination of the last 18 Marvel in ten years, starting from the first Iron Man to now and take our word for it, it's worth every second of the ride. This one opens without the traditional Marvel fanfare overshadowing the logo, instead it's almost deafening, we open not long after the impact of Thor: Ragnarok with the destruction of Asgard and suddenly Thanos (Josh Brolin) a giant purple gilactic warlord puts the survivors to the ultimate test to try and possess all the six Infinity Stones which will put him in control of the entire universe. But it's from minute one that Thanos is not a villain that can be beaten with just the swing of a hammer (Thor should know that), the Avengers are put to the ultimate test.

Hulk (Mark Ruffalo) is challenged strength to strength. Thor (Chris Hemsworth) is tested through his limits. Captain America (Chris Evans) will find that this is no easy war to win. The story written by Captain America: Civil War writers Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely is dark, darker than all the previous Marvel films before, here nobody is left without a fight, and in terms of scope this has the biggest ever battle scene (but we'll get to that). And at the helm is Marvel's darkest, deadliest and strongest villain Thanos and it's Josh Brolin who's up for the role once again as he said at the end of Age of Ultron ""I'll do it myself"" and he delivers in spades delivering shock to shock, many dark turns and lots and lots of bodies at his feet. And it's clear that the Russo's have brought the impossible to life, and it won't leave without deeply cutting into your very skin.

How dark is the story? Well that really depends on how much light is at the end of the 149 minute long tunnel, but in terms of how many lives are at stake probably not much. But just like every other Marvel villain Thanos comes with a past, and Thanos' past isn't anything to be triffled with, a past that's filled with war, turmoil and death but anybody who knows his history should know how dark he really is, and despite the many family friendly filters there are through the never-ending saga, he is the darkest one ever. Yet, thanks to Brolin's fantastic performance he's also the most compelling, yes you heard that right he's even more compelling than Loki. But unlike the Asgardian God of Mischief the giant purple warlord isn't simply misunderstood, neigh, he's just a menace. However prepared you may be to watch Thanos putting the universe through ultimate destruction, you aren't ready for the damage he might leave behind, and put it this way, there's a lot of deep scars here, so prepare for the damage.

Yet, the film isn't always dark, there is some lightness here. It's also very, very funny. Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.) is momentarily left speechless. The Guardians are up to to their usual high stakes camaradarie, Star Lord (Chris Pratt) isn't afraid to show his light self, Drax (Dave Bautista) once again shares his comedic duo act with Rocket (Bradley Cooper). It's almost as if McFeely and Markus watched both Guardians of the Galaxy films and jotted down all the jokes. But honestly who would blame them?

Happier still with a long running time, a compelling villain, an all star cast, some very funny jokes and several storylines to follow Avengers: Infinity War stays massively intact thanks to the Russo's exquisite directing style who handle the project beautifully, from handling the massive cast without feeling any fatigue (sorry Joss Whedon), through the expensive yet stunning CGI battles, to the mammoth sized final battle scenes. If you thought the battle of Sakovia in Avengers: Age of Ultron or the battle at Berlin's Leipzig airport in Captain America: Civil War was big then this is a mammoth battle. Indeed Infinity War is worth the decade long wait and who knows maybe the currently untitled Avengers 4 may be bigger than this. However big it is, we certainly can't wait.

VERDICT: Quick on it's wits and quick on it's whims, the 19th MCU film delivers all of them on an intergalactic scale, you may not be prepared for Thanos, but then neither are our heroes.","10"

"frank_kneepkens","It's all for the money","3 August 2018","Very angry after watching this movie. It's a trend, started by Netflix, now Marvel also sees a good money making formula to force people and Marvel fans to keep watching and buying the stuff. The formula is this: make a (potential) good storyline, use good actors and great cgi but then make an open end, ready for a sequel. I'm sorry but then there is no real satisfaction after watching the movie. Normally (especially) Marvel movies end well, the good guys win, the bad guys loose. In the old days you get a good feeling and have 2 hours of good entertainment. You can replay the movie back in your head and repeat that good feeling. No not any more, all for the money, more more, make (force) the people longing for the next episode. I'm ok with that with series, but NOT for movies. Movies need to have a satisfactory good end. That is why you watch 2.5 hours of movie. It's that I could watch this for free with friends, but in a cinema I would demand my money back. What would people say if you buy a book and there is no end, you need to buy another book for the end, it's the same thing. So that is why I rate this movie a 1, even though all my favorite Marvel characters are in, lot's of humor, super CGI and everything looks great for a 10 rating, until the last few minutes. It really ruin everything before it back to the lowest rating. Oh and please, it has nothing to do with that ""I don't understand"" the movie. I understand the financial reasons for doing this very well!","4"
"AdrenalinDragon","Marvel has set the bar super high with this movie!","26 April 2018","I've enjoyed a large chunk of the Marvel Cinematic Universe movies. Not all of them worked for me, but I gotta say Avengers: Infinity War has set the bar really high for Superhero movies. Without spoiling anything (and believe me, this is a movie that works best without spoilers!), all I can say is there is a lot of darker and edgier stuff that will surprise you, as well as the Comedy you expect from a Marvel movie. However, perhaps most surprising was the main villain Thanos (Josh Brolin) having alot of character development in it. He's a bit more complex than your standard Superhero villain, but also very menacing and quite sympathetic too.

I worried about the movie having such a long running time and having to focus on a lot of the characters, but to Marvel's credit, they pulled it off extremely well and the 2 and a half hours running time went pretty quick. The action is what you'd expect from an Avengers movie, it was never boring to me and I found it pretty funny myself. No issues with the CGI and everyone acted decently in it.

The amount of discussions I had with friends and families after coming out of seeing it was insane, as well as the other audiences. Depending on how invested you were into the Marvel characters in previous movies will affect how you feel about it, but I think as a movie that ties and groups a lot of the characters together in one big Blockbuster, Infinity War has exceeded what I can hope for. It had action, emotion, comedy, and is pretty close to a perfect package you could expect from one of these movies. I can't wait to re-watch it and hopefully part 2 will live up to expectations.

"jhalcollege","For better or worse: the same as every other MCU","3 June 2018","In linear algebra, a matrix is said to be rank deficient if one of its rows or columns can be expressed as a linear combination of the other rows or columns. In layman's terms, this particular part adds nothing new to the overall picture, it just uses information that is already present.

This happens to be the defining characteristic of Infinity War, there's nothing new here. What there is is a lot of action, a lot of CGI, and lots of bad jokes with a few okay ones tossed in the mix (exactly what Marvel has been doing for ten years).

The film makes a half decent effort to distinguish arch-villian Thanos from the rest of the baddies, and its kind of succeeds on a minimal level. But in the end, he's just another world conquering fiend who's bigger and stronger than everyone else (Steppenwolf from Justice League?) who is set off to collect some arbitrary artifacts.

Another issue is comes as a side effect of putting so many established characters in. Take Captain American for example, a character whose driven by morals, and whose films are relatively serious, and the Guardians of the Galaxy (about as serious as Looney Tunes). They've done fine on their own, but put them in the same scene and it just doesn't work.

At this point, if you're not sick and tired of Avenger's Universe, then good for you. But for the rest of us, one thing's for sure, haters are definitely going to hate this one.

(If you're not familiar with the IMDb rating formula, you should check it out. While Infinity War rests at an 8.8 at the time of this writing, it will drop reasonably over time as more casual viewers watch the film, and rate it the four or five it deserves.)","10"

Thanos is so hyped that he shouldn't be beaten even in part 5. How is it that Dr Strange never used the time stone? Then Iron Man and Spiderman (humans) are able to breathe freely on Titan?

Also annoying, Vision is carried about like a baby, limp and powerless. You just wonder whether it's the same vision that was so powerful in Civil War and could walk through walls.

Quite frankly, I wasn't expecting the Avengers to win Thanos in this part since it's a 2-part movie but let's put it this way; the avengers were humiliated! Probably should have been called - Avengers: Thanos the powerful.

"classicsoncall","""Tell him about the dance-off to save the universe.""","5 September 2018","Compared to the first two Avengers movies, I've rated this one a solid '9' against a pair of '7's' for the other two. The prequels felt more like getting the most out of all the destruction that the super-heroes could inflict on their cosmic adversaries. That formula's still at work here but it seemed a lot fresher with the team-up between The Guardians and The Avengers, while Thanos (Josh Brolin) brought a decidedly different dimension to his role as an intergalactic enforcer. Some might even call his mission honorable, in as much as he wants to save the universe with his philosophy that ""If life is left unchecked, life will cease to exist"".

Fresh on the heels of ""Thor:Ragnarok"", the Marvel and Disney folks do well here to keep the humor in place while dramatic events unfold throughout the Marvel Cinematic Universe. The Thor (Chris Hemsworth)/Star-Lord (Chris Pratt) dynamic was especially played well, and it was a hoot to see Thor accept Rabbit's, er..., Rocket's (voiced by Bradley Cooper) claim as captain of the Guardians.

Where the film loses a point for me has to do with the inconsistency with some of the principal characters. Depending on which prior movie you care to cite, Thor and Doctor Strange have been positioned as the most powerful entities in the Marvel universe. However here, they were dispatched rather handily in the early going by Thanos's minions. There's also the quite literal overkill that occurs near the end of the story with the disintegration of heroes like Black Panther, Doc Strange and Spidey, along with the entire Guardian team. You know they have to make a come back in the follow up sequel(s), so it seemed like an almost cheap attempt to elicit pathos from the audience. By my count, at least fourteen Marvel characters met their demise in the story if you include Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson) and his partner in the after credits scene.

Once again, and I can't help it, but kudos to Stan Lee, Marvel comic writer and originator of many of these characters, for his bus driver cameo near the beginning of the picture. His one line was particularly apropos: ""What's the matter with you kids? You never seen a spaceship before?""

And oh yes, don't want to forget this little tidbit. There have been any number of movies with scenes set in New York City in which the Twin Towers of the World Trade Center are in prominent view prior to the events of 9/11, but in this flick, there's a quick glimpse offered of the new One World Trade Center rising from the city skyline. I thought that was very cool, and even better that it wasn't in the path of the New York City dust up.","2"

But then later Quill, Guardian of the Galaxy, was responsible for the death of half the life in the universe because he gets in a tamper tantrum with Thanos over the death of Gamora. Come on. Why wasn't he cracking up jokes instead? The Avengers team didn't turn on him? Really?

Then the powers of the superheroes are inconsistent. Vision, the all powerful creation with the stone in him gets tossed around like a toy by Thanos' minions. One moment they can take on Thanos and in other scenes they're wimps. Bruce Banner wears the Iron Man suit, which he battled and lost against as the Hulk. But the suit gets shredded like paper by Thanos' army.

There's also the suits Tony Stark upgraded from himself and Spider-Man. One moment the suits are there and the next they're literally turned off. It's as if Tony Stark can create matter from nothing. At least make it believable like the early Iron Man series.

Overall this movie takes things way too far. It was way too cartoonist.","10"

"gradyharp","Louder, Longer, Less plot - Groot has the best tool: an iPod..........","18 August 2018","Louder, Longer, Less plot - Groot has the best tool: an iPod.......... There is an audience (and a massive one willing to pay big bucks and stand in long lines ) who champion all of the Marvel Comics films. AVANGERS INFINITY WAR is no exception. At over two and a half hours even the huge cast of gifted actors - at their bet when being funny - explode, blow up things, zoom into outer space for a mission to find Thanos who goal is to rule the universe by obtaining all the funky jewels for his glove - all seem to wear thin from the plodding 'plot' and turn to dust.

The true 'stars' of this huge effort are f course the CGI team - the special effects are truly spectacular, at least for the first hour. The characters don't get much time to develop but the actors assigned to the strange roles make the Avengers and their enemies entertaining. The 'plot'? 'As the Avengers and their allies have continued to protect the world from threats too large for any one hero to handle, a new danger has emerged from the cosmic shadows: Thanos. A despot of intergalactic infamy, his goal is to collect all six Infinity Stones, artifacts of unimaginable power, and use them to inflict his twisted will on all of reality. Everything the Avengers have fought for has led up to this moment - the fate of Earth and existence itself has never been more uncertain.'

Cast includes Robert Downey Jr., Chris Helmsworth, Mark Ruffalo, Chris Evans, Scarlett Johansson, Don Cheadle, Benedict Cumberbatch, Tom Holland Chadwick Boseman, Zoe Saldana, Tom Hiddleston, Paul Bettany, Anthony Mackie, Idris Elba, Peter Dinklage, Vin Diesel, Benecio Del Toro, Chris Pratt, William Hurt, Josh Brolin, Gweneth Paltrow, Bradley Cooper etc etc etc. Definitely a film for those who follow Marvel Comics - or those who need an escape form the chaotic world we inhabit. 'That's entertainment?'.","9"

It started weird, and as someone pointed out already the Order didnt get an introduction, and theres no need since theyre all dead. Escaping Asgard when Hella destroyed it was pointless since they're all dead as far as we know, unless Loki used some magic to hide them.. but going back to the beginning of the movie.... we dont know. It was a pile of shi and we need to stop rewarding crap with praise. Im sure part 2 will be better but very overhyped by fanbois, the weakest link in the chain","8"

"willz187","Its no Super Hero Squad Infinity Gauntlet","28 February 2019","I'm probably the only fan of Super Hero Squad: Infinity Gauntlet but if you found this Avengers: Infinity War too heavy you should give it a try. Infinity War is filled with more super whiners than super heroes; unless you like your superheroes to whimper, demand to be sacrificed, argue, and to die. Not my idea of good times. Not lining up to see the sequel/conclusion. I'd rather read the comics, or watch it on cartoons. Also, it's stupid that the Fantastic Four and Silver Surfer aren't in this universe.

Try to say something positive: ok, the villains were different and refreshing. And it was cool to see so many Avengers represented. Had some cool scenes. Gave it a generous 6/10 but will never watch again.

Hero up! and watch Super Hero Squad or for something less childish, Avengers Assemble Season 2, which also tells the story of Thanos.","10"
"ericstevenson","The wait is finally over!","30 April 2018","I'm just going to say right now that I don't believe this movie to be as good as the 2012 Avengers movie. It's still one of the best superhero movies ever made. Thanos had made brief appearances in literally three other Marvel movies and we finally got a film focusing on him. Even at the ending credits, it says that Thanos will return and not the Avengers! The plot's pretty standard with the Avengers teaming up with the Guardians Of the Galaxy to stop Thanos from collecting all the Infinity Gems making him the most powerful being in the Universe. The biggest part of this movie is the ending in which...they actually fail.

Yep, Thanos gets everything he wants and immediately gains his goal of wanting to kill half the people in the entire Universe! There possibly hasn't been a movie with more deaths of named characters. This was in fact something that happened in the comics, but it seemed so crazy I had no idea it would actually happen here! It's a shame that we don't get to see all the Avengers and Guardians of the Galaxy in the same place at the same time. I believe this is the longest Marvel movie ever made. It certainly didn't seem like it as the pacing was so great!

They said this movie would be darker, but it seemed to have a lot of jokes at first. Then came the ending and even the ending credits seemed gloomy. We finally get to see Loki kick the bucket. It's great that we have the characters reference all of their losses. It's just one awesome action scene after another. Unlike ""Transformers"" these ones are beautiful looking and creative. ****","10"
"bgsmall","Extraordinary fantasy with bizzare and dark storyline (Spoilers)","19 May 2018","Caveats on this review are; I'm no especial fan of comic book storylines made into films, my primary reason for attending was to take my children for their entertainment (not mine).

As you might expect from a comic book rendering; the central plot of revolves around Thanos (the 'baddie') intent on decimating humanity by ~50% of it's current number to 'restore balance' to an over-crowded universe that has dwinding supplies and no means to support the ever growing populus. Taking that and the film at face value - this is a bizzare and macarbe storyline that hurtles between fight scenes without any character development or sub-plot development whatsoever (O.K, that's a little unfair - but not much). That's maybe my own fault - as I've not seen the other (precedent) movies in this series. However, as entertainment value goes, it's a little poor and in retrospect I would not have taken my children to see it.

Now, taking the central plot as something 'other' than just fantasy I have a couple of questions / statements: 1. Is the storyline in anyway faithful to what was written in the comic book storylines? 2. Who signed off on the budget of this movie? - I'm guessing it cost $$$$$$$ (that's seven, each representing a 10-fold increase in magnitude) at least. 3. Whoever (individual or committee) did sign off on this budget, then also implicitly (or maybe explicitly) approved the premise of the central plot. 4. Given that Hollywood has been used historically to influence audiences and therefore by extrapolation (largely developed world) populations via it's 'messages' (propaganda) is this warning or threat? 5. I don't believe that a movie of such an incredible budget is signed off without having an ulterior motive (usually paving the way for later films and more money) - and unless I've missed something - they just trashed the franchise??

Just because I'm paranoid, doesn't mean they're not out to get me.","2"

"ivan-samuelson","Really pretty to look at and...well that's about it.","4 December 2018","Don't get me wrong. I love the Marvel Universe. I even went back to watch the original Iron Man and forgot that in those days, Disney didn't have their mitts on it yet. It was a Paramount movie. My how times have changed.

For me, the movie was all over the place, jumping from earth, to a distant planet, etc. Yes, the war extends across the galaxy, that much is understood, but too many cross stories, and the entire former Avengers team isn't even together. It does set up the 2nd half that comes out in 2019 which looks lie there will be a head-on face-to-face again with two of the Avengers that split apart, especially since, well, you know why.

All in all, the CGI graphics were excellent. Very top notch. But, a movie can only look so great before it falls under it's own weight, and I'm sorry, but AIW does just that. Editing is sub-par, there are some good one-liners, but I had just watched Ant Man and the Wasp just before this at home and that was a great movie for me. Funny, hilarious and action packed. This, so-so. Disney is trying way too hard here. Need to get back to reality and ground this series back to how it started.

I dare say that AIW is the Marvel Universe's ""The Last Jedi"". Pretty to look at, but empty everywhere else.","8"

No super hero movie has ever come close to what people at Marvel are doing at the moment. And Avengers Infinity War said that furthermore this movie soared through my expectations. The visual was spectacular the action was explosive and satisfying. The Russo's have crafted Something truly remarkable and freshness that you'd never expect. The ending of this film truly opens up an intriguing narrative possibilities that strech in any direction. On the strength of this outing, that's Something to be anticipated, rather than feared.

"margerami","What a waste of time","29 April 2018","(mild spoilers ahead)

The movie is designed to appeal the viewers by the familiarity the audience has with the cast from all the previous installments. There are some humorous dialogues that are funny, which makes the movie deserve my second star.

The effects are of course top notch, and one has to commend the technical aspect. Other than that, there is no logic whatsoever in the movie. Every exaggeration from the past has now been multiplied by a thousand. The plot could be summarized in a couple lines, with room to spare.

I wish I had a time stone so that I can return to the past a few hours ago and tell me not to spend money on this disaster.","4"
"TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews","Perfectly balanced","27 April 2018","Thanos(Brolin, giving us a layered villain, the best in recent years) has...*finally*... started to gather the Infinity Gems. If he gets all six he can wipe out half of the universe with a snap of his fingers. Will our heroes be able to stop him and his ""Children""?

The hype for this was unreal. Many say that it couldn't live up to it. And I realise that a lot don't, and won't(as it premieres around the world), think it did. For my money(and they'll keep getting them as long as they keep making them this good), it delivered, and then some. Obviously, with so many major characters, they cannot possibly all get a lot of screentime. You could criticise their decision to include so many. Honestly, you're free to think so, but this is not a movie for you. Which is fine. I don't doubt that you love flicks that aren't for me. This is a cinematic version of an event comic, not decreased in scope as most of the adaptations of those stories are, something I've been waiting for for 20 years to be done right. So rather than complain about something that couldn't be helped, let's look at whether it's satisfying. Personally, I absolutely think so. I've loved most of these since I first saw these versions of them, and I felt that they were all featured to the right extent. Every single one of them makes an impact, most get arcs, not a single one feels like they're just in the background(as is the case with every single X-Men film).

This wastes no time starting the plot, moves quickly, and introduces us to all the groups quite early on, and yet never feels overpowering. I realised the following is an old example, however, recently rewatching Revenge of the Sith, the difference is incredible. Both were built up to for years(at least 6 in both cases), and where that one is massively overcrowded, and quite tiring and tedious, this one isn't, even a little. I know. I can hardly believe it myself. It delivers on emotion, interaction between individuals, growth, in addition to action scenes(which, ultimately, is the bread and butter of a Summer blockbuster). Does it, outside of the bad guy's depiction, including personality and motivation, reach a level of depth akin to the solo adventures? No. It would be unrealistic to expect it to. It's not going for that. Finally, there has been a lot of reasonable concern, for how they would handle the supposed killing off of fan favorites. I'm not giving away whether or not they do, or if it's only for bit parts. What I will say is that everyone who kicks the bucket in this, on either side of the conflict, gets to be memorable and important before they do. They were very smart and how they handled that. Like everything else in this.

I recommend this to anyone who finds it to be appealing. Do note that the ending is very much a setup for the next one, and doesn't feel conclusive. It used to be called part 1 for a reason. And yes, that will disappoint many - and they're not wrong. Personally, I'm just incredibly excited for Avengers 4. 10/10","6"
"siderite","An awesome action movie that makes little sense","18 August 2018","The CGI is great, the acting is good, the action is wonderful, Thanos is really scary, every hero (almost) is here. And yet things make little sense. There are again confusion between forces that have many orders of magnitude between them, there is little strategic or, indeed, tactical logic in this ""war"". I enjoyed the film and I am sure it's going to blow so many people away, but it was so damn pointless.

Anyway, the idea is that the movie is just the first of a two parter so my recommendation is to wait until both movies have been released and watch them back to back. I know it's hard, with all the references flying around you and friends wanting to discuss how Star Lord destroyed the universe (oops!), but I think you will enjoy the ending a lot more knowing you will be watching the rest in a few minutes and not next year.","5"

"bobholt27","Better than expected but still has flaws","6 May 2018","Overall, I liked this movie. It was fun, awesome, and a great watch. I was worried that this would be another huge dissapointment for me like Civil War was, where the trailer was better than the movie. I have to say, they handled his movie pretty well. Still, there are huge pacing issues but it's a comic book movie with a lot of characters so i've got to give it a pass. But my biggest problem with the movie is that it doesn't feel like an ""Avengers"" movie- they're all split up and such. The theme barely plays and when it does it doesn't feel quite right. The Russos don't really understand what the Avengers are, based on this movie. It doesn't feel quite as complete as the previous two. Well, this was a good movie, worth the hype, but I hope they improve for the next and final one. Part 2 is usually better, right?","7"

"ThisisFizban","Some decent fight scenes and a few funny parts but that's about it","22 May 2018","There's something odd about Infinity War and a lot of other Marvel films and it's hard to put my finger on it. But after thinking about it, here's an analogy. It's like watching a sports game where the top seeded team plays the lowest seeded team. If you're a fan of the top seeded team, then it's an amazing game. It's a very safe experience. You get to watch your team decimate their opponent. Every play is fun to watch and you leave feeling superior and satisfied. As an example I'll point out the first action sequence in Winter Soldier. Captain America jumps out of an airplane without a parachute like he's headed out to pick up the morning paper. When he lands on the ship of bad guys it looks like he's just in a casual daily sparring exercise. I felt no tension at all that he was in danger or that he couldn't take the entire ship down by himself. But here's where Marvel has it figured out. It LOOKS cool and impressive. Each kick and punch is thrown highly stylized and well choreographed. That is the problem there in general with Infinity War and others. I'd say I like about half the Marvel movies just to put that out there. To put things in contrast I'll bring up the show Agents of Shield(which sadly has been more or less cast out by Marvel). The writing on the show can be somewhat repetitive but what they do get right is the tension(and the amazing characters). Every season they put them through absolute hell over and over and over to the point where I don't know who is going to survive and even if they do, how will they recover emotionally? I'll frantically binge watch a season in like 2 weeks, staying up till 3 AM each night and then get mad at myself that I'm too tired to continue watcing. I don't feel this with the Marvel movies. But like I said before, Marvel has discovered that they don't need to make a tense storyline or deep relate-able characters. Really it's all about showcasing everyone's favorite character be dominant and show off their powers. One of the problems with Infinity War is that it felt like a sports game where they were giving out participation awards. Back in the day I was an avid comic book reader. And I knew that there was a wide range of characters with varying levels of powers. Some stronger, some medium and some without powers at all. It brought tension and interesting dynamics to the stories because why in the heck would Captain America take on Thanos head-on seriously? Cap is a smart guy. He's not that stupid. As far as super abilities Cap is on the lesser end. Similar to Batman in many ways. He uses his intelligence, speed and fighting ability most of all. But he knew his limitations and his comic book had a raw relate-ability that other comics didn't. The fact that Cap actually beat the crap out of Iron Man in Civil War is absolutely preposterous. So there were many moments in Infinity War where super heroes were treated on equal levels when they shouldn't have been. I have some other criticisms of the movie like how all minor villains were completely forgettable. I don't know their names or really much anything about them. And Black Widow continues to annoy me with her invincibility and the fact that she is so American it's cringe worthy. And Thanos' supposed sacrifice of Gomorrah and his inner pain that was trying to pull on my heart strings? Yeah not very believable. The movie wasn't terrible... just to clarify. But the main thing I wanted to point out is that many people are saying this is a great movie and well that's your opinion but maybe it's just a great looking movie and you enjoy it because you get to see your favorite heroes kick butt. But does that make it a good movie though? You could argue that it did have tension because at the end half of the characters die. By the time all that started happening I already knew that Marvel doesn't have the guts to kill of anyone major. They'll all be back in the next movie :)","8"
"freddfoley","Bad Movie","31 December 2018","Unlike the majority of people I honestly really disliked this movie. I felt it was far to crammed because of how many characters where in it and that Thanos was not a good villian. I believe Thanos was not a good villian because the directors made him so sympathetic that I was struggling to believe that he could do the horrible things he wanted to do because one moment he'd be crying about letting Gamora die and the next moment he'd be happily planning to wipe out half the universe! Also because the decimation (Official name for the Snap) wiped out all the new characters no one is expecting the snap to be permanent so it removes the tension of what will happen next in Avengers End Name","10"

"tabuno","As a standalone movie was a disappointment","28 January 2019","As a likely minority in the over-rated super-hero extravaganza, Infinity War as a standalone movie was a disappointment. It pandered to the audience with simple script devices where the superheroes were made to look pretty stupid, uncertainly un-Jason Bourne like in mentality and behavior. The evil ones were able to convenient arrive just in time to continue the storyline that could have easily ended multiple number of times at any number of points if these multitude of conglomerate, almost innumerable superheroes could actually learn to work together and obtain the oneness that comes of Buddhist, Eastern cultural wisdom of the importance of society over the individual. The backstory of Thanos and his daughter was too brief and insufficient to provide a more complex and bonded emotional connection is one problem. And another problem is simply too many superheroes that almost makes the movie more about heroes becoming the norm instead of super. It's almost now about many people who appear to be super but the movie is populated with so many of them that really it seems that they are normal people with extraordinary differences that the audience has seen so often that they almost appear normal now, nothing really special anymore, something the audience just comes to expect. Overall, the movie substantively is pretty superficial and the plot while challenging includes too many cliques and uneven tone from a chaotic fusion of trying to be so cute and funny, to serious and emotional riveting so much so that it becomes neither.","4"

"DeBBss","The Hype Is Real!","28 April 2018","I've been waiting for this movie to come out for forever now. I was afraid it was going to be terrible; if it was, then that would be a surprise. Marvel movies have been at the top for years now, and this is the peak. I was so excited to see all these characters meet for the first time and take down Thanos. For me, this is the best way to introduce the Infinity War story. There was so much characters and subplots, and there was no pacing issues and the story didn't get lost in itself. This movie could've been three hours plus, but putting it all together in two hours thirty minutes is a real achievement. I was never bored too; there was action right in the beginning to the end. I know a lot of the non-comic moviegoers are going to hate this movie, because they had no idea that Thanos would kill everyone, luckily I knew what was going to happen. I think it was a hard decision for Marvel to take this direction; due to the criticism of the naive moviegoers, salute to Marvel. The thing is, if Marvel never explained all of the characters, then this could've ended up as a failure. We knew all of the characters and plots. Marvel explained every bit to the audience through multiple movies. Marvel took their time to explain and not confuse the audience. DC didn't do that with Justice League, there was no hype for that, because there were no ""Multiple movies"".

Story: 10/10

There are six Infinity Stones, each stone was explained throughout every Marvel movie (Excluding the X-Men universe). We knew everything there has to be known about the Infinity Stones and the subplots, because of the ""Multiple movies"". This movie is subplot galore, and a lot of movies suffer from that, but this movie doesn't. All the subplots made the Marvel universe more interesting and exciting. For anyone who doesn't fully understand the plot, Thanos has to collect six Infinity Stones from around the universe, if he gets it, then goodbye to the superheros, and that's what happens in this movie. Most of the superheros are gone, it's up for the rest to end Thanos. There was no pacing issues, as I said before. I was never confused of what was happening; the plot stayed on its tracks the entire movie. We also saw Thanos collect each Infinity Stone, except for one. I liked seeing Thanos collect all these Infinity Stones while seeing the superheros band up together, it really builds up the the climax. Overall, the plot stayed steady, there wasn't too many plot holes, the story is action packed, fun, and exciting.

Characters: 10/10

I loved all of the characters. Each one had their own movie to star in, which made them even more exciting to see them team up. For me, Thanos was perfect. They made Thanos strong and ""Merciless"". Thanos was such a good villain because he didn't fail to kill superheros, and that's what he did in this movie. If a villain managed to do nothing, then he's a bad villain, but Thanos managed to complete his mission. Every character was interesting, and they had their own part to play in this movie. Each character and setting was explained so perfectly in this movie, and in other Marvel movies. One of the newer characters is Eitri (Peter Dinklage). Peter Dinklage was the perfect choice for Eitri. Dinklage is such a good actor; he can really play any role. I would also like to see Eitri join the rest of the Avengers to end Thanos, that would be great. Since there's so much characters in a two hour thrity minute movie, some characters don't get that much screen time. I wanted to see more Black Panther, he was only helpful at the end of the movie. Overall, every character had their own role to play in the story, Thanos was perfect in this movie, but some characters didn't get that much screen time than others.

Action: 10/10

A lot of long movies like, Star Wars: The Last Jedi and Blade Runner 2049 suffer from one important issue; the boredom. A lot of long movies feel long because there isn't enough action to keep the audience satisfied, but Avengers: Infinity War had no problem. None of the characters had to be explained and none of the major plots had to be explained, it was all action. This movie really used the power of CGI, and there was no problem. Sometimes having a CGI villain can ruin the villain itself, but the voice acting by Josh Brolin was good enough to make this CGI villain believable. The climax of the movie is one of the strong parts of this movie. Seeing most of the superheros work together for the first time is like rewatching the climax of Avengers (2012). But not all of the superheros were fighting the alien army. The other superheros were fighting Thanos. Overall, there was constant action, the CGI was on point, but I expected a slightly better final fight.

Overall, Avengers: Infinity War was perfect for me. I loved the story, the characters, and the action. I was afraid that Marvel would do something wrong, but everything was perfect. I really hope Marvel can keep up with the good work, but Venom scares me. Venom, in my opinion doesn't look that good for a Marvel movie, and I really want this Marvel hot streak to continue. There is one minor issue; there wasn't enough Hulk. I wanted to see Hulk in the final battle, but he was just in the Hulkbuster suit, which is ironic. Avengers: Infinity War was funny too, which isn't surprising. I strongly recommend Avenger: Infinity War, it's the Perfect Marvel movie, with lovable characters, laughs, and the constant action.","5"
"photoe","A long ways from the perfect scores people are giving this movie.","21 March 2019","The only reason I'm giving this movie a 6 and not a 3 is because of its daring script, which I might add, is WAY too heavy for children under 9. I feel sorry for parents who felt obligated to take their kids to this, because it is challenging and depressing, even for adults. There's also a fair amount of in-your-face murder, and allusions to genocide. There's so little happiness in this movie, I give the producers some points for getting it through the studio.

I won't go into long machinations about the plot and characters. All of the characters are there, as far as I can tell, and it does get crowded. It's impossible to tell who has what powers at some points, since several seem omnipotent, with all manner of energy weapons. The problem with energy weapons as a plot vehicle, is that why do they even bother with learning combat? Why is an energy hammer more powerful than an energy spear? Why send packs of feral dog monsters if they can just be slaughtered? Can every single superhero breathe in space? Even Spiderman? He is aware that gravity is much reduced to swing on his webbing, right? Why does noone's hair or makeup get mussed after brutal combat, except on occasion, certain heros do get injured, stabbed, have their skin broken etc. There's absolutely no rhyme or reason to any of this, and it gets old.

A few characters have mind-controlling powers as well, and that gets really hard to track. Some have novelty powers that seem as directed by the special effects department as anywhere else. The battles are relentless, and frequently devoid of all manner of scientific logic. If you can't stand watching modern video games, you don't want to see this movie, because it behaves much like one.

The villain Thanos is definitely sinister, in voice and deed more than in looks, since he is a 3D construct, and I found it harder to take him seriously than the other live actors in the film. I still have no idea what Scarlet Johansson does, short of look good. She can fly around and kick things. THat's pretty useless to the other heros and villains throwing around energy bolts and space/time warping spells and weapons. For some reason, Thor has some of the most fearsome power, when he finally pulls it together in a method that is reminiscent of getting a lawn mower started, another thing which made absolutely zero sense.

At times, the movie definitely feels made up as you go along, although there was a clearly defined plot that was crafted as a devilish and depressing cliffhanger, so that's the most redeeming feature. There is a good parable about sacrificing what is most important to us for ultimate power, and it is well delivered, so that's the main thing holding up this otherwise hollow picture.

Big props to Zoe Saldana, for grounding and exploring the character Gamora, and bringing the best acting to a picture that doesn't leave much time for any of its big stars to do much but show up, make unfunny quips and fight. The writers were smart to give her as much dialogue as she had. Without the dynamic between her and Thanos, this picture would be nothing.

I am curious to see how this predicament is addressed in the next film, since the evil fell across this movie and also Ant Man and the Wasp, but I fear that the payoff will be one drawn-out slugfest and energy weapon fest, and that, like Revenge of the Jedi, it cannot be as good as the depressing Infinity War/Empire Strikes Back tragedy flick template. This was no Empire Strikes Back however. Let's be real on that one.

Let me add I'm being generous, because I'm an adult who can hack some of these comic strip films, especially the better ones like Wonder Woman. However, if you find the cliches rife in these movies intolerable, definitely stay away from this movie, because it is knee deep in many of the problems of this genre. And Tony Stark should be chasing Scarlett, NOT Pepper Pots.","8"
"keyope","Another superhero movie","2 August 2018","Avengers Infinity War wasn't a film I was overly bothered about seeing, but my friend drags me to all of the superhero films, none of which I've found to be very interesting. Since the first Iron Man film (which was a pleasant surprise) these films have become more and more formulaic. This one has huge ambition by throwing every single Marvel superhero into the mix. If you love these characters then this is probably all your cinematic dreams come true. However if you're just a fan of good movies then this might well leave you cold.

On the positive side of things, it's very impressive that the filmmakers have assembled so many characters and given them all something to do, but it comes across like Wacky Races with 50 characters. It's kind of fun for a while but as more and more characters are introduced it becomes harder to care. And the plot, well, it's a problem. On the one hand they've kept it really simple by having one major bad guy (with a couple of sidekicks who show up now and again). And as is usually the case in these films, it's a maguffin chase. All of these big budget franchises have been using this lazy plot line for ages now. Thanos (the villain) needs to find a bunch of coloured stones to wear on his glove. And if he gets them all then it will mean the end of the world, universe, blah blah (same thing as the ring in LOTR, or the cube in Transformers, and most other big movies like this where everyone is after a magical artefact). The problem is, these magic stones don't really do anything. They just have nice names and the bad guy has to find them at any cost. That's your whole plot in a nutshell.

So to try and keep the audience engaged the filmmakers have decided that an overbearing soundtrack will tell you how to feel at every crucial moment in the film. And it's almost always the same thing - Character X is about to die (cue tragic sad music). A long drawn out sequence takes place where X says goodbye to someone. These scenes (which are repeated every ten minutes or so) either end with another avenger showing up to save the day (cue triumphant music) or X is killed / left to die by the bad guys. But because this is a superhero film and most of these characters are big cash cows, you know that they're not really dead. They're coming back, sometimes twenty minutes later. After a while the constant ""don't let me die"" scenes get beyond ridiculous, but I suppose if you're a kid and haven't seen this done a million times before, it might be ""amazing"". On the other hand, if you're an adult and you've seen this done enough times to know how it plays out, this becomes tedious really quickly. And the overbearing soundtrack telling you how to feel at all times, smacks of desperation from a studio that knows they have too many characters in the film and not enough time to make a casual viewer care about them, so the manipulative music is added in instead to trick you into feeling whatever they want you to feel.

Even though I didn't enjoy this film, I think they've done a great job of making it look fantastic. And every character gets their allotment of screentime without the pace of the story ever slowing down, but what you have is a 2 hour 15 minute action film with no downtime, probably in the hopes that younger viewers won't notice the absence of a proper story.

To summarise, this is great for fans, but probably boring for anyone else.","2"
"Molongirl","Overkill","3 May 2018","Overkill on so many levels.Too many characters, too many worlds, too many explosions. I found there were so many deaths that in the end even when a character I really liked died I had no emotional response. Also too many times, before he had the full set of rings that Thanos could have been shot but no, everyone politely waited until he was aware of their presence (eg when he is talking to Gomorra and Star Lord is standing there with a loaded gun doing nothing!!!). I cried at the end of GOTG 2 when Yondu died, but this movie almost trivialised death, it was an emotionally vacant experience. I love both Marvel and DC universes but this missed in too many ways to be engaging, Justice League a clear winner. a final thought, the music was also draggy which didn't help, I came out thinking I may well see the follow up on DVD. My favourite bits were the different groups meeting each other and finding out that Thor speaks Groot. My advice to Marvel studios, you seem to focus on Iron Man a lot, he is an unlikeable character, choose someone else as your lead and maybe that would help audience engagement, certainly would mine. But again Tom Hollander as Spider Man is just perfect.","9"
"fernandoschiavi","'Infinite War' is not just a film, it is a cinematic event. More than an adventure or action film, like most of its predecessors, the film has a much greater sense of urgency!","22 March 2020","A decade after the debut of 'Iron Man', Marvel finally reaches its peak, concluding three phases that brought the great heroes of Casa das Ideias to the screen, who knew how to make the necessary adaptations while maintaining the essence of the original material of the comics. In this decade of huge successes, the audience became intimate with Captain America, Iron Man, Hulk, Ant-Man, Thor, Black Panther, the Guardians of the Galaxy, in short, the whole range of characters that today make part of everyone's life. And there are characters to come before the end of phase 3 in 'Ultimatum'. The cinema knew how to popularize and expand exponentially all these characters already so familiar to fans of comics. With each new phase, new characters and universes are added to this formula, consequently leaving everything bigger, better and grander.

With the contracts about to expire and having to increasingly pay stratospheric salaries to their stars, it is natural that this phase closure is the end of the cycle for some, while other characters will continue to emerge for years to come. To command this last film, which will be divided into two parts, the Russo brothers were called, who directed highly praised films by Captain America, The Winter Soldier and Civil War, which is also an Avengers for having brought together several Super heroes. For the script, Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely were called again, who had the complex mission of bringing together earthly and cosmic characters in an organic and convincing way, placing the heroes in the face of a devastating threat. In Avengers, Infinity War, Thanos (Josh Brolin) finally arrives on Earth, willing to collect the Infinity Stones. To face it, the Avengers need to join forces with the Guardians of the Galaxy, while dealing with disagreements among some of their members.

One of the points that we observe here is how the connection between the different films of the Marvel universe is made with extreme mastery. All loose ends are tied and we can see the consequences of the events of previous films, since the split of the heroes in 'Civil War' (after the events we noticed that Tony Stark and Steven Rogers had broken off since then), Bucky Barnes' exile (Sebastian Stan) in Wakanda and how the heroes have followed separate paths since then. Captain America (Chris Evans), the Falcon (Anthony Mackie) and the Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson) went to one side as fugitives, the Scarlet Witch (Elizabeth Olsen) and Vision (Paul Bettany) started a relationship, the Hulk had stayed the recent years in another galaxy, as seen in 'Thor, Ragnarok', the Guardians of the Galaxy continued their space adventures, now with Mantis (Pom Klementieff - featured in 'Guardians 2') integrated once and for all with Peter Quill ( Chris Pratt) having, finally, relating with Gamora (Zoe Saldana). We see Spider-Man (Tom Holland) continuing his student life with his newfound powers joining in the cosmic battle with the group, officially becoming an Avenger. We also see characters from the Black Panther universe, presented a few months before to the public, with Wakanda being the stage of an extensive and important sequence.

'Infinite War', like the infinite itself, has no beginning and no end, starting in the midst of the action directly connected with Thor, Ragnarok in which we have an exact notion of the size of the threat faced. If in small appearances in previous films, Thanos failed to show everything he was capable of, here he arrives showing what he came for. In ten minutes of film, the Titan beats Hulk (Mark Ruffalo) mercilessly and without mercy, decimates Asgardians and ends Loki (Tom Hiddlestone) and Thor (Chris Hemsworth) without making the slightest effort. This is the point at which, we buy the seriousness of the situation and the grandeur and seriousness of the villain.

From there, as never before, the universe is fully explored as we follow the villain in search of the Jewels of Infinity across the galaxy. Thor's encounter with the Guardians of the Galaxy and the split of the group in two, with Thor, Rocket and the teenager Groot going to Nidavellir, where Eitri, the dwarf (Peter Dinklage) would manage to make a new hammer for Thor, with which he he could defeat Thanos and the others by going to Knowhere, where The Collector (Benício Del Toro) keeps the Jewel of Reality. Having already had the Jewel of Power, obtained when Thanos wiped out Xandar, he would become even stronger. Meanwhile, the other heroes stay on Earth to face Thanos' allies, who desperately try to obtain the Jewels of Time (which is protected by Doctor Strange) and Mind (which is part of the Vision).

This beginning of the conclusion of phase 3 of the Marvel universe expands the action to several places on Earth (New York - where Thanos' followers go after the Jewel that is with Doctor Strange, Scotland and Wakanda - to obtain the Jewel of the Mind). In addition, in space we travel to Gamora's home planet wiped out by Thanos, to Knowhere - where The Collector, Titan lives - Thanos' planet, Vormir - where the Soul Jewel was, where only Gamora knew her whereabouts, Nidavellir - dwarf planet forging the most deadly weapons in the galaxy.

In 'Infinite War', we have the feeling that there is really a powerful and practically unbeatable threat that puts humanity and the entire galaxy at risk, to the point of being wiped out in a snap. The film carries an air of despair and hopelessness. What we see on the screen are characters fighting side by side and trying to improvise in the face of a threat far greater than the sum of their powers. The battle still carries the airs of altruism and strength of the previous films, but this time, we have moved far from that feeling that everything is under control and will be resolved in some heroic and inventive way. The writers rightly chose to leave the villainous titan Thanos at the center of the story. The film carried by the antagonist's unexpected charisma, which has contextualized motivations, and fits perfectly into the presented universe - he is cruel, merciful, has a sense of humor and is kind. Here, his relationship with his ""adopted daughters"" can finally be properly explored. In this respect, many applause for Josh Brolin's performance combined with the incredible visual effects that created the figure of the Crazy Titan

With an established enemy, the directors' competence shown in 'Civil War' in reconciling so many heroes on the scene, is repeated here, on a much larger scale. With so many heroes on the scene, it was possible to notice even more the relationship between them. Thor's dynamic with the Guardians of the Galaxy is excellent, especially with Rocket (voice of Bradley Cooper). We even have some scenes of the God of Thunder with his half brother Loki, who once again reinforces the love-hate relationship between the brothers. We also have the hilarious relationship between Spider-Man and Iron Man, again repeating the partnership in some hilarious scenes. The duo still has great chemistry with Doctor Strange (Benedict Cumberbatch). Captain America's team also had a fearless resistance with the Royal Guard, the Frontier Tribe, the Dora Milaje and the Winter Soldier, Bucky Barnes (Sebastian Stan). Whether across the galaxy or on Earth, the groups formed to defend humanity from Thanos' imposing threat. The whole cast is great and the excitement of each one to be part of these experiences is notorious.

Contrary to what we saw in the past, by the way, you can say that Infinite War is the darkest film in the Marvel shared universe. This is not only due to the aforementioned sense of hopelessness, the result of the notion that, at that time, the heroes really are dealing with a threat far greater than the strength of their powers, but also because of the decrease in the tone of jokes and comic reliefs. . Not only the public, but the heroes themselves know that what they face now is far greater than any enemy they have faced before.

There are no words to describe the magnificent visual effects, which are further magnified on the big screen of the cinema. The action scenes on practically all planets and scenarios bring out the best to be explored in each situation. The joining of so many worlds, in so many contexts and how everything is so integrated was certainly an arduous task, but performed to perfection. The varied photography of Trent Opaloch combined with the production designer of Charles Wood and the soundtrack of Alan Silvestri places the viewer in the most diverse environments and brings all the dramatic and spectacular load to the viewer.

It is the feeling of integration of the entire Marvel universe materializing in a way that it is impossible not to please the public. Infinite War is not just a film, it is a cinematic event, one of those films that are practically unanimous and that manage to go down in history, due to the quality, repercussions and records achieved successively. More than an adventure or action film, like most of its predecessors, the film has a much greater sense of urgency. The Russo brothers made a megalomaniac work, with unforgettable scenes of action (with special emphasis on the action scenes that take place in Titan and Wakanda) and with dilemmas of friendship and family that are fully supported. This is the long-awaited show since 'The Lord of the Rings, The Return of the King (2003)', something so spectacular and well built at the same time.","9"

"srdjan_veljkovic","For all the spectacle, it turns out shallow","27 April 2018","It feels like a series of related, high-level commercials. It never stops, always wanting to make an impact right-away, never allowing time for things to grow. Mostly by blowing stuff up, but in all other aspects, too.

Humor is a bunch of one-liners. Growth (by, say, Teenage Groot) is an ""event"" - ""from a tablet-playing teenager to a hero in 1.4 seconds"".

When it does try to break that pattern, mostly w/Thanos, it doesn't do much, merely stretches the time-base, taking things into slow-motion, yet still the same low amount of things actually happen.

Not to mention that men show more emotion than women in this movie. Methinks #TimesUp for this silly feminism already.

The biggest problem is the finale, where any semblance of sense is lost, especially since we know Spider-Man and Black Panther have planned sequels, so, their ""deletion from existence"" at the end will not last. Hopefully it will not be some big ""time-reversal"" event, or this will start to look way too much like comics.

Bottom line, it's watchable, but not very good, worse than original Avengers and, while different, of similar overall quality with Age of Ultron.","9"
"brankovranjkovic","Avengers - Infinity War (part 1)","1 May 2018","Action packed superhero fantasy adventure.

22 (yes 22!) heroes battle the evil Thanos and his Infinity Gauntlet.

To become all powerful Thanos needs to gradually collect all 6 mystical infinity stones, only then can he complete his Universal genocide masterplan. The superheroes aim to stop him with their individual special powers. Dr Strange has foretold millions of possible outcomes of the battles ahead, his priority is to protect the time stone (hanging around his neck) but gives this up in exchange for Iron-Man's life. We are led to believe that Iron-Man is the key to ultimately beating Thanos. Unusually the villain wins and in doing so we see many important heroes die, in a dramatic 'turned to dust' way. However Dr Strange's time travel ability may bring them back for part2? We also know the individual instalments are yet to come.

The film is long, dark and gritty. There are good character dynamics, humorous in places, emotional in places (especially in the last 30-45 minutes). 3d is effective, so invest in the option where available. I really enjoyed the soundtrack as well. Recommended.","6"

And not even all of the action kept me from yawning. Dr. Strange had some great action scenes but for the most part the choreography in this film was nonexistent and sloppy. And If people thought the humor in the Last Jedi was out of place then you will really be disappointed here. Unlike Thor Ragnorok, the humor in Infinity War was for the most part; not funny and it came up at wrong moments in the film, which removed the seriousness in certain situations.

Even the acting seemed lazy, especially the performances of Ruffalo and Evans. These guys are running out of steam and put no energy into the roles this time. Even Robert Downey and Tom Holland lacked the chemistry they have often displayed in previous films. Perhaps its not their fault but the due to the fact that they had so little screen time. This film might as well be a Guardians of the Galaxy film, but they called it an Avengers film because they have more prestige. The film should have been called Infinity War and that's that.

To sum it up, this film is a 2.5 hour long first act of a three-act film. Save your money because you will be disappointed, just like my entire theater was.","1"

"pokedom","Cuthroat, brutal, and fun as hell","28 April 2018","The hype train behind this movie was insane. You should have been there, it was such a ride. We were losing our minds at this image, and crying over that shot from the trailer, and speculating about every little thing. It was something special to behold. So now that this gargantuan movie is here, was it worth it? Was all that hype warranted or did it all go to waste? I'll say what I can here, but to put it simply, this film gave me everything I wanted and more.

Guess I'll just start with the bad, because no movie is truly perfect, and this one is no exception. There's one shot in the beginning between Tony and Pepper that constantly blurs in and out of focus, which I would guess is a problem with the whole thing being shot with IMAX cameras. They're great for the action scenes but really poor for scenes of two people talking. I don't think they do enough with the characters they're given, mainly because I've followed Marvel movies religiously for close to 8 years now and would have just loved to see all the witty banter they go through. And yet there's not too much of that. You have all these A list actors, and you do... pretty much nothing with them. A little annoying but whatever. There is stuff, but to me they could have gone farther still. And the last issue is the Soul Stone. They throw it in, but I'm guessing only for fanservice and to go through with the ending. The problem is we've been looking for the Soul Stone for 6 years now and no one knows, and now it's Gamora who's known this whole time? Yeah, that's kinda an issue.

Really all that stuff is me nitpicking. What this movie doesn't do so well here or there it makes up for in spades with all this really cool stuff. Every action scene is superb. And trust me, there's a *lot* of action scenes. There's one at the start, then there's another in New York, then there's another on the ship thing, and another in Switzerland or wherever, and a really big one on Titan, and a really *really* big one on Wakanda. It wouldn't be too much of a stretch to say the whole movie is one fight scene honestly. And not just one long boring fight scene, they do so many wonderfully amazing things in it that saying anything here kinda defeats the purpose.

The characters don't need too much more fleshing out, as we already know who these people are from other movies. And that was really my biggest concern going in, that they would give everyone an extra backstory. But the film goes, ""you should know who these guys are by now, don't expect us to waste precious time on them."" The only character this really happens to is Gamora, but she never had that big of a backstory to begin with, so it doesn't truly matter. Besides, she dies anyways. And not just at the end, which I was surprised by.

Speaking of the end... I love it. It's so bold and brave of Marvel to literally erase every character we've cared about for the last 6 years. The only people that end up alive are the original six (I'm going with Hawkeye/Antman being Schrodinger's Cat, where they are both alive and dead until further notice), Rocket, War Machine, and Nebula. And I agree with it, mainly because deep down we all know Avengers 4 is probably going to undo at least part of the damage. Peter Parker dying isn't the end of Spiderman, because Spiderman is a suit, not a person. (STILL WAITING ON MILES MARVEL). Dr. Stephan Strange, Sorcerer Supreme dying isn't the end, Sorcerer Supreme is a title. T'Challa dying isn't the end of Black Panther, they've already announced a sequel within like a month of his movie, and besides, Black Panther is just another title. A kingly status, not a person. I love the ending just because of the sheer ambition and bold choice made, but not everyone did clearly, as I could tell people walked out really really sad. I don't blame them, it sucks seeing them die. But that's exactly why they did it.

Thanos is the coolest villain Marvel villain... ever really. I'd say better than Loki, better than Ego (whom I've learned to love), better than Michael Keaton that one time, better than literally every Marvel villain. He steals the show, and in a way you can understand his thought process. He thinks what he's doing is right, wiping out half the universe so that the last half have a better, more prosperous life. And in the end he wins, and his ambition is realized. Was what he was doing right in the end? To him maybe, to us maybe. And every fight scene involving him, except maybe the very very last one where he walks up to Vision and just kinda blows through the remaining force through sheer over-leveled might was absolutely fantastic. He is far too powerful, but everyone against him puts up one hell of a fight.

So I thoroughly enjoyed this movie, and I can tell a lot of other people did as well. It's not a perfect movie, honestly to me Iron Man 1, Guardians (both), Avengers 1, and Dr. Strange are still better, and none of those top Dark Knight, but still. I love this movie. And you should too, if you've been like me for the past year. Go watch it at your earliest possible convenience!.. just remember to bring tissues.","9"

"msbreviews","Rating: A-","15 August 2018","If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog :)

My most anticipated movie of 2018 was released a few months ago but at the time I was super busy, so I only had the opportunity to write a mini-review. Now, with Ant-Man and the Wasp coming out this week, I am writing full reviews of the 2015 Ant-Man as well as this monumental film, which features a lot of our favorite superheroes. I didn't watch a single clip or trailer for Infinity War, but my expectations were as high as ever. I went into the theater expecting to (finally) get a movie to rival with The Dark Knight for the best superhero film of all-time ...

Unfortunately, I didn't get it. I will get my two issues out of the way now so I can focus on the positives because this movie has a lot of them. Being this a spoiler-free review, I can't get in-depth about its ending, so I'll do it like this. While its concept is incredibly daring and its execution seamless, the emotional impact is significantly reduced by my knowledge of the MCU's future. Everyone knows which films are being developed for Phase 4, myself included, so I can't just ignore what I know. In the same way that I consider every single movie leading up to Infinity War, I also consider the future releases, especially since this is a two-part film with an overarching story.

My other problem is its balance of characters and storylines. First of all, I cannot imagine the colossal task of having to put together so many characters like the Russo brothers did. This is probably the one issue I was expecting this movie to have because I think it is impossible to perfectly balance this many groups of characters, where protagonists of their own sagas are left to secondary roles. While I do think that they mixed the characters beautifully, sometimes it felt that the film was just going from scene to scene without a real flow.

There are a lot of heroes who have to be introduced and teamed up with other ones. Even with 156 minutes of runtime, it feels that they needed more time. The first half of the movie is a bit convoluted since basically, the transitions from scene to scene become repetitive and action-heavy, with no time to breathe. Sometimes it works (the opening scene is jaw-dropping), sometimes it doesn't. These are my only issues with an otherwise outstanding movie, I enjoyed every second of it!

Like I said above, the Russo brothers brilliantly combined characters with one another having in mind the tone of each individual saga. Every actor and actress bring their A-game, everyone's script is excellently well-written. If I had to choose, my standouts are Chris Hemsworth as Thor, Elizabeth Olsen as Scarlet Witch, Zoe Saldana as Gamora and, saving the best for last, Josh Brolin as Thanos. Oh my God, Thanos ...

Undoubtedly, the star of the film. I never expected that Thanos would have as much screentime as he did, especially when it comes to his backstory. This is the best Marvel villain yet! Even though he is a total maniac, I understand where he is coming from and his motivations are actually plausible. His story is so well-told that I almost wish that he succeeds in his mission ... How crazy is that?!

When someone says ""CGI villain"", everyone instantly associates that to a horrible and depthless character. Well, Thanos is the exception to the rule because not only the CGI is mind-blowing, his characterization is amazing. Every single second that he is on-screen, I can feel it. His menacing and powerful presence is indescribable in words, you have to see it to believe it. I repeat: best Marvel villain to date!

The action is one of the best in the MCU. The fact that this was the first movie in the history of cinema to ever be entirely shot with IMAX cameras definitely elevates every single set piece. Every sequence feels astonishingly epic and the Russo brothers are part of a very small group of directors who can seamlessly handle shaky-cam. Even in the first half, there are so many entertaining action scenes, cleverly filmed and with fantastic visual effects.

Nevertheless, the big spectacle is saved for the third act where everything feels like I am watching those last epic battles in The Lord of the Rings franchise. Winter Soldier and Civil War might have better choreography and longer takes of action, but when it comes to the enormous and boundless sequences, Infinity War brings it home with bone-chilling charges on armies and exciting epicness levels. Also, the score is sensational and it definitely helps to raise a few goosebumps both in the emotional and action moments.

It is hard to rank it inside the MCU and even harder to do it inside the superhero genre. I do not have the ability or knowledge to do it know. However, it is a ground-breaking and unique film, for sure. There is no other movie with such high stakes as this. Don't get me wrong, even though this film is dark and tragic, the Marvel humor is as funny as ever. In such an action-heavy flick, having the sometimes exaggerated Marvel comedy is a breath of relief and if there is a movie that needs it, is this one.

Congrats to the Russo brothers! I never imagined the day where I could experience a film with so many superheroes, let alone such a magnificent one. Avengers: Infinity War is a ground-breaking movie in the genre, it has some of the most epic superhero action I have ever witnessed and one of the best villains of the genre's history, Thanos. This had everything to be an A+ but some issues with its ending and with the overall balance of characters and their storylines bring it down a bit. Still, it is undoubtedly one of the best superhero films ever and I can't wait to watch again!","5"
"Hollywood_Yoda","Like a Fine Wine, The Avengers Get Better With Each Film","6 May 2019","With every Marvel Cinematic Universe film, the stories get better and they each get deeper. They also are getting longer, this film runs for 2 and 1/2 hours. Well worth the runtime, and you'll get a glimpse of nearly every MCU character to date, which is cool.

Is the end of the MCU coming? Maybe in a few years from now (2019), it'll be epic!! The Disney studio has done a tremendous job with bringing the films from script to screen. I may be a tad biased, but the MCU is much better and higher quality than the DC universe. In twenty years, the MCU films will be remembered much better.

Infinity War is a great comic book film! Watch the entire MCU to understand the story though, or you'll be lost. Happy watching.","8"
"eddie_baggins","Marvel have done it again!","25 April 2018","A culmination of year's worth of effort, groundwork and master-planning that started way back in 2008 with the seemingly risky Iron Man (wow I am getting old!), Infinity War has a world of expectations riding on the back of its hero-filled shoulders but as Marvel have proved time and time again, they're masters of meeting expectations and as is the case with this epic, messing with expectations as the Russo Brothers deliver what will be the year's biggest and most talked about blockbuster.

Kicking things off with a memorable opening act that makes it clear we're in for a relatively unpredictable affair, Infinity War is a long and eventful action packed ride, the type of which must make the DC film hierarchy cry on top of their mountians of money, made from the mainly mediocre film offerings they have been toiling away on in the wake of Marvel and Disney's seemingly endless winning streak.

Infinity War is filled with dazzling visuals, laugh out loud humor and a fair share of heart and soul, all of which feels earnt and appropriate in light of the decades worth of happenings that have come before it.

It may not have the novelty factor and unexpected awesomeness that ran through the veins of the very first Avengers outing but after so much time and commitment, Marvel and Disney and in turn us the audienece have invested into this saga, Infinity War feels like something more than your average summer blockbuster experience that's event heavy and many various narrative strands are near perfectly juggled by the Russo Brothers.

With so many key figures and important character arcs to deal with, its to be expected that certain players get less to do than others and some aspects of past occurances don't get much airtime but overall, fans of all shapes and sizes will find much to enjoy from the films beginning through to the films final frame as each hero and villain get their time to shine, with only this year's huge success Black Panther feeling like he may as well have stayed at home as the world fights for its survival.

Fighting against purple baddie Thanos, the world and the universe have found a worthy adversary and pre-release doubts about Thanos feeling and looking menacing enough (doubts of which I shared) are quickly dispelled here with Josh Brolin doing a great job under the guise of his CGI performance, Thanos really is a piece of work and feels likely to be the Marvel universes greatest of big bads.

Without entering into spoiler territory, aspects of Thanos's journey, his inward torments and motivations and his interactions are all handled extremely well and come the films climax, its clear Marvel have created a character and end game that will be both controversial and much-talked about for months and years to come.

Final Say -

There's a lot that can be said about Infinity War but most importantly this is a high-class blockbuster experience that feels like a worthy final piece of the puzzle to this particular phase of the Marvel cinematic universe.

At times thrilling, funny, heartfelt and always entertaining, Infinity War will please all those who've followed the comic book series for the many year's gone before, with the Russo's film likely to be the king of 2018 blockbuster field.

"bastille-852-731547","Disappointing Marvel Superhero Epic","28 April 2018","Unfortunately, this much-hyped Marvel film fails to live up to the hype. The film surrounds basically all characters in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (sans Hawkeye, Ant-Man, and Wasp) as they must fight to stop an evil villain named Thanos, who wants to destroy half the world's population. Josh Brolin does an impressive job voicing Thanos, working to make him both depraved but also somewhat understandable as well. The visual effects are generally impressive, with the notable exception of Thanos' henchmen, whose CGI looks quite cheesy and almost akin to the villains in ""Justice League.""

Unfortunately, ""Avengers: Infinity War"" has an array of flaws. The first flaw is that the movie is almost impossibly convoluted. I consider myself a casual Marvel fan who has seen most MCU movies, and have seen a little over half of them in theaters (Iron Man, Thor, Avengers, Iron Man 3, Thor 2, The Winter Soldier, Guardians of the Galaxy, Age of Ultron, Civil War, Black Panther, Infinity War.) I fully acknowledge the fact that I am unlikely to take away as much from this film as a hardcore fan. However, parts of the film were still difficult to follow--and I followed Civil War just fine. Additionally, while the film is ambitious, it is just unfortunately too overstuffed. There are too many characters and subplots to care about, so much that the audience becomes less engaged in the story until late in the narrative. I believe it would have been better to sort of ""split up"" some non-primary characters between this movie and 2019's ""Avengers 4."" This would allow for audiences to take away more from the two films. While the action is generally thrilling, it lacks a scene that feels wholly unique as compared to other superhero films. The climactic battle in Wakanda shown in the trailers, while a good scene, is pretty similar to other ""large-scale people running"" type battles in movies like the Lord of the Rings series. I guess I was hoping for an action piece that felt really unique to the specific movie itself like Civil War's airport scene or Black Panther's Busan car chase scene. I will not give away any details about the ending, although I will say that it didn't work for me and made it hard for me to suspend disbelief.

Due to its overstuffed nature and overtly convoluted plot, I cannot say this film met my expectations. 5/10

Note: I saw this movie in IMAX 3D. The picture and sound quality were both very good, although the 3D was weak and did not really add anything.","4"

"sheppard-2","Disappointing ending and lots of logical inconsistency","1 August 2018","Well, this movie is certainly entertaining and packed with action and expensive visual effects. It also gathers superheroes from several comics in one place. This feels both fresh and random. It also feels like each character is less interesting, because the writers had to write for so many characters, and they had to spread their effort instead of focusing it. The only actually funny characters here are the guardians of the galaxy, and they are still pretty shallow. The villain team looks like some orcish/undead characters straight from some fantasy video game. The ending might seem like a fresh move for some people, but to me it was just very underwhelming. Not unexpected, no twist, just ""to be continued"", and also on the verge of justifying genocide. This already makes the movie not really worth watching. You get entertained, but it's shallow and empty. And besides that, there are lots of logical inconsistencies. And the biggest one is why would they even fight throughout the whole film? The outcome of their fight is completely inconsistent with their effort. Then, why does the main villain use his powers in some cases and instantly undoes everything that the good guys try to do upon him, but in other cases he just wrestles with them as if he has no superpower at all? And gets no damage most of the time, except one moment where he gets a tiny scar. This really lowers the stakes. All in all, there's no need to watch this movie.","5"

I had to put my input as well and agree that this film does not deserve a high rating as IMDb's users are placing it to be. This movie is tiring in both a good and bad way. Too much action crammed in a 2.5 hour movie. This story should have been serialized or someplace like Netflix where they can hash out a story in an episodic format, like a comic book. I agree with others with plot holes, but we must remember that this is a comic book movie and you have to expect that. I see where certain Hollywood producers are criticizing the comic book film genre and the constant release of these films. I feel that the genre has peaked with this movie.","1"
"KenToo","All fluff, no substance.","2 August 2018","There are movies that have a lot of car chases and explosions and stunts and special effects, but the story is weak and contrived. This movie is kind of like that. It's crap with star power. I will say that it was cool to see so many heroes in a single movie, and there were good special effects and lots of explosions. But, geez, the plot was so weak and contrived!

This is what I call ""dumbed down"" writing as found in Maverick, a 1994 western about a gambler in a poker tournament. The buy in per player was $25k! In today's money, that's about half a million dollars, for the buy in, not the prize! DUMB! The writers knew this, why not fix it? Because they think people are too dumb to understand that $1k was a huge amount in the Old West, so they dumb down the writing for them. I hated this, and it ruined that movie. A:IW commits the same sin, more than once.

First, consider the Infinity Stones -- 6 stones created at the Big Bang of the Universe with unmatched power, supposedly. Yet 2 of them belong to Earth heroes? (Vision and Dr. Strange). And the rest all seem to be in our corner of this one relatively small galaxy. With more than a billion trillion stars in the Universe, this is STUPID.

Next, let's consider Thanos' motivation. He grew up on a planet where overpopulation led to collapse of civilization, so now he is on a crusade to ride the Universe of overpopulation by killing exactly 50% of the people Universe. Does anyone else think this is too idiotic? I mean, sure, people on a planet with no space travel and limited technology might overpopulate that planet to the point of self-destruction, but, like, the Universe is full of empty space and empty planets. Like, billions, maybe trillions, of empty planets. And under-population can cause societal collapse, too, right? Insufficient genetic variation and such. Oh, and overpopulation is often a self-correcting problem because as resources get more scarce, people fight more over them and kill each other off. Not pretty, but effective and largely unavoidable. Thanos' motivation is so stupid that, in fact, one would expect the other characters who discussed the motive to note the stupidity, BUT THEY DON'T! Everyone acts like it is reasonable if cold and heartless. NO IT'S NOT REASONABLE!!!

If you really want to know how dumb this is, consider that the human population doubles about every 60 years. Assuming our growth is average for other intelligent species in the Universe, that means Thanos literally just set back the ""problem"" of Universal overpopulation by 60 years. And I think he spent hundreds or thousands of years on this master plan? Anyone see the problem? Bueller?

Next, the plot is based on the fact of how infinitely powerful these six stones are, so any hero with just one of them is thereby one of the most powerful superheroes of all. With only 2 stones, Thanos lays out the Hulk with one punch -- the Hulk who held his own against Thor (and then some) in Ragnarok. Then with 3 stones, Thanos defeats the GOTG the blink of an eye. Then with 4 stones... he suddenly has trouble against Iron Man and Starlord? with three stonesBut later, when Thanos has 4 stones, he has trouble knocking out Iron Man, Spiderman and Dr. Strange? And after getting all 6 stones, we learn Thor could have defeated him if he went for a head-blow with his new axe? (The axe trumps 6 stones? Why was Thanos not collecting these axes instead?!)

Next, everyone hero Thanos fought, it was like he had a man-crush on him, gushing how much he respected him. Over & over & over. A transparent attempt to explain away Thanos -- the most ruthless and villainous person in the Universe -- sparing hero after hero (until the very end when he wipes out half the universe, thereby setting back overpopulation by 60 years).It makes no sense for Thanos to spare these heroes he could easily kill in fight after fight after fight. He spares Thor (twice), spares Iron Man, spares the Guardians of the Galaxy at least once, spares almost every hero he encounters in Wakanda. Dumb/fake.

Next, it is a common flaw in most of these ""multiple superhero"" movies for the authors to complete punt on any logic to the relative strength and power of the respective heroes. I mean, Captain America is basically just a human juiced up to be, maybe, 10 times stronger than a normal person? That leaves him about a thousand (or maybe a million?) times weaker than Thor or the Hulk or Iron Man. And don't get me started on Hawkeye and Black Widow -- totally normal humans who happen to have some martial art skills. Yet in Age of Ultron with a horde of metal robots patterned off Iron Man's technology, somehow every single one of them is pretty much equally kicking ass. In reality, Hawkeye and Black Widow should have been killed by the first robot they encountered, and Captain America would have been killed shortly thereafter.

To see a variety of comic book heroes fighting side by side despite their different power levels, we have to accept this kind of inconsistency. Fine, to a point. IMO, the Avengers movies up to this point did an okay job not going too far ignoring the reality of the power differentials of their heroes. But this movie chucked any realism out the window, then ran outside and pissed on it. We are to believe one of Thanos' top aides -- the woman with the horns -- has trouble defeating a human with no powers just some martial arts skills (Black Widow)? And sure, maybe Captain America is 10 times stronger than a regular human, but Thanos' four-armed, fang-toothed soldiers looked at least 10 times stronger than a regular human, too, so Captain America should not have been decimating them like he was Superman. Oh, yeah, in a big budget Hollywood movie, the ""hero"" can always effortless defeat an infinite horde of faceless creatures, without any explanation needed.

With all the repetition of how infinitely powerful the six stones are together -- so strong Thanos can kill half the universe instantaneously with just a thought! -- how is it that some space dwarf can forge an axe that can take him down? By the same token, if the six stones are each infinitely powerful, how can one human O.D. on gamma rays or build a metal suit of armor & suddenly be a power match for some one with an infinity stone? (recall he Hulk having his way with Loki when Loki had an infinity stone in his staff)

In fact, Iron Man's power is just plain stupid because from GOTG we know humans are, like, thousands of years behind in their technology. So even if Stark was a visionary building Iron Man's suit well ahead of Earth technology, that might mean it is 50 years ahead, still thousands of years behind those space-traveling alien races. I mean, to Thanos, Stark's technology must be like the steam engine is to us... Yet Stark can go toe-to-toe with Thanos? Makes no sense.

Next, a common stupidity in superhero fighting in general: If a hero has near invulnerability, like Hulk, Thor, (or villains like Thanos), so that they might fall thousands of feet, crash into the ground, and then just get up and brush themselves off, then it necessarily follows that pickup on a giant piece of the ground and smashing it into that person will not hurt him either. Writers often act as if an object ,that would not hurt a superhero who flew into it, WILL hurt the hero if thrown at that hero by an enemy. No, no, no! If Superman can fly into the a train at 500 mph and not get hurt, then a villain picking up said train and throwing it at Superman at 500 mph cannot hurt him either. In effect, this fact would make fights between these near invulnerable heroes pointless and boring, so writers ignore this, but it still is dumbed down writing.

Getting away from general superhero movie criticisms, and back to this movie, a lot of the scenes were just not that fulfilling. When some of the heroes managed to put Thanos to sleep and were about to remove his infinity gauntlet, Starlord suddenly starts hitting Thanos and demanding he tell him what happened to Gematria, so he wakes up before the gauntlet is removed. Dude, with half the population of the Universe at risk, you can't hold yourself back from interrogating him just 60 seconds till the gauntlet is off??? Then you can waterboard Thanos all you want for information!!! Seriously? The writers want me, as an audience member, to feel satisfied with that story line? STUPID WRITING!!!

Almost as bad was the defeat of Thanos crony who controlled metal like Magneto. They blow a hole in the ship wall and he's sucked into space. Seriously? Can't he just use his power to float some metal to him, grab it, and then float it back into the ship like a buoy? Or maybe float the whole metal ship to himself? Or just seal up the metal hull of the ship before he gets to it? It seemed like the most lazy way to resolve that fight, not even trying to be clever or believable. Why not have the bad guy slip on a banana peel and hit his head, just as original and plausible.

Should we ponder again how Thanos with 2 stones easily beats Hulk, Hulk beats Thor (in Ragnarok), and Thor at the end is just about a match for Thanos with 6 stones? This will never make sense, and it is lazy and poorly thought out writing.","5"
"TheTruthofItIs","Thanos FTW!","4 July 2020","Who doesn't love an EPIC villain?! With huge production values this was an awesome display of VFX and an epic saga of galactic proportions. The only thing plotwise is that it's totally implausible that a being with Thanos' capabilities would suffer any attack from our protags. In ""reality"" they would've been banished to oblivion long before he acquired his final gems, though I suppose he needed a few of the superheroes in his quest for the gems. I'm stoked to see how ""Endgame"" ties it all up, though I fully expect Thanos to prevail, I'll be supremely PO'ed if the producers sell us the standard Earth-heroes-must-win Hollywood ending.","3"

I have to say it has felt like a chore getting through some of these films, most are okay but usually not so good that I can't wait to slog through the next 10. The best ones are for me so far Iron Man, Avengers Assemble, Guardians of the Galaxy and Ant Man. Then the problem I found with these are there are just little nuggets of knowledge you get from watching all the others. Which then makes me think do you really need to watch them all?

Infinity War rewards you for your commitment. Like Rocket just conveniently having the eye he stole from the last Guardian of the Galaxy film spare for Thor. Was that planned?

It starts where the last Thor ended and then.picks up every others last adventure at a furious pace.

Thanks is definitely a threat because he just wipes out the whole of Asgard immediately. He has been hinted at here and there but now we see him in his full terrifying glory. The entire Universe is at stake here.

It has real emotion throughout. Every detail has been thoroughly planned. You can even put up with the humour because that's what these Avengers do they make light of immediate danger and who else is going to save the Universe from Thanos?

As for leaving you wanting more, this definitely makes you want to see what happens next.

Everything already seen in previous marvel movies, it seems that every new is even worse with lower quality and I didn't even have big expectations before the movie. The main reason I decided to watch it is IMDB rate 9/10 which is total fraud and paid advertisement. There is no guarantee if some character is dead that he will remain dead, everyone could resurrect...Go watch anything else than this.

"deason","Huge crossover exceeds expectations","25 April 2018","This review is no more spoilery than what's already been in the tv ads...

There's a shot in one of the tv commercials for The Avengers set in a forest where we see for the first time together on screen, Iron Man, Thor and Captain America facing each other. The spine tingling electricity that engendered in me lives fresh in my memory: ""Look at them, all together at the same place! It's just like a scene from the comics!""

Avengers: Infinity War taps into that same power source, amplified by an order of magnitude or more. There are so many wonderful interactions between never-before-seen combinations of characters, watching it is regularly delightful. (Particularly entertaining is Thor amidst the Guardians of the Galaxy, but Stark, Strange and Spider-man have some great moments also.)

The tv ads already give a hint of the scale and scope of the battle in Wakanda, but fortunately the actuality exceeds expectations. In fact so many moments from the film have appeared in the tv ads that one might be worried the whole story (or at least too much of it for its own good) has been laid out in advance. It's a real strength of this movie that it has avoided this risk. There are plenty of plot strands barely hinted at in the promotions, many hitherto-unseen (did I really just say that?) powerful moments that deliver hugely satisfying or heart-breaking emotion, and regular genuine surprises.

It's a busy movie but never confusing or flustered. There are references or call-backs to pretty much every single preceding MCU movie, which add to the enjoyable feeling of watching a shared universe develop. Being familiar enough with earlier movies to recognise these various elements adds to the pleasure of watching, but is not really required to follow and enjoy the story.

With criss-crossing subsets of heroes grouping and regrouping across multiple locations on multiple missions, it really does capture the feeling of reading one of those massive company-wide summer crossovers so popular in mainstream comics these last few decades.

It's a great success. If you've seen and enjoyed any MCU film in the last decade, there's something here for you and you shouldn't miss it (and I hope and expect you won't)!","3"
"ossie85","An unforgettable experience","14 April 2023","Avengers: Infinity War is a true cinematic achievement, brilliantly constructed in its scope and execution. The film is not only an incredible action-packed extravaganza but also a masterclass in storytelling, weaving multiple storylines in a seamless and exciting way.

At the heart of the movie lies the incredible villain, Thanos, played with captivating intensity by Josh Brolin. His journey to collect the infinity stones is given great depth and purpose, making it a Thanos film as much as it is an Avengers' movie. Thanos' presence is felt throughout the entire film, and he truly serves as the driving force of the story.

In addition to Thanos, the film's scope is truly awe-inspiring. The sheer number of characters from the Marvel Cinematic Universe that the movie brings together is nothing short of remarkable. The interactions between fan-favorite characters like Iron Man, Doctor Strange, Captain America, and Thor are nothing short of epic, and the film plays to the strengths of each character perfectly.

The action in the film is also nothing short of spectacular. The sequences are well-choreographed and offer plenty of thrills and excitement. The stakes are high, and the film is unafraid to take risks that leave a lasting impact on the audience.

Avengers: Infinity War is a tour-de-force of superhero filmmaking. The film is brilliantly executed with a compelling villain, seamless storytelling, and spectacular action. It's a movie that will leave both casual and die-hard fans of the Marvel Cinematic Universe equally amazed and enthralled.","2"
"cs_rahul_kumar","Avengers: Infinity War Is The Best MCU Movie Till Date !!!","13 March 2022","10 years in the making, the entire Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) comes together to take on the mighty Thanos who threatens to put an end to the universe.

Irrespective of your opinion on the superhero film genre, you cannot deny that 'Avengers: Infinity War' is an ambitious undertaking - the biggest of its kind, making it a significant event in film history. Marvel Studios took a decade to meticulously plan this mammoth showdown of all their fictional heroes together for the first time on screen. To say that the MCU has a lot riding on this would be a gross understatement, evident by their massive marketing campaign visible everywhere. But the billion-dollar question is - does it live up to the hype.

Quick answer? Oh yes, it does! All the superheroes get their moments to shine, and while some naturally take predominance over the others, no role feels minor at any point. Christopher Markus & Stephen McFeely's efforts need special mention for putting together the most crucial and challenging element in a film of this magnitude - the screenplay. From the film's opening moments, their goal to create a clear and coherent narrative is evident. The Russo Brothers take this material and enhance it to bring out some fantastic performances, along with the large-scale action one has come to expect from the MCU. Keeping this balance is not only tricky but also essential to maintain audience interest over a period of two and a half hours. There's barely a dull scene; in fact, MCU's trademark humour is intact and paired with several gut-wrenching moments that will be hard to forget once the credits roll.

In addition to the delight of seeing various characters who've never met each other rub off on one another, talk shop, and exchange banter, it's also staggering to see how much Marvel's universe has grown when it's all brought together on a single canvas. The directors and the writers deserve praise for not making Infinity War feel rushed, as it has plenty of quiet meaningful moments for its characters, especially for Vision (Paul Bettany) and Scarlet Witch (Elizabeth Olsen), Quill and Gamora, and Stark. This isn't true for most of the others, such as Cap and Black Panther (Chadwick Boseman), but that Infinity War can craft some genuine heart-breaking moments in such a massive get-together is a marvel.

Avengers: Infinity War begins where Thor: Ragnarok's post-credits stinger left off, with Thanos' ship intercepting the Asgardians. Infinity War uses Thanos as its viewpoint, as he goes after the Infinity Stones one by one. His goal is to collect all six, with which he could then wipe out half the universe with a snap of his fingers. Earth is important because two of the powerful, glowing ingots are here. One's in the care and protection of Doctor Strange, while the other is embedded in Vision's forehead, essentially keeping him alive. As they try to stop him, the film divides up the heroes: Thor ends up with the Guardians momentarily; Iron Man, Strange, and Spider-Man end up together; and the rest secure Vision in Wakanda.

The consequences of this entry on the MCU are tremendous, all due to the actions of the one single antagonist they have been building since 'The Avengers' in 2012. Josh Brolin had a high bar to meet, and his Thanos smashes all expectations with conviction. He is multi-dimensional with a looming presence to justify all his screen time. Facing him are the superheroes who will take you by surprise on multiple occasions. It's a big team effort with every actor swinging for the fences. The only drawback? All the blistering action, relentless humor and plot intersections might get overwhelming to the casual viewer. But it's all part of the plan - there's so much to digest it warrants a second viewing. If you've felt we're nearing superhero exhaustion, Marvel just went and changed the rules leaving you begging for more - proving yet again that they are the real masters of this game.","9"
"Skippy rocks","Did I see a different movie to most people?","28 May 2018","*** SPOILERS ***

I just don't get the rave reviews for Infinity War. Yes, the action is great. Yes, the special effects are great. Yes, there's a pretty good balance between most of the different characters; and seeing some of our favourite characters meet up with some of our other favourites was also great. I just can't understand people raving about the ending...

*** SPOILER REMINDER ***

Given that we know there are a few more films in the pipeline- Spidey and Guardians to name just two, to have those main characters killed off was pointless because we know that they are going to have to be resurrected in Infinity War 2 (before the new stand alone character films are released). However they do this, (time reversal or diving into the soul stone or whatever), it simply means that characters are going to be resurrected. For all we know they all will be, and Thanos will seem like an insignificant blip on the radar because everything he did possibly gets undone. It was so jarring because I didn't believe it for a second that the 'deaths' were real (ie. Black Panther, Spidey and the Guardians). I knew they had to be resurrected. It just killed the tension, it killed the atmosphere- I mean why should I cry for Parker when I KNOW he's coming back? By the time the end credits stinger rolled around and more deaths occurred, I was snarling contemptuously at the screen. I was so bitterly disappointed. It honestly (and I mean this wholeheartedly) feels like the last Twilight film- there's a super cool battle that essentially is just a dream- it never really happened. It's the same plot device and I am stunned to hear people saying that the end of A:IW was heart wrenching. How gullible do people have to be? Just so you know, I'm the kind of film viewer who doesn't critique everything while I'm watching a film. I like to just enjoy the experience, absorbed in the events unfolding before me. A:IW just didn't work at all, the writers bit off way more than we could chew! I really want to rate it 2 stars because I'm so disappointed by the ending, but as I mentioned, there were a lot of really good things about the film.","4"
"swalker808","Characters Behaved Irrationally","5 March 2019","It was ridiculous how many times the Avengers should've taken out Thanos. When Starkiller punches Thanos when they almost had the glove off, it ruined a lot of the movie for me.

There were so many poor decisions the Avengers made that demote this movie. From not destroying the stones while they had them, to seeking out Thanos separately instead of all together, these dumb decisions made this movie unrealistic given the world.

It's still one of the better Marvel movies, but it could've been better had the characters behaved more rationally.","9"

"paulclaassen","What the hell???!! Why was this such a big success??? CGI Deluxe with no realism whatsoever...","11 June 2019","It honestly baffles the mind as to why this film was such a huge box office success. I didn't like the original 'The Avengers', I loved 'Avengers: Age of Ultron', and now I'm back to not liking 'Avengers: Infinity War'.

Firstly, I mean there are way too many characters in this film!! We have the original Avengers Iron Man, Captain America, Hulk, Black Widow and Thor (no Hawkeye in this installment). Now they've added the entire Guardians of the Galaxy crew, Scarlet Witch and Vision from 'Age of Ultron', Black Panther, Doctor Strange, War Machine, Falcon, Winter Soldier and Spider-man. (What the hell is he doing here???). Loki is back, although only for a (very) short while. Bloody hell, that's a LOT of protagonists for ONE FILM!! With so many characters I actually forgot about some of them when they were not on screen. I mean, Iron Man and Captain America literally were on screen only for a few minutes the entire film! They are also unrecognizable (Thor with short hair, Captain American with a beard and moustache, Black Widow now blonde...) It was way more fun when each character had his own film.

Just like 2012's 'The Avengers' this film plays like a medley of superhero films, and not a standalone film. 'Infinity War' was also too fantastical with not an inch of reality. There was not a single screen without CGI and blue or green screen effects. It felt like I was watching a video game. The film clearly illustrates how CGI is taken much too far in films. Oh, so now Iron Man's mask just disappears? And Spider-man's too? And Quill?? Were all of their superhero suits designed by the same person??? It looked silly and felt fake, choosing the easy way out.

I found the film boring. I hated 'Black Panther', so needless to say I didn't enjoy any of the Wakanda/Black Panther scenes. This was pure CGI and no excitement whatsoever. Iron Man's suit doesn't look as believable as it did in the first 'Iron Man'. It looks too obvious CGI. My favorite character was the antagonist Thanos, who was probably the deepest character of all, and I completely understood his intentions.

"achyutaghosh","How soon can Thanos return?","30 April 2018","Avengers: Infinity War was 10 years in the making. Every MCU movie since 2008 hinted at this eventual end game. The ultimate, cosmic showdown between the entire assembly of heroes, and an all powerful villain. Fans have been waiting for this, Marvel has been building up the MCU for this. Given the genocidal backstory, the challenge for Marvel though was to make a different kind of movie, yet remain faithful to it's brand of film-making, which it actually manages to do well.

So planets are destroyed, and Asgardians liquidated even before the movie begins, while much loved characters soon start getting killed off 5 minutes into the movie. At long last, a villain takes front and center in a Marvel movie. For the last 10 years, Thanos has sent his underlings to collect the Infinity Stones. This time round, he is doing it on his own. The best part about Infinity War is that it is more about Thanos and less about the Avengers and Guardians. Unlike the comics, where Thanos wanted to eradicate half of all life in the universe to win his love, Lady Death, in the MCU, Thanos has a Malthusian hangover. He passionately believes his actions are imperative to save the universe, and goes about doing what he needs to do, methodically, even though it extracts a terrible price on everybody, including himself.

Thanos: Daughter. Gamora: Did you do it? Thanos: Yes. Gamora: What did it cost? Thanos: ...Everything.

So how did the Russo brothers sprinkle the Marvel formula in a movie that is all about death and destruction? First of all, they spread the action across half a dozen locations across the universe- Wakanda, Knowhere, Vormir, Nidavellir, New York and Titan. Then they broke up the heroes into disparate groups, and allowed their emotional connects and comic timings to take over. Other than probably Thor, Iron Man and Dr.Strange, most of the other heroes get a raw deal in this 2.5 hour ensemble set up. Even then, for them, these roles are but their second skin, and they do a great job, as expected. The result is a massive thrill ride, with it's own emotive moments.

At the end though, even when severely wounded by Thor, Thanos snaps his fingers, and half the universe is obliterated. As far as the Avengers go, only the original core team (Captain America, iron Man, Hulk, Thor, Black Widow, and I assume, Hawkeye) remains in existence. Come May 3rd 2019, will it be one last mission for them? Will the Infinity War duology be like the masterful Kill Bill series- the first one being all slam bang, the second a more intimate take? Who knows given that Captain Marvel is teased, and we have seen Adam Warlock last year. And as for those who seemingly no longer exist- Spiderman, Black Panther, Guardians etc- fret not. They all have sequels lined up in the next couple of years.

To sum up, Infinity War delivers a fantastic experience- on this scale, mixing action, imagination, humor and drama with a villain who you can almost sympathize with. The latter though is Infinity War's greatest triumph. I will need therapy to wait for Thanos's return.

It was really satisfying to see the stupid cap and the other bunch of losers get their ass kicked by Thanos.

I was very pleased with what I saw. Brilliant looking CGI, strong story and a massive triple A cast. And of-course a lot of long action sequences that never got boring.

Josh Brolin played an awesome bad guy Thanos who's explanation of his deeds actually made sense, and that is weird because the expectation was to hate this guy.

Here come the spoilers, I warned you.

Red Scull aka Hugo Weaving makes an appearance and that was really an exiting moment because it felt that he wasn't given enough screen time in the first Captain America.

And then we arrive to the moment where several Avengers get axed. And I actually only felt sorry for one of the choices. Bucky Barnes aka the Winter Soldier.

The rest of the axed ones I always considered extra's anyway. For example Black Panther, because of the extremely annoying media coverage That his stand alone movie got I could not be any happier that his movie career got terminated quickly.

"rudicantfail","Yep, I enjoyed that","24 April 2022","""Avengers: Infinity War"" is a bit of an animal, packed with action, good storyline, a good smattering of humour and really good special effects. The film is packed with many hero characters, that sometimes makes the viewer struggle to work out how they all fit into the script. You have to have watched the previous Marvel movies, in sequence, to recall each characters role and ""powers"". This is a long movie, but it is an action rollercoaster. I have to say that the ending is in true Marvel movies tradition; it is like wadding through extra thick treacle, it is that slow and drawn out. But, it is clever in that it keeps the view hooked and on the edge. It seems like this is it, game over, but we shall see. As I said, this is a really good movie, perhaps the best from Marvel Movies in my opinion, I really enjoyed it. The special effects are just superb, the storyline is full of twists and turns, and all the different actors brought together works in perfect motion. Well worth watching, you will enjoy it I am sure.","10"
"ironhorse_iv","Avengers: Infinity War is a Comic Book Triumph. Everything nearly assembled flawlessly.","5 May 2018","Ever since Walt Disney Company purchase Marvel Studios in 2009; they have been on a blockbuster roll, with their comic book movies. Their Cinematic Universe lead by producer, Kevin Feige has introduces countless amounts of superheroes and their stories to vary amounts of success. In return, every standalone & 'Avengers' assemble movie, the studio had made, has been built up to lead up to an all-encompassing climatic arch, in which big villain, Thanos (Motion Capture & Voice Acting by Josh Brolin) will one day, come to control the universe, through the use of six powerful infinity stones. Most of those films in their Phrase One & Two, kinda work, as they help push the apocalypse doom subplot, in a somewhat foreshadowing constant rate. However somewhere, in Marvel Studios Phrase 3 film campaign, that story thread began to lose some ground, as more popular & recent Marvel Comic story elements were put in the foreground like 'Civil War' & 'World War Hulk'. Because of that, it really felt, like Thanos threats of worlds domination storyline was not only coming at snail pace, but simply, delay, more and more, in order to milk more cash out of establish standalone films. Not only, was this decision, causing, doubt that this assemble movie would ever get release, but it was also, making people, wonder, if the film can be possible to be made. Finally, in 2017, we got our answer, as one of the biggest & the most ambitious film projects ever undertaken start to take shape with screenwriter, Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely and directors, Anthony & Joe Russo with their crew on hand, shooting back to back with a direct sequel. In 2018, on the ten year anniversary of the Studios first cinematic universe movie 2008's 'Iron Man', 'Avenger: Infinity War' was finally released to the public. Without spoiling the 19th overall film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, too much, it did live up to the hype as one of the best entry in the Marvel Cinematic Universe yet. It was somewhat accurate to the first half of the 'Infinity Gauntlet' comic book story, written by Jim Starlin, minus the absence of some key characters, like Adam Warlock, Silver Surfer and Mistress Death. Hopefully, they are in 2019 sequel. As for length. For 3 hour film, it was also surprisingly, well-paced. However, there were some really confusing exposition dump parts in the film that seem really odd. It seem like the movie cut a lot of sequences. One of them, involving the Nova Corp & the Power Stone, and the other, concerning the Soul Stone & Thanos's daughters. This also, includes the after credit ending, with the hints to Captain Marvel. Those parts really did seem like to come out of left field. Despite that, while, the movie does jump around, a lot; every scene was a very heart pounding experience built on many amazing heroic characters having to deal with such devastating stakes, in their own unique ways. Surprisingly, the movie gave, enough screen time to, nearly all the marvel characters, without, turning into a giant mess of a film. It's also truly unique, in how well, the writers, fully introduced the villain with all the heroic characters, having to deal with him, one way or another. The screenwriters really did flesh out, Thanos from a cartoony over the top, out there simpleton baddie, into a believable down to earth, well verse, complex nemesis through his fatherhood subplot. Not only that, but Brolin's acting is so commanding, that he really seem like a serious threat with his voice. It was a huge improvement, since his last appearance. He's the best Marvel villain, yet. Even as a special effect character, Thanos kinda moves as if he's really there. The only scene, that kinda look fake with him, was, in the beginning, when he was choking out, a character. As for the good guys, the CGI suits on Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.) & Spiderman (Tom Holland) could had look a little more realistic. It was given off, a 2011's 'Green Lantern' vibe. Other than that, all the action scenes with them, and the other CGI characters such as Hulk (Mark Ruffalo), Groot (Voiced by Vin Diesel) & Rocket (Voiced by Bradley Cooper) were compelling enough to overlook the CGI spot fest. As for full make up performers like Dave Bautista (Drax), Karen Gillian (Nebula) and Zoe Saldana (Gamora). They did well in their scenes. As for Paul Bettany's acting was alright as Vision, but his makeup, was still a bit off. As for live action performers such as Black Panther (Chadwick Boseman), Captain America (Chris Evans), Thor (Chris Hemsworth), Black Widow (Scarlet Johansson), Dr. Strange (Benedict Cumberbatch) & Starlord (Chris Pratt) and others. Every performer in this movie did a great job in their action scene & their acting. Even, the Stan Lee & Peter Dinklage cameo was great. I have no complains about that. As for the humor, it was fine. Lots of laugh out loud moments for a surprisingly dark film. As for the depressing bittersweet ending. I love it! While, a lot of diehard fans and young children might find, this climax to be upsetting. Just note, to take it, with a grain of salt. It's a comic book movie. There is always, going to be some kind of McGuffin or Ex Machina to bring them back. I just glad, Disney took the risk, rarely than play it safe. It was broad to subvert expectations. Overall: The movie was an exceptional achievement that somehow leaves you both fully satisfied and desperate for more. In the end, 'Avengers: Infinity War' ranks among the best adventures, we've seen yet from this stellar franchise. I can't wait for the next movie. I highly recommended seeing this.","1"

"Emma-M-V","Just not that enjoyable","21 February 2019","There are obviously good things about this movie - a lot of talented people worked on it and especially in the scene design there is a lot to like. But there are a lot of problems too. For one it feels disjointed, as if there are scenes that have been uncomfortably cut out. Only a few characters get introduced, and just a few more get what feels like a decent amount of screentime and dialogue. With Cap for example, his role feels extremely insignificant - as if he as a character could have been replaced with any other Avenger performing the same actions and nothing would change. I thought Vision's and the Witch's romance was pretty inoffensive and sweet. I was surprised at how much of a role they had, but the actors did very well at making me see them as real characters, which was at times difficult with some of the more main-cast characters. On the other hand Tony gets an uninteresting and cheesy as hell intro that easily could have been pared down, he and Strange have a stupidly prolonged dickwagging segment and Banner's way to frequent attempts at humor made me wish somebody would shoot him in the face already.

The main I have is probably Thanos though. Thanos' plan is quite obviously deranged and stupid as hell, but he's never portrayed as deranged. We're supposed to see him as a smart, sympathetic villain - which, quite honestly, is a joke. He's just a big, sadistic dummy with a god complex. If they wanted me to see him as anything more they'd do more to set him up as traumatized and disturbed by the events at his home planet so we could see why he would ever be so dumb as to cling to his silly ""just kill half of everybody - that'll solve inequality"" plan. Also, at a point at about the middle of the movie we realise Thanos can change reality around him, and from then on whenever he's in a physical fight with anybody I couldn't feel any stakes at all. He should be able to stop them with a thought or handmove or whatever - so is he fighting them with his fat fists? Does he just think it's fine excercise?

It also doesn't help my view of the movie that I'm a Guardians (and Spiderman) fan over a fan of MCEU in general. If you've watched the movie already you'll probably know why that kind of sours one's view of this movie. I would much rather have more Guardians content in some other form than have this movie. It feels like it sacrifices Guardians - the characters, style and feel of it, on the alter of the crossover cash cow. Similarly for Thor this movie kind of fucks up the story Taika Waititi built up in Ragnarok.","8"
"n-kefala","Too much of everything","29 April 2018","Though surprisingly rich, the film's storyline remains incomplete. Feels more like several movies squished together. ""Avengers: Infinity War"" isn't a perfect film, but it's probably exactly what it wants to be. A massive spectacle full of fun character moments and impressive action sequences. It is an entertaining movie but one that leaves too many unanswered questions. Also it is too long, too dark and too confusing but the humor and all star cast helps you endure the overrunning length. On the whole, ""Infinity War"" is what fans have been clamoring for - an action movie that puts everyone under one cinematic roof, that puts all the good guys against the ultimate big bad for a better universe.","10"

Avengers: Infinity War is an epic awesome fun superhero film that is basically the climatic battle of the MCU that has been leading up to this since the very first Iron Man movie. And surprisingly, it does not disappoint. Marvel has been doing well with its storytelling over 19 superhero movies and counting. And every one has been giving hints of the infinity stones or a big bad villain that will soon arrive like Thanos. And Thanos is the groundbreaking villain that will shake the line up of heroes and possibly changing the direction of the rest of the MCU.

The plot follows right after the events of Thor: Ragnarok. Thor and Loki and the rest of the Asgardians come across Thanos. And his desire for hunting down every Infinity Stone to annihilate half of the universe. Meanwhile on Earth, Doctor Strange and Iron Man face against danger that lands with Thano's adoptive children who are searching for the remaining stones on Earth. While, the Guardians of the Galaxy are on a race against time on trying to stop Thanos from reaching the final stone.

The plot had the Avengers getting separated into their own adventures. Yes, it involves trying to protect the stones or racing against time to find them before he gets it. You have Spider Man, Doc Strange, and Iron Man taking the fight on Thanos home planet. Rocket, Groot, and Thor searching for a weapon. The rest of the Guardians are trying to stop Thanos. Then, Captain America, Black Panther, and Scarlett Witch trying to protect the remaining stone on Earth. Characters were everywhere and had there own objective. Thanos is a villain that is set on world domination. And the writers did add a little emotion to his character and his reasoning behind his motivations of destroying everything. He is the force of nature that will test every Avenger. Sure, some may complain that there are too many characters. Yes, there is. But the writers tried to keep a well-balanced screen time on giving every character enough progression to the story. Which makes this 2 and half hour running time feeling pretty short when several characters are on a different journey that eventually crosses paths.

The visual effects and action sequences are plenty throughout and exciting. It is epic. The first ten minutes with Thanos threatening characters and attacking does leave you with chills. There are some awe, shocking, and haunting moments. And some fun humor with characters interacting with each other. When you get so many high ego heroes in one spot together can be hilarious. And than you have the Guardians which they always light up the mood. Every character has a spot to shine with the fight sequences. Then, an epic climatic battle in Wakanda. And the final moments of the film is pretty haunting. Which may leave the audience talking once the credits roll. This shocking cliffhangar does leave you hanging for the next Avengers movie. Especially, on where the direction can go next. Which is best to avoid all spoilers and media to see for yourself.

Overall, Avengers: Infinity War is a great superhero film. The plot is epic. Our heroes go through several exciting action set pieces to face against the ultimate villain. The film does have a huge cast ensemble as it is. And every one does get their fair share of screen time. Except for a couple of characters that were absent in this film (there roles are probably saved for the fourth film). The visual effects are amazing. And the action sequences are plenty throughout. There is a lot of action from beginning to end to keep you on the edge of your seat. Especially, when characters lives are at stake. The film does end with a shocking cliffhanger, which will leave you pondering on where the fourth Avengers movie will go.

I recommend seeing this film on the big screen. If you seen any of the MCU movies or the previous Avengers film. This is definitely one of the best movies and the climatic part of the Marvel universe. Also, stay tune for the final post credit scene which is an important set up for the next Marvel chapter.","9"

"eliexenov","An amazing film","3 January 2021","This movie is currently the pinnacle of marvel movies. I've heard people criticize this movie for incredibly stupid reasons like being ""to long"" or using cgi. Those people are called weirdos. Watch the movie. It's good.","4"
"murphyollie08","Detailed storytelling, well realised characters and a compelling villain.","3 May 2018","I was there ten years ago when Iron Man graced our screens. I was too ignorant to see the movie in the cinema but I was there the second the film came out on DVD. One of my all time favourite cinematic memories was seeing The Avengers in 2012 with all of my friends, after Iron Man came out we saw every film leading up to the Avengers in the cinema and stuck around for each post credit scene. Here I am six years after The Avengers, Infinity War tickets go on sale and I buy two for the BFI IMAX in Waterloo for me and my girlfriend. I walked into this movie with nothing but high expectations and they were all met. This film benefits from the existence of the other 18 films in this illustrious franchise. It builds upon every single character thread and arc laid down in previous films. No theme is left untouched and no character is left without their traits and quirks. Time has left it's toll on some and has barely graced others. Iron Man's unwillingness to let go of the life he stepped into 10 years ago shows in his absolute eagerness to step into battle with his new nano-suit. Captain America's optimism has wavered but his ability to fight for what is right hasn't. The romance between Wanda and Vision doesn't feel random or forced because their connection has been present since Age of Ultron and especially Civil War.

This film continues a theme long explored in the MCU, familial issues. First explored by Stark's complex relationship with his Father which culminated in 2016's Civil War this film widely explores the relationship between Gamora and Thanos. And what a relationship it is. Thanos is terrifying but the love and compassion he feels for Gamora makes him even more terrifying.

This movie does what no other superhero film is doing right now, it uses it's original score (sorry Guardians) to the best of it's ability wherever possible.

I would highly recommend seeing this film as it is amazing, it's characters well realised and is a creative masterpiece.","9"
"harry_tk_yung","""Part 1""","1 May 2018","There are two group of audiences: (a) those whose background knowledge comes entirely from watching some (perhaps all) of the previous 18 ""related"" movies and (b) those who have read (some even grew up with) these Marvel comics. This makes a big difference because the second group have a pretty good idea where things are going with ""Part 2"", subject to how closely the moviemakers follow the comics. It is also interesting to note that some critics in the first group spill a lot of nonsense that reflect their ignorance, using only their guesses to predict where things are going. I belong to the first group but unlike these critics, I am fully aware of my ignorance.

Just like the ""Harry Potter"" or ""Twilight"" franchise, the grand finale of The Avengers, ""Infinity War"", could be entitled with the informative notation of ""Part 1"" and ""Part 2"". Indeed, that was the initial intention, although I wouldn't try to second-guess why this idea was abandoned. A majority of the world's population know, of course, that one final movie is scheduled for release next year. Many would like to believe that, like the two other aforementioned movies, the gloom the audience take home from the dark tone on which Part 1 ended will be expelled by a glorious finale in Part 2. Will it? I guess we will have to make sure we stay alive in the next 12 months to find out. The consolation is that the wait would still be shorter than that for Game of Thrones or Star Wars.

The one-week spoiler ban for the critics has passed and I am not a critic anyway and have dutifully included my IMDb user review spoiler warning. Among the 76 characters in this movie, the single most important one is the villain Thanos (well-casted Josh Brolin) who, for the first time ever for any villain in a scifi-fantasy, arguably has a ""noble"" agenda - the humankind in entirety. The logic is so simple that it may sound farcical: just eliminate half of it and the remaining will live happily ever after with adequate resources. I said farcical but if you think about it, it is so realistic that it will send a shudder down your spine.

To give Thanos's ultimate, mind-boggling power is a set of six ""infinity stones"". He is already in possession of a couple of those at the start of the movie, which is about his acquiring the remainder. The last one, bringing the movie to an emotional climax, is implanted in Vision's forehead.

To stop him, the superheroes from the two main groups (Avengers and Guardians of the Universe) plus a handful of independent movies (making a total of the abovementioned 18) are sort of regrouped. I'll mention only the key ones here and I won't attach the name of the actors.

The odd couple of Iron Man and Spider-Man teams up with Doctor Strange. I said I won't mention the actors but if you think about the ones in this grouping, you will be amused at the idea of Sherlock Holmes bantering with himself (the movie-screen version vs the TV-screen version).

Vision and Scarlet Witch, you will perhaps be delighted to find, have now a sweet romantic relationship. Under attack (resulting in Vision being badly injured), they are rescued by Captain America, Black Widow and Falcon, and together forms a group joined by The Hulk who stubbornly hides inside Bruce Banner, refusing to come out when he is needed.

Thor, with a somewhat different persona, joins the ""Guardians"" and just imagining the bantering between a serious Thor and a flippant Star-lord will make you smile. But he soon spins off with the two animated characters Groot and Rocket on a special mission and, oh joy, encounters a new character, a dwarf played by Peter Dinklage. Gamora, who is a critical role in this movie, set off with Drax and Mantis for another mission.

Black Panther and company have the dubious fortune of having their homeland as the final battlefield. There are many other characters that I skip mentioning here, the presence of quite a few of those are barely registered. Entirely absent are Hawkeye and Ant-man. Nick Fury and Agent Maria Hill appear in the teaser at the end of the credit roll if you care to wait, and wait, and wait. The background material and theories surrounding the grand finale next year can fill a few volumes of an encyclopedia.

At time of this writing, Infinite War ranks #9 in the IMDb top 250 with an IMDb user rating of 9.0.","1"
"D4V1D2411","Once in a lifetime experience","9 May 2022","Its perfect. It gives you everything you want, it gives all the heroes perfect amounts of screentime, it has a perfect villain with motives you can understand and even support, the fights are one of the bests in the entire MCU, even despite watching it like 15+ times, I still have chills when all the heroes appear, on all the fights, when thanos gets another stone and specially on the ending. Watching this movie is literally one of the best experiences you could ever have.","1"
"CardinalsBaseball","Grade - Incomplete","1 May 2018","This is an incomplete film. Thanos is collecting the 6 gem stones, which can magically do anything for the possessor. The Avengers, Guardians and anyone else you can think of are out to stop him. That is the entire crux of the film. Thanos' motivation is that he wants to eliminate half of the universe's population under the notion that it will somehow cure poverty and starvation. This premise is asinine, however. Earth was half of it's current population a mere 50 years ago, and poverty and starvation was an even bigger problem at the time, than it is today. If he really was concerned with the ratio between life and natural resources, why not increase the amount of resources? Either way you look at it, the motivation was incredibly asinine and poorly thought out. Regardless, that's Thanos' master plan and the heroes aim to stop him. From the very beginning, however, they fail miserably. By movie's end, Thanos has won; he has all of the gems and half of the universe is dead, including all of Asgard and at least half of our heroes. The End. Seriously, that's the end. Now most folks recognize that the carnage and death in this film will be undone in the next movie. Dr. Strange likely cast a spell on his gem that will start mucking about with time and reality and they will somehow make things right again in time for those Black Panther and Guardians of the Galaxy sequels. But that's a completely different film and that just belies the significance of this film even further, Films should stand on their own. Infinity War doesn't do that. If you get off seeing the heroes getting their asses kicked and dying while the bad guy wins at the end; then this is the film for you. I think that's the sort of story that would only appeal to someone who enjoys tearing the wings off flies.","3"
"undeaddt","Up there, shoulder to shoulder with Captain America-Civil War","2 May 2019","Arguably, the best MCU movie ever made, and yes, I watched Endgame. Many people say Infinity War is the action and Endgame is the brain and I agree totally with that, but in Endgame there are many things that can be questioned, the decisions, things that did not make sense, things that can't be explained, some rushed choices and many more. But Infinity War is perfect, it is balanced, it is well written, it is action-packed and the most important thing, it never gets boring, not for a single second. There is always something happening, something big and exciting, heart pounding and stressful. There is happiness and there is grief, there is team work and there is power. Incredible re-introduction of all the characters that we've seen throughout the MCU journey with some of the most amazing visuals and CGI effects ever seen in the movie theaters.","10"
"fmbr-1","Deeply flawed","10 August 2018","There are two types of stories where the hero doesn't save the day. Horror and documentary - horror because the villian is far too powerful to begin with, but even then is usually thwarted by the last of the survivors it has chosen to torment. The other is documentaries, because they are based on real events - but usually the heroes win, because they write the histories. This film is neither and while others applaud the boldness of letting half of the universe get snuffed out, I would say that if the studio was truly bold it would not release another film featuring the characters it so casually got rid of. As it is, this 'boldness' costs them nothing more than thinking of some BS excuse to bring them back, and we are all the poorer for it, for if they can be brought back once, why not twice? Why not over and over again? Death has no meaning to these heroes, they'll be back as long as writers can dream up an excuse. Further, I object to Thanos' loony idea. Kill five billion people on Earth (half is less but then there are airline pilots that disappeared, people killed in traffic because of crashes, etc. etc. Within 100 years, the population will be pushing 8 billion again. He hasn't stoped the problem, merely delayed it for a little while. However, the problem isn't even real. Thomas Malthus published his 'Essay on the Principle of Population' in 1798 predicting that people would run out of food - yet today, we produce far more food than we can use (even if it was sent to feed the hungry in areas of famine). Finally, Thanos doesn't even have the courage of his convictions. If he believed that it was for the good of the universe, he should have volunteered that he be the first taken. The fact that he isn't means that he doesn't believe and is also a coward. Truly this is the worst of the Marvel films to date.","1"
"patrick-91640","Assembly-line work","21 November 2021","Yeah, I get it: the bigger picture, the grand finale, and how it all wraps up the entire mcu saga that was build up for so long.

And I do agree on that one. What the MCU has established over many years is impressive. It really is. And there is nothing I can think of that comes close to this type of lifetime-achievement. Touché!

But let's be honest: that doesn't make the movie itself good or interesting. Since many years the primarily asked question for MCU movies and the most discussed topic is the ending credits scene. Imagine that! You've just watched a movie and the most important question doesn't seem to be the movie itself and how well you were entertained but what comes next to complete the bigger picture. That is the truth and nothing but the truth to the success of the MCU.

Infinit war is no exception to that. The movie as it is is boring, way too crowded, way too much CGI, the once so great heroes get degraded to cannon fodder but all the critics and many viewers praise it as one of the best movies ever. Simply because of the greater picture around it.

To me that is the real oath of manifestation. The early MCU movies we're great movies. The newer ones are just mediocre with a strong universe supporting them.","9"
"dakuchonekobing","Wonder how many movies like this Marvel can create? Maybe never","11 July 2022","This is the result of 10 years. And it's incredibly effective. When you create a good enough villain, the superheroes around him only need to appear for a few seconds. But everyone knows these heroes well, they all have their own movies that have been released before. So can I consider this a solo movie about Thanos lol.

To create a villain like Thanos, perhaps Marvel's producers also need luck. He is too perfect, from appearance to personality and purpose of life. He makes all other superheroes worthy of mere supporting characters. Because his ideals have convinced viewers. And superheroes can only fight him through tolerance and peace-loving hearts. And no one can use reason to defeat Thanos.

I'm pretty reserved and concerned that Marvel will create another villain, another super movie that brings together many superheroes and creates a movie of great quality like this one. Because that's very, very difficult. This is probably the best Marvel movie of all.

My emotions were filled by this movie. Although there are scenes that are not suitable for children, like the scene where Iron Man is beaten by Thanos, and the scene where Loki is strangled to death, this is what I like, because movies are for all ages.

Of course if I had a friend around 10 years old I wouldn't recommend this movie. ""Wait a few more years"" lol so violent.","10"
"holgerscholl","Utterly disappointed","12 May 2018","So, this was it, the culmination of a decade of Marvel movies preparing and leading up to this final showdown? Well, I could not be more disappointed.

Here is why:
Yes, the film brings together many different story lines. But it does so in pretty predictable ways. A few mildly funny scenes when the heroes of different movies meet for the first time. But that's it. That's about the only good thing I can say about the story.
Yes, CGI and FX are top notch. But as the story is pretty simple in itself until the end, that's not saving the day.
The story in deed is very lame and to a large extend either predictable or stupid. There are quite some inconsistencies such as humans breathing on Titan, Thor talking in space and such. Not the ingredients of a fantastic climax movie.
A few examples (Spoilers!!!):
Thanos kills almost all Asgardians, but Thor. Thor proves he can survive and even talk in outer space, survive the fire of a star. Wow, really? Lame.
Thanos is so powerful, you wonder why he hasn't collected all the stones a lot earlier. This now seems like a walk in the park, no real challenge. Anything dangerous coming, he could simply step through to another part of the universe, or he could use the Reality Stone and turn everything into soap bubbles. We he uses his powers only so scarcely? Well, otherwise the movie would be over in 10 minutes. All fights leave you wondering why Thanos is not using all his powers. Not convinving!
When the team on Titan has Thanos ""at sleep"", they don't even try to kill him, which, it seems, would have been the most reasonable thing to do. And then Peter Quill, just short of victory (removing the gauntlet), cannot stop talking and slapping him with his bare hands??? Seriously? Lame and stupid.
Wakanda, the nation with the most advanced technology, lines up foot soldiers for one to one combat against killer beasts? 18th century battle tactics in the 21st century? Seriously? Instead of using all the advanced technology (other than the shield) or even simple things such as machine guns or airplanes with bombs etc.? They are not even attacking the base ships where the beasts come from? Stupid, unconvincing and hence lame.
Vision, completely lame. Wasn't he a very powerful fighter in Civil War? Now, he seems to be just a simple robot with a lamp on his head.
Thanos loved Gamora - honestly??? Wow, why on earth should he? Really not convincing.
The Soul Stone was so evasive and couldn't be found for many millenia but then we simply fly to a planet closeby (suprise, suprise, we learn during the film that Gamora conveniently knows where the Soul Stone is (a hint which was obviously forgotten to be planted in an earlier movie)...) , meet your field guide Red Skull, then throw someone (you love) into the pit and that's it? Nobody could have done that before? Not convincving...
Red Skull, completely lame. Why was he even in the movie? No role to play other than saying this is where he went after vanishing in Captain America?
But worst of all, Dr. Strange, destined to protect the Time Stone at all cost, just hands it over then (never using it BTW)? Well, I assume this is not the end of the story but who wants to wait a year ot two for the sequel film just to find out why this really unconvincing and unmotivated surrender is really a grand victory?
And finally, the death of so many figures, just flaking into non-existence? That's what I call a complete and utterly disappointing anti-climax.


Never after a Marvel movie, reading ""Thanos will return"" on screen, did I think, ""Better not, good riddance, and I'm most definitely not waiting for it"". This is not a weekly serial where one could tolerate such a deep cliffhanger. And if it is not a cliffhanger, then what? All really dead? And from now on only prequels?

What a great disappointment. 2 hours of FX and CGI fights with a few funny scenes mixed in. That's all. No clever story anywhere in this movie, maybe later, but that's not the basis for a rating of this movie. So much opportunity for great story telling, so many cool and deep characters, and then this uncreative and unmotivated piece with this disappointing cliffhanger. Ok, granted, it is most certainly not the end of the story and all will be smart and clever in the sequel. Maybe, but this here right now is mostly lame and stupid and far behind the possibilities.","1"

"macakanobi","10/10 Awesome epic adventure from start to finish..!","29 April 2018","10/10 and this is why..! I've watched this film three times now so I can get a true picture of it and honestly I enjoyed it more, the more I watched it. To juggle a huge cast this size and make it work is an accomplishment, and boy is this an accomplishment.

Each character shines in their own way and the comedy is placed well, so not to take away the depth, the pain, the suffering and severity off this story arc. The SFX is some of the best ever seen in my opinion, yes there are some slight flaws here and there, but not enough to take your mind of the story on screen. Thanos looks amazing and for the true comic fans like myself Kevin Feige, the Russo brothers and the team at Marvel Studios have excelled in bringing the dark Titan from page to screen.

Josh Brolin is totally worthy of playing this nemesis and Brolin adds heart, pain, power and a sadness to this character, as always the Marvel team hits a home run with the casting. Every little detail is put into Thanos. For a purple giant he looks realistic, from an eyebrow movement or a cheek twitch to a full on capable gladiator in battle stance, he looks like a living, breathing being.

Where does this film stand against the rest of the MCU, well it's right up there in the top three. Some people might not like or even fully understand the ending, but the possibilities it sets up for the future of the MCU only leaves me with questions and excitement! This film has made some choices that surprised me as a comic collector and fan of 33 years, but I honestly thank them for that, the Russo brothers not only promised, but also delivered the film we've been awaiting.","7"

"kirbylee70-599-526179","THE WAR BEGINS","20 August 2018","I will admit to feeling a certain amount of joy the first time I watched THE AVENGERS: INFINITY WAR. Having just watched it a second time I can let those who felt the same that it holds just as much impact the second time around. No doubt it will on repeated viewings as well. It is that good of a movie.

If you've been a fan of the Marvel movies based on the comics from the same company then you'll already know what some may not, that every single movie released to date has led to this point in time, to this very film. Hints of things to come were dropped like breadcrumbs along the way with each becoming more revelatory the closer we got. If you haven't been watching them then by all means go back and start with the first, IRON MAN, before watching this. It's not that you won't enjoy it watching it on its own but you'll miss so much of what takes place. Warning there are a few spoilers in this review.

The film opens aboard a spaceship last seen in THOR: RAGNAROK which holds the remnants of Asgard. The evil plunderer of the Universe, Thanos (Josh Brolin), holds Thor (Chris Hemsworth) in his grasp and has beaten him in search of the second jewel he seeks, the Space Stone, having already found the first one, the Power Stone. Presented the stone by Thor's brother Loki (Tom Hiddleston) he kills Loki and heads out to find the next stone. Also on board is the Hulk who too is beaten by Thanos but who escapes with the help of Heimdall (Idris Elba).

Thanos has had a glove made specifically for his singular purpose, to collect all 6 of the Infinity Stones. With all of them combined (missing yet are the Time Stone, the Mind Stone, the Reality Stone and the Soul Stone) it will provide Thanos with the power to alter reality and time itself, to control all things. His goal is to eliminate half of the population of the universe with the intent of ""saving it"" from overpopulation as resources dwindle. In his twisted mind he is to be considered a hero rather than someone responsible for mass genocide.

Hulk, now in the form of Bruce Banner (Mark Ruffalo) crashes into the sanctum sanctorum of Dr. Strange (Benedict Cumberbatch) and warns him of the upcoming arrival of Thanos and his minions. No not THOSE minions. Strange contacts and returns with Tony Stark aka Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.) just as the evil doers arrive seeking the stone Strange possesses, the Time Stone. A nearby Spider-Man (Tom Holland) also swings in to help. Before Stark can reach out and contact Capt. America (Chris Evans) he, Spider-Man and Strange are onboard the spaceship heading towards Thanos.

Rather than continue with each story point I'll stop hear. And this so far only accounts for perhaps 30 minutes tops of this 2 hour and 29 minute masterpiece! With the exception of only 3 heroes already seen in the previous Marvel movies (Ant-Man and the Wasp which is explained in their own movie and Hawkeye) every single hero shows up to do battle in this one. Every Avenger, Black Panther, War Machine, the Winter Soldier and all the Guardians of the Galaxy are on hand to face off against Thanos. The question though is are they enough? Can they take down the most powerful being in the Universe? And if he gets all of the stones, will he be able to achieve his goal?

The answer is yes and no. When you get to the final moments of the film, a heart wrenching moment in heroic film history, the answer is still unknown. Yes know going in that the final answer is not on hand to be seen here. A second film is on the way and will no doubt pick up with the remains of this film. Not all of the heroes we've come to know and love will survive. None of those that remain will be left unscarred. And in a battle to save the known Universe all will lay their lives down on the line as a last defense to do so.

Our civilization has always used mythology to move us forward, to teach valuable lessons. They began with drawings on cave walls, altered to stories passed down verbally, reached the printed page, changed slightly to four color comics, moved to radio and then to the big screen. Movies have become the current medium in which mythology has decided to rest. The Marvel movies which began as comics and have since embraced movies are there to provide a way of continuing the tradition of teaching valuable lessons to those who witness them. Sacrifice, loyalty, heroism, love, failure all are on display in these films and this film combines all into a massive epic that has to be seen to be believed.

The end result of watching this film is not total sadness or joy but an anxious feeling, one in which the viewer wishes that the months were over between the viewing of this film and the next. Until that time this movie will be viewed repeatedly by fans who will wait for the next, ticket money in hand and hoping for the best for those heroes that they've come to love to be among those who will survive. This is the movie that has long been developing and it delivers on every single level expected of those who love movies.","10"
"holgerscholl","Really? This was the culmination of 10 years of Marvel movie story telling?","11 May 2018","Completely disappointing. A few mildly witty or funny scenes. The rest a sum of dumb and unwitty fights against an enemy who is already too strong at the beginning of the movie and only gets stronger during the film.

From first scene to last it is just bang, bang, crash, smash, bang! The story is very weak and there is zero character development. Maybe the characters were already fully developed over the previous 30+ movies and hence why so little attention given here.

I'm just not invested in the series and so don't find the Avengers movies to be much of a pay off, but get why others do. Personally, I found it to be an exhausting, unrewarding experience.

"mgruebel","Not Thantastic","30 December 2018","It seems that the Marvel films are slowly descending into loud action set pieces without very original or daring plots. AIW is a good example of this trend.

Villain Thanos (probably a shorthand for the Greek Thanatos = Death because Thanos is the bringer of death) wants to collect 5 jewels that will allow him to snuff out half the galaxy's population so the other half can live better. Supposedly he's better than Hitler because he targets casualties at random, rather than a specific group. With all the energy expended on this quest, one wonders why his plan A was not simply to provide more resources for the galaxy, so all of its inhabitants can live better lives!

He is opposed by the Avengers, Guardians of the Galaxy, etc. in a series of set pieces for each stone. The set pieces are OK little movies, but really nothing too inventive or exciting besides the usual action mayhem. Some of it is downright stupid, like the idea that opening your shield to let badass creatures in so they don't surround your shield is good war tactics; or Thanos' henchman deploying useless badass creatures in the first place when he has giant diggers to go underneath the shield anyway. And so on, and so forth.

In an effort to provide every Marvel character a few minutes of screen time, the writing is diffuse, the action generic and the whole thing too episodic. Now, if at least they were to stick with the ending (half the galaxy's population dead, Thanos wins, many Avengers turned to dust) there would be something tragic about the ""Hitler wins"" plot. But of course we all know they'll come back to life magically in the next installment, as hinted by Dr. Strange towards the end of the film. So therefore who cares if Gamora gets thrown to her Death. She'll be back soon enough.

It's a bit sad because Thanos is a pretty good villain as Marvel villains go, and he deserved a punchier, more coherent film.

Still, it's OK to watch once, and fans of the Marvel universe will of course find endless trivia in this movie, while those not familiar with MU will be slightly confused. It's a trend these days: theatrical releases becoming more like episodes in an old-fashioned 70s mini-series; and Netflix miniseries becoming better than theatrical releases. Ah well.","3"
"zombie84-1","what a lousy movie","31 May 2018","SPOILER: After carefully thinking about this movie its safe to say its garbage.

why is it garbage?

1. The ending is pathetic we know the heros will be back and we know it will all lead into the next movie why give us a cop out ending. Maybe it be nice if they keep the heros who vanish at the end dead. Also be nice if they do kill off all the heros at the end for good in the last movie so they can focus on the newer ones.

2. its cliche and bland. And quite boring. Dont get me wrong I loved every marvel movie expect this black panther and dr. strange. I like my movies to not be the same recycled crap.

3. we waited 10yrs for this?

4. Dr. Dickhead ruined everything.

5. Thanos was pretty meh.

6. Alot of stupid decisions.

7. God forbid you say this movie is shit everybody bugs out. Sorry that I can see through crap and you cant.

8. You better off paiding to see deadpool 2 way better then this crap.

9. hoping the last one be worth it and they can give us a good ending in which the villain wins for once","1"

It took them over 20 movies to get to their most defying antagonist and the wait was worth it. Josh Brolin's performance as Thanos truly stands out among a sea of Hollywood A-listers portraying characters that became iconic.

"greg-gillet","Before you spend your hard-earned cash...","8 May 2018","We occasionally use IMDB to judge whether a film is worth watching at our local Odeon. Generally, that works well but a score of 8.9 for this film (currently) is hugely misleading IMHO.

This is clearly a film that polarizes audiences - those who have bought into the Marvel franchise and have watched every previous film (31 apparently) mostly love it; those (like us) who have watched a few here and there seem to be disappointed / puzzled / bored.

For a non-fan there are a couple of major issues: Too many characters and too much back story that we can't remember or never knew. The fights seemed rather perfunctory and, I know it's the fashion these days, but the shortness of each shot (a second? half a second between cuts?) makes them impossible to follow.

One positive reviewer has criticised low scorers saying it's like watching the last 2 minutes of an hour-long drama and expecting to understand it. I think that's unfair. Surely a film should make sense in and of itself - I wasn't charged less to watch this one, so surely I should be able to enjoy it on some level? For the record, we recently went to see Thor: Ragnarok and Black Panther and enjoyed them both (particularly the last one).

Which I guess brings us back to where we started... redressing the balance of that crazy 8.9 score. No, this film is NOT better than Apocalypse Now (8.5) or The Terminator (8.0) or Citizen Kane (8.4) or Taxi Driver (8.3) or Raging Bull (8.2)... that's just crazy! My honest advice: If you like Marvel, you'll probably love this; if you're not a big fan, save your money for something else.","2"

"Random3","Good, but far from the best of the MCU films.","26 April 2018","***SPOILERS AT THE BOTTOM***

The good: -The film should be commended on managing to make a watchable film that brings together characters from the previous Avengers films, both Guardians films, Black Panther and Doctor Strange. It could have been a complete mess and thankfully it wasn't. -Thanos is possibly the best MCU villain so far, although I know that isn't saying much. He had clear motivations, conflicts, personality, you know, all the things that go into a good character. He wasn't generic bad guy #7. -As expected the film was pretty funny. Most of the jokes landed.

The bad: -Although the film wasn't a mess, there were a fair few characters that did almost literally nothing. Kinda understandable when you have 35 or so characters but even so, it is still a negative. -There was no single clear driving force in terms of plot. Instead we had three different groups of characters doing their own thing, and occasionally meet one of the other groups. -Tonally it was kinda like watching two films at once, largely due to the integration of the Guardians characters with the Avengers. -This film features a faceless CGI army for the heroes to dismember.

***SPOILERS BELOW*** SPOILER: And my biggest problem with this film is the ending. Throughout the film there are three characters (should have been four!!) that die and it is very clear that they are actually dead and Marvel isn't going to bring them back. They die for a reason. At the end of the film however, probably half the characters from the entire film die. So the way I see it is that one of two things happened, and one is infinitely more likely than the other.

Either a) Marvel legit killed off 15 of its characters in one scene or b) they wanted the audience to think they did so they could have a cheap cliffhanger. The problem is that if option A is correct, everyone is going to be thinking they actually went for option B! The way the scene is played is very straight, very emotional, loud music + slow motion etc so they are very clearly trying to make you care. But the problem is, regardless of whether these characters are going to remain dead, I spent the whole scene thinking that they would almost certainly all come back via Time Stone magic in the next film.

Had they killed off maybe two or three primary characters then it would have been believable but you can't kill off half your franchise in a universe where the Time Stone exists and expect me to care.

So overall, a mixed bag but generally positive. 6/10.","1"

It is a delight to see the crossover of Guardians of the Galaxy and Avengers meet to battle the veiled villain of the last decade in the Marvel Universe. But IMO: Thanos is not the greatest villain in the Marvel Universe. His motivation is not that awesome - and in a way - by making the universe hang in the balance the film raised the stakes so high it was difficult to really care or believe. There is no real drama at the end because like any comic book...the character's will return. However - the fights are great fun. So - like any great crossover...it was big and loud but not as good as a single edition adventure.","9"
"namob-43673","McGuffin War is entertaining, but lack in script and explanation","16 March 2019","After telling people that I didn't really like this movie and, of course, getting attacked by every fanboy in the MCU I felt it necessary to put down a proper review.

Let me start with the good so you know that I did not hate this movie. I actually enjoyed it. Infinity War is one of the most entertaining movies ever made. The entertainment value comes to fighting is great, a couple of superhero saves that are utterly amazing, acting very solid, music great, visuals mostly fantastic, and the villain is mostly great too. If you look at infinity war as a prelude to the end of the first big story-line of the MCU and if you look at it from a pure entertainment point of view this is by no means a bad movie, it is, from that perspective, darn good.

Above sound like I loved this movie, right? So why didn't I?

Because this movie has a few very, very big flaws, and it introduces a few concept and a bunch of additional McGuffins in a very hamfisted way and I do not think it completely nailed the landing.

Let me elaborate.

Let's start with Iron Man. So Tony, suddenly, and completely out of the blue, introduces his new Nano-tech suit. Where did that come from? When was that developed? Why never mention before? This tech is so immensely impressive that Iron Man go from being a strong hero to almost invincible. If it wasn't for fighting Thanos with the Gauntlet, Iron Man would win almost any fight against almost any opponent now. Sure it looks pretty cool and the Russo brothers make the best of it in the movie, but... what!? It actually pissed me off. Marvel has been very good at building up these things over time, over full movies, but here the nano-tech is just thrown in there because it looks cool. That is the only reason it is there, to make the visuals and the fight look cooler.

Next up we have Vision and Scarlet Witch that, apparently, and also very suddenly, a couple and are sharing a bed together in some hotel room in Scotland. Now this was not completely out of the blue since it was sort of hinted at in both Civil War and Ultron, but them apparently sleeping together and being a couple in love!? What? I know they were/are a couple in the comics and if I remember correctly even have children together, so perhaps I should not be too surprised and upset over this development, but it makes no sense and it feels so rushed. In the context of the movie universe this is lazy writing, bad character development, and very forced upon us as viewers. Of course Captain America does a great save in a very nice entertaining way so I sort of forgot about this story hole upon first viewing, but it is not good writing. Not at all.

Then we have Thor who, apparently, IS the God of Hammers. AND he gets an eye 25min into the movie, so that entire Ragnarök story in regards to Thor's character development is thrown out the window. Sidetrack: I actually hate Ragnarök, I think it is, by far, the worst movie of the MCU. I think it is worse than Howard the Duck, worse than that awful Daredevil movie and worse then Elektra. Ragnarök is the only MCU movie in par with (some) DCEU movies, that is how putrefied it is. However the only redeeming trait of Ragnarök was the decent okayish character development of Thor that sort of work. But a few moments into Infinity War all of that is basically gone. He has an eye, and suddenly, after withstanding the blast of a star (haha..) he also have a new shiny ax. Then he summons the bifrost and with no knowledge about anything going on nor knowing where Wakanda is he poffs in there to save the day. That scene is absolutely fantastic, one of the best hero arrival ever and it is brilliantly entertaining, but it make no sense whatsoever. Again lazy writing or bad directing.

I could go on pointing out so many other things like Red Skull showing up with no explanation, Gamora suddenly having half her planet alive (it was said before she was the last of her kind), StarLord flipping out (sort of understandable, but still...) and many other things in the movie that either demands background story or more explanation - stories and explanations we never get.

What it all comes down to is either lazy writing or bad directing, probably a combo. The Russo´s have made very good movies before this. Civil War was very entertaining (and better than this movie) and Winter Soldier is as close to a masterpiece a superhero movie can get, but here they fail on several points. If it was just one character or one of the things I mention above (there are many more of these holes are missing pieces in the movie - take too long to list them all) it could be forgiven, but there are so many of them. I keep getting the feeling that they wanted to make a super-entertaining movie and a part One out of Two to end this saga, and they did so with little consideration for good writing. Why not an exposition dump? A narration or two? Why not ignore one of the fights and slow down and explain things? No! We need entertainment! Boff! Poff! Blam! Isn't this fun!?

Now I come to my final, and most significant objection to this movie, and also most likely the most unpopular opinion of this review. The villain, Thanos, I wrote above that; ""the villain is mostly great too"", but he is also completely weird and a really bad villain. Kill half the universe? Why? Never explained other than in his; ""I am a green party member and I want to kill folk because we use too many resources"" which is stupid beyond belief. How about double the number of planets? How about giving everyone a Star Trek replicator? How about clean energy? I hope his motivation is explained in Endgame, but if not he is just nuts, bonkers, crazy. In the comics his motivation was much, much more relevant and understandable, and that was crazy. And people complain that Captain Marvel is political? Really? This is the environment movement´s wet dream, nothing else.

To summerize; this should be called McGuffin War because they fight over McGuffins with their own McGuffins and we get introduced to new McGuffins, out of nowhere, to counteract other McGuffins. And when Thanos finally collect all of his McGuffins he kills half the universe because we drive too many cars... It is lazy writing, and bad storytelling. Sure it looks great, and all those explosions are nice, and oh boy all those McGuffins are fun and entertaining, but does that make a great movie? Is this really fantastic?

No.

To me this movie belongs in the mid- to low range of the MCU. There is a reason why Iron Man, Winter Soldier, and now also Captain Marvel, are the best movies of this franchise; because they are character driven stories. Sure those also have faults, and are perhaps not as entertaining as McGuffin War, but they are better movies because we get exposition, explanations, and we get to follow the characters in a logical well executed way. McGuffin war is just 2hrs and 30min of high-speed entertainment. It is almost like a Transformers movie, only better acted.

And that is why I give this movie a 6/10.

If Endgame do not explain some of the things I mention above I am most likely not going to like that movie either. BUT if it does, this movie probably need to be seen in a different light and I might need to up the score, but as of now it does not deserve a higher score.

Edit: Since Endgame was horrible trash and explained absolutely nothing of McGuffin War it made also this movie worse. Endgame sucked so hard it was almost Justice League bad, and although McGuffin War was not as bad I have to reduce the score to 3/10. The Russo brothers should be banned from cinema for all time.","5"

"kosmasp","Come together ... right now","5 August 2018","Well the movie we've been waiting for ... years! It's finally here and it doesn't dissapoint at all. You may nitpick and there are things to critisize as with all movies, but as a Universe Marvel did a fantastic job, setting characters up and giving us something to look for. So even the smallest things can make you chuckle (if you are like me and into that sort of stuff), like Groot and Captain America introducing themselves to each other. It's a character moment, but it's also as funny as it can be. And it is grounded into what we know about them and their attitude.

So even when you have all that mayhem and all that fights going on, there is always time for other things. Quirky things, intelligent things and not just necessarily just social commentary (see Black Panther), but also dialog like the ""made up words"" argument (very fine moment indeed). And again, I'm just giving you some simple moments, that really define how well thought out this all is. Not afraid to be self deprecating at times either.

If you are able to avoid spoilers, please do and watch this to be surprised, to laugh, maybe even cry a little bit, but more important of all be entertained! I guess having to watch a few movies before this may seem like a chore for some, but once you start them and are not too negative about it, you will enjoy them ... just watched Ant Man and the Wasp and that was a hoot/blast too. But now I have to wait until next year ... for Captain Marvel and the ""conclusion"" of this ... I have some ideas where it might go ... By the way there is ""only"" one scene after the movie is over and it's after the credits ... sometimes you have to have room to breathe, so right decision!","1"
"agmoldham","This isn't going to be popular!","1 May 2018","As ever with movies, avoided all the hype before seeing Avengers Infinity War. Was rather surprised to see this scoring a 9 on imdb, so guessing my rating isn't going to be popular. I should probably say from the outset that I've never been a super fan of the super hero movies.

The plot to Infinity War is pretty much the plot to most super hero movies. The plot is overlooked in favour of lots of action sequences. Personally I don't find much empathy with any of the characters. With so many of the marvel characters on show it's hard not to wonder whether the screen time is being split evenly between the big names. Talking of which I also found myself wondering whether the Black Panther got more screen time in editing after the success of the recent movie.

There's no doubting that some of the visuals are dazzling. The jokes wear a bit thin after a while. If you love action movies and/or the marvel universe you will adore this film. It seems that many people who aren't must also love this film, so maybe it's just me that doesn't get it!","8"
"oldy71","Visually magnificent, technically state-of-the-art, dumber than a box of hammers","1 May 2018","Oh man...

I was so looking forward to seeing this movie, and so bitterly disappointed when it was done. It might not be the dumbest story I've ever been subjected to, but it sure tried hard.

First off, the CGI was magnificent. Most of the cast weren't actually there when they filmed this, and yet you believe. It all looks so real, and when you have a scene with CGI Kroot, CGI Rocket and a CGI background, and everyone looks real and has emotions, it's staggering. Absolutely hands-down the best movie I've ever seen in this regard.

Now let's talk about that story. Spoilers from hereon in.

Hey, how about that scene where Wong cuts off Cull Obsidian's left forearm with a portal? Hey, what about Cull Obsidian tearing off the left forearm of the Hulkbuster suit? How about that scene where Groot cuts off his own left forearm to form the handle of Stormbreaker?

Are we seeing a pattern here? What to do about a bad guy who wears the ultimate weapon on his left forearm? Ooooh, I wonder. And Thor with that spanky new AXE and all...

Not to mention the master of the time stone choosing not to use it at any time in the movie to make it all better. Yeah, yeah, yeah, halfway through he looks into the future and sees only one way to win (assertion with no evidence) but he doesn't even try earlier?

Dumb. Disappointingly dumb.

Fantastic dialogue throughout. Clever moves from Thanos's guys in Wakanda, and some amazing fight scenes. But that story...

And the second Black Panther (with another movie in the works), Spider-Man (with another movie in the works) and the Guardians (say it with me) start to wink out, you KNOW it isn't going to stick. And Part 2 will involve some form of travelling back in time to undo it all. Good grief.","4"
"A_Llama_Drama","A Massive, Glorious Spectacle, but wondrously incomplete","29 April 2018","It's finally here. He's finally here. As the Hulk crashes back to Earth, and Bruce Banner returns, he gasps ,""Thanos is coming.""

Back in 2010, Scream 4 was announced (Scream is my favourite horror movie), and I spent every day hungrily watching trailers and spots over and over, trying to figure out what was gonna happen. 7 years later, Infinity War released its first teaser and I had the same sense of excitement that came with the knowledge of a new Scream film. Finally, all the characters and stories would be coming together in one almighty show down of good vs evil. But just like the false starts in Scream 4, and the false endings, I was not ready for this. I don't think anyone can be.

The action begins where Ragnarok left off; Thanos has discovered the refugee Asgardians and attacks them, hoping to get the Tesseract. Thanos is not playing around. The scene is barely over before New York is under attack again and that feeling of finality hurtling toward you doesn't let up until the credits roll.

Marvel definitely took a gamble and I think it paid off. I'm amazed at the negative reviews I'm reading because it truly informs how spoiled we are that this movie received anything less than critical acclaim. It is bombastic and filled with characters that over 10 years have developed, the acting is stellar, the various tones of the different directors over the past 19 movies seeps into every detail from the colourful and playful Guardians, Thor's off beat humour, Iron Man's cripplingly humane sense of responsibility, Spiderman's youthful and exuberant laissez faire, Captain America's seriousness and Dr. Strange's mystical mind melting graphics. It's all here. Not to mention the sheer ecstasy of the return to Wakanda. Black Panther may have just come out but there's no denying the impact T'Challa and company have had on the Marvel universe.

What's more, these characters are so fleshed out and clearly defined that to see them work in tandem, and there are some surprising team ups, is just cinematic joy at a different level than I've ever experienced. Somehow, within all of this, there is even time to deliver character development and true pathos to characters such as Thor (whose story, on reflection, truly is devastating, even if he is a God), Gamora (Zoe Saldana deserves massive credit for delivering some great work against what I can only assume is a man covered in green screen during filming) and Groot, who has so little to do, and yet so much to do with the story.

The movie, however, belongs to Thanos. He is present in every scene. Even if not physically, his presence is felt as the Avengers and Guardians do everything they can to prevent his goal of gaining all the stones. In all honesty, the movie should have been called ""Thanos."" If Ms. Mojo was naming it, it would be ""Top 10 Avenger Fails.""

But, there are problems. Big ones, actually. First of all, if you have not seen many (and I mean many, not just a few) of the Marvel films, you may really struggle to join the ride. There is a lot of story involved and even though there is a small bit of exposition at the beginning, every scene is crammed with different characters with motivations that without context will feel alienating to many. Many characters are sidelined and it's hard not to believe that they are given lines just to remind us they're there. If you're a fan of Black Widow, Bucky or Shuri, check your expectations at the ticket booth. Further, it reveals itself to be a first part in a two parter towards the end which ultimately delivers a fatalistic and very depressing note. When ""Empire Strikes Back"" ended, it was on a message of hope. When ""Infinity War"" finishes, you know there's a sequel planned but that doesn't mean the writers should be let off the hook for how they end the first part.

Still, this is an amazing accomplishment and deserves to be seen at the cinema.","10"

-Thanos (Josh Brolin) is definitely the main focus of the film, and arguably the main character. Thor (Chris Hemsworth) and Gamora (Zoe Saldana) also have big roles in this as well.

Paul Bettany as Vision is the first Marvel superhero and arguably first movie character to die twice...two deaths..in two minutes! (Vision begs Wanda to kill him to prevent Thanos from getting the mind stone, but then Thanos uses to time stone to reverse hos death. Thanos rips the mind stone out of his head causing him to die Again)

"orcsvssalt","NOTHINGS CHANGED (REVIEW FOR ALL MARVEL FANS)","25 October 2018","This review represents more than just infinity wars. This review applies to every marvel movie ever made.

Why I hate marvel movies Marvel represents everything wrong with movies from this generation .The marvel universe started off strong in 1944 with captain America which for the time was incredible. Than they started making movies that were aimed at adults such as the Blade trilogy and of cause the punisher which might I add I actually enjoyed. But than the sequels began to this day in 2018 marvel have filmed over 80 movies with an average of 9 movies every 2 years. If this doesn't show marvels true intentions than I don't know what will. Marvel is the most soulless repetitive money motivated film company of all time at this point you are literally paying for the same movie with a different repetitive costume 80 times 5 times a year. let's say you pay $10 for a ticket for every hardcore fan they have wasted $800 of there money times that by about 20 million fans you got $1600000000 going to a terrible franchise that just keeps ripping people off over and over. Than using money and theatre time that could be going to actual good movies. For example Quentin Tarantino's the hateful 8 was postponed for a later released because non other than marvel desided that they wanted to release there film a few weeks earlier. If movies watchers keep supporting these high budget plotless pointless repetitive garbage movies that keep Dwayne Johnson and marvel in business in a few years there won't be any good movies being made. Than we will all be thinking back to the 90s and mid 2000s when movies weren't money making trash and actually had plots and were more than a few good action sequences wondering what happened. The fact that avengers infinity wars is 49th place on the top 250 is disgusting and shows how close we are to the good movie irreversible apocalypse. There are a few good directors left and unfortunately they are getting old and only release 1 movie per few years such as Quentin Tarantino Martin Scorsese and Steven Spielberg. But lucky for us it's not to late just stop buying tickets and merchandise for marvel DC and any pointless action or dumb Adam sandler or Amy Schumer comedy and we might be able to save this planet from the great film Death.","7"

"thom-mac","Blows, but not your mind","30 September 2018","This movie is so boring I had to watch it in installments. Some folks say it blows your mind but I just think it blows. I probably over-rated it as a 4 but mostly because of the special effects. Weak plot, too much jumping around, WAY too long. Even the battle scenes drug on much too long. Thinning the herd may have been the best end solution for the movie. Too bad it didn't happen in the first 30-45 minutes. I was ready to dissolve into ashes by the time the credits were ready to roll. I think the people that loved this movie beyond compare are the same folks that would wait in line for 2-3 days for the release of the new iPhone.","10"
"CynicAce","worth the hype, a brilliant film","25 April 2018","Infinity War was brilliant, and don't worry even though it has more than 50 characters they all get their moments it was so much fun watching them fight all together

and even though the title says Avengers, it's clearly a THANOS movie, and probably the best character in this film and has the most screen time, and Josh Brolin did an amazing job on portraying Thanos.

The character development is great, except for the children of Thanos which disappoint me a little bit cause they didnt have that much development and screentime but that was expected since there's a lot of characters in this film.

CGI was great! it almost feel like it was real.

there are some scenes that feels like there's too much going on, and like moving to different scenes or places but overall the action sequences were amazing and even the movie is just 2 and half hours, it didnt feel like it was.

the movie is just so brilliant and emotional, 10 years of hard work. it paid off. the ending was definitely shocking, it'll leave you speechless

and the post credit scene will make you so much more excited in the future film of mcu","10"

There is no time to get bored, it is action from beginning to end without fillers or moments when you would like to get over how they are in many Marvel movies. It's a visual show with all the characters I've grown up with for so many years. I could sit and write an entire novel, but where would the point be? Just look at this masterpiece for you!","2"
"Stefan_Loves_Movies","#Movie Review","15 August 2021","Avengers: Infinity War (2018) is one of the most ambitious movies made by Marvel so far. As time passes, the number of movies increases. Likewise, the number of heroes is also increasing, thus it gets significantly more difficult to create a plot involving everyone without it becoming a mess. The Russo brothers surprisingly manage to pull this off with a coherent, well-structured plot. I enjoyed the beginning-ending relation and the fact that everything that's happening on the screen has a meaning that you'll later understand as the story unfolds.

As much as I enjoyed Avengers: Infinity War (2018), the movie isn't perfect. Even though the Russo brothers have done a fantastic job, there'll always be repercussions when it comes to a story involving plenty of characters. The focus gets quite blurry since the movie has to jump back and forth to give everybody a chance to shine.

Nevertheless, this movie was a BLAST!","9"
"chi_town_fed","Lot of potential. Only thing missing is a 1980s sitcom laugh track for the poor writing.","25 July 2018","Writers, producers, and directors simply suck today. They mask their massive incompetence with a plethora of special effects. It is hard to ruin a movie filled with characters who all bring a massive, built-in audience. Yet they managed to do so.

They turned the Hulk into a joke. The Hulk!!! One of the most beloved and sympathetic characters in Marvel. I was waiting for the Hulk to have round two. It never came. Moreover, I don't understand how so soon after Thor's people are mass murdered right in front of him, he starts cracking jokes within minutes of being rescued by the GG. Why do writers today feel the need to turn dramatic scenes into a Friends sitcom? The only thing missing from this movie was a laugh track.

I fail to see the comedy in an all powerful being brutally mass murdering from credits to credits. This could have been a powerful and more dramatic film. Yet writers never fail to inject jokes at the most inappropriate times, which distracts from the movie. Thor cracking one-liners right after what was left of the Asgard race has been annihilated made absolutely no sense to me. Portraying the Hulk as Abbot and Costello throughout the entire film also makes no sense.

Another irksome thread in this film was the weakness of the Vision. Vision is as powerful as they come yet they basically made him a symbol for First Alert ""I've fallen and I can't get up"" from credits to credits. In the comic books Vision is no joke. In this film, he is the weakest Avenger of them all. In my opinion today's society prefers to portray women as powerful, and men as weak buffoons. I have no problem with a powerful woman. I do have a problem with the weakening of men in the process. Both can be and should be powerful.

Additionally, this movie is all over the place and never brings the Avengers together as one cohesive team. They are basically scattered across the cosmos each small group doing their own thing completely oblivious to what is going on with the other members.

Its similar to how they ruined the Transformers over time. How do you manage to ruin a franchise that has a built-in audience? Unlike most other movies the audience for the Avengers and the Transformers existed for years, if not decades before the movies were made. How do you blow it? Simple, try to squeeze three movies into one by jumping around all over the place. Also, toss in an abundance of jokes that only serve to ruin dramatic scenes because you think the audience needs to laugh every five minutes.

If all you care about is death, destruction, special effects, and jokes you will love this movie. I rank this ridiculous film up there with Freddy versus Jason. If you seek a thrilling story filled with heart ache, triumph, and characters that really draw you in, this movie sucks. I gave it some stars due to my love of Marvel.

I am glad I waited to rent this movie or I'd really be upset.","10"
"yettygutschow","Not as good as it could have been...","8 April 2022","A good movie overall...but there's a few things that I just can't get over. First, the whole theory that this mighty Titan is going to reek havoc all over the galaxy so he can ""reduce the population by 50%""...really??? All of that effort expended JUST TO DO THAT??? Well, mourn losses and have babies. So stupid it can't be overlooked. Another, Quill is NOT that stupid...to risk (50% of the pop of the galaxy). The action scenes make up for the plot stupidity...but you can't have a great movie with such silly plot holes.","10"
"neoanderson12","Some Heroes are stripped of their powers just for plot convience.","6 August 2018","Bruce Banner cannot be the the Hulk during the whole movie.

Vision is pretty much useless and just a liability through out the whole movie.

Doctor Strange could have amputated the gauntlet off of Thanos' hand like he did one of his goons earlier in the film.

Doctor Strange could have briefed the Avengers on what they needed to do in order to beat Thanos that one time.

The biggest and most annoying plot hole in infinity war is that Dr Strange, who can open dimensional portals to any location, didn't just open some portals and bring every hero all together on Titan to fight Thanos.","10"
"randy_orton_fan","It's Fun If You Turn Off Your Brain","26 April 2018","Avengers: Infinity War is the culmination of everything the MCU has shown us since the first Iron Man. And it's a massive disappointment. The movie boasts more characters in a single comic movie than ever before, and that's where one of the biggest problems comes in. There are too many characters and it causes pacing issues, where they ramp through exposition as fast as possible to move on. Some characters barely do anything and are just there because they are supposed to be.

Thanos is an okay villain. Not ""Vader X 10"" like they told us. But it's not hard to be a better villain than we've seen before when the MCU has had lame villains for 10 years.

There are multiple character deaths in the movies. But the ""Emotion"" and ""Drama"" of seeing them die is artificial, since you know they aren't leaving these characters dead and their deaths will be retconned in Part 4 next year. Some of the characters who ""Die"" have movies on the release slate for the next few years, so Feige and the Russo Bros. promising the deaths would be permanent is a lie since we know that

*SPOILER ALERT*

Spider-man, Black Panther, Gamora, Bucky, Groot, Mantis, Drax, Black Panther, War Machine, and Falcon aren't going to stay dead.

The jokes are cringey as usual and it causes an inconsistent tone. They don't know what they want the movie to be. A comedy? A serious movie?

There is so much action in this movie, and it exposes the hypocrisy of critics. After years of hearing them whine about too much action in some of the DC movies the final 45 minutes to an hour of Infinity War is pretty much all action, which the positive reviews show they suddenly have no issues with.

The movie was a disappointment. And people attack DC movies while giving movies like this a pass. It's stupid. Justice League was a mess but let's be honest with ourselves. WB let Joss Whedon butcher that movie because they wanted to pander to the critics who love brainless quipfests like what the MCU puts out on a regular basis. We never got to see the real version of Justice League. So my question is, why are DC movies fair game but we're supposed to just pretend garbage like Infinity War are masterpieces?

The MCU is exhausted. They are out of ideas so this movie became a cheap gimmick to try to prove that it's not just basic parodies and they are desperate to prove how ""deep"" they can be and how much ""risk"" they're willing to take. But how much risk is there in doing things that you know will be undone in the very next movie? It renders the entire movie pointless when you know that it's just a set-up for the finale instead of standing on it's own.

The CGI was pretty subpar in some scenes. Showing off mid-2000s level CGI in some areas, which is just sad in a movie released in 2018. Say what you will about the effects in Justice League, but that movie underwent unnecessary reshoots and that caused the effects to not be as polished in some scenes. So what is Marvel's excuse for this, especially as massive as the budget for this movie was?

Some of the action was really good, but overall the movie was like when you go to a restaurant and you just happen to get the food that's dry and has been sitting out for a bit. It's okay but you walk out regretting spending the money on something that you know could have been more but the people who worked on it knew they didn't really have to try to still make money off you.

Had it's moments, but ultimately a let down. 3/10","10"

"ryanmeldrum11","Don't Listen To These liars! This is movie of the year contender!","22 May 2018","DO NOT LISTEN TO THESE PEOPLE! This is an amazing movie! One of the best openings in the MCU! People keep saying there is no story to this movie in which case they are incredibly stupid as this movie follows the story of the infinity gauntlet comics from the 1990's where Thanos takes all the infinity stones from the Avengers heroes and eliminates half of all life in the universe which is exactly happens in this movie as it is a part 1 of 2 story! This is the defeat and part 2 is the victory that's how this is set up so don't go into this movie expecting anything like character development or a more fleshed out world just expect WAR! A massive fight across worlds where our heroes try to stop Thanos and fail. In my own personal opinion this is a masterpiece for 3 reasons 1.) all these characters combining into 1 big massive team is done incredibly well (2.) we have seen easily the greatest marvel movie villain ever for the first time in action and finally (3.) this is easily the most fun and emotional Experience I've had with a marvel movie since the first Avengers movie!

I like this movie and it's a complete entertainment package... Infinity War does a brilliant job by seamlessly combining the last few films together. It picks up where Ragnarok left off on the space shuttle with Thor, Loki, Hulk and all the remaining Asgardians. It opens with a distress call as Thanos and his Dark Order have slaughtered most of passengers including some of the remaining Asgardians... This movie will sit you on the edge of your seat for 2 and a half hours. Hats off to the writers, directors, producers, and Marvel Studios...","9"

"jcareccia-90248","Ok, fellow fans. Here we are.","3 November 2021","After 10 years of buildup and hype surrounding every movie that came out, We are finally here. The big showdown we've been waiting for since 2008. I, unfortunately, didn't get to see this in the theaters, but I got it the day it came out on Blu-Ray and watched it with some friends and fellow fans of the MCU. And.... Wow. In a good way. This knocked my socks off. This wasn't Joss Whedon like the first two (I might be wrong), but this was just as visually stunning and had the same effect. The end was a punch to the gut. A hard one. Anyway, the beginning was unlike any Marvel movie I'd ever seen. Thanos torturing Thor and killing Loki made lots of sense, since they had just seen Thanos's ship at the end of Thor: Ragnarok, and it was brutal to watch, and really made you hate Thanos right from the start.

The middle was just as good, with some lighthearted moments like the Guardians' entrance (my personal favorite after Thor's to Wakanda) and some funny scenes with the Guardians (""Are you mocking me?"") and the action scenes in New York with some banter involved with Spiderman. The part where Thor forges Stormbreaker was one of the most epic scenes in the whole MCU, and we finally got to see Groot do something other than play his game, which was needed.

Thor's entrance to Wakanda, though... It's indescribable. I got chills then and I get chills just thinking of it now. Remember, the other Avengers (Cap, Black Widow, etc.) hadn't seen him in 2+ years, and he looked AWESOME (as always).

Thanos, the villain, is my second favorite after Killmonger (Black Panther). He thought he was doing the right thing by trying to wipe out half the universe, and as much as we hated him, we sympathized with him. He was a great villain with really realistic motives, and the CGI, OH, MAN. Was it stunning. Every scene felt realistic, and I felt the power in every move and every blast that a character took. None of it felt fake

Overall!!","2"

The emphasis is different to previous films, making Thanos the main character of this darker movie. The cast is excellent as always and really nails the drastically changing emotions in this film. Overall, people can say that this movie is better than Endgame. For my part, I think the double-header of Infinity War and Endgame makes it fantastic, surprising and inspiring story.","10"
"rdenisw","Infinity War? No, infinitely disappointing. Don't waste your time!","6 August 2018","When I started watching this seemingly endless drag of a movie, I was expecting some of the magic that this franchise has had in the past. It wasn't to be. Instead, we got familiar character after familiar character, each doing their characteristic throw-away joke.

No drama was involved; at no time did I ever think any of the far-too-many stars that were involved were in any danger, or that anything bad could happen; it was all slight-of-hand, all CGI trickery that looks impressive when there's just a bit of it. Here were great heaping glops of it. Acting? None that I could discern, it was all throw-away lines from throw-away characters. These cardboard characters looked better on the cardboard box!

At first I thought of giving this piece of garbage a score of 2/10; but really, this movie is so very bad, and so damaging to the franchise, that a 1/10 is well deserved. It would be lower if I could make it so. This is a throw-away movie.

Very young children and the extremely easily impressed by green-screen effects may like this film, but don't look for a plot or story; it's got lots of familiar faces though. It would have done so much better if it had a decent script-writer! Alas, that was not deemed necessary.","8"
"kervindonngo","The Avengers Movie With A Tragic End","12 September 2023","Avengers Infinity War has a powerful story in this Movie. It is funny, climatic and sad too as well. It has a lot of humor and a lot of fight scenes to see. Thanos is really one of the most interesting villains in the movie because of his personality and power. The saddest part of the movie is that when Thanos snaps his fingers he disintegrates half of the universe and some of the superheroes even my favorite Marvel superhero Spider-Man.

The movie that I absolutely watched and remembered that people in the world wanted to know what is next and when a is the next Avengers Endgame

"Hellmant","It's better than 'JUSTIC LEAGUE' at least.","27 April 2018","'AVENGERS: INFINITY WAR': Four Stars (Out of Five)

The third installment (not counting 'CAPTAIN AMERICA: CIVIL WAR') in the blockbuster superhero franchise, based on the Marvel Comics' characters. This one has the Avengers teaming up with the Guardians of the Galaxy, to stop Thanos from collecting all of the Infinity Stones so he can bend reality to his will. The movie was directed by Anthony and Joe Russo (who also both co-directed 'CAPTAIN AMERICA: WINTER SOLDIER' and 'CAPTAIN AMERICA: CIVIL WAR'), and it was scripted by Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely (who also both co-wrote all of the 'CAPTAIN AMERICA' movies). It stars Robert Downey Jr., Chris Evans, Chris Hemsworth, Chris Pratt, Chadwick Boseman, Tom Holland, Benedict Cumberbatch, Mark Ruffalo, Zoe Saldana, Dave Bautista, Scarlett Johansson, Paul Bettany, Elizabeth Olsen, Don Cheadle, Anthony Mackie, Sebastian Stan and the voices of Josh Brolin, Bradley Cooper and Vin Diesel. It's received mostly positive reviews from critics, and it's expected to break all kinds of records at the Box Office of course. The movie is a pretty epic action flick, but it's a little light on actual character development and meaningful story.

The story begins two years after the end of 'CAPTAIN AMERICA: CIVIL WAR', and the Avengers are still not on speaking terms. Thanos (Brolin) has come to earth to collect the last of the Infinity Stones, which will allow him to form a gauntlet that can bend reality to his will. Hulk (Ruffalo) has arrived just before him, to warn Tony (Downey Jr.) about his plans. At the same time Thor (Hemsworth) meets the Guardians of the Galaxy, in space, and the Avengers must later team-up with them in order to stop Thanos, and save the universe.

The film definitely has a great epic feel to it, and look, and the action scenes are spectacular. There's way too many characters in the movie though, and each one has their own little story; which when added all together makes the whole film feel kind of pointless and empty. I'm sure nerd comic book lovers will still love it, and on a purely superficial/technical level it's quite a film-going experience. In the end though, it's all style over substance, and it's kind of like movie junk food with no real value. It is better than 'JUSTIC LEAGUE' at least though.","10"

"Behnam-A","The Best of Marvel","19 June 2020","Avengers Infinity War is the best movie in marvel universe by far. In fact it is the only one with very decent plot development and minimum holes within. This movie unlike other superhero movies have actually well done in the story telling and putting the pieces of the story together. Beside holding you on the edge of the seat the whole time, you ask yourself the ""How"" and ""Why"" logic-killing questions much much fewer times in compare to most other similar films. Also, the funny scenes and especially the emotional scenes are very interesting and are not only for killing the time and stretching the movie. Although, in order to fully understand the characters and relations you must be familiar to Marvel's universe, It is not necessary and you can still enjoy this one even if you haven't watched anything in Marvel universe before. This movie truly deserve the attention that it got and absolutely worth your time.

Many superheroes dying is just one of the gimmicks. Look at the ones dying. They're all not part of the first avengers movie. Spiderman? We know they've planned a sequel. Black Panther? Sequel is planned. Doctor Strange? Sequel is planned. MCU is going to come up with some or the other reason to resurrect all these heroes. They should have killed some of the original heroes if they had the guts.

Coming to the plot. What plot? It's just Thanos trying to get all those stones. But at the same time, Thanos was one strong character. The only one whom we would remember after the movie. Also, the CGI was great. Fights were just ok.

Other gimmicks include Thor getting a new Hammer. Or was it an axe? I don't know. Then Iron Man with a new suit which is just bland and nothing actually new.

And, what happened to Hawkeye? They weren't able to get Jeremy Renner for the shooting?

"Dolchi","First movie I saw in the theater that busy year and totally worth it!!","9 June 2022","There is a lot spoken about this film. My take is ""just go and watch it!"". Granted, this film is a very standard superhero affair. Yet, the VFX is ground-breaking and the story is engaging enough for us to care till the climax.

The array of different characters never cease to amuse us. Rather than trying to wow us with different performers and superpowers, the film has a genuine role for each characters which appear.

In terms of empowerment as well, this film scores very well. The minority characters come up with intelligent ideas scientifically in a scene which is well done and does not cloy us into dismissal.

The action is fantastic and is backed with compelling reasons for all the fighting. Overall, this is a fun-filled movie which will satisfy a big number of audience.","4"
"tareqzaghal","MCU's Magnum Opus","3 September 2023","10 years in the making and 18 films building up to the moment that would define the Infinity Saga's legacy for decades to come. I distinctly remember the lead up to this film, a crucial moment in blockbuster filmmaking. It's an accumulation of a decade's worth of comic book storytelling through film, a genre that has become divisive in recent years to say the least, but you get what you come for here, and that's what matters.

For anyone that grew up on comic books, you are certainly familiar with how large-scale crossover events always came to be, and having that feeling replicated on the big screen is something any fan will always cherish. There was a lot that this film had to accomplish, too many to list in fact, but perhaps the most vital was crafting a villain as memorable as Thanos the Mad Titan. If Thanos fails, then the whole film does as well. Yet, thanks to one of the strongest comic book film scripts and a timeless performance by Josh Brolin, as well as some of the most incredible computer-generated character design, Thanos is cemented as one of, if not the, quintessential comic book movie villains of all time. Almost every line of his has become part of the cultural zeitgeist, this generations The Empire Strikes Back (1980).

Endlessly rewatchable and satisfying, filled with lots of incredible character moments and interactions, my favourite being those between Stark and Strange. The entirety of the action sequence on Titan is breathtaking, one that I always come back to. Filled with impressive choreography and a fulfilling use of each character's abilities, as well as serving as a key moment in the entire saga, it's definitely my personal highlight.

There are some issues that I've always had. One being how Bruce Banner/Hulk is handled, he is definitely a character that you feel the directors/writers did not know what to do with due to the amount of characters. Tony's suit is really ugly, it's baffling that a suit crafted in 2018 looks worse than the ones in 2008, and it's due to the over reliance on CGI.

Overall, this is where the MCU peaked for me. I do enjoy other remaining entries such as Endgame, No Way Home, and GOTG Vol.3. But if I'm being honest, Disney/Marvel have done irreparable damage to the MCU brand with their Phase 4 entries and how everything else is being handled. Much like their comic counterparts, after every peak there becomes an abundance of characters and storylines, a confusion of direction and a misguided desire to replicate an event previously planned for almost a decade in a matter of a few years.

At least we'll always have the Infinity Saga to look back on.","6"

"zerone23","Beyond my expectation!","25 April 2018","After building a plot for ten years, today we are at its peak. It's the culmination for those credit scenes that we waited in every MCU movie.

I did bring my expectation for this movie. I always wondered how the Russo brother handled a movie with vast list of main characters. The result? They nailed it. Either Avengers and Guardians have their part perfectly. It's about balance, right?

The opening part was predicted considering the end of Ragnarok last year. The rests are shown from the trailer but not in order and with several additional exciting scenes. Also, as we predicted, we found 'Thor-eyepatch' scene. It's a scene when there is a specific scene in a trailer but then changed in the final product.

Personally, I'm glad that Black Order is involved in the movie. Four of them didn't get any background story which is fine considering the runtime. However, they didn't have a proper death. Well, they had their purpose collecting stones for Thanos. But, only if they had a proper death, maybe they are rememberable.

If you are expecting a totally dark theme movie, you will be disappointed. It has several funny jokes which bring smile on our face and I'm definitely fine with it. It's a way of life. If you have a sad event, a little smile would nice,right? It is reflected in Thor's scene with Rocket. He is making joke but deep down, you know that he is afraid and has unbearable sadness.

As expected, there are deaths literally everywhere. It's chaotic. It shows that Thanos is someone that you should afraid of. For me, it's pretty dark movie. Not only because of the deaths, but also how the movie can scramble your emotion. Even though so many deaths, we were reunited with a certain character in Phase I of MCU. (Sure, it freaks me out)

Conclusion. I'm still trembling when I write this. So exticed and sad when I come out from the theater. The part that I love the most is when Thanos snap his finger. I'm glad that it is happened like in the comic. But, I'm freaking sad when a lot of main characters died, especially Spidey. Literally, I'm crying in the theater.

Well, it's beyond expectation. 10 of 10. And there's only one credit scene. Just wait. It's worth. A lot.","2"

Get it ? Visual ""Marvel"". That's a bad attempt at humor.sorry. Moving on , iw is directed by the Russo brothers and stars almost everyone ?!. Now the story has a lot of arcs to it but is centralized to one Thanos. I loved how they set up character introductions along the way and made sure there was no phasing issues which is really important in a movie close to 3 hours. This movie is a really dark one but the one liners and humour are spot on and are never forced anywhere unlike justice league *cough* *cough*. I also loved how they took time to explore other worlds in the movie while there was so much going on , there is a lot going on in this movie , like a lot ! . But just like any other movie on the hype train it does have it's flaws. Remember how I said there were many arcs , sometimes the switch from one arc to another takes a really long time . Other than that , ok what else ? . The CGI in this movie is amazing but personally I thought they could've done better with iron man's armor. And even the little details on Josh brolins face were really good. And when you finally feel like these arcs are gonna combine and all for something bigger , then BOOM ! A cliffhanger right there.And it's an ending I'm still trying to figure out. In the end , avengers infinity war is something which travels beyond expectation , with great characters , a gripping story , great visuals and a cliffhanger ending for the avengers to actually ""assemble"" in the next movie (hopefully) .","6"

"jmoseschua","The whole movie is just a 2- hour fan service.","4 August 2018","Have you ever watched a movie where even if you already set the speed to 1.3, you still can't stop yourself to forward it 5-20 seconds time to time? I just did. I even read positive reviews to convince myself that the film is good but nothing worked. Don't get me wrong. I know, and I am very much familiar with MCU. I liked it, in fact, even if the whole plot is cliche.

The whole movie is just a 2- hour fan service thus the lack of storytelling. But, of course, this would be not an issue for Marvel since the viewers watch the film only for the sake of seeing their favorite characters come to life (even with slight inaccuracies) and knowing (not figuring out because every Marvel film is shallow) what would happen at the end of the film. Thus, it is also the case that if the viewers already knew what will happen in the film, the film will lose its value. This is pretty simple. Every important part of this film is just a collection of discrete information. Watching this film felt like reading a bullet outline. There's no transition. No emotions to fill those gap--which something I believe a good movie should have. The supposed catharsis should have happened during the whole disintegration moment, like really? How cringey is that? This film is a mosaic. Most of the plot-turning moments in the film are unsubstantiated. I would bet even the Marvel fan themselves observed some moments in the film where they would react: how did that happen.

The script made the film into a clown fiesta. This film is more like a parody. A highly budgeted parody is a crap.","5"
"colindeng","Fun to watch, really terrible to think about.","25 July 2018","Okay, so the movie was really good in a sense that it provided action and cool things to look at. But what really makes this not as good as people say it is is the frickin logic in it. Ok i get it, it's a movie, movies don't have to be realistic, but goddamn look at all the heroes in this movie and with the way Thanos was portrayed he could've achieved his goal in half an hour if he tried or did something logical but instead he decided to ""take his time because he knows he'll win"" and because of that many of the heroes could have beat thanos themselves like thor at the very end could have cut thanos's arm off ending the movie right there, or doctor strange who had many many many opportunities to do things could've used the stone, or cut thanos' arm off with his portal, and wong, who literally showed up for 3 minutes could've appeared at wakanda and yeeted the enemies into the mirror dimension instead of causing a great battle between human and alien. Like so much of this movie is unnecessary that it just ruins it once you look back.","3"
"aaronjamesmaximus","Better than end game but still terrible except for the ending","24 September 2019","There are too many heroes that we get nothing from because we are expected to already like them, but the opposite is now true now none of the heroes matter, they get no character moments it's all in the service of the big epic plot thus making the villain the only likable character and thus the hero of the story and he wins, which is quite satisfying as all the heroes are all bland and boring. Just because the characters are already established is not a good reason to just stop making your characters interesting.

the first iron man was good and he was likable, but the second movie had a forgettable villain with dumb powers. The second sequel (the third iron man) tries to fix the bad villain issue, but just tricks everyone for a lame surprise villain who hates iron man because he wasn't nice to him once or something. Much is the same with all the other superhero movies, except Thor all his movies suck. Ant man and black panther just rip off the plot of the first iron man by having an evil version of the hero fight him at the end and they both suck and just feel like bad copies.

By the time this movie rolls around there are no really likable characters except Thanos. And they give the hero of the story his ending where he kills all the dumb unlikable characters, but then take it away in the next movie and have the villains win, which on the whole is much less satisfying and an insult to the comics these movies were based on.","5"

"dutchs-1","Man, That's Quite a Corner You've Written Yourself Into","29 May 2018","The Big Bang created six stones that each govern aspects of the universe. Somebody wanna 'splain me why they aren't scattered in galaxies billions of light years apart, maybe in the cores of planets, instead of being in one small region of space where they can all be collected? So Thanos, mastermind of the previous attack on New York, has a theory that saving the universe means bringing it back within its carrying capacity by killing half the sentient life forms on every world. So he sends his minions to earth to collect the stones he's still missing. To combat them, all the various Marvel characters come together, and it is indeed great fun to see them. There's a climactic battle in Wakanda, where Thanos completes his quest and people, including some Marvel folk, begin disintegrating, presumably because Thanos can now will their disappearance. We see Thanos sitting under an alien moon, and given the reassurance that he will return.

Okay, where do they go from here? Just imagine the chaos if half the human race vanishes. It'll make the ""Left Behind"" scenario look mild in comparison. What will Thanos do for an encore? He already has the Infinity Gauntlet. And do they fight Thanos with magic and psychic powers? No, plain old ""Biff"" ""Pow"" mechanical force. Stuff that the military does quite capably. So wouldn't a few F-35's help a little bit? Wouldn't a few gunships help with that attacking horde at Wakanda?

"rexmatthewj","Thanos!","13 March 2023","""Avengers: Infinity War"" (2018) is a highly anticipated and stunning superhero film that brings together some of the biggest names in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. The film's plot revolves around the Mad Titan Thanos and his quest to collect the Infinity Stones and destroy half of all life in the universe.

The themes of sacrifice and the consequences of power are central to the film, and the film explores these themes in a way that is both thought-provoking and thrilling. The tone is dark and serious, yet still manages to find moments of levity and humor, making the film a rollercoaster ride of emotions.

The acting is excellent across the board, with standout performances from Josh Brolin as Thanos, Robert Downey Jr. As Iron Man, and Chris Hemsworth as Thor. The characters are well-defined and each get their moment to shine, with their relationships with one another adding emotional depth to the film.

The direction is masterful, with the Russo brothers delivering some truly unforgettable set pieces and action sequences. The score is haunting and adds to the film's overall epic feel, while the cinematography is stunning, capturing the scope and scale of the film's world in a way that is truly awe-inspiring.

The production design is top-notch, with each new location and world looking more incredible than the last. The special effects are seamless, with each action sequence and superhero moment feeling believable and grounded in reality. The editing is tight and keeps the pace of the film moving at a breakneck speed, while the dialog is witty and full of humor.

Overall, ""Avengers: Infinity War"" is a triumph of the superhero genre, delivering a film that is both entertaining and emotionally impactful. Whether you're a fan of the Marvel Cinematic Universe or not, this film is a must-see, a film that will leave you on the edge of your seat and wanting more.","7"

This looked more like a STAR WARS movie than an AVENGER movie, and I haven't cared about a STAR WARS movie since 1980 something..

"reeseevans","Rarely have I seen a movie where so much is going on, but nothing is happening.","2 August 2018","Rarely have I seen a movie where so much is going on, but nothing is happening. Besides the typically impenetrable CGI action, you are expected to follow five plot threads at once- often waiting fifteen minutes to return to them. Heaven help you if you've missed any of the previous Marvel installments going in.

You have a well-acted villain in Thanos whose motivation makes no sense. He is a galactic scale eco-terrorist who strives to cull half of the universe at random, owing to his fears of resource depletion from overpopulation. To believe the universe is in danger of overpopulation is asinine, not least because Thanos learns how to ALTER REALITY. Why slaughter so many people with a snap of your fingers, when you could make the universe more abundant instead?

There's little on offer by way of genuine drama (hindered by the nagging sense that death is not permanent in a comic series transplanted to the screen). It's packed to the gills with immersion-breaking humour (because a superhero movie can't take itself seriously without being called ""grimdark"", apparently). The Hulk, for example, is reduced to one big joke about erectile dysfunction.

Avengers: Infinity War is a lumbering behemoth, like a suitcase stuffed to the point its zip is breaking. The obvious conclusion to building a universe that must connect, yet be constrained to a sub three hour running time. The stakes are raised so high that ""trillions of lives"" are threatened, but the basics of film making (character development, plot, motivations, theme, pacing) are almost entirely overlooked. The movie carries no dramatic weight, and feels more like a who's who of Marvel characters. It is a Saturday morning cartoon very much brought to life, with all the associated one-dimensionality.","6"

"bluenine-2","Great Movie messed up a bit by the writers","1 May 2018","My favourite MCU movies are The Winter Soldier, Ironman and even the first Avengers movie. I was hoping this one reaches or surpasses those, but I don't think this has. This is more like a bigger version of Ultron, much much bigger in scale. Might have enjoyed this much more as a teenager (I guess its mainly the teens who are the ones leaving 10/10 reviews), but now I need a superhero movie to deliver more than just the basic elements (great CGI, big scale, humour and good fight scenes - these things MCU usually gets right, and here they have outdone themselves yet again).

For me Superhero movies (like epic fantasy movies) need to explain the power of each individual - specially the limitations of power, the character flaws, and consistent application of these rules. Those are the things that make it interesting. Limitless power is boring. Which is why I am not a big fan of Superman or Captain Marvel, but I like Spiderman, Ironman and even Batman. In the current MCU universe, the powers and specially the limitations of some characters are not well defined - like Dr Strange, Scarlet Witch, Vision, and Antman. Some of the things they can do almost makes them all-powerful and you wonder why don't they use those powers to get out of every situation.

This is where this movie lets us down - that consistency and power definition is lacking.

Warning: Spoilers ahead

Firstly, the good stuff:

1. Opening scene & Hulk: Loved the opening scene, and the fact that the hulk is beatable too. Even better was the psychological impact of this beating as Banner is not able to summon the Hulk at will. This adds so much depth to the character.

2. Darker tone: Set up so well in the opening scene, it is good to see MCU taking a bit darker tone - superhero's can also die. That makes this universe more unpredictable and so much more interesting. Also the layers in characters - they really developed Thanos character well in this movie - showing his emotional side helped.

3. Captain America: Never one of my favourite superheros, I like how his personality is changing and growing with every movie. The treatment of his gradual change is so consistent, you can see a ""perfect person"" is slowing changing into a more real person. Maybe they should have given him a bigger role, but perhaps that will happen in the next movie.

4. MCU set up: I guess this is the best part for all MCU fans, how all 18 previous movies have logically been leading up to the storyline of this one. The consistency and scale of this set up (while not perfect) is quite mind blowing - 18 standalone stories covering into one.

The Bad:

1. The time stone: I hate that stone. Any power which can go back in time to change history usually ruins the story for me because most writers don't know how to handle it. Its usually a cop out for bad writers to escape from writing a good story. Lets just kill everyone to shock the audience, then just rewind it to solve the problem. Terrible ending, this rewinding time bit was the worst part of the movie.

2. Supernova: Thor can survive a blast from a freaking supernova, really? That whole scene was so ridiculous, treating the audience like 5 year olds. Maybe if he had died there to create the weapon for someone else, that may have redeemed that scene a bit.

3. Thanos and the power of stones: The power of the stones and their limitations are not very well defined. We don't see Thanos growing in power with the addition of every stone, infact he looks stronger in the first scene with just one stone than in most of the movie with 2-3 stones. Rewinding time apart, now with 6 stones he can kill 50% of the universe with a click of his fingers, but cannot stop Thor from burying his axe into his chest? Doesn't make sense. Might have made a better movie if they had let Scarlet witch destroy 1 stone, so that no one is all powerful.

4. Consistency of powers: Vision and Scarlet Witch should not need help from the likes of Black Widow and Falcon, just like a tank does not need help from an ant. I guess this is a problem because the limitations of powers of Vision and Scarlet Witch haven't been defined properly before. Maybe if they had previously shown that Vision cannot function well when he is injured or that Scarlet Witch isn't every effective when she is emotional, that scene could have made sense.

Overall a good movie for watching once. But the time rewind thing is easily the main problem with this movie. With the post credit scene, I guess they have set it up very nicely for the Captain Marvel movie, which will lead nicely into the 2nd part of this movie - MCU does that so well. Buy I am not looking forward to see an all powerful Captain Marvel taking on an all powerful Thanos, rewinding time to bring back the superheros as per the writers whims and fancies. Yawn.","5"

"paul_marston","So much to pack into 1 film - should Infinity Wars have been a trilogy?","26 April 2018","First of all when I rate a film, I use this system for rating - 5 is a pass, 6-7 merit, 8+ distinction. I NEVER give a 10./10 because it's IMPOSSIBLE to make a perfect film. Thus my 8/10 would be 8.5 (distinction) if I could give half a star. Thus this film is VERY GOOD, but has a few issues.

Because of the nature of the film, there are a LOT of characters, so inevitably some characters (2 in particular) is glossed over. Even Stan Lee's cameo was as brief as it could be (but considering his health that is understandable. This is the ULTIMATE crossover movie - virtually all marvel movie is represented in some way.

To say this film is action packed is an understatement - if anything there is TOO much action - I could make a decent case this is 2 films rolled into 1 - hence the title of the review! Having said that, all action scenes were well done, and the issues re CGI I had against Black Panther weren't present here.

As was shown in trailers, Thanos is on a quest to gather all the infinity stones to complete his plans for the universe. As such, Vision is a key target. We begin however in the cosmos with the Ragnarok survivors in a spot of bother. Loki shows his best & worst, and my appreciation for what Tom Hiddleston has done with this character is never higher than here. From here keeps flashing between earth & the cosmic realm - bringing into play the guardians.

From here, it is standard MCU fair - if you've enjoyed any of the other movies, you will love this one. The big difference is Thanos - played fantastically by Cable - sorry Josh Brolin (nod to deadpoll ;-) ). and BOY has he done a fantastic job. All the claims that killmonger was the best villain in the MCU - are made to look VERY silly after watching Thanos. His plan is beyond diabolical, but the way he is played, it is quite possible to sympathise with him. Without saying WHAT he is trying to do, his motivations are to be benevolent! Whilst if he succeeded would be about as horrific as is possible, he doesn't do it to be evil destructive. In HIS mind, he is trying to prevent an even worse catastrophe! Yes the film plays it from Thanos's POV, and Thanos is taking a macro view of the universe! What is so great, is how Thanos is portrayed with a level of sympathy. It's as if Thanos doesn't WANT to do this, but he sees it a the only way to ultimately save the various species!

I can see why people may not like this, there's things in here that I wouldn't have done. But for me, there is NO QUESTION this is an excellent film - but unlike many of the recent MCU films, no way could you consider this a romp! It's a complete tonal change from Ragnarok. And that is what I love about the whole MCU. They aren't afraid to change a working formula.

I thoroughly enjoyed this movie, I've DELIBERATELY not discussed much, as this film needs to be seen - if nothing else Josh Brolin's performance. This DESERVES to make way much more money than Black Panther. When politics change, Black Panther will not date very will - Infinity War WILL in my view.

the trailers fairly represent the movie. You like them, you WILL love this. Oh and Peter Dinklage shows why he is such a giant talent!

"Safcinexile","Absolutely breathtaking and visually gorgeous","26 April 2018","Watched this film at a mid-night screening this morning.

After having a bit of sleep and some time to process what I watched earlier, I can honestly say the Film was absolutely breathtaking at times just didn't seem to let up with all emotion I was feeling while watching. Character interplay was spot on too, adding humour at the right time. Also couldn't help feel a bit sympathy towards Thanos, could understand his reasoning even though his actions were a bit self-centred, although I couldn't help feel for him what he had to kill Gamora to get the soul stone. Her death and Loki's death really hit home how high the stakes have been raised.

For me one of the biggest surprises of the film was the return of a character thought dead (The Red Skull)

Didn't actually expect the ending, had thought with it being a Marvel Film, the heroes would save the day at the last minute, but no Marvel when down the dark route and let Thanos succeed in wiping out half of the universe, which for me makes the film even more special.

The Directors/Marvel have set the bar with this film and are going to have to pull out all the stops next year if they want the next part to be just as good.","8"

"thekilon","Thor Ragnarok recycled","4 May 2018","Summary: Infinity war has all the elements of the old trusted Disney recipe. Mediocre to bad comedy, stupid story, flat characters, political correct and kids friendly style.

If you loved Thor Ragnarok , you will love this one. It's only major difference is that there is much less Hulk in this one.

In Detail:

The good thing about the film is that it brings all our favorite marvel superheroes together without feeling overcrowd and giving each one of them its own role in the film without using him or her as mere decorations. The ending although partly expected, it has a good deal of surprise.

Overall however the film suffers from a ton of issues:

1) The elephant in the room is Thanos himself, he suffers from the same issues as Steppenwolf in JL. As a villain he is everything you expect to see, a bad guy wanting to do bad things. Their only difference is that dialogue wise Steppenwolf takes the edge with some really unique lines, Thanos takes the edge of having a bit more complex plan. But overall this is a ""what you see is what you get"" situation for both of and sadly they also both suffer from the plastic face CGI issue. Overall much of the motivation of Thanos makes little sense and the film does not seem able to decide the most basic whether Thanos is mad or plain stupid.

2) Hulk has been a big issue in all Disney films but never as much as in this one. He is pretty much non existent in this film , gone are his old days of ""we have a hulk"" , maybe there is a reason a surprise element left for the sequel but after Disney turning Hulk to this big cute meatball wrecking havoc depriving him of his Marvel identify of the stuff of nightmares and horrors , my hopes are very low on this one.

3) Disney of course does not stop there at destroying any link with the comics, an art they have perfect since the first movie they made. Thor for some weird reason is completely overpowered. The guy that barely made it alive from a fight with the Hulk in Thor Ragnarok , the first fight he discovers the peak of his powers , seems unlike Hulk to have no issues whatsover taking Thanos by himself. Why ? Again none knows.

4) Spiderman once more is reduced to Iron Man's sidekick. His role in the flim is completely unnecessary , even though he does indeed participate and contributes his own powers this film, these powers are like Homecoming extremely town down. His insane agility is long gone, his spider sense just a shadow of the one in the comics and of course what remains is his high reliance on his armor of course made by tony. Essentially if Iron Man is Dr Evil, Spiderman is Mini Me. It's pretty obvious that Disney is pitching Spiderman as the new Iron Man , although Holland acting skills are nowhere near those of RDJ.

5) Comedy was always the weakest part of Marvel films. Usually its a hit and miss situation, throw random jokes on the wall , see which one sticks. This film manages to be even worse than Thor Ragnarok. Some very good jokes, most of them you see them coming miles away.

6) For me Hulk was not the big surprise on how underpowered he was but Dr Strange. Marvel has already establishes that he can run circles around Thor and Loki combined , yet in this one he seems to display a tiny fraction of his abilities

7) Which brings us to another problem stemming from this inconsistency, action scenes. None of the fight scenes are really exciting, the most exciting is nothing more than a recycle from a similar scene in Thor Ragnarok.

8) Last but not least, character development is non existent. Infinity War seems to follow Civil War but again there is no discussion on the big gap that it left to the team, the film starts with an indication that it may address the issue but then as soon as Thanos visits our planet, its no longer an issue. Disney logic at its best.

All my fears since watching the trailer have been confirmed and I would be surprised if the sequel is the first superhero movie not bothering to watch.","9"
"theanimatoradam","I've seen it once, I don't need to see it again.","31 March 2019","You know when you go on a rollercoaster ride with one of your parents? And, bless them for coming along, but they always complain afterwards that they feel sick, their back hurts and that they're just glad it's finally over? That's the reaction I had to this one folks. With so many name characters having to have a slow pan, tilt up to face reveal shot before doing anything all the way through this film I was getting deja vu about one third of the way through the film, only to find the rest of it had to be so fast paced in order to keep all of those plates spinning at once, that your eyes and brain never get a chance to rest. For most of the movie all that's really happening at any one point is ""Remember these two guys? Let's have them meet for the first time. And now we'll cut to a fight between them and another band of generic villains"". That doesn't make for a bad movie, but that can summarise what happens in this film roughly 4 or 5 different times, and unfortunately the break-neck pacing idea seems to have caught on because after seeing this movie I've noticed almost every other new film I've watched since try to do the same race through their story beats that more often than not leaves me tired. I don't know, I've never been a huge fan of the Marvel Movie Machine, it's definitely had a handful of great films amongst it's wide variety of mostly pretty good ones, but this definitely falls into that second category - worth seeing if you're into these movies, but I'm definitely not going to sit through the whole thing again.","3"

"briancham1994","Incredible ensemble","5 August 2020","This film is far better than the previous two Avengers films. It balances all its characters and settings with a deft hand. This time, the central thread is the villain Thanos who is portrayed by Josh Brolin. He is a brooding figure with a false sense of wisdom and he is the true star of this film. Everything else is amazing - the story, the action, the effects, the stakes. Before this, I was not very familiar with the Marvel Cinematic Universe so I didn't recognise half the characters and scenarios, but this film just pulls you along for the ride so you don't necessarily have to know everything beforehand.","7"

It will lose you if you have not been paying attention up until this point and it has obviously polarised audiences, but it is a masterpiece of directing and scriptwriting. I can't wait to see where we go from here.

If you've enjoyed marvel thus far, you'll find a lot to like. It is a marked improvement on the story from the old comic!

I suspect people score movies low to bring the average down and yet Infinity War still currently stands at 8.9/10! That alone should tell you all you need to know about the quality of this movie.

It won't be for everyone, but no movie is! For me, it was perfect. Exciting, moving and thoroughly enjoyable. A triumph.","5"

"thebricks","The summer movie season is starting off great this year","29 April 2018","Definitely a return to form for Marvel with Infinity War, but I predict the next movie will be a bit of a letdown as the conflict with Thanos has to be resolved. If you've read the comic, you probably have an idea what will happen, and I think it will probably end up being lame. Still, it was a well-made movie.

I'm just getting sick of Black Panther and Wakanda though. Here you have an black superhero and his nation, which supposedly is some sort of breakthrough for black moviemaking and black comic book superheroes(laughably not true) yet the world of Wakanda is chock full of insulting, backwards stereotypes of African people in spite of the fact their society is so advanced, an alien race can't even break through its force field. Seeing the Wakandans use spears, dressed in tribal gear, just makes my eyes roll as well. Shuri is also the smartest person in Wakanda, dare I say, the only person in Wakanda who seems to be smart enough to engineer anything in spite of the fact their society was technologically advanced for decades, if not centuries. The stupidity of Wakanda is just infuriating and juvenile and I wish they would clean it up in future movies. I just refuse to watch any more Black Panther movies if they are made because I cannot stand anything about it.

Also, the balance of power between characters just isn't logical. You will have one character like Hulk get the snot beat out of them, yet Captain America or Iron Man will easily go toe to toe with Thanos and his goons and put up a good fight. The one fight scene in Scotland was really bad; Vision and Scarlet Witch get the snot beat out of them, yet Black Widow, Captain America and Falcon easily make short work of Thanos's goons and run them off? This could have used some work but wasn't enough to ruin the film.

I highly recommend this movie. It is a bit long though, but I never checked my watch.","1"

"nathan9826","Coolest Marvel Movie","19 August 2018","I've seen Infinity War and all the other Marvel Cinematic Universe movies at least 3 times. This film was worth waiting 10 years. Although the movie is 2.5 hours long, it was not boring. Every scene was action packed and detailed. In fact, you definitely need to watch it at least once because there is a bit too much information going on.

Thanos was a great villain. He was scary yet likable. You can see his emotional side especially with Gamora. Of course, no movie is perfect. Thor was overpowered, probably because of his newfound powers in Ragnorak and stormbreaker. I didn't like that Captain America had a smaller role than normal. Additionally, I'm sure Hulk had a minor role here for a reason. Like in Civil War, Vision was mostly useless as well. I get that he was stabbed earlier in the movie, but he still could have done more.

Some people do not like that half the universe ""died,"" including the heroes. However, I enjoyed that the ending was not a cliche of the hero always winning. People need to understand that this movie was originally supposed to be in 2 parts. ""Part 2"" should have all the answers when it comes out next year.","6"
"ilmicifir","Infinity War Provides Infinite Disappointment","28 April 2018","After ten years of epic waiting, we just got a chance to clarify that The Russo Brothers were an awful choice for Marvel Cinametic Universe. Infinity War, including over 30 main characters, starts with a quick plot without losing time to introduce our heroes. The movie goes on with funny bits popping out of nowhere during non-stop action sequences and sends us back home with a terrible ending. Suprisingly, it is not only bad because of lack of drama, but also the glorious fight between Avengers and Thanos brings out nothing original. The movie may serve as a great entertainment for early teens and comic-book fans, but surely not beyond that.","8"

I left the theatre with people watching all the credits, hoping for something to happen. If you speak to Marvel fans, they argue with you, claiming that the sequel will be great. Meaning this one was bad to some extent. The movie didn't have to drag out for so long. Everything felt very DragonBall Z'ish, but no pleasure in the end. I seriously wish I had watched something else.","10"
"littlemankazoo","A Herculean feat of Screenwriting and Directing","27 April 2018","I'm not a big ""fan"" of the Marvel Cinematic Universe.

Just wanted to get that out of the way right here and now before people begin to question my allegiance or my bias of where I stand before I start this review.

As I have told many people, I do not blindly follow this series of films wherever they may go. I enjoy Marvel when they make GOOD films, just as I would any other studio, director, writer, etc.

In some cases, I find the MCU films to feel almost ""cookie-cutter"" when they are at their worst. The acting is fine, the action is fine, cinematography is typically 'safe' and doesn't break new ground as often as a series of this magnitude really should. No real risks are taken. I think of 'safe' when I think of many of their films, which isn't BAD, per-say, but I wish these films would be more risky in how they handle their material.

Try something new...Trying something daring...Try something DIFFERENT...

Well. My wishes were granted. In spades.

'Avengers: Infinity War' is not a perfect film. In fact, it's not even the best film in the MCU. However, it was absolutely EVERYTHING it was billing itself to be. It IS new. It IS daring. It IS different.

But let's un-pack that before I lose myself here. Because there's certainly A LOT to talk about...in NO SPOILER terms ;)

The tone of this film, without giving anything major away, is by far the bleakest of any of these films have dared to go. This storyline and these characters that they have been teasing for 10 years are now paying-off massively, as we are now seeing real consequence in this world that has been established. Your favorite characters are here, yes, but they ARE at-risk against a threat that isn't treated lightly. There isn't any awful Yo Mama jokes like in TLJ to dilute the drama and tone.

This is DARK, and the Russo Brothers do not let you off of that ride for you or the childrens' comfort level, which is precisely what I think this part of the story needed. The many comparisons I have seen to 'Empire Strikes Back' are not invalid, as its tone, manner, and even themes are extremely similar in more ways than one.

I can tell the Russo Brothers, fresh off of 'Winter Soldier' and 'Civil War', were allowed to make a film that resembles their film, and not a studio mandate. They make decisions that I KNOW will be extremely unpopular with a lot of people, but unlike a certain franchise tentpole, this film does it without self-destructing the reason we come for these films, which is intrinsically the characters and this massive, sprawling story.

Let's move on to that topic, The Characters. By far the strongest bone in this film's body is the characters and character interaction, as most Marvel films seem to excel at. After 10 years, we see all of these characters we've grown to love come-together and interact, and my goodness is it everything we have been waiting for. The dialogue here is sharp when it needs to be witty, is slow when we reach the emotional valleys, it can even reach heartwarming and heartbreaking at some points depending on what connection you have forged with these characters over the last few years.

A character I find particularly captivating in this film, however, is the antagonist itself. Thanos, believe it or not, is an extremely interesting character once we see him and learn what he's all about and capable of. This isn't another case of ""big bad Marvel bad guy man"". He is genuinely a character I find fascinating, which shows Marvel took notes as far as I'm concerned. If anyone's fear was that they would get him wrong after 6 years of building him up, consider those fears squashed. This is a Marvel VILLAIN, and I mean that in the best way possible.

To combine both prior points, hats off to screenwriters Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely for managing to juggle all of these characters and such a massive story and manage to make it COHERENT. Under many other writers' watches, this likely would have been A MESS, but the way the story progressed and characters were incorporated was, for the most part, expertly done. Every character gets a moment of their own, the ones we truly care for get integral arcs over the film's massive run-time, and in the end we hardly feel that certain characters were left out of the proceedings. I wondered how they would manage all of these characters, and they managed to walk the tightrope without falling.

The score is also a welcome and noticeable addition, as the talents of composer Alan Silvestri ('Back to the Future', 'The Avengers', 'Predator') were brought back for this film. There are plenty of excellent pieces of music in the film, along with the Avengers theme itself (The only noticeable orchestral pieces these films really has ever had), and it is welcome to have excellent music in these films again after the disaster Brian Tyler and Danny Elfman presented to us in 'Age of Ultron'. The music only adds to the feel of the film, which is what good movie music should rightfully do.

Now, all of this considered, this film is NOT perfect. In fact, a couple glaring flaws made themselves apparent throughout the film, though they were moreso ""Tiny cracks"" than ""Gaping holes"", so to speak.

For starters, the action cinematography is actually shockingly bad in the early half of the film. At some points, I could barely tell what was even supposed to be happening. The fights in the early part of the film suffer from SCS, or should I say ""Shaky Cam Syndrome"", as we are over-stimulated and shown too much CG in these portions to process what we're supposed to be looking at. That said, the action cinematography does improve as the film moves along, so this isn't a problem that knocks-out the foundations of the film. However, the action early on is NOTICEABLY bad, which certainly hurts.

Editing at times was also rather choppy, as odd choices are made in some portions of the film that made me scratch my head. I can't name anything in particular, though most of my issues with the editing stemmed from odd transitions and segues that almost looked like ""abandoned transitions"", where an attempt was seemingly made to stitch two scenes together...and then proceeded to be hacked-and-slashed to trim 2 seconds off the run-time, for some odd reason.

And that's perhaps my only real issue with this film; the flow of the film. So much of it feels as if it's begging to be smoother, but instead there are sequences where it simply feels too long or too short in places. At some points, we will be on a plot thread, cut-away from it, and will not return to said thread until 20-25 minutes later. I genuinely feel that this sort of thing could have been fixed with a better editor, or simply a smoother-written story, though considering how already miraculous it is that this film managed to be coherent with how much it had to juggle, perhaps the odder pacing was only a by-product of trying to assemble all of this together.

But in the end, is this massive assemblage of Marvel films and characters a success? Is this the film that is worth all the hype of 10 years and an entire film franchise has been leading up to?

Yes.

'Infinity War' is a tremendously fun time at the cinemas. It is quite literally an 'Epic', sprawling across so many characters, universes, worlds, tones, etc. This film feels like an event, which it may very well be, and I can safely say the Russo Brothers and writers Markus and McFeely as well pulled off a miracle and made such a Herculean task of a film into something I think is a great summer blockbuster and a tremendous first part of what is sure to be a grand finale for this universe we've seen grow over a decade.

I may not be a huge Marvel fan, but this is certainly a GOOD film. In fact, I'd dare say a GREAT one.","3"
"Fluke_Skywalker","The whole is less than the sum of its parts","30 April 2018","Plot; Thanos makes his move to unite the Infinity Stones so that he can bring balance to the universe.

This year the MCU turns 10 years old, and Infinity War (the 19th film in the MCU) represents the culmination of that carefully laid story that started w/Iron Man. W/the exception of a few characters, the gang is all here, and an effort is made to give everyone a key role or at least a moment. It's not an easy task, but Infinity War (w/it's 2 1/2 hour runtime) does manage its cinematic roll call reasonably well. At times the massive cast comes at a cost, as characters fall out of the story for large stretches of time, but the film itself never stops to catch its breath.

The action here is almost nonstop, but I found very little of it compelling despite being technically impressive. Even w/the obvious stakes, I just never felt that dramatic tension; or only in fits and starts. The tone is serious and often grim, but that tried and true MCU formula remains, so there's humor as well and most of it lands.

If the MCU has had a consistent criticism its the villains, but that's not an issue here. Thanos is not only impressively rendered physically, but he's got a depth and a mission that go beyond your standard mustache twirling baddie. Our heroes are the same characters we've grown to love, and it was nice to see a few of them known more for their humor get some dramatic depth. The ending is one I didn't see coming and will leave even the casual fan's mouth agape.

There's a lot to like about Infinity War, but for me the whole was less than the sum of its parts.","9"

However, the attempts at comedy are forced, not funny, and simply unnecessary (namely Quill, Drax, and Mantis).

Also, why did Thor go to Earth instead of Titan? Thor had Stormbreaker forged for one reason: Kill Thanos. Doesn't make sense.","10"
"Thekeybaldemasterrises","This movie is an experience. A true blockbuster achievement. Spoiler review.","29 April 2018","""There was an idea. To bring together a group of remarkable people. To see if they could become something more. So when we needed them. They could fight the battles that we never could."" It's opened everyone. 10 years worth of storytelling, world building, character development, it's all led to this. One last warning this is the SPOILER review. Don't read anymore if you haven't seen it!! To spoil it is to take away the experience. This truly is a cinematic achievement. Nothing has ever reached to this scale before. It's the ultimate pay off. So the biggest question is, was it worth the wait? YES. Yes it was. I'm honestly floored by this film. It's so much better than it has any right to be. By god though did Marvel do it. They actually did it. This is the most ambitious movie they've made yet, and I really enjoyed myself. It's like they've taken all of our criticisms of the previous films and gave it their all with this one. They did not hold back. It actually shocks me that Disney even let them make this movie because there is so much devastation and heartbreak that happens, but I'm proud of them for trusting Marvel to make this. I can't imagine how they had to sell the deaths of characters like Groot or Spider-Man like can you imagine asking the Disney execs to sign off on that? So you can only imagine what my reaction was to all of this. I laughed, I cheered, and I cried. I cried! Let me just start off though that I am completely aware this movie is not perfect, not even the Empire Strikes Back is, but that doesn't mean it overshadows the rest of it all. Let me start off with what didn't work for me. I didn't like how the Black Order was handled. They were intimidating but we didn't know much about them. The most we get about them is that they're the loyal children of Thanos? Ebony Maw or Squidward as Tony calls him, was probably the most memorable one because we got his name and they slowed down to focus on his dialogue. The other ones like Proxima Midnight? I think that's the only other name I heard. They just seemed like meaningless obstacles that had little development. They work fine as henchmen, but nothing more. What else did I not like? Nothing. I loved everything else. I'm trying to hear out everyone's issues with this movie and the only one I can maybe agree with is the ending feels cheap because we know it's only part 1 of 2 movies. So all the characters who vanished we know are coming back. That's not the point to me though. The point is that Marvel understands they've been criticized for not taking chances, that they play things too safe and that there are never consequences in their movies. So they had the guts to kill off nearly half of our beloved heroes in front of our very eyes. Now I don't know about you, but I lost it. Watching Groot vanish while Rocket wept. Watching Spider-Man tremble into Tony's arms begging for his life, was just soul shattering to watch on screen. I cried a lot during this movie. I cried for Loki, Gamora's entire story, Tony's fakeout death, when Spider-Man started to vanish, and even when Cap did everything he could to hold back Thanos. The biggest thing I appreciate about this film is how it just doesn't ever slow down. The pace is excellent. People might see this as a negative but I think this is a good thing because when you have this massive event with this many characters you just have to keep it moving. There's always something happening on screen whether if it's character banter, developing Thanos, or just insane action. I was never bored and I was just really engaged from beginning to end. The tones all blend really well too. It's funny when it needs to be, but it's not afraid to punch you in the gut and make you choke up like ""did that really just happen?"" Marvel actually had stakes and tension throughout the entire thing and I was so nervous waiting for each scene to play out. By the time credits rolled I was so traumatized I felt like I needed therapy LOL. Each character reacts the way they usually would and I'd totally debate people on that. The Russo Brothers clearly talked to all the other Marvel filmmakers and give each character at least one thing to do. That's all you can really wish for, the fact that they even had this many characters in the film and still made it work is nothing short of a miracle, because it could've been a complete disaster. Let me talk the biggest force of this movie though. The villain. Is Thanos a good villain after all this time? I would argue he's even better than I thought he would be. I think his plan is very profound for a guy who literally wants to wipe out half the universe. He wants balance in a world(universe) where people constantly struggle and suffer from just life. That he feels he's doing everyone a favor. These are what the good villains do. They don't wake up in the morning and think IM GONNA BE BAD TODAY. I still can't believe it's Josh Brolin because the cgi looked so good on him. He's definitely a highlight of the movie without a doubt. I guess it's time to predict what happens next, so we know now that Thanos has achieved his goal. People are vanishing left and right while he sits peacefully as he said he would. However we all know if people just vanished, there's a high probability they'll come back. The one thing I noticed is the ones who mostly made it are the original Avengers team minus War Machine, Rocket, Nebula, and Okoye. I wonder if there's some sort of significance to this as why the original Avengers survive and the newer ones and most of the Guardians did not. Of course the answer lies with Dr. Strange looking into the future and acknowledging there being only one possible outcome where they win out of millions(billions?) of outcomes. And we know that prior to that moment Strange made it clear that if it came to Tony or Spider-Man's life over the stone that he would not hesitate to let them die. However he gives up the stone to save Tony. So he knows Tony is a key for this outcome and that he must survive. Also Captain Marvel must play some large role in all of this henceforth the post credits scene. There's a lot of anticipation for Avengers 4. Like what it will be called. How is everyone saved, and more importantly will Thanos help to reverse it all or will he fall into madness till the Avengers overpower him? There's a lot to look forward to and I sure hope Avengers 4 can have the same level of impact this movie did because Infinity War knocked out of the park for me. This movie is an experience and that's why I can give it the highest honor of a 10/10. Now does this mean it's a perfect film? No, not on my scale. A 10/10 simply means this movie met and exceeded all my expectations. It engaged me from beginning to end. It got me to feel so many different emotions. I'm proud of Marvel for bringing us 10 years worth of stories and more to come. Go see it In IMAX if you can, it was phenomenal. Thank you Marvel. - 10/10","8"
"Gordon-11","An enjoyable blockbuster","25 April 2018","This film tells the story of the ensemble of Marcel superheroes uniting to fight against an evil man called Thanos.

It is a joy just to watch the numerous famous faces in the film! The story is good, visuals are fantastic, and there are loads of fighting. It has all the elements of a blockbuster.

However, the plot doesn't drive itself, and is not overly engaging because of the vast number of characters in different locations and subplots. It feels a bit fragmented to be.

"cwkenreich","""perfectly balanced""","12 April 2022","Avengers Infinity War may be seen as the epitome of populist entertainment; with nearly 30 different beloved characters all juggled around in one massive crossover of unprecedented scale. But that's not necessarily a criticism. Unlike more formulaic marvel films, Infinity War takes bold risks, exhibits cinematic artistry, and manages to bring dozens of plotlines into one coherent narrative with major payoff for devoted fans, laypersons, and cinephiles alike.

Infinity War is far from perfect; but, even the most cynical can't help but succumb to feeling emotionally invested in the characters, a testament to the filmmaking and acting. Even if you hadn't been keeping up with the films, for the first time, the Avengers storyline has weight to it. The film is riddled with far more defeats than victories, especially towards the end. A comedic outing in New York City, well guarded by the Avengers, lapses into a cosmic nightmare of nearly biblical proportions. The dramatic acting across the board is surprising, specifically: Elizabeth Olson, Paul Bettany, Zoe Saldana, and that one scene with Tom Holland.

Possibly the greatest aspect of the film is its complex, enigmatic, yet developed, protagonist (or antagonist). The Mad Titan Thanos rivals the Joker, Darth Vader, Hannibal Lecter and other illustrious cinematic villains. A towering, disorienting physique, reputation as large as the universe, and, most of all, an unbelievable motion-capture performance by Josh Brolin; switching from a fatherly figure to a mass murderer in an instant. His eloquence renders his twisted vision of genocide into a logical course towards prosperity. The audience is provided with the little information necessary to explain his backstory. His bittersweet relationship with Gamora and Nebula humanize this godlike figure and invokes both sympathy and deep hatred.

The pacing and editing are spot on. Unlike the bloated narratives of Age of Ultron or Civil War, Infinity War takes the Game of Thrones approach: spending only a little time with each character and filtering out the fluff. What results is nothing but plot advancement. Almost no scene (save for a few of the corny jokes at the beginning) deserves to be deleted (although overall, the comic relief was spot on and timed appropriately). Knowhere (pun-intended) in the entire 2hr 30 min runtime does boredom steal the mind. The editing is surprisingly smooth. The small mention of a particular character acting as a gateway to another planet. The simultaneous battle scenes allowed the suspense to accumulate. Even the flashback scene with Gamora is flawlessly integrated.

The visual effects were more than enough to deliver an OSCAR to this film and are put to great use in inventive ways. The battles may feel excessive (as they did in Age of Ultron), but the variety of the visual aesthetic and the high stakes permeating the film, the editing, and the musical score elicit gasps, cheers, and cringes. The magical duel between Thanos and Doctor Strange is a particular standout in terms of visual pleasure. Another major standout for fans is Thor's arrival in Wakanda, which is attributed mainly to editing and music. Thor appears compromised right as the music swells and Groot completes Stormbreaker until...his finger twitch with electric sparks. Cut back to the Battle of Wakanda and Thanos's army is overwhelming the Avengers, an opportune moment for a deus ex machina, who has been gone since Age of Ultron, to make an EPIC entrance.

The ending of the film may just be the best part. At the time, who knew Disney would agree to such a risky move. (Endgame, that's why), but to create Infinity War as a standalone film with a lack of closure (for our heroes, at least) was an unprecedented move for Marvel. Personally, the Snap was the moment I realized that I cared about this fictional universe, and I couldn't bear to miss the part ii. The final scenes with Thanos at a mysterious temple and his look of complacency at the very end provide closure to Thanos's character arc and his relationship with Gamora. As for the Avengers, even though they lose, rewatch the scenes of Wanda destroying Vision or Thor's personal vendetta with Thanos and you'll still be cheering (and crying) for the heroes. The emotional effectiveness, the cinematic beauty, the visuals, all of it ""perfectly balanced, as all things should be""

"starrychloe","Arbitrary and capricious + plot holes","3 August 2018","There is a giant plot hole in the first 5 minutes. Apparently there was a boarding party and the Hulk character was hiding and sneaking up on the enemy. That is very out of character. Normally the Hulk attacks first, directly, and loudly. That part didn't make any sense. Then the Hulk lost in a simple fist fight, when that character has been through much greater ordeals. Then the Asgard transporter is activated when the machine was already destroyed! Such sudden and severe plot holes really made me p-----... made me angry and I vowed to rate 1 star. That was only the first 5 minutes. How they decide who wins against whom is so arbitrary and capricious, and never follows any sort of logic or consistency. I am willing to suspend disbelief, but the writing must follow its own rules! Characters can be smashed by giant boulders, their skin never tears like its made of diamond, yet they bleed from a fist. Pure nonsense. It never occurs to Dr. Strange to use a portal to get back home, when that is half of what he does. Lazy writing. The rest of the movie was entertaining though, with even more plot holes, so I settled on 6.","10"
"ferni-tierni","The hardest choices require the strongest wills.","9 May 2020","Despite Avengers being a Marvel commercialism and attempting to unite all these characters into a cohesive narrative, the movie does a good job of integrating them in a way that it does not feel forced or expendable. They all have their little cameo and do not have excessive presence that creates random and out of place scenes. I mean it somewhat does, but it is bearable. What makes this movie stand out above all superhero movies - except the Nolan's Batman Trilogy - is the deep meaning and implications of the clash of ideologies between Thanos and the Avengers.

Thanos follows a narrative of a redeemer, a godly presence, coming to restore order in the universe. He is not a sadist; he even feels burdened by this purpose. At a certain instance he confesses: ""I ignored my destiny once, I cannot do that again"". He is one of the most humane villains I have seen in any movie. He is willing to risk everything to get the six infinity stones and reduce as much as possible the suffering of people by just snapping his fingers and disintegrating everyone. Simply Thanos wants to maximize the pleasure of all living beings by reducing population and providing everyone the resources for a happy existence, instead of what he perceives a chaotic and damaging organization of living beings.

The dialogue is adequate: The avengers are continually given a chance to demonstrate their uniqueness and role. The directors gave them dialogue to express their idiosyncrasies and personality, and it was entertaining to watch the usual quips and jests by Iron Man or the Guardians of the Galaxy. Even though the movie was two hours and thirty minutes the movie never felt dull, and the inclusion of new scenes always had a purpose in the major plot. Maybe the movie had too many action scenes for my personal preference, but maybe I am asking too much from a Marvel film.

Thanos achieving his goal the way he did was definitely a surprise, and I feel like I don't get surprised that often in films, so Kudos to the Directors for raising the tension repeatedly, and instead of, like in most movies, the superheroes achieving their goal we had a very spiritual, multi-faceted villain that accomplished his goal. I have to say that Thanos continually justified being a worthy villain to face all the avengers.","7"

"benjaminburt","It Feels Like a Real Comic Book Movie","29 April 2018","Some could argue that the booming comic book film industry has grown a little stale since its inception with 2000's blockbuster X-men. Some argue that it's just the same shtick of hero-fights-bad-guy. There are a few titles that have been absolute standouts that work in a vacuum as a piece of media, such as the Dark Knight trilogy and Logan. However, one disappointment I've long held is that the stories don't feel like a comic book.

Naturally, stuff is inherently lost in adaptation from comic book to the big screen. If you want to see what happens when we try to re-create media in a new medium, you need look no farther than 2014's The Killing Joke. The last third of the film was nearly panel-by-panel identical to the original comic, but most fans would tell you that the comic is still head and shoulders above. But, that's neither here nor there.

The essence or flavor of comic books was perfectly expressed in Sam Raimi's Spider-man Trilogy (yes, even the third one). The stories seemed to juggle subplot and characters, but the narrative weaved them all together effortlessly. Some of the most effective moments in a film were just that - moments. These films showed a deep respect and appreciation for comic books.

Then, Batman and Iron Man show up, and the stories gained a new form. Like I said, adaptations inevitably require changes, but it seemed like the studios had abandoned this style. I did see glimpses of it in films like the first Avengers and in Civil War, but for the most part, I was slightly disappointed.

Infinity War brings it back. It feels like an event comic. The story trades back and forth between several subplots, the heroes don't need to explain who they are or their backstory and motivations because we already know these characters, we've spent films with them. The villain is menacing and memorable (I'd say even more compelling than Thanos in the original Infinity Gauntlet comic). Characters die and there's already setup for them to come back. The story is somehow organically a collection of moments yet still somehow flows as a compelling whole.

Avengers: Infinity War is a big, dumb, action flick. The dialogue, shot composition, editing, etc., are all above-average, but none of it is pushing cinema to new heights. What makes it great is the feeling it can give the audience thanks to great characters and good storytelling.","5"

The characters meet each other and team up without it being forced, and the tone perfectly is set from the very beginning that s**t it hitting the fan. Thanos is not just evil, he genuinely believes hes making the world a better place. He needed to be the best villian of the series and he easily is. The things he does in this movie. Sheesh. This is his movie. These characters have come such a long way, and we got to be there for it all. Which makes it so hard to watch as they all fail, and inevitably fall. Theres tons going on but it's so well balanced. I love this chapter. The only thing I could say is some heros dont seem that strong or important but other than that...amazing. 90%","10"

"djak-43049","Life-long comic-book fan, what's not to love? A lot!","31 July 2018","I've grown up in the Marvel (and DC) universes, since a kid, I've read everything in comic book form, having my favourites of course. Thor: Ragnarok began a new trend in tongue-in-cheek Marvelism, submitting to humour while ignoring the basic qualities of the characters.

Infinity War was a disappointment because it paid no heed to the capabilities of the characters. Going back to Thor as an example, we have the God of Thunder enduring the blast of a neutron star while in Ragnarok, he couldn't even extract himself from a magnetic chair.

Back to Infinity, we find Dr Strange almost without a single trick up his sleeve and my all-time favourite, Vision, who couldn't hold his end up against any of Thanos' minions.

The Scarlet Witch is supposed to distort the fabric of reality yet she choose only to move herself and objects around, giving very little evidence of the great power she had that suddenly allowed her to destroy an infinity stone with one hand while holding Thanos back with the other.

Having achieved his goal of collecting all of the infinity stones, he then blows a fuse, where did that come from and where was he sent? Was it back in time to his home to retire in splendid comfort or was he stuck in a fantasy realm created by the fusing stones?

And then, the final disintegration of many of the heroes, apparently at random, why Spiderman and Dr Strange and not Ironman? Why the Black Panther and not Captain America? Why Bucky and so on....

Did I enjoy the film? Yes, of course I did - it's part of the universe I know and is pure unadulterated fantasy, as it should be. I'm just sad that the makers didn't see fit to honour the legacy of Stan Lee and the Marvel artists of by-gone years.","8"
"anupapu8","Best By Marvel","27 April 2018","Avengers: Infinity War- M gonna try to write this with as less as spoilers possible. But there will be some minor ones , so sorry for that.

Q. Is it the best MCU film overall? A. Yes. (not counting BLACK PANTHER , because i haven't seen it yet) Q. Does it has flaws ? A. Many. But its not the best MCU film by becoming perfect , rather the good things in the movie were so awesome , that you are totally gonna forget the bad things. Q. Is it the best written MCU movie ? A. Certainly not. If we consider just writing CAP AMERICA: WINTER SOLDIER takes the crown. Q. Does characters die? A. O YES. Much More in numbers then u r expecting. Q. Does they will be left dead ? A. Certainly not. MCU is no Game Of Thrones. There are million ways a character can reborn. And this time the movie hinted a way itself . Q. Does that affect the emotional effect of those deaths ? A. Not At All . Its exceptional. The movie will punch u in the gut , really really hard , many times but specially in the climax , after the last fight. M pretty sure this movie has the bleakest Climax any Superhero movie ever had. MCU goes beyond DCEU level dark with this movie. To the level of darkness Nolan use to provide in Dark Knight Trilogy. And although i don't think this movie to be as good as Dark Knight and Dark Knight Rises , but even those two movies didn't had such a sorrowful climax.

As there were few , i would like to start (yes the review starts now , above it , was just the background, sorry if it gets lengthy) with the bad things.

1. Jokes didn't worked always. I mean the characters throws jokes in between some serious scenes , which didn't felt good. They also throws jokes when someone is on the verge of getting killed. This has been a major problem for me since the beginning of MCU. But yes , majority of the jokes land very nicely.

2. There were too many things in the movie happening simultaneously . Which again didn't feel good always. For example i really loved the WAKANDA action scene , but that fight sequence was cut at-least four times to show whats happening on the other storyline. That irritated me a little.

3. Many characters in the movie didn't got enough scenes for themselves , unfortunately most of them were my fav - CAP AMERICA , BLACK PANTHER and the whole WAKANDA team , Black Widow , Winter Soldier . Hawkeye was not even in the movie. HULK , o my my , how can they not use HULK. Everyone loves hulk, but except the opening scenes where HULK fights THANOS for a very small amount of time , the rest of the movie gave us Bruce Banner because apparently he is not able to change himself to HULK anymore. By the way there were no AntMan or Valkyrie either , but didn't missed them at all.

4. Then there was a single scene where a character did a really really really stupid thing even after 4 other characters were asking him not to do that. And by doing that thing , they lost really nice chance to defeat Thanos. And that stupid thing was done by (yes m gonna name him) STAR-LORD.

So whom did i liked most in the movie. Ofcoarse it was THENOS. He is an awesome villain . Infact the 2nd best villain of any Comic Book movies after - Yes Heath Ledger's JOKER. He was strong . He was menacing . But he had very clear thought. Particular goals . Which he thought to be the right thing to do to cleanse the Universe. He is not a villain just for the sake of being villain. He just don't go on killing people . He only kills them if it fulfills his higher purpose. He is emotional too. Also cries on the loss of loved one. Yes Yes Yes , he is able to love. Stakes were really high with him. Our heres were never in control of the situation , they were getting being defeated again and again .Josh Brolin did a damn good job with the motion capture technique , to make THANOS really really expressive.

When it comes to heroes. Two of my favorites were THOR (who was as good as he was is Thor:Ragnorak) with his jokes and his new weapon (an AXE) and his lightening power AND DR STRANGE (who was so so so much better here then his stand alone movie) with his EGOISTIC war with equally EGOISTIC Tony Stark and also his awesome Magical Powers.

Others get there time to shine too. But i am specially disappointed with DRAX , who although got enough screen time , is not contributing to the team enough , and was there in the movie to just crack jokes.

Then comes the action scenes. Loved each and everyone. Weather it was the small fist fight between Hulk and Thanos or the big and crazily crowded fight in Wakanda.

So lets end it with some small footnote points. 1. I watched the movie in 2d , and totally loved it. So i dont know if its worth of the extra money to be spent on 3d. 2. There was an end credit scene in the very end , so wait for it , which establishes a connection with upcoming MCU film , for which i was not much excited but some how that end credit scene gave me excitement. 3. If in the early half of the movie u feel that its just good not the best , wait for the 2nd half as it gets better , and the end is totally mind boggling . 4. Last but not the least , this movie has the best cliffhanger ever for any movie to set up a next installment, even better then the whole KATAPPA SUSPENSE of BAHUBALI 1 .

So yes , now time to wait. Avenger 4 is coming on 3rd May 2019.

"tomwarne-53094","Best MCU Movie yet!","27 April 2018","Wow absolutely amazing! Start to finish this film was so good. They managed to balance all the characters so well, with each character getting equal amount of screen time. Josh Brolin as Thanos was the highlight for me, never before has the MCU managed to make a villain so good and likeable, maybe with an exception of Loki in avengers assemble. I never read the infinity war comic story, so the ending was complete shocker for me, all the way through this movie, key characters are dropping like flies which is something the MCU don't ever do. I really enjoyed Thor, I thought he would be upset all the way through this with the opening scene and the death of my favourite MCU character. RIP Loki. But Thor was really great in this and he look amazing with his new hammer. As for the post credit scene, It did not mean much to me as I'm not a fan of this Captain Marvel, but the appearance of Nick Fury and Maria Hill was really good and hope we see them with the avengers again in the next one. As for the ending we all know these characters like black panther, spiderman, rocket, groot and the others will be back, with the time stone in play that's how I'm guessing they'll come back. As for Loki, gamora and vision, there fates are sealed I think as we see their dead bodies whereas the others disappeared.

This movie was defiently well worth the years and years of build up and lived up to the hype. This is easily the MCUs best movie since guardians of the galexy in my opinion. And can not wait for the next one, I hope they call Avengers: Infintiy Gauntlet.

But a 8.6 on imdb: Infinity war must be a great movie! Well, it was NOT and unbelievable that it has a 8.6 on imdb! Throw in all the characters you have from the Hulk to Spiderman and mix it with Black Panther, Thor and the Guardians of the Galaxy and than you have a mix which is not taste or good at all. Add a dumb story about a villain, who needs an iron fist to become powerful and if he succeeds in collecting six stones than he will be able to minimize the population in the universe, throw in all the special effects you can imagine and volia: Avengers-Infinity War is there. What a waste of time and what a waste of potential. Hopefully the next Marvel-movie will be a stand-alone again with only one or two Marvel-heroes in it because they now go the wrong way.","10"
"ljsmith-25626","Masterpiece in Entertainment","27 May 2020","Avengers: Infinity War is unlike anything you've ever seen before. It is 10 years in the making, with 20 instalments leading up to it, all designed to introduce our lineup of 30 odd characters and hint at fragments of Infinity War plot throughout. When I left the cinema I couldn't quite believe the Russo brothers had actually managed to pull it off. On the face of it, the film should be a total mess, with too many characters and too many storylines unfolding in unison. But they absolutely smash it, creating a masterpiece which the likes of have never been seen before and most likely will never be seen again.

Thanos is the ultimate villain and about the best I've seen - not just in the superhero genre. His motives and actions throw your moral compass into disarray, creating a dynamic viewing experience. What's more, I can't think of any other film in the MCU where we don't genuinely believe from the outset that our heroes will survive and prevail to save the day, but with Infinity War these certainties cannot be so assured - the stakes are so much higher. The opening scene sets the tone, and from here on in there is no guarantee who will be left standing when the final credits role.

The story throws together characters from across the franchise in the most unexpected fashion - Thor teaming up with his good friends Rabbit and Tree; Tony Stark and Peter Quill fighting Thanos side by side. So much enjoyment stems from these unlikely groupings, and watching all these characters who we know and love, interacting and bouncing off each other, is just the definition of entertainment.

In the end Infinity War has you laughing and crying, often in the same scene, with a finale so shocking and unanticipated that it doesn't lose its impact no matter how many times you watch it over. Overall it is the best Marvel has to offer, and I don't think it will ever be topped. 10/10.","10"

this movie was the most overstuffed and over the top and unnecessary movie i'v ever seen. the dialogue as always seems like its written for 10 year old kids, but what else can you expect from Disney. and of course this movie will make a lot of money and so do the fast and furious movies. people seem to want garbage these days. oh and btw SPOILER! a lot of them die a the en, but guess what. they are guaranteed to come back in Avengers . smh. and i don't fault marvel for their universe filled with MEDIOCRE movies. we blame Disney. kind of how like they ruined last Jedi.

"pinkled5","Fun Movie Despite Repetitive Plot","1 May 2018","I really enjoyed this film. It's biggest weakness was its repetitive plot, but its character interactions were pure joy and the way Thanos was developed as a character was a delight.

PROS:

Great character interactions. Seeing these heroes from diverse properties finally meet and interact in such interesting ways was really satisfying.

Well developed bad guy. Thanos is interesting and compelling as an antagonist with understandable motivations.

Genuinely funny and organic humor. The jokes were not forced and were often derived from character development, not one-liners. I laughed out loud on several occasions.

CONS:

Repetitive main plot. Instead of building and thickening throughout the film, the plot was a series of redundant scenes where Thanos tries to get a stone and the heroes try to stop him.

Less engaging action sequences. There were a few good fight scenes, but some, like the ""climactic"" battle in Wakanda, were a bit underwhelming.","4"

However this, although not a terrible watch was as if they had given the film makers unlimited access to budget and special effects. And the result was as if every instrument in an orchestra was all playing very loudly and all at the same time. Parts felt like I was just watching a computer game and the cgi, and there was a lot of it didn't feel as good as in others. That being said there were more funny parts in this film compared to the others, but was I left thinking about it the next day? No. Would I watch it again? Not unless somebody else asked/forced me to. So overall 6 but more like a high end 5/10 than a solid 6 and I was glad my ticket price was reduced due to an offer.","10"
"bshristov","The movie is a highlight itself. The action doesn't stop for a second...","5 May 2019","This movie has hit all points at the highest level. It was hilarious at some points while still being heartwrenching at others. It portrayed all of the MCU characters very well and gave all of them major rolls in the story while not overpowering any one of them. This movie took major risks and I believe that Marvel executed it to perfection. Overall, Avengers: Infinity War is filled with heart, humor, and sacrifice that help redefine what a hero should be. The Russo brothers have crafted an epic of galactic proportions that will have fans contemplating long after the credits roll.","3"
"ferguson-6","big","25 April 2018","Greetings again from the darkness. We are at the 10 year mark of the new Marvel cinematic universe that began with the revolutionary IRON MAN (2008). This 19th movie in the franchise is actually Part 1 of 2 films that will (supposedly) be the lasting legacy of The Avengers. The second ""half"", much of which was filmed simultaneously with this one, is set for 2019. Co-directing brothers Anthony Russo and Joe Russo were responsible for the two most recent Captain America movies (and also one of my all-time least favorites: YOU, ME AND DUPREE), and have now taken on the biggest budget, biggest cast, and longest run time yet of any Marvel movie. In fact, it's so big, it could only be named 'Infinity'.

Being that the fan base for this movie is highly sensitive to anything resembling a hint, much less a spoiler, this review will tread very lightly, and instead function as an overview with very general observations. There are a few key points, most of which are quite obvious from either the trailers or the previous movies in the series. First thing to realize is that this is a Thanos movie. He's the first big (I told you everything was big), bad, nearly omnipotent villain. It should be noted that Thanos sees himself as misunderstood, which leads to the second key point: melodrama abounds - moreso than any previous comic book movie. It seems to be reminding us that Superheroes are people too (but are they really?). The third point is that if every character with a speaking part simply said ""I am Spartacus"", it would still likely be the longest ever comic book movie. There are at least 28 characters with ""key"" roles - and that's not counting the end credit stinger, or the missing characters we thought we would see, or the one that gets a logo tease as a coming attraction for part 2.

Co-writers Stephen McFeely and Christopher Markus had their hands full in working to come up with a coherent story, while allowing so many familiar characters to have at least one moment in the spotlight, if not a few. The fact that AVENGERS: CIVIL WAR divided the group actually allows for multiple segments to play out concurrently. Though we never doubt these fragmented cliques and isolated individuals will fight to save the galaxy, that doesn't necessarily mean they get the band back together. In fact, it's the Guardians of the Galaxy who are a much more cohesive group than our beloved Avengers. But fear not ... there is plenty of fighting and action to go around.

Thanos claims he is saving many interplanetary civilizations and restoring balance with his plan to eliminate half of all living beings. While there might be some scientific evidence to back up his plan, it doesn't sit well with the good guys. More focus is given to his cravings for ultimate control and power provided by tracking down all six Infinity Stones (Tesseract/Space, Mind, Time, Power, Reality, and Soul) to complete his Infinity Gauntlet. Many of these stones are in quite inconvenient locations and require some ingenuity and brute force from Thanos.

Perhaps the travel agent had the biggest challenge as portions of the film take place in New York City, Knowhere, and Wakanda (good luck finding a brochure on those last two). We also get a budding romance from Vision and Scarlet Witch, as well as annoying quasi-romantic banter between Tony Stark and Pepper Potts. And while we are on the ""TMZ"" portion of the review, it should be noted that both Black Widow and Captain America (introducing himself as Steve Rogers) both have new hair styles - though only one of them sports a beard.

In the realm of comic book movies, this would be considered an epic. It has stunning action sequences, remarkable special effects and some terrific comedy mixed in. Of course, you'll have to accept the melodramatic emotions and fear that we haven't been previously subjected, and know that the final finality doesn't arrive for another year. It's very long (more than 2 ½ hours) but it seems to go pretty quickly. The filmmakers have mostly succeeded in the monumental task of remaining true to the history in order to keep comic book fans satisfied, while also creating something that most should be entertained by. Despite lacking the upbeat, feel-good ending we've grown accustomed to, there is a welcome Stan Lee cameo, a post credit stinger (after about 10 minutes of rolling credits). And to top it off, we get ""Rubberband Man"" from The Spinners. Now that's big!","1"

What really got me though was the scene in Edinburgh, DC had no right to film here and I found it offensive and frankly cruel the way they portrayed Scottish culture. I felt like throwing up in my popcorn box. Another thing that really hit me hard was the death of my old friend Vision. I had a deep emotional and romantic connection to that youngster so when he dissolved or whatever I just couldn't stop the waterworks. Causing me to embarrass myself in front of my girl. I was so bored during the part where Mhanos was mumbling something my brain couldn't even transmit into English I found myself wobbling one of my teeth that was causing me a spot of pain after I bit into a Oreo to hard.

"andrew-york80","A little of everything, makes for an average affair","27 December 2018","I've enjoyed most of the Marvel Universe films but I wasn't as taken with this, basically a little of everyone's favourite characters, but equally not enough of everyone's favourite characters combined to make a slightly less than memorable movie.

One thing though, this was a movie with a message that humanity cannot continue wasting the resources of this planet or face the loss of at least half of what we have on this little planet of ours. Credit for that as we need to wake up to a very harsh future if we carry on as is.","6"
"dfle3","Only for those who are heavily invested in this franchise...they'll be more easily pleased. 40%","3 June 2018","Firstly, let me just admit that I haven't been devotedly watching every film in this series with a tie-in to this latest Avengers' outing. Looking at my reviews at this site, the last one directly related to this one that I saw was this film's immediate predecessor, ""Avengers: Age of Ultron"". From the moment this latest film begins, with superheroes dead or dying on what looks like the aftermath of some epic battle, it gives the impression of having immediately followed on from some previous Marvel film...which I haven't seen...which may or may not be the case. I.e. perhaps there was a film which showed the epic battle of which the opening scene is the aftermath? If so, then, obviously, it might pay to watch every single tie-in film to this one to be in the loop*, so to speak.

Secondly, apart from possibly not being a true stand-alone film, the ending also makes clear that there will have to be another Marvel film which will directly follow-on from the ending of this one. There are some obvious story elements in this latest Marvel film which makes clear that I have missed certain developments from previous Marvel films that I have missed (i.e. chosen to ignore...it looks like the only other Marvel film that I saw before Infnitity War was ""Deadpool"" and I do plan on watching the sequel to that sometime soon). Characters from other franchises also appear...e.g. the Guardians of the galaxy...another Marvel franchise that I have not seen (and the level of comedy that those characters reveal in this film doesn't make me feel like I've missed out on anything by not seeing that other franchise). Other characters, well...I have no idea who these people are...

All that being said, I have to say that none of this is an excuse as to how low the bar has been set for this film, as far as the writing, characterisation and entertainment factor goes. This tends to be a problem with most films in this universe...eventually I just get bored of seeing the sequels...which happened after the first Thor film for me and maybe the third Iron Man film, if I made it that far...or the Spider-Man reboots...perhaps even the latter film(s) of the Tobey Maguire incarnation of the character.

Anyway, the plot of Infinity War concerns a supervillain called ""Thanos"", who seeks to gain great power by collecting ""Infinity Stones"" (most of the names of these stones sound pretty unimpressive...I feel that marketing could have really put more work into coming up with cool sounding stones), which give him various mystical abilities which he uses for warlike purposes. He's already made a start on the collection of Infinity Stones (gotta catch 'em all!). Seeing Thanos in action against superheroes, he really does make them seem like boys fighting against men...who are warriors. An interesting aspect to Thanos' character is his psychology...he wants to collect all the Infinity Stones so that he can bring about much faster his plan to randomly kill fifty per cent of all life in the universe. He espouses reasons such as societies eventually collapsing and dying because there are too many people and not enough resources to sustain them. On that level, he does come across as rational...but is he? In other words, is he just so crazy he has to be stopped? Why fight it? Of course, such plans are anathema to superheroes and they try their best to stop Thanos.

So, the reason that I score this film poorly...it just doesn't try very hard to be entertaining, apart from in the action department. It relies on fans being so obsessed with the characters in this universe that they will lap up every attempted joke the writers have to offer. And the writers lack the wit of a Joss Whedon. For instance, one scene has Thor made to look an idiot (the bit where he tries to harness the power of a star) and another character (Hagrid?) labouring that obvious point as a result. Generally, most of the jokes fail. The odd joke works, but they aren't particularly high calibre. If you absolutely LOVE this universe, the writers are relying on you to be so invested and so well predisposed to these characters that they will have to do very little quality work for you to lap it up. In my review here of ""Age of Ultron"", I think I pondered whether I would continue seeing more films in this series. Based on this film, I think that it might be unlikely.

Contrast that criticism with films that are based on stories unknown to the public and/or with a cast of unknown leads...they can sometimes create a great emotional investment in the characters and story or amuse you with their wit and comedy. With Infinity War, it's all shorthand...the invested viewer has to fill in the gaps which the scriptwriters don't provide themselves, as far as characterisation and humour goes.

Some reviews that I've come across mention that favourite superheroes die in this film. Seeing what Thanos does immediately preceding such events makes me wonder how permanent such an outcome is.

* Having to watch EVERY film with a tie-in to Avengers' films just seems like too high a price to pay. It's not worth it, just for the latest Avengers film to make sense. Being entertained is more important to me, and eventually the sequels bore or the spin-offs underwhelm.

Random observations:

* I saw this film in 2D. It's my strong suspicion that forking out more to watch it in 3D would be a waste of money...nothing really struck me as being particularly geared towards a 3D experience and often Hollywood makes rather pointless 3D movies anyway...just a vacuous way to extract more money from the cinemagoer.

* The closing credits mentions ""Arrested Development character""...I wonder what that refers to.

* Near the start of the closing credits the name ""Okabayashi"" appears...not sure if I noted that accurately...but I did wonder if it was related to a a word I came across which related to the Star Trek universe: ""Kobayashi"" (I had to search a list of Star Trek video games to remind myself of that name!).

* Like a James Bond film, the closing credits have the phrase ""Thanos will return""!

* What's that black thing in Captain America's ear? Which film did I miss to see the explanation of that?","3"

"DrTuvok","Too much stupidity...Maybe it's about high time they lost","17 April 2020","Avengers: Infinity War, Marvel's latest blockbuster, actually got more right than I expected. The opening scene started with a good amount of tension, people died right away, and you begin to think this might be their best one yet.

Then.

The first half an hour ends and the film becomes utterly consumed by a horde of swarming side plots and then completely falls apart in one of the most excruciating drops from decently engaging to excruciating I can think of. With each added character, the emotional stakes lessen and lessen until all you have left is a mental checklist of who you think is going to die. Of course, this wouldn't be a problem but for two things: the Russo bro's utter incompetence in crafting well-made action scenes, and the laughable ridiculousness of the script's attempts to be philosophical. First off, the action scenes. They retain some trippy visuals and entertain on the basic level, but for the most part are reduced to illogical CGI barf where characters are flung around and punched like rag dolls. Yes, the superheroes get beaten in the end, but you never doubt for a second that they will be able to fix it; the climax would have had more emotional heft if Iron Man wasn't always transforming like a liquid Terminator and if Spider Man could quit sprouting more arms and superpowers. All these little pop-up tricks really undermine whatever stakes there are supposed to be in this movie. It's a problem I have with superhero movies in general, that we're watching powerful people beating other powerful people, and succeeding because they have more powers, etc. It just doesn't make a good story. The action culminates, meanwhile, in a massive, shaky-cam, lamely choreographed battle which was probably meant to evoke the Lord of the Rings but I kept getting flashbacks to the Phantom Menace. (Bubble shield to cover the good guys, check. Miniature bubble shields for good guy troops, check. Giant bad guy troop carriers, check. Hordes of cannon-fodder troops, check. What visionaries the Russos are). Once again, the Avengers' strategy is to charge their enemies-forget it, that doesn't even work as a strategy. The battle then revs up and we are treated to so many acts of maximum destruction that all impact is lost. It's like watching a house of cards being atomic bombed. Then, due to a series of tactical blunders, they lose anyway. Just one way for them to win, Doctor Strange says? You might want to check another couple million possibilities because you probably overlooked something.

Okay, on to the script. It attempts to philosophize with its pretty lame villain, Thanos, who is only considered great because he has been teased for so long he must be good, right? He isn't. The movie doesn't even offer any reason why he's wrong other than ""You just can't kill people!"". Well, he's saving the environment, I'm sure Michael Moore would encourage him. The whole thing is just ridiculous. Besides, if he's so concerned about the universe's 'finite resources', why doesn't he just use the all-powerful Infinity McGuffins to create more resources instead of killing a bunch of people? Can he not do this even when he has a 'reality stone' that controls reality or something like that? It's total nonsense. The writers are good at making you laugh, but when it comes to anything serious or thought provoking they're doomed.

Well, at least we still have the characters, and seeing them lose was pretty refreshing after their string of 20 some victories. But then you get on to Endgame, and this movie looks like an artistic masterpiece...","1"

Defying physics and common sense, defying background story that was building up for 10 years. A bunch of ppl runnung around having fun, looked like a party movie.

It was like a potpourri: we've recently seen every scene in a bunch of another super hero movies. Even the final sequence is similar to X-men. All those ""professional critics"" who write these prepaid positive reviews for yet another Disney's garbage should be ashamed of themselves. Is there nothing saint left in the world?

It is no exaggeration to say that Infinity War delivers on every level despite having the unenviable task of telling a HUGE story and somehow balancing this story that takes place on two planets with more super heroes then there have been in any super hero movie before or since.

This is a task that would be difficult for even the most seasoned of film makers. Fortunately they brought on the writers from Captain America The First Avenger, Winter Soldier and Civil War. Of course the one thing that made this whole thing work was the Russo brothers. At the end of the day those two guys and all the talent involved pulled everything together and delivered something truly special.

Infinity War finds Thanos and his Black Order: Ebony Maw, Corvus Glaive, Proxima Midnight and Cull Obsidian searching for the Infinity Stones. Along the way, the Guardians meet up with Thor, Doctor Strange, Iron Man, Spider-man in an effort to stop the mad Titan.

Coming back from his self imposed exile is the man himself, Captain America who realizes that even though the Avengers are scattered, him, Black Widow, Falcon, Bruce Banner, War Machine, Black Panther and the armies of Wakanda are the only ones who can possibly stand in the way of Thanos carrying out his plan to destroy half the life in the universe.

Infinity War is a staggering sci-fi, action-packed, highly emotional piece of cinema that will bring out the tears in even the staunchest of movie critics. The finale of this movie is... something to behold. You know this movie worked when it leaves you thinking ""My God... NOW WHAT?!"".

Avengers Infinity War has everything I wished the first two Avengers films could have been, and it's obviously necessary viewing for anybody who wants to see Endgame. Obviously though, a LOT of MCU movies are mandatory viewing for going into Endgame anyway.

"xamtaro","When a ""fun"" experience can overshadow all other shortcomings","1 May 2018","So this is the big one. Ten years in the making, 18 movies in a franchise leading to this. Despite the sky high expectations stemming from the popularity of its preceding films, AVENGERS INFINITY WAR delivers the wide appeal, casual friendly entertainment one has come to expect from the Marvel Cinematic Universe brand. Only that this time, Marvel studios takes it a notch higher.

AVENGERS INFINITY WAR is bigger from the get go. The scope is expanded from earth to the entire universe as the alien warlord Thanos' personally expedites his quest to retrieve the powerful infinity gems for his own ends. Gems which are closely tied to the fates of this world's greatest heroes. Through perfectly logical (within the context of the story) means and reasons, the actions of Thanos and his servants end up bringing together heroes from across all the past MCU movies.

How does the movie juggle so many characters at once? Well it does so very well. All the characters get a decent amount of time in the spotlight. Half the fun is seeing these characters that you grew to love in their respective movies come together and interact on screen; characters who merely years ago would have no reason to be interacting. Who would have imagined StarLord, whose adventures are at the far end of the cosmos, would be talking face to face with the earth based Iron Man? The cast is perfect in every way with decent chemistry even among those interacting for the very first time on screen.

The one thing i really appreciated was the more serious tone, carried on from Black Panther earlier in 2018. A pet peeve of mine has been this obsession with throwing in random quips and comedic moments into the middle of a hectic battle, a tense dialogue or a tension filled face off. This has plagued more than half of MCU movies and all it serves is to trivialise the stakes and destroy any attempt to take the movie seriously. Thankfully, the stakes here are more dire than anything ever seen in the MCU. INFINITY WAR does have witty banter, but this is kept separate from the drama; a very welcome change.

I can safely say that the movie entertains. Its energetic script and fast pace makes the long run time zoom by. There are multiple sub plots but nothing too complex if you are paying attention. The awesome action sequences are finger bitingly intense and the highlight of the entire movie. All this is set to some of composer Alan Silvestri's best musical work yet. S

I can also safely say that this movie is not perfect. As amazing as the action was, some of the fights are just overly choreographed, more like a dance than a fight. Personally, I would have preferred something more raw in the fights.

The story too comes across as a little shallow, especially compared to CAPTAIN AMERICA CIVIL WAR and BLACK PANTHER which managed to weave in some relevant sociopolitical commentary that generate discussion. INFINITY WAR touches on themes of self sacrifice, and a Machiavellian take on population control, but it never brings those themes front and centre.

Instead what is front and centre is the laughs, the action, the tears, and other simple emotional appeals. The fact that all the characters enter and leave this movie ""as they are"" rather than undergo development through the course of the narrative makes it feel like a season finale to a saturday morning cartoon. Whatever development comes about suddenly in the closing moments rather than organically as the story plays out.

On a whole, I would describe AVENGERS INFINITY WAR as this big reunion party. It sells itself on the experience rather than the story. The experience of a loyal fanbase being rewarded after 10 years of loyalty. The experience of that roller coaster ride through flash CGI graphics all ""woohoo"" and ""yea!"" and being able to enjoy it in the company of like minded individuals. It is a party more than a movie. Who cares about overly convenient events that drive the plot, who cares about unremarkable cinematography and overly hectic action sequences. Who cares about deeper themes, symbolism and narrative depth. It makes me feel awesome. Exactly like a good party.","8"

"justinwfirestone","Steve and Bucky ride again","2 May 2018","Avengers: Infinity War is a whole movie. Actually, it's a movie and a half of a half of a movie, because it comes in hot at roughly 150 minutes of punch-you-in-the-face, stab-you-in-the-chest, blow-your-hair-around, melt-your-skin-off, shave-your-back action. Phew! The movie should come with a moist towlette or two, or at least a travel-sized pack of tissues.

Thanos is big, bad, and blue (I think). He believes, much like I do, that overpopulation and scarce resources lead to strife and suffering. Instead of using infinity stones to do something like, say, increase crop output or resiliency to pests, he decides to harvest the infinity stones and put them into a really cheap looking metal gauntlet. Then, at the flick of a finger, he can make exactly half of the universe's (humanoid) populations flake away like chaff in the wind.

This begs several questions, of course. First, what if there are an odd number of humanoids in the universe? Do we get to round up or round down? Would that be on a universe, planet, or spaceship basis? Do the infinity gems use a truly random algorithm to determine which half die? If it is a psuedo-random algorithm, can we deduce a non-stochastic, deterministic pattern?

Next question: once half the universe is gone, is that it? Do we wait for it to sort of build back up to crisis levels and then flick the fist finger again? Or do we eliminate half the population every month or so, logarithmically and asymptotically reducing the universe's humanoid population to zero?

I digress. Bucky and Steve do not kiss, not even with crappy CGI.","10"
"edcochran","Disappointed","28 April 2018","Had great expectations for this movie. Unfortunately, I was rather disappointed. Tons of action and special effects, but I found myself getting bored. And the ending was horrible. Everyone around me in the theater seemed to have the same reaction. And the comments I heard afterwards seemed to echo my opinion. Sorry I rushed out to see it opening weekend. Won't be surprised if box office results drop dramatically next weekend as word of mouth gets around.","6"
"JacobsReviews","Could've Been Over Way Sooner","5 July 2020","It seems Doctor Strange vastly underused his powers in New York when Thanos' henchmen come to take the time stone. Later, Doctor Strange is using his full arsenal while battling Thanos one-on-one, so it seems strange he doesn't use his full powers earlier.

Also, the whole side-quest where Thor and Rocket embark on a mission to get a new hammer for Thor is boring and could have been deleted to shorten run-time.

Captain America's entrance into the movie by saving Vision is really cool and the Wakanda fight scenes are entertaining. The end where Thanos actually captures all six infinity stones is a surprising twist and kind of cool knowing the Avengers lost this round, but will surely be back for more.

For the most part, Marvel needs to be applauded for meshing all their characters into a solid, entertaining movie, that's not without inconsistencies, but a pretty good all around Avenger movie.","6"
"biohazardguru","Not a very good movie","22 August 2018","The main reason i'm giving this movie 1/10 is because this one doesn't deserve the current rating that it has(at the moment of writing this is 8.6, I would refer to other current movie ratings at the moment of writing this review). A rating of 8.6 means that this movie is as good as The matrix(8.7), Saving private Ryan(8.6), Memento(8.5), Interstellar(8.6) and also that it is better than Mr. Nobody(7.9) and Synecdoche, New York(7.5), etc.

This is the result of a movie with lots of fans who don't have any idea how to rate a movie and usually haven't seen much. at the most I would give this movie a 5.3, it is not so bad and it's enjoyable not memorable. Too many jokes and this is not a comedy, it doesn't seem to have a script not giving a chance for the actors to actually act.

In the movie they combine cinematography of some of the other movies related to this franchise, so in some instances the quality drops really low to the point you feel as if you're watching a really bad TV series, most CG effects are on point and sometimes not(the hulk buster).

I personally don't understand who would give a score of 10/10 or 9/10 so easily to a movie no one will remember next year.","1"
"zardoz-13","One of Marvel's Best Adventures!!!","24 May 2018","Disney's latest Marvel Studios' blockbuster superhero epic ""Avengers: Infinity War"" finally gives us a villain we not only can love but also loath with equal passion because he considers himself the epitome of mercy. Few supervillains share Thanos' warped point of view as well as his staggering supremacy. After several cameos in earlier Marvel epics, the long-awaited Thanos devastates everybody and everything in his path like an apocalypse. Just about every Marvel superhero shows up to hamper this doomsday juggernaut from looting the universe for those six ultra-powerful Infinity Stones that auger ill for the future. ""Captain America: Winter Soldier"" and ""Captain America: Civil War"" co-directors Joe and Anthony Russo and ""Captain America"" co-writers Stephen McFeely and Christopher Markus have delivered a sequel that indisputably surpasses its predecessors, but it is debatable that Marvel can elevate the stakes much higher in later sequels for a villain as formidable as Thanos. Moreover, the greatest criticism many may raise is that their favorite Marvel superhero may have been short changed in this saga owing to a lack of time to streamline everybody into the storyline.

Actually, most of the superheroes have more than enough time, while the peripheral entities, like Loki, perish in the first scene and those that ensue. Clocking in at a marathon two hours and 36 minutes, ""Avengers: Infinity War"" will challenge anybody's bladder. Unless you're a dialysis patient, you'll have to schedule your departures, so you'll miss either the least amount of high-octane action or expository dialogue. Back in the good ole days, Hollywood provided audiences with intermissions to purge their urges. Problem is the brothers Russo and their scenarists never squander a second in their narrative. Perhaps somebody will create an app that will enable us via Wi-Fi to watch on our smart phones what will would normally miss during flights to and from the lavatory. Meantime, the Russo Brothers maintain a straightforward, serious tone throughout this superhero mash-up, sprinkling the action with amusing quips, especially about Wakanda possibly getting a Starbucks Coffee Shop since Black Panther wants to open his homeland up to the world. No, ""Avengers Infinity War"" isn't a parody like ""Thor: Ragnarok."" Despite its abundant length, the filmmakers take enough time to update certain characters, such as Thor, and give us glimpses into the past about how Thanos saved a young Gamora. What may dishearten some Marvel fans is Thanos doesn't take a licking. Instead, he delivers the licking, taking down virtually every Marvel champion as irrevocably as a bowling ball smashing ten-pins during a strike.

""Avengers' Infinity War"" picks up where ""Thor: Ragnarok"" left off. Thanos (Josh Brolin) boards the Asgardian spaceship with the Ragnarok survivors. Incidentally, he wears a helmet and uniform in a nod to Jim Starlin's graphic novel ""The Infinity Gauntlet"" (1991). He wears a massive gauntlet on his left fist that will eventually be encrusted with six stones. Thanos sheds the helmet. He vanquishes Thor (Chris Hemsworth) and the Hulk (Mark Ruffalo) in brief but brutal combat. He tortures Thor for the whereabouts of the Tesseract, and Loki (Tom Hiddleston) reluctantly surrenders it. Not only does Thanos dispatch Loki but also Heimdall. Before Heimdall (Idris Elba) dies, he summons the Bifrost and hurtles Hulk back to Earth. Once he possesses the Space stone, Thanos destroys the ship. Meantime, Hulk plunges into New York City. He has reverted to Bruce Banner. Worst, he cannot conjure up the Hulk. Thanos' cronies invade New York. They hover above the Big Apple in a colossal ring-shaped spacecraft. Peter Parker (Tom Holland) is riding in a school bus, driven by Marvel honcho Stan Lee in his inevitable cameo, when this monstrosity appears over Manhattan. Dr. Strange (Benedict Cumberbatch), Spider-man, Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.) tangle with these sinister extraterrestrials that want Strange's Time stone. Eventually, our superheroes stow away onboard the departing alien ship, and Spider-man discovers that his new suit helps him survive. More of Thanos' toadies rampage into Scotland to bring back the Mind stone embedded in Vision's forehead. Scarlett Witch (Elizabeth Olsen) fights alongside Vision (Paul Bettany) to repulse these wicked adversaries.

In a riff on the rescue mission in ""Alien,"" the Guardians of the Galaxy receive a distress call. When they reach the scene of the destruction, they can only save Thor. The Guardians split into two groups, and Rocket Raccoon and Groot accompany Thor to the planet Nidavellir, where Eitri (Peter Dinklage) forges a replacement battle-axe christened Stormbreaker, so the son of Odin can intervene in a life-and-death fracas back on Earth in Wakanda. Captain America (Chris Evans), Black Panther (Chadwick Boseman), Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson), and Bucky Barnes (Sebastian Stan) confront more of Thanos' subhuman armies out to get 'the Mind Stone.' The creation of Thor's new hammer is exhilarating stuff. No matter what this army of superheroes does, Thanos manages to subjugate them at every turn. Eventually, once he has acquired all six stones, the Titan snaps his fingers, and half of the universe expires like dust in the wind. Barnes, Black Panther, Groot, Scarlet Witch, Mantis, Drax, Star Lord, Dr. Strange, and Spider-man dissolve into smoke. At one point, our heroes nearly relieve Thanos of the Infinity gauntlet, until Star Lord infuriates the purple giant. Ultimately, Iron Man, Thor, Banner, Rocket Raccoon, Captain America, and Black Widow survive this frightening Armageddon.

Anybody familiar with Jim Starlin's ""The Infinity Gauntlet,"" the film's ostensible source material, knows the graphic novel and film share few similarities. For example, in the Starlin's ""Gauntlet,"" Thanos has acquired all six infinity gems from the start. Conversely, in the movie, Thanos embarks on a scavenger hunt for these essential crystals. The film jettisons Thanos' futile infatuation with Mistress Death. More than thirty superheroes wind up on casualty list, and the Earth is catapulted out of orbit. Nevertheless, everything that Thanos did was undone. The biggest surprise about ""Avengers: Infinity War"" is the triumph of Thanos over the heroes. Presumably, the sequel will undo the evil Titan's victory.","9"

"kjell-ahlstrom","Fanservice gone wrong","5 May 2018","Half of this movie is really great, the other half is great fan service, but ultimately shouldn't have been in the movie.

This is mostly a movie about Thanos. It is also a movie about Thor, Dr Strange, Ironman, Spiderman and the Guardians of the Galaxy.

Then there are so many more characters in it that just steal screen time and drags the movie on and on, well past its expiration date. I know that not having those characters show up would have also been cause for concern, but adding them in this way really brings this movie down from possible greatness to mediocrity.

There are also a lot of other issues with this movie regarding the fluctuating power levels, the painfully bad spirit stone sacrifice monologue, the accomplishment of killing more protagonists than almost any other movie and doing so without either me or any of their own friends really caring, etc.

The biggest sin though is working up a world for ten years and ending up giving us a terrible X McGuffins coming together plot, and a villain that has an interesting idea about the world and the laziest worst, least thought through plan of enacting his vision. There are so many flaws with his half-population-solution I don't even know where to begin. It is so bad it isn't even villain of the week material on Netflix or the CW.

It is however still have low stakes despite many of the characters died. We can all know for sure they'll be back in the second movie. I hate the comedy they're not funny and they never was. Performance wise they're even more cringe than they were, the only one that really stands out is probably Thanos. I don't think you can ever take a movie seriously where the antagonist is a giant purple guy and everyone else shoots laser beams and stuff. It comes off as a bit silly and will always be no matter how serious they want it to be. Some action scenes were entertaining because the characters can manipulate stuff and it's pretty clever how they did it but that's just it, the rest is people smashing each other like we've seen a million times over. It is as good as it can be and it is definitely one of the better ones.","6"
"Jemae","Not too bad","26 April 2018","I didn't mind the film, some parts of it were good and some were meh. What I enjoyed was some of the more subtle humour in it. Like other Marvel MCU films, the humour seems forced, but with this one, they have toned it down. There are still some (to me) forced humour in there however it's not too much over the top. The scene where Stan Lee makes an appearance as the school bus driver is funny... I did enjoy the different planets that some of the characters were on.

What I didn't enjoy and this is the reason I give it a 6/10 is things have become undone in the film, for example, Thor is given an eye...So what was the point in him losing it in Thor Ragnarok? There's a scene where Scarlet Witch destroys the stone in Visions head....it's an emotional scene and it's hard for her to do it but she succeeds......only to have Thanos bring him back and take the stone out of his head, which kills him anyway... *sigh* Doing that only makes the previous action or movie weak and pointless.

One of your favourite character's (the Hulk) who is shown in the trailer only has 15 seconds on screen....so no it wasn't all of the Avengers there. It didn't make sense why the Hulk was afraid and wouldn't ""join the gang"". I think it was so the writers could make Thanos unstoppable in the story. The movie would have ended a lot sooner if the Hulk was there. What a cop out.

The ending of the film didn't make sense but was interesting enough. Once Thanos had all the stones, people started turning into dusk or leaves, Peter Parker disappears and that actually got me...that was the saddest part of the film. He was just a kid, who was trying to help out. However there will be another Spiderman film and I predict that somehow Marvel will find a way of bringing him back. It was a good ""twist"" to the film, I don't actually know what it means....but it looks like we might be going back to the original Avengers.

Would I watch it again?.......Yes, Of course I will, it was still an alright movie.","10"

"cliftonofun","Sometimes more is less","30 April 2018","Unpopular opinion: the Avengers movies have been suffering from the law of diminishing returns. The solo movies still work brilliantly, but the giant ensembles started collapsing under the weight of characters and plot lines right around when Ultron showed up. This one faired slightly better for a few reasons. First, the giant cast divided and conquered, allowing for A, B, C, D, and E plots - and each story worked pretty well. Second, they have introduced so many new (and funny) characters to the MCU that this edition was infused with some fresh energy and laughter. Buuuut...there were still too many characters. A movie like this cannot reach the heights of Homecoming, Ragnorok, or Black Panther. Less is more. So this film inevitably succumbed to being more about setting up future franchises than about the characters themselves. It was fun and intense, but I'm looking forward to when the stories get smaller and more focused again.","10"

This is by far the best super hero film ever made and for me one of the best films I've ever seen. I'd give it 20 out of 10 if I could. Fantastic.

"Aaron1375","Exactly what I was hoping for and what I've been waiting for","2 July 2018","I enjoy the whole Marvel comic universe thing they have going on now as to me having beloved characters I have seen in the comics and were a part of my childhood on the big screen is simply amazing. Then, like a comic book, I can be watching one characters film and another hero can appear. I loved crossover comics and I love crossover movies as well! This film features several comic book characters and Thanos, whom I have been anticipating in a Marvel movie since they teased him in the original Avengers film. I was disappointed a bit by the second Avengers film (still enjoyed it overall) as they went with Ultron as the villain and then later got more disappointed when I read somewhere that the Abomination was originally going to be in the film, but they scrapped the idea. That would have really given that film the kick it needed. This one though was not a disappointment at all as I got to see Thanos be as totally awesome as he is in the comics and I got to see many of my favorite superheros on the big screen at the same time!

The story has Thanos, the mad titan, collecting infinity stones as he makes quick work of both the Hulk and Thor! The Asgardian ship seen in the previous Thor film is decimated as Thanos collects yet another stone and soon sends his children to Earth to collect the stone within Vision's forehead and the one protected by Dr. Strange. Thanos, himself, goes to the collector to retrieve the stone left in the Collector's care. Tony Stark ends up getting a warning from old friend Bruce Banner who gets back to Earth thanks to Heimdall and soon the children of Thanos make their attack as Tony must once again don the Iron Man armor to fight off these attackers and try to protect Dr. Strange's time stone. He gets some help from his friendly neighborhood protege, but all three end up on the ship of this weird dude who has very powerful telekinetic powers. Bruce Banner is left on Earth and he makes the call to Captain America who has to try and hold off the hordes of creatures that come for Vision's stone and does so by going to Wakanda where he will get the aid of the Black Panther and his old friend. Meanwhile, the Guardians of the Galaxy recover Thor and soon Thor, Groot and Rocket go to a place where Thor can get a powerful weapon to fight Thanos, while the rest of the Guardians try to stop Thanos at the Collector's. The power Thanos wields though is truly terrifying and things keep becoming vastly more difficult for all the heroes!

The thing I enjoyed most was seeing all the different heroes interacting together. I was not expecting Dr. Strange, Spider-man or the Guardians to be in the film as much as they were. I was expecting more like extended cameos. I enjoyed watching Iron Man and the group on Titan fighting Thanos as they did a really amazing job of combating him. The only thing I wish there was more of is Captain America as he just did not really factor into the movie much at all being a bit ineffective. I also want him back with his regular shield too! Still, just a minor complaint in a movie that completely wowed me for the most part.

So yes, this was a very good comic book movie. I do believe I enjoyed it more than the first Avenger film which I also loved as this one was just so overwhelming and did so many cool things. This one also featured the best villain in Thanos, who they did really good with, making him almost sympathetic at times. The action was great in this one as all the battles were totally off the chain and as I said watching Dr. Strange, Iron Man and Starlord together on the same screen was simply great. I look forward to the next Avengers film coming thankfully next year. At first I thought it was not coming out until 2020, that would have been a very difficult wait!","10"

"EM-69079","Entertaining for a while, annoying overall","7 May 2018","It's a mediocre superhero movie, and definitely not a good movie.

The action scenes are so busy and cut you're sick after 5 minutes. The images are fine but FX are too much. Sounds and effects are very loud and all over the place. This is for the technical stuff.

Thanos actually makes for a good villain, character-wise. I'd say it's the only character in this franchise with a bit of weight at this point, and that's nice. But his plan is dumb and even his Death-boner makes weirdly more sense, but oh well.

Then, you realize Black Widow and other regular humans are as strong as Cap, Vision gets nerfed to hell, etc. At least they have the decency to leave Hawkeye retired. Might change thought, sadly.

And man oh man the jokes. More jokes than in freaking Deadpool. It's supposed to be the end of the universe for Christ's sake. The additional ""meta-jokes"" with Dinklage dealing with cringy GoT references are the worst. They're trying to add gravitas and sadness in the movie but you end up rooting for Thanos to end it once and for all.

Though I have been pleased enough to see Marvel revitalized with the films of the last almost 20 years, to me, and no doubt countless die hard comic fans out there, the Marvel Cinematic Universe falls short of greatness, occupying a slot just below the somewhat lackluster Ultimate line of Marvel titles. A never impressive Hulk, a sickening to behold Thor, a HUGE lack of characters that are mainstays of Marvel comics, but have, like with the trend in comics themselves, been retconned out of films, the avengers series are okay at first, but lose value after rewatching but a few times. Enter the most pathetic Thanos this side of a poorly written What IF issue. ( Dont get the reference? Well too bad, go read some old comics ya posers) Thanos, voiced by Josh Brolin, sounded less booming and profoundly intimidating than the ""Mad Titan"" should have. Also quickly doing away with Thanos' armor in lieu or undergarments that make it seem like he just came from the gym, brah, and way too much emphasis on Thanos being overly emotional, and not that bad a fella, I felt myself getting sick through some of the film.

Alongside what seemed like a very rushed story, even for the first of a two parter, there should have been more meat to the bones of this film considering how few big league heroes were actually present. But it seems this was kinda glazed over with the multitude of second string characters introduced in the VERY recent Black Panther film ( and perhaps that was partially the intent upon its own release). Still the nostalgia was more palpable than all the other films combined, which was no doubt Disneys intention so as to best satiate the lust for that bygone era of comic sanctity that so many have longed for. Seeing a few of the avengers mish mashed, with different hair colors, or a bear, or lack thereof, almost added some much needed character depth, but was too obvious a ploy to be convincing of how hard times had lead to even harder ones. At least the jeers, tears, and reactions of people in the theater, comprised of many age groups, was sufficient enough to swing me toward a more moderate positive vote. Infinity war had a decent amount of action, emotion, but still felt too forced. So for nostalgias sake, I can give this no more than a 7/10. Enjoy, but Brolin will likely do better( not saying much) as Cable in the upcoming Deadpool 2...>,;,<","6"

So let me just ask the obvious... why do you bother in the first place? Second, many of you have stated there's no plot. Have you not seen the 29 movies prior or is this your first marvel movie? I'm guessing this is your first. Lol This movie was a treat. I honestly expected to be disappointed and boy was I wrong. I tried to critique it and judge it harshly and I can honestly say this film won my heart. It had that Bane from Batman feel and as much as I hate to admit it... I like when the bad guy accomplishes his mission once in a while. It's satisfying. Not because I'm pure evil or anything but because it goes away from tradition or the norm. It's bold, daring, and a fun ride. If this is your first marvel movie or you think there's no plot do everyone a favor and don't comment.","3"

I like superhero movies as entertainment, but some, like Dr. Strange, have something more... The first Avengers was so boring that it was the first movie I slept almo all over... This one I didn't, but now I think it'd be better if I did... Of course I hated that everyone that matters died, but, it wasn't just that, this was only the rotted cherry of one big bad cake! The worst part was that everyone who had great power did the opposite of what they use to do, and here is the inconsistency....

Worse, we're subjected to a farce, where Thanos can pulverize the Hulk and Thor (who has chosen to not use lightning for no apparent reason at all) in 3 seconds, but Captain America can hold his fist open for nearly ten seconds. Where Dr. Strange absolutely no, sorry but, cannot, ever, hand over that time-stone, but apparently sees no particular need to jump back in time and maybe reverse being on that ship in the first place? (Maybe even *gasps* turn back time until Starlord does not punch Thanos in the face? Or, why not trap Thanos in the sort of time-loop he used last time at the end of his movie? If I, a plebeian audience, can think of this, why can't Strange?). Where everyone tries to pull off Thanos' glove, and no one thinks of putting his arm through one of those yellow-Strange-portal thingys and chopping said arm off, which we know worked perfectly well on Thanos' kid. Where Loki, who can survive falling off the Bifrost and through space, apparently decides trying to stab Thanos with a dagger makes more sense than taking Thor and jumping out a window and letting the vacuum of space kill everyone on Thanos' side who *can* be killed by that, since it's been a fact since he fell off the Bifrost that both he and Thor are immune to dying in space. Worse!!! Where Heimdall teleports Hulk back to earth, because apparently Hulk is more important than the King??? I will not even get started on poor Steve, Wanda, and Vision's arcs, or Starlord's. All I will say is that it IS trading lives if you trade 10,000 foot-soldier's lives for one Vision, and Starlord might be shallow but he DOES have a brain.

That´s why if the second part keeps this pace of this bad, bad plot... I'll never more watch one movie of this franchise.","10"
"rogerg100","Not as good and not as bad as many write","29 May 2018","This movie is actually better than I expected but not in the top 100 movies of all time nor in the top 10 of this year. Don't expect much or any character development in this movie. 95% of all the characters were already introduced in previous Marvel movies. You would have had to have seen at least ten others marvel movies to get any joy out of this movie .

So this one goes straight to the action .The super heroes are in groups and they fight separate fights and the movie seems scattered . The obvious plot does not make up for it, the characters do not develop further , it often feels more like a good computer game then a movie. So cannot give it more than a 7 * .

It is not as bad as you might expect from such a movie and the plot does get a bit more interesting, however simplistic it is... Super heros are no longer invincible , unfortunately many of them are still far from human . We cannot really identify with them or estimate if any of their actions actually make any sense - we are a spectators, like spectators of a video game we have never seen before.. For example how much punishment can a super hero or super villain take before he dies, we have no idea and there is no gauge. Sometimes they just get up again other times not..

The movie does have some interesting sub plots and parts to it , yes even the villains have a human side. Nevertheless the main villains motive for wanting to destroy half the universe is unsatisfactory, at best .

The good part is that it is not too predictable, the movie has good CGI and well actually good actors in most of the roles.","9"

"kirejkinav","Best Marvel movie.","19 January 2022","Avengers: Infinity War is the 3rd Avengers movie, and 19th in the MCU. This movie can rightly be called the best movie about the Avengers, and can be compared with the first Iron Man in terms of quality. The main villain is Thanos, one of the most interesting villains in cinema in my opinion.

The trailer for Infinity War has become the most viewed trailer on YouTube, with over 230 million views to date. The film itself was excellent, and the villain was extraordinary. Thanos, starting all his atrocities, had a goal that is different from fantasy films, where evil aliens just want to kill someone for power. Thanos had his goal, which is not so crazy, because he considered the topic of 'overpopulation', which was and is relevant at the moment. Also, I was very pleased that each of the teams, and each hero in the film, and there were quite a few of them, was given enough time. Of course, we can say that there were interesting coincidences, like the meeting between Thor and the Guardian of the Galaxy, but then it became interesting to watch this team, and I want to say thank you/","1"
"ThomasDrufke","Unprecedented","29 April 2018","The two things that Marvel movies have always been under criticism for are their villains and lack of stakes. Not only does Infinity War put those criticisms away, it takes full advantage of the gravitas of the comic book it's based on. I can't really imagine a better way that the MCU could have closed out a 19 movie arc, while also perfectly setting up the final (for now) installment next May.

In one of the gutsiest and deadliest superhero films to date, The Russo Brothers have once again delivered a meaningful and thought provoking entry into the MCU. I don't know how they did it, but they managed to give all 30 something characters time to shine while also giving several of the big Avengers or Guardian related characters an impactful arc of their own. There are very minute pacing issues that perhaps some casual fans may take issue with, but for someone who has been with this universe from the beginning, I ate it all up. I'm not sure there are any directors who could have possibly executed this story as well as The Russo brothers did.

As with Age of Ultron, I worried that the tone of the trailers (dark and serious) wouldn't really translate to the movie, as the MCU is known for its humor. Ultron was a very funny movie but it still felt like a missed opportunity to not have a little more emotional weight to that story. Luckily, Infinity War brilliantly balances humor, heart, and some serious sh*t that goes down in this adventure-heist-thriller.

Much like its comic-book counterpart, Infinity War follows Thanos (and it's largely his story) and his quest for the 6 Infinity stones which gives him the power to wipe out half the universe. How can you possibly give someone like that shades of humanity and an understandable motivation? Well somehow they did it, and when Thanos or someone else does things that bring the emotion out of him, it's some of the best sequences of the film.

Most impressively, the Russo's and the writers figured out a way to pick up where we left each character while also making it fit into an Avengers story that needed them to more specific things related to a bigger threat. In other words, this film is driven by characters and not plot. As much as I love Age of Ultron, it feels more like a film that had their characters act based on where the filmmakers wanted the plot to go (i.e. Thor's quest in the middle of the film). Infinity War is far from that, and is clearly structured by filmmakers who still have stories left to tell in this universe.

I could go on and on about specific plot elements, scene stealers, surprises, and the bold direction the film takes, but I decided to take a more vague approach to this review to not spread the spoilery thoughts that the internet has been filled with the past few days. In short, Infinity War is the most balls to the wall film Marvel has ever done, but still fills it with brilliantly quiet moments that made Civil War and Winter Soldier so groundbreaking.

"alphaomega-57581","Marvel united (part 3)","7 November 2019","Here comes the ""Marvel"" movie with sympathies for a supervillain, introduced first in 2012s ""Marvel's Avengers"" post-credit scene. His name is ""Thanos"", motion-capturly performed by actor Josh Brolin, known for Academy Award winning ""No Country for Old Men"" directed by the 'Coen Brothers'. The badass character is coming from outer space to enslave Earth as pathway stone and sweep the entire universe from, in his perspective scum of the galaxies.

What the directors 'Russo Bros.' and producer Kevin Feige achieved here on an 300 million plus production budget comes close to perfect digital movie-making. All characters involved, interlink with there predecessor movies since 2008 ""Iron Man"", starring Robert Downey Jr. as Tony Stark, who again also here leads the storyline to an inevitable thunder-slashing showdown at ""Black Panther's"" Wakanda battlefield of clashing ""Marvel"" superheroes versus ""Thanos"" supervillain army of beasts.

I liked this picture very much. It reminiscences films from my youth, when political correctness were stretched to the maximum, winning 'Best Picture' Academy awards and the protagonist's nemesis won the rules of the game; as in ""French Connection"" (1971) Fernando Rey's drug-trafficking crime kingpin - ""Silence of the Lambs"" (1991) Anthony Hopkins' Hannibal Lecter - ""Scarface"" (1983) Al Pacino's 'The World is Yours' striking Tony Montana, and surprisingly cliffhanging devil pirat 'Davy Jones', performed by technically revolutionizing mo-cap acting Bill Nighy in ""Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest"" of summer 2006.","10"

"octomancer","The plot is the main problem - big holes, silly reasons and cheap, cheesy tricks","27 December 2018","I'm no fanboy, but I'm not a hater either. I've watched 15 or so of the MCU films and I've loved a few of them (Iron Man, Winter Soldier, Avengers Assemble, Civil War, Ragnarok) and at least enjoyed most of the rest.

The plot really is the problem here. The characters do stupid or out of character things just to move the film forward.

My biggest problem is the scene on Titan where Iron Man, Dr Strange, Spiderman, Star Lord, Drax & Mantis try to take the gauntlet from Thanos. Once Mantis has Thanos' mind subdued there was any number of ways in which they could have won the fight right there. In fact, they *were* winning the fight. They nearly had the gauntlet off (in the slowest, most difficult way possible ... why didn't they hack Thanos' arm off?) Instead, they bicker like children and Starlord slaps Thanos, breaking the mind control allowing Thanos to win and escape. This was so unsatisfying as to spoil the whole film for me.

I totally didn't buy Thanos' love for Gamora. That came out of nowhere and was just a cheesy plot device to elicit an emotional reaction from the audience. It also provided a framework to hang the recovery of the soul stone on, otherwise it would have been as exciting as a UPS delivery.

On the subject of Thanos, his motive for assembling the stones is lame. To snap his fingers and destory half of the beings in existence. For ""balance"". Wut? Ok, it makes a terrifying objective, but is very shallow.

Another recurring problem was the complete lack of logic in some of the fights. There's a basic problem of combining ordinary humans, albeit highly skilled and trained, with superhumans, be they gods, titans, aliens or whatever. Characters that were utterly outclassed inexplicably lasted more than a few seconds.

Black Widow against any of the Black Order should have only one outcome, very quicly. The Black Order wiped the floor with Scarlet Witch and Vision (who is powered by an Infinity Stone!) yet Black Widow doesn't die against them. Twice. BW is cool and all, but is just an un-augmented, highly skilled human. Sorry, nah. Also, that Black Order dude who wrapped Thor up in metal at the start gets killed cheesily by Iron Man blowing a hole in his spaceship. Nah, not buying that either. Thanos' power was theoretically increasing hand over fist (sorry) with every Infinity Stone he gained, but he won or lost fights throughout the film not based on how powerful he is but by whether or not the plot need a win or loss to move forward. Many other encounters in this logicless vein.

Cheesy deaths. You just know that most of the characters who died will come back. Therefore there is no gravitas to any of it. Cheap tricks.

It *was* visually spectacular and I thought the script was pretty good, where it wasn't labouring under ridiculous plotting. The action scenes were spectacularly good as usual, if wildly illogical at times.

Overall, not as satisfying as I wanted it to be. Like I say, i'm no fanboy but I was ready to love this film.","1"

The action sequences were epic. The plot had holes that were just as big.

Sure, some of those might be resolved in the next movie, and the heroes will probably win in the end, but the ending was an anti-climax, made worse because of the needlessly sappy and drawn out failures of all the different Avengers.

At the end of the movie, no one left the cinema. The audience sat there stunned, waiting for some glimmer of hope. It never came. There was defeat. There was death. There wasn't the satisfying victory to help ease the long set up and the forced attempts at humor. Even the post-credit teaser was depressing.

I won't write this movie off completely given there's more to come, but disappointing to have to wait until the next movie for some catharsis.","8"
"jaredc-24231","The Russo's make their draw and leave us perfectly in awe...","23 July 2019","Much more engaging and far superior to its predecessor Avenger films...Infinity War is the movie we were all waiting for . 10 years build-up and it came down upon us, with sheer epic scale and gut-punching resolutions. It may over-entice its somewhat bloated array of storylines with somewhat unbalanced character dynamics along the way. But this is not meant to be an ordinary film. It's a Super Smash Brothers Brawl type feature and a blockbuster like no other. Reaching places visually and emotionally that this MCU franchise finally needed to take. Carried by a fabulous performance by Josh Brolin as Thanos, he makes this movie his own, as the Avengers are just there to do their best. But is their best enough. Such an epic experience. It's an event more than a film, and be sure to ready your expectations. Because the Russo's send us off with pure cinematic, shakespearean-esk illuminations. Setting up for maybe an even better Avengers sequel. But let's just hope they don't get too predictable on us. One for a generation. What an experience.","1"
"Fields201","What A Summer Blockbuster Comic Book Movie Should Be!","29 April 2018","Avengers 3 reminds me why these Marvel Universes is so popular. They are stories involving a well-cast group of superheroes from the Marvel comic books. The first Avengers was a lot of fun, but disappointing because there were only a handful of the comic book characters fighting. Age of Ultron sucked and it was boring but this one, well, I admit that Guardians of the Galaxy got me excited for it, but it's great to see a bigger cast of superheroes.

Thanos, in pure Voldemort scheme, is out looking for the Infinity Stones to give him the ultimate power, and the heroes must stop him before he finds them all. That is pretty much the movie. However, everyone has a story, including Thanos this time, and I realized halfway through the film, that he is a good villain. It took several movies but they finally have a good supervillain to face! YES!

What makes this film great is that it has a perfect mix of action, comedy, and even backstory. The movie even takes time out to flesh out characters, and it does it in a way where it isn't boring. There is always something to look at, there are a ton of characters to cover, and the movie actually handles them quite well. I honestly don't have too much to gripe other than, if this is your first time seeing one of these Marvel movies, you might get lost.

What a way to kick off the summer! I was excited for this and even had goosebumps with the trailer, but this film definitely delivered. It saddens me because I really hope DC gets this kind of following. As it stands, Marvel is dominating and Disney is banking. The steam isn't running out yet with this franchise.","4"
"hellraiser7","War for the Universe","6 May 2018","The thing about conflict is it goes both ways, no matter how well trained we are to not lose, no matter how many battles triumphed, death and loss are never far away.

This is one of my favorite sequels of all time up there with ""The Empire Strikes Back"" in my book, it's also believe it or not my favorite Avengers film (at least for now, till the next one comes out). This film really is something not just is it a big event but it's also the darkest entry in the franchise and MCU, as it is the most epic but also the most tragic. Though the film is fitting as it's takes place in the MSU's 10th Anniversary and through the years it has build itself of to this, and I'll just say it's one hell of a pay off.

Characters are good each have good moments: Thor and Peter Quill/Star lord stand out for me I really felt both were at their best on an emotional basis, from what both have to endure it's interesting seeing both of them really pissed, it really drives both of them to do what must be done and you really route for them doing it.

Though who also stand out are Scarlet Witch and The Vision, both characters I honestly felt we're really at their best. I really like that you get a little depth on their relationship as we see how far they have can for themselves and each other. It's really touching which is also what makes what they endure all the sadder; I honestly wanted both to somehow find a way to survive but there were no guarantees.

However, the one character that stands out in the whole film and that we're all really here for is Thanos. Josh Brolin is just fantastic as Thanos, this is probably my favorite role from him; it just fit like a glove for him (no pun intended). I really love the physicality as well as emotionality of his performance, let alone voice which is spot on I actually did imagine that is what Thanos would sound like. Strangely this film is sort of his movie, he truly is the main character throughout the film. Which is cool, Thanos is one of my favorite fictional villians of all time not just is he terrifying but he's the most complex as he is three dimensional.

The most interesting thing about him is he doesn't perceive himself as a villain, he honestly feels what he is doing is right, that it's for the universe's own good as he feels by destroying a certain number of worlds that are heading toward failure, he can save several other worlds in the universe so there would be an harmonious balance. He's actually aware his actions breach ethical boundaries but to him they are necessary evils to accomplish what he sets himself out to do.

I even like seeing the emotionality to him as you see from his eyes and voice a lot of anger but also a lot of sadness, as if this guy carries an emotional weight that is as heavy and large as his size as you see this is a person that has endure more than his share of loss. Which fuels his rage as it seems he despises it more than any enemy he fights. I also like that there is a bit of this unpredictability about him, you're not always sure what he's about to do until he does it which can kind of catch you off guard.

And of course, his trademark weapon The Infinity Gauntlet is just awesome, it's one of my favorite fictional weapons as that gauntlet with all the stones in place lets you weld God Like Powers. With all six stones intact, you could do just about anything you want, I won't say what you have to see for yourself to believe.

I really like the story format and the pace in it is great as it's really fast, despite how long the film actually is I honestly didn't notice the time which is a good sign. At first, it's sort of an adventure as we see things taking place in both space and earth, and it's practically a race for the stones. There is kind of a double layer suspense where on one hand your hoping the Avengers will find the stones before Thanos, but on another hand your kind of are quietly routing for Thanos to find those stones because let's face it we deep down really want to see what each of them can do. And once we see Thanos utilize those stones it doesn't disappoint, it's kind of a payoff for each and every plight.

And then the film turns into you could say a war movie, in the final half it gets into one of my favorite battles of all time let alone one of the longest as it clocks in about 30-40 mins. It is just absolute pandemonium as we see left, right up and down there are actually two different battles taking place. One in space with Thanos and a group of Avengers and another on earth against Thanos's forces and the secondary group of Avengers. It's almost like seeing a live action ""Where Waldo"" art illustration as there are just things happening all around the characters and you've got just most of the character from the Marvel Verse involved.

In the battles there are some really cool moments from Thor getting his new hammer which I'm glad, I know that in the last film ""Thor Ragnorok"" he's fully harnessed his power of lightening but it's just not the same, that hammer is his trademark and is just really cool seeing him kick ass with it. Which he does in this film and you can see from the ferocity of his actions he's really mad now. Or even Bruce Banner in that Hulk Buster, I thought it was really cool for once seeing Bruce doing the ass kicking and not relying on the Hulk all the time, it just shows he's no wimp Bruce truly can hold his own against danger.

But I like that you see the battle isn't one sided, it really looks like things can go either way. We see the Avengers kicking ass as usual but also, we see Thanos and his forces at times get the upper hand and turn things around. Times like that really made me worried for the lives of the characters, despite the Avengers abilities they're not bullet or knife proof. You really get that wavering feeling you have where at times you feel a glimmer of hope but then gets crushed, you can say by Thanos fist.

The score by one of my favorite composers Alvin Sivelstri is good, though it's really the end theme song that is the most memorable and is probably one of my favorite end themes ever. I won't say what kind of theme it is, but I'll just say just like what happens at the end it will hit you really hard.

From here I've said enough, and I'll just say one last thing, a battle may be won but the war is far from over.

"jlieske-85601","Decent movie, but WAY overhyped","8 February 2019","This movie is definitely very pleasing to the eye with nothing short of amazing CGI. Even though the CGI looks very cool and gives you the illusion of being on another planet, I think this is a major downfall of the movie. Because there is so much CGI in the movie, it makes it that much more unrealistic. I know this is a superhero movie and it's not supposed to be very realistic, but I think they took it way to far with this. I believe that what makes a great superhero movie is being able to add those cool effects, while keeping things on a realistic level.

One aspect of the movie I liked a lot was the villain, Thanos. I thought that his appearance was amazing, he looked scary, but he also looked like he had a personality. Thanos was the best part of the movie by far. He has great lines and hes energy was amazing.

The main reason I do not like this movie is because of the ranging power levels of all the superheros. It is very annoying when three people will be against Thanos and not be able to do any damage, then one hero comes with one wave of their finger and knocks him on his ass. It is also very annoying how much power Thanos has. Everything seems so easy to him and he can just destroy anyone with a snap of his fingers. This is annoying to me because it takes away the fighting in a fight scene. It also makes the movie seem very corny, especially with all the jokes throughout the entire movie. With all the darkness that Thanos brings to the movie, you would think they would make the movie a lot more dark, and more of a superhero movie instead of a comedy. The fact that ""the entire universe"" is at stake, just seems extremely corny to me, they gave the villain too much power.","7"

"movietalkwithmuhammed","Not your typical happy Marvel movie","27 April 2018","Overall this was a good movie; however, there were some issues. It was rushed, and some of the heroes were extremely annoying. But there were still some really awesome aspects to this movie.

To start, this movie was extremely rushed. Thanos collected all of the infinity stones so quickly. It was cool to see how he was able to collect them all with the exception of one- the power stone. I thought this was really annoying because it took away from the origin story of Thanos.

There were some characters that were great in previous movies but were super annoying in this one. Star-Lord is number one on the list. He was selfish and he was compromised. He did not care about the team when they could have defeated Thanos. Vision is number two, and he is arguably the most useless character in all of the Avenger movies. He literally does nothing. He has an infinity stone, the mind stone, yet he is the most weak-minded Avenger. He offers zero significance to the story.

There was a fight between Hulk and Thanos, and it was awesome! Any screen time that Hulk gets is usually something worth watching. He was able to hold up his own, but I felt bad once Thanos started to use the power stone against him. I did not think that he could get hurt. It reminded me of the end of the fight scene between Batman and Bane in The Dark Knight Rises. This fight scene was probably the best part of the movie.

It was exciting to see Red Skull- finally! The last he was seen was at the end of Captain America: The First Avenger. He was sucked up, into space, but we did not know by who.

There was also a lot of humor between Thor and Drax the Destoryer. They kept the movie funny in their own dry humorous ways. Speaking of Thor, he was incredibly awesome in this movie. He had lost so much throughout his time with the Avengers; he was driven by his vengeance and in a crazy way, it was well deserved to see him like that.

Many of the heroes will die in this movie. I will not say who, but some of the ones who die is such a disappointment and unexpected. It left a bitter taste at the end of the movie.

Once part four comes out, I believe this movie rating will be higher. But by itself, it is much lower. I do not like it when a movie leaves a bitter taste in your mouth. It will leave you with many unanswered questions.","8"

"nikeillusion","Army of teenies upvoted this crap movies to the top","7 August 2018","Except for Thanos & maybe Strange, no one else in the whole movie acted like half of the population of the universe would be obliterated. Everyone kept repeating ""Thanos is very dangerous"" ""Thanos will destroy everything"" ""Thanos will kill everyone"" but 5 seconds later you will see them joking or fooling around. Most MCU movies are rubbish with same storyline, boring dialogues and pathetic acting by overpaid actors. This movie was headed the same way but the only saving grace was Thanos, during the movie I thought that if we have these MCU's clown superheros to save us then do we really need saving? Maybe if Thanos kills half of these 'superheros' then maybe Marvel will be forced to pay writers to write better scripts & hire better actors. There is something with Marvel movies that even some of the good actors after becoming part of MCU stop caring about acting. I guess given that our 'intelligent' population might not understand something sophisticated that is why studios are dumbing down. But what irks me is this 'highly intelligent' population of teenies starts rating movies on various platforms resulting in contamination of rankings/ratings. In conclusion, this movie is just average nothing more.","9"

"TomTomH","If you thought an Avengers instalment without the helm of Joss Whedon would be concerning, don't worry. Infinity War is a blast that shows Marvel is still on top of their game","4 August 2018","Marvel has done the inconceivable. I'm happy to admit that Avengers: Infinity War is the best team up movie in the franchise since Joss Whedon's first Avengers film. But is that too much of a good thing? The answer is a resounding yes, but in a sense that it can be let loose and do whatever it wants while strictly aiming towards fans and non-fans. It's not perfect by any means, but for the most part it is like a vending machine loaded with colourful geekiness, going full throttle on humour, enthralling set pieces and surprising moments that still thrill. Even the third act is as satisfying and effective as anything we've seen before.

The plot really kicks into gear from the get-go, not spending any time on setup and delving straight into the action. The past 18 instalments did the business of building everything up. Long story short, over 20 superheroes team up to take down the most powerful villain in the galaxy, Thanos (Josh Brolin). Rather than telling the story in predictable fashion, the script executes it unconventionally with splitting every character up into a different situation all over the place. Iron Man, Doctor Strange (the two Sherlock's: Robert Downey Jr. and Benedict Cumberbatch), the Hulk (Mark Ruffalo) and Peter Parker (Tom Holland) team up, Thor (Chris Hemsworth) pairs up with the Guardians of the Galaxy, while Captain America (Chris Evans) reunites with his Civil War crew.

What makes their interactions compelling is the commitment and energy that everyone involved brings to the film. Writers Stephen McFeely and Christopher Markus structure scenes excellently, but the Russo brothers adapt them to the screen almost without a problem in sight. Where the duo's previous Marvel work were on the forefront of political seriousness, this time they channel the fanboy gleefulness that superhero films deserve, something that original director Joss Whedon had a knack for. They've just about matched him in terms of style.

Thanos is engaging but not the bad-guy-wants-to-destroy-the-world stereotype that you could imagine. He's humanly developed and masterfully designed, but perhaps not as empathetic or relatable as Killmonger in Black Panther. As the plot roaringly progresses forward, so does he.

This culmination doesn't always work. There is so much going on at once that sometimes you lose track of where you are and what's happening. The moments with underused characters frequently feel rushed, which makes scenes more appealing than others. Formulaic exposition can sometimes put the comedy to rest. But for a film as bulky as Infinity War, you can't have everything. It learns lessons from the frustrating overkill of subplots that plagued Age of Ultron and Civil War and goes for something leaner in its approach. More than a 'greatest hits' compilation, the film is the Pulp Fiction of the superhero genre. It is so good that it makes Justice League look like Batman and Robin.","4"

"fredrikgunerius","Two and a half hours of superheroes coming and going","8 August 2023","And so the movie business has come to this: An unscrupulous milking of an enormous number of superhero franchises, which then are divided further into several parts of outright episodic quality. Avengers: Infinity War is not a movie in any traditional sort of sense; it's a combined recap of a previous episode and intro to another. This is two and a half hours of characters coming and going, all of which are more or less invincible and have no ground-rules set for their co-existence. The action sequences and battles are flat, unaccounted for and thus have no relevance. I'm appalled by the fact that the studios (Marvel and Walt Disney) do not realize how meaningless they are making their own universes with such shameless sell-outs. I am not looking forward to the next installment.","9"

"mjplysaght","Decent, but not worth the overwhelming amount of hype","4 May 2018","10 years and 18 previous Marvel films have led up to this moment. Some of the preceding films were better than others but the ensemble of characters have been established for us nonetheless.

Thanos (played by Josh Brolin) is the villain of the piece, and against my expectations, he's actually fleshed out really well as a character. From the fleeting glimpses of him we saw in some of the earlier films, he didn't really leave much of an impression, which caused me to fear that he would be bland and one-note like a selection of some of the other Marvel villains. But, no, he's given depth, motivation and they make him somewhat understandable.

So, as the title and premise suggests, Thanos is on an intergalactic conquest to acquire all six Infinity Stones to power his gauntlet so that he can decimate the universe, for the sake of 'balance.' Makes sense in a very twisted way, but he's still a madman.

Meanwhile, the Avengers slowly but surely get made aware of the threat and band together, albeit in different groups, relative to their locations and circumstances. Each group have either the possession or the knowledge of at least one Infinity Stone, so Thanos dispatches his minions of the Black Order to retrieve them for him.

Also, side note: Tom Vaughan-Lawlor as Ebony Maw (Squidward), good god, he is brilliant!! Perhaps I'm biased because I'm also Irish and I loved him in Love/Hate, but he is such an underrated actor.

But getting back to the topic of how the story is laid out, and this is one major gripe I had with the film: it is cluttered as hell!! Don't get me wrong, I know how difficult it is to incorporate 20+ main heroes into one film, but the constant jumping back and forth between subplots makes you constantly have to remind yourself what happened to the previous group.

The characters work well off one another and there are a couple of funny lines, but some of our heroes were either underdeveloped or out of character. For instance, Star-Lord. I know that he's been shown to be juvenile and immature in a funny way in previous films, but he comes across as an insecure, impulsive joke here. There's a pivotal moment in the film where he single-handedly ruins a plan in motion, that could've ended the threat for our heroes.

The action scenes are fairly decent. The Wakandan battle scene was very well captured, in my opinion. I've probably become desensitized to these superhero action films, merely because of the sheer frequency I've looked at similar looking battles, but for the first time, we're shown a Marvel film with ACTUAL STAKES! No spoilers, but for the last five minutes of the film, my facial expression was frozen to one of absolute shock, which is a first for me. They've given us a decent cliffhanger for the next film, at least.

So yeah, generally, it's a competently produced film. The Russo Brothers continue to do a good job in the MCU. The drawback for me was the pacing and the jumping between the different groups. (Also, mild spoiler: What the hell was Peter Dinklage doing?! I full-on laughed at every one of his scenes. His accent as that character was ridiculous and kinda ruined my suspension of disbelief)

Not the best Marvel film for me, but it's in my top 10, at least.","4"
"Dianthuses","A disappointment for a casual fan","2 May 2018","Every once in a while you walk out of the theatres after seeing the New Big Thing and disappointingly conclude: ""This wasn't made for me"". Which is fine. I don't follow the hype, I don't watch the trailers and don't bother keeping up much with continuity. I generally watch these movies and my reactions tend to fall somewhere in between ""technically competent but flawed"" (e.g. Doctor Strange) to the rarer ""pretty damn good"" (e.g. Black Panther). Because technical competency is never lacking - the writing is generally sharp, casting and acting as well.

Infinity War is technically competent. From what I gather from the more avid watchers of these movies, continuity and fan-service is on top. It's really quite funny - I especially enjoy the Guardians team. But I don't think it's particularly fun, especially not after the first third. The pacing gets bogged down majorly in the second act and you can feel the plot structure bursting at the seems as it tries to force a dozen separate stories and half-hearted arcs into something resembling a traditional movie structure. And it still feels like an hour of character development was roughly cut. Somewhere in the middle of the movie two characters bizarrely meet after one has been missing and presumed dead - which is awkward - but the tension between them is never addressed after this point and I don't even think they share any more dialogue. Here is where the weaknesses in directing seem to become apparent to the point of harmfulness. The Russos directed the last two Captain America movies well enough (the last one being a better Avengers 2 than the actual Avengers 2) but Infinity War seems to be too big of a challenge. Maybe it was too big of a challenge for any director.

A large amount of the focus on character-driven story-telling has fallen to Thanos, who until now has only appeared at the margins of the rest of the universe. And it kind of works. Many directors seem to struggle with relatable antagonists with clear and understandable motivations. That's what makes Killmonger so great. He's frightening because he just may be right. And the angle of antagonist-who-sees-himself-as-hero almost works in Infinity War. Except Thanos' motivations are so ridiculously - and I try to avoid using this word in general - stupid that I couldn't possibly take them seriously. Admittedly, a lot of people can and I'm not going to judge anyone for that. But Thor could have handed Thanos a book on basic political theory and obliterated his entire worldview.

Half the audience was in loud glee and half was in loud anger when the credits rolled. And I have to say I was in the latter camp. But I'm not sure it's fair to get as angry as I initially was. Maybe I'll warm up to it on a second watching. For now, I feel cheated. If the movie was called ""Avengers: Infinity War - Part One"" I probably wouldn't have minded. Or if I kept up with the hype. Which brings me back to my original point. This movie wasn't made for me. I expected it to be something else. Most of the time I just wished the Black Panther universe had more to do with it. Or I just want another Black Panther movie. Infinity War has me exhausted on Marvel. It isn't bad or offensive or really any other strong adjective. It's just bland, poorly structured and disappointing.","1"

"jude_rc","Good story, but lack of entertainment","9 May 2018","I dip in and out of the Marvel Universe as after a while they all seem to follow the same trend. Hero is loses. Hero comes back even stronger. Big fight. Hero wins.

However, the good thing about a cross over is that there is a bit more of a story, and that statement is certainly true with Avengers Infinity War.

Overall, I enjoyed it. The story was good and I like that the ending wasn't a cop out and that it sets up for another. However, of the 20+ Marvel Hero's this film introduces, about 6 of them have decent air time. I love that Thor teamed up with the Guardians, this made for great comedic viewing, but for fans of the Black Widow and Captain America, prepare to be disappointed. The Capt punches some people and looks sad, BW has ' a girl fight' (which to me seems put in there, purely to please female viewers (which I doubt it will)).

To sum this up in a sentence, it was a good film with an enjoyable story line and certainly continued the Marvel world, however, IT WAS NOT ENTERTAINING!!!! It will be a very long time till I watch it again, if ever.","3"

"WritersCredence","A Decade of A Masterpiece_Breathtaking and Heartbreaking","29 April 2018","Never in my life have I loved a movie so much I needed to see it again immediately after I watched it. My friend was still mourning the character deaths, so I took her home, bought another ticket and went straight back to that theater. This movie is marvelous. Not only am I a hardcore Marvel fan, but I am also a film student and a writer. I absolutely admire and give my applaud to Marvel, for having the patience, the courage, the directors, the producers, the cast, and the crew spending a decade turning 70 years worth of comics into this beloved franchise that brought those stories and characters to life.

I'm going to do my best to keep this short and sweet, without spoilers. This movie should be getting nothing but appreciation and praise. This movie is for the fans, not trolls, not critics. The Russo brothers did exceptional, balancing each character perfectly to their own spotlight. Nothing felt over done or unnecessary, every moment was completely motivated and executed beautifully. The character pairings were well thought out, mended well, the character growth and interactions were fun, and I nearly lost it from excitement. Any scene with Thanos was amazing and stressful, his character arc was well developed and almost made me feel for his gentle side, but whenever he walked on screen I was scared for the heroes lives!! The actors, as always, were incredible, but their performances in Infinity War were outstanding, they all deserve Oscars. Despite the few heartwarming jokes and banter, the movie never shifted from it's serious tone, which I appreciate, as the actors held strong emotional moments that will undoubtedly leave you teary-eyed and heartbroken. This movie will leave you laughing, it will leave you shocked by the twists and turns, it will possibly leave you gasping horrified (like me) or screaming (like some fans), and the ending will leave you emotionally crippled by the cliffhanger, but you will be awestruck.

The only thing that I wish was a little different was I wish the score was a little less dramatic and more softer and powerful to deliver that emotion further. I wish they got Hans Zimmer to score the Avengers, but I'm not removing a star for that, because all in all Avengers: Infinity War is a masterpiece, and it takes a lot for me to called a movie a masterpiece, even if its Marvel, but Infinity War pasted all expectations. Do not miss this experience. It is satisfying in all ways and never disappointed me. Now go buy that ticket and enjoy this unique, special, and phenomenal film!","4"

RP1 Wins hands down.","14 May 2018","I've enjoyed some of the Marvel oeuvre.. but honestly.. this is not up to the mark, nowhere bloody near, not at all. Let's be honest; It's a turkey.

Very poor directing, Russo bros.. whoever they are.. it's like.. are they in the right job or did someone mistake the set janitors and kept them on to lower costs? Shoddy in fact; - they'd have been far better off using whoever directed Thor 3, Dark World or Avengers Age of Ultron, or Ironman III, Or even Thor Ragnarok, - all better directed and more watchable movies.

The cinematography of the 'live' footage was generally awful. I mean, shocking. Amateur. It made me wonder if they'd used the wrong lenses or cameras or something.

As for performances.. 'Acting', as it used to be called.. where to start.. I'll keep it simple: Most of the 'stars' including RDJ are taking the piss.. it's not as if they had a great deal to do anyway, but.. they must be laughing all the way to the bank.. call this a day job? They're getting money for old rope.

The screenplay, the plot - is practically non-existent, and what there is is balderdash, tripe, codswallop and piffle. Half a crap story painfully overstretched into well over two hours.. the ending is a complete cop-out / a cobbled together mess.. they must've been stoned and thought it was clever.. it wasn't, it isn't.

I was actually looking forward to seeing this.. but having already seen Ready Player One a few weeks back - absolutely no contest - Ready Player one is a truly great movie, by a great director, great cinematography, screenplay, story, plot, music, soundtrack, FX, ideas, the whole kaboodle.

Comparing Avengers Infinity war to ready Player One is like putting a used Edsel next to a brand new Aston Martin.

This is a big big budget movie that (apart from some quality CGI) looks like it was made on a shoestring in a back-alley. Shame on the Russos.. and whoever else was responsible for this forgettable pile of doo-doo.

Oh, the (almost entirely scored) soundtrack wasn't bad.. but way too glorious for the poor character playing, performances, script and screenplay.

"jamesba-640-753446","Good, but not great considering the hype/wait","7 May 2018","First off, the ratings for this movie are so inconsistent, it appears you are either a ""Marvel fanboy"" or a hater with ratings of only 1s or 10s; with limited information on why these ratings are justified or on people focusing on one minor issue.

I found the film to be pretty good, engaging for the most part, and allowed most of the characters to shine. However, considering the near ten year wait for this film I expected damn near perfection, although probably unfairly.

There was nothing glaringly wrong with the film, just inconsistencies, similar to that of Thanos' powers, which is probably to be expected when a film has over 30 main characters!

Speaking of Thanos, it was a refreshing change to have a villain whose background and motivation is explained and relatable, in the sense it was not ""I have to kill the Avengers because the plot demands it"". Unfortunately, (I am not a comic-book nerd before I get shot down), Thanos' seemed overpowered from the start, trivializing his conquest for the stones. Unfortunately, whilst Thanos was great, his henchmen were laughable. They were unexplained faceless characters, using characters in the loosest sense, ill explained and boring to watch. Again their powers seem to change to suit the plot, which was irritating. The comedy was spot-on for the most part, although one of the villains death's was an unintentional funny, reminiscent of Palpetine's death in Robot Chicken Starwars.

Whilst most of the film was engaging, there was a lot of shifting between plot lines, as the story/team were broken into pockets across the universe. A smart move for a film with so many characters, but some plot lines were extremely dull and I was wishing the film would shift back again (sorry Cap/Vision). Whenever Thor/ Guardians on the screen it was at it's best, and I was hoping the film would turn into a GOTG/Thor crossover exclusively.

The final moments were unexpected, *SPOLIERS* not the fact that Thanos succeeds in his plan but in the way it was done was touching, and a surprising death toll to our heroes. Although, it all boils down to a huge fist-fight battle with nothing really clever going on. Yes there is the stuff with Vision, however he is unlikable and under-powered, possibly with the viewer baying for his blood. I believe one of the lines the Cap says to him is ""we don't trade lives"" tell that to all the Wakanda's dying needlessly just to save him. Unfortunately, you know who isn't going to die and makes the second film somewhat predictable. Overall it is a typical Marvel film, nothing to shout about but a fun day out and I would suggest that you go and see it, unless you have children under 8 as you will have to console them for weeks to come. 8/10.","10"
"westsideschl","Money, Money, Money","23 August 2018","First about the herd of low star ratings decrying the cost. Learn patience and wait until a library has a copy. Second, the movie & music industries long ago established non-competitive pricing amongst themselves for their products that garnered excessive profits (like the pharmaceutical peoples today). Apple & digital helped to reduce that. The message at the beginning ""Piracy is not a victimless crime ... harms the economy."" is in place w/the help of lobbyists and politicians (wanting donations), and is mostly meant to maximize those profits. Third, as to the movie it should be commended for it's vast CGI effects although it's getting computer cheap to produce those effects these days. On the down side, out CGI-ing everyone else has the effect of making us boringly saturated with over-effects, and loss of meaningful story, intelligent dialogue & good acting. Fourth, don't expect intelligent scripting e.g. sound effects still in space; physically impossible space structures; bad science i.e. the Big Bang created six colored glass crystals??; the usual colored lasers; fire throwing, & force fields from your hands; swords, guns & naugahyde clothing (from cheap plastic if you don't know); aliens w/vocal structures that speak perfect English (at least they didn't script some subtitled alien speak). Fifth, excessive dramatic music to sub for realistic and/or repetitive action. Dialogue amongst all seemed at a dumbed down level like neighbors arguing over which football team is better. Science dialogue such as describing a ""quadrant"" is pre-digital 19th century accuracy - dumb! Sixth, the ending and the recently overused CGI of bodies turning to ashy bits of floating organic material was obscure, and meant to make more money on a sequel.","10"

"CANpatbuck3664","Justifies All the Hype and Keeps the Marvel Blockbuster Train Rolling","29 April 2018","Marvel's been at this so long that their success is no longer a surprise. They aren't just a part of Disney film making, they're a benchmark in big budget entertainment. So, expectations for the new Avengers installment were sky high. We've had smash hit after smash hit from the studio and I'm happy to report that they've got another winner. One reason for this is that Infinity War maintains the delicate balance of keep things light while keeping the stakes raised. There were more than a few times that the entire audience burst out laughing but with the added threat of Thanos (Josh Brolin), the threat he poses to the world is grave and you feel that tension. This is compounded by the fact that this doesn't follow a template, they take things on new tangents and although I was able to guess a few things, Infinity War never fell into a rut or felt too familiar.

Much like the Russo's previous work for Marvel (CA: The Winter Soldier and CA: Civil War) they somehow give everyone enough time to show what they can do, even with such a large ensemble. I was able to spend enough time with each major character to find out their motivation and how they planned to deal with the looming threat. They also split into smaller groups and they had such great chemistry together that there wasn't a stale moment. Everyone is humanized, and no one is just defined by their special abilities. This even includes the villains which is no mean feat. We see new sides of some of the characters, background players get some time in the spotlight and although these heroes boast superhuman abilites, we learn just how vulnerable they are in their moments of weakness.

You don't get much bigger than the names in this cast. That sounds hyperbolic, but you have to remember just how many people have been collecting checks as heroes or villains in this universe. There are too many members in the cast to go through 1 by 1 but I did have a couple of favourites. Chris Hemsworth builds off his strong performance in Thor: Ragnarok, Robert Downey Jr. was his typically excellent self and it was nice that Elizabeth Olsen got more to do as Scarlet Witch. Some of the relatively new cast members like Tom Holland and Chadwick Boseman were also exceptional. I also really liked Josh Brolin as Thanos, he's a worthwhile villain for our heroes and there was a lot of feeling in his performance despite it being performance capture.

With a movie housing so many wild and memorable characters with their own independent style and motivations, there was bound to be a couple of missteps. The biggest for me was Gamora's subplot with Thanos. Don't get me wrong, there's a lot of important work here where we see another side to Thanos that isn't a bloodthirsty lunatic. It makes him a more memorable Marvel antagonist instead of him just fading into the crowd. But Gamora loses strength as a character by how easily she bends to Thanos and it dampened parts of the story for me. They also make Dr. Strange even more arrogant and there were moments where his act was wearing a little thin. The movie doesn't completely skate around plot holes but none of them are egregious enough to wreck the movie. The other small issue is that there is so much buildup and hype for Infinity War that it was almost impossible to live up to that ideal.

The last thing I want to mention is that I want to credit the creative team for doing something bold with the ending. It would have been easy to just setup a sequel and slide into a happy ending but that's not the direction they chose to go with. They really caught me off guard and I think most people will have a similar reaction. It makes me just that more intrigued about where they will choose to go next (we know there's going to be another Avengers movie, that's not a spoiler).

Anyone who's been attending the local cineplex in the summer over the past 5-10 years has a passing familiarity with Iron Man, Captain America and the Marvel characters. The fans expected a lot and this movie delivered. Almost every character had their time to shine, the movie balances the action and the humour superbly and they tell a story that does all the buildup justice. They also take it a way that will open things up and stray from predictably just marketing for the next standalone. Keep your eyes open for some Easter eggs and a couple of surprise appearances. If you're a Marvel fan, I'd recommend this wholeheartedly but let's face it, you were going to go see it anyway.","10"

"Carycomic","Wow! Just---plain---WOW!","28 April 2018","How to review this film without 100% spoilage?

Well, let's start with the high-jacking of the refugee ship from THOR:RAGNAROK. It comes under attack by Thanos, who manages to whup Thor and the Hulk almost too easily.

Enter the Guardians of the Galaxy and Dr. Strange. The latter aiding Iron Man and Spidey against two alien mercenaries (Roughouse and the Metal Master?). While the former rescue a comatose Thor (who now resembles a Silver Age Nick Fury minus the cigar) from outer space.

This leads to the mandatory explanation about the Infinity Stones and the various aspects of existence they control. And wouldn't you know it? The Vision has one of them in his forehead!

Enter two more alien mercs (Bloodscream and Pip the Troll?) who go after him and Wanda Maximoff in Scotland. Only to have their butts handed to them by Captain American and Company (with Cap now resembling Ringo Starr)! From Scotland, this group goes to Wakanda while Iron Man, Spidey, and Dr. Strange wind up on the Saturnian moon of Titan.

All these different story threads finally coming together in an opening battle that totally surpasses the turning point Battle of Eckthelion from LOTR: ROTK!

Marvel Studios has been building up to this moment for more than a decade. Some of their previous films, in this shared universe, have been more lackluster than blockbuster. But, this was not the case, here. I sat through every second of it and I was not disappointed! Nor was anybody else in the packed house that showed this flick, earlier tonight.

Sure, there was a cliff-hanger ending! But, I knew that there was one coming from the start. After all; there's only so much you can put into a nearly three hour-long movie with a cast of characters this big. Rest assured, though. The Good Guys will whup the Bad Guys! How? I don't know any more than you do. Personally, I hope the sequel features the cinematic debut of either Adam Warlock, Quasar, or Capt. Mar-Vell of the Kree. Yet, Marvel Studios might surprise me (and everybody else) by introducing none of those three!

Two things everyone should remember, however.

1) The Confederate Army's victory at the First Battle of Bull Run didn't guarantee them victory in the American Civil War. And...

2) This film is PG-13. Which means it ""might"" prove unsuitable for hyper-active, attention-deficit children, under the age of five, who erroneously think they're the Flash!","10"
"showchan","Below average movie","8 May 2018","Of all the millions of dollars spent on the CGI and the big name actors, someone forgot to hire a decent scriptwriter. The plot was so full of holes I could imagine it looking like Sponge Bob.

The attempt to make Thanos as the anti-hero was feeble and the backstory of the love for a daughter held no ground.

All the heroes never used their powers the way we have seen them in previous Marvel movies, thereby conveniently handing ALL the stones to Thanos on a silver platter. AND setting up the scene for the next movie....

It's bewildering and frustrating that only Thanos knows how to use the stones' power, despite having only gained them for the first time. Yet their previous wielders only knew how to flaunt it in front of him/his henchmen and then easily giving them away.

The only reason I gave another point to the 1 I originally planned to give was because Spidey used an Alien reference...

The very few parts I liked from the movie was the post credit scene, Doctor Strange, Iron Man and Black Panther. Others either died or just didn't stand out.

"aziza-ismail1","Here, there and everywhere","17 August 2018","Not a major fan of Avengers, but this is the best of the lot but there are many flaws with Infinity War, one of them is the Thanos powers are not clearly consistant. The battles happen in a here there and everywhere fashion. It sometimes feel like different movies all put together and sometimes hard to follow whos doing what and for what purpose.

The battles scenes are great with exceptionally visuals and cgi but the purpose to defeat one undefeated villian is jumbled up. Infinity Wars is clearly an overated movie but deserves credit especially in the visuals and a simple plot which the movie intends to make it complex.

I didnt feel the superheroes powers like we did in their stand alone movies, its like a buffet.

The worst performance was The Hulk, he had absolutely no business in being there if he was not willing each time to show his powers.

I expected more from Infinity Wars since the big hype and thought they could have done more fighting as united Avengers to defeat one main villain. I know this might be done deliberately so that we can spend another 2,5 hours again for the next installment.

Nevertheless its still an entertaining movie that I liked but not love or drool over it like some fans, has its ups and down with top of the range visual effects.

Some say that it is so sad in the end, honestly I did not feel anything for them at the end, the ending is just bad, and it might turn out diffently in the next installment.

Between Black Panther and Infinity War, I would prefer Black Panther as it was more focused on the characters and story which is a better made film overall.

To have a rating of 8.6 on imdb is undeserving as these are mostly fanboys superior ratings.

To give where credit is due is only in the visuals and cgi and maybe in the difficulty in making such a huge movie with a huge cast that is why I give a 7 out of 10

I feel like I've been hit with Thor's hammer. This colossal, ambitious, terrifically engaging movie literally took my breath away. And not because of the awesome action scenes (and they are awesome). But because of the heart and soul the film puts out there. This is mainstream cinema at its very best.

The cast are all great. But Josh Brolin is absolutely fantastic as Thanos. He banishes forever the accusation that Marvel villians are not up to much. Chris Hemsworth's Thor is astonishingly awesome in this movie. Whereas The Hulk was the go to guy for gigantic damage in the original Avengers, here it's the Golden-haired Avenger. And boy is he angry. Hulk, however, is largely absent, even if Bruce Banner is not. No Hawkeye too, although it is explained why he's missing.

I walked out of the cinema shell-shocked. How brave of Marvel Studios to do this, to really, really go for it. And they did. Thank you Russo Brothers. This movie has passion and impact in a way that even the best of the previous Marvel movies does not. Marvel's bravery is to be commended. In many ways this is darkest film they have ever done. I do think there will be a reset button somewhere along the line.

And yet it's also very funny. The writer/directors juggle the tonal changes (and there are many) like master magicians. Thank you guys,. There are plenty of plot twists, and almost all of them are suprising.

Just do yourself a favour - ignore the DC trolls (dead universe breeds spite) and go and see this. The culmination of a great cinematic event. And prepare for that blow from Mjolnir.","2"
"kiwijinxter","Epicness of Transformers, but with story and characters fully intact! Masterpiece!","1 May 2018","It's like Transformers, but with a story intact! All the Transformers movies were epic to me, but as the sequels came, the stories got more and more lost. Not Avengers: Infinity War. As an ex-comic collector (over 15 years), I was quite well acquainted with Thanos. My biggest worry was how they were going to pull off a weird looking hulk of an alien like him and not make him look like a doofus. Pulled off they did. Thanos was convincing and menacing, but most importantly he felt ""real"". Of course, no one can fault the fantastic, solid cast in the Avengers - Captain America, Iron Man, Spider-Man, Scarlet Witch, Dr Strange, etc. (though I missed Hawkeye) were all rock-solid and it's amazing how their characters shined through despite the very very full cast of the Marvel Universe. The action was epic - this is where it reminds me of Transformers - where the CGI was fantastic, blended well, etc. The difference? Infinity War had a rock-solid story that tied in all the characters really well, and it had a whole raft of emotions - funny, sad, poignant, shocking, surprising, mindblowing moments all came through the movie. It is one truly epic movie that deserves to be on the big screen. I love it, and can't wait for the next part. Highly, highly recommended.","6"

"hannahgrahambell","Works only in the context of the Marvel Cinematic Universe","27 May 2018","Taken in the context of a larger narrative within the Marvel cinematic universe, Avengers: Infinity War impressively brings together the many beloved characters together for an action-packed adventure. However, the movie does not work on its own as a narrative, and like most Marvel movies it has particular cinematic flaws. From the first scene, it is clear that Infinity War relies heavily on CGI for both its characters and action sequences, which should not come to a surprise for Marvel fans. In fact, it is plausible to say that more than half the movie is touched by CGI, from epic space sets to flashy bursts of light denoting magical power. The CGI isn't done badly, but for anyone who isn't on completely board with that style of animation, Infinity War would be unwatchable. At times, the amount of mystical sparks, auras, and beams becomes so saturated that it is difficult to take the movie seriously. Luckily, Infinity War has some of the world's most beloved actors and characters in its arsenal, which have proven to be Marvel's greatest strength as a franchise. Having Robert Downey Jr. as Ironman, Benedict Cumberbatch as Dr. Strange, Chadwick Boseman as Black Panther, and Chris Pratt as Starlord, just to name a few, give their characters credibility and charm. The writers do an excellent job balancing the many heroes, whose individual movies are often tonally different. Since the audience presumably has come to know and love each character from the standalone films and/or the Avengers, the actors are able to slip into their respective roles easily. This gives Infinity War a feeling of akin to huge family reunion, which definitely works in the movie's favor because the audience is emotionally invested. What makes the movie unique is that instead of following the traditional three act structure, the entire two hour and forty minute film acts as only as a chapter in a larger Avengers movie. Infinity War could be described as the latter half of a second act and the beginning of the third act. This means that the movie is almost entirely action with little exposition or character development. The lack of elaborate backstory or convoluted plot is refreshing in some ways, as some of the other Marvel movies suffer from over-complication. The action is well-choreographed and relatively creative, but because it fills the entire movie it can be mind-numbing. Anyone not familiar with Marvel or critical of the franchise will find nothing to connect to. Unfortunately, Infinity War lacks the political complexity and mysterious suspense presented in previous films. Shades of gray on moral dilemmas and conflicts between the heroes are downplayed or ignored in favor of a clear good vs. evil battle. Infinity War is a success within the world of Marvel, but not as a movie in its own right. Fortunately for Disney, Marvel is wildly popular among critics and fans alike, making it a financial and critical success. All of the advantages and disadvantages of a cinematic universe are shown in this movie, making it a unique cultural phenomenon.","5"

The various characters play their roles nicely throughout the movie, with ample screentime for almost all of them. A nice accomplishment, considering how many different characters are actually making an appearance.

The pacing felt exactly right to me and even though the movie speeds along rather quickly and there really isn't any character development to speak of beyond what we already know from previous movies, it never felt rushed. We are not working towards something anymore, we are nearing the end.

The action scenes are done very well, emphasizing each character's powers and abilities nicely and quite in detail, with plenty of originality in showing it to us. And the CGI? They outdid themselves; top notch and then some. No messy ""big CGI explosion showoff"" lazyness here.

With Thanos as a villain, we (finally) have a real villain. Well acted and far from one-dimensional.

I'm glad this time around there wasn't an overabundance of unfunny jokes being crammed into every possible scene. Still, not all the jokes/humor landed for me, which continues to turn certain characters into caricatures of themselves.

All in all, not flawless, but nitpicking at this point would be nitpicking for the sake of nitpicking. For what it's supposed to be, this movie did almost everything right. And most importantly: it was an entertaining ride from start to finish. 9/10","10"

The whole avengers team drives up to costco in a van and Colby starts to shake. He says to director bill strip: ""i cant go into a costco because ill start feeling silenced and used like an 1800s women. They all had to head back to the studio (taylor swift included).

I think it was too risky wanting to put together so many superheroes in one movie. We didn't even get to see Captain America or Black Widow for more than 15-20 minutes, in a 2h30m long movie. I was also hoping for a more epic final battle, like in the first Avengers movie. This one was too short and messy. Maybe we'll get to see a better one in the next film.

"shadow_blade-89459","Good, but Lazy","20 March 2019","""Avengers: Infinity War"" (2018) is a professionally produced action adventure film about The Avengers and their eventual allies coming together to stop the growing powers of Thanos, played by Josh Brolin. I must admit I felt different from the beginning of the film to the end. I will sum it up by saying, it was joyful to see so many of my favorite characters come together until the end and leave it at that. It is difficult to really dive into what this film is about without being repetitive of prior super hero movies or completely giving the film away. However, staying in tradition of a Marvel super hero film, it is a fresh take that hits most of the normal marks excluding the conclusion.

The acting of this star-studded film, as expected is, dead on marvelous. It's not overly hokey like some of the hero films tend to be. The Russo brothers also did an immaculate job in directing this film. The fight scenes were very vivid and gripping in every sequence. In contrast, I do believe this film may have been a little long for my taste. I really think if the script would have been slimmed down to focus on Thanos' search for the stones and the Avengers and allies trying to stop him, there wouldn't be so many moments that feel like they drag on. I also believe there should have been some type of ""actual"" call to action for the Avengers in the end. I know there is a proposed continuation, but it feels like a lazy conclusion.","7"

But the story is absolutely lacking, everything seems to happen completely by chance, characters are inconsistent with their comics' or previous MCU movies' personae. Thanos is immobilized about to be deprived of his gauntlet (why not cutting off his arm, I wonder?) but Mr.Moron Startlord Quill (I don't recall him being such a moron in the Guardians saga) messes all up, Dr.Strange refusing to use the gem of Time and then giving it away becuse, you know, saving Stark is worth sacrificing the entire universe. And why Thanos is battling at all? After he manages to get hold of the gem of Reality he can just tell atoms, quarks, strings to do whatever he wants, wiping his enemies away by snapping his fingers: he even throws a moon at Iron Man, why not just decompose him and transform him into cardboard?

"JasonR77","A ride like no other","30 April 2018","I feel like I just gave birth to a Thanos-sized baby.

I have been physically and emotionally drained by this movie from start to finish, as it starts with an intense sense of foreboding, and carries that throughout the entire rest of the film. This is edge-of-your-seat excitement, and it is not hyperbole to say so. Around every corner is something dangerous and unpredictable, and for all the scenes that feature so many of the heroes Marvel has cultivated over the last decade, it never feels cluttered.

The Russos carefully pace the introductions and the separation of scenes, never feeling like our stay with a certain group of heroes is too long or too short. We have come a long way to get here, and in doing so, we are not cheated in any way by how the story unfolds.

Josh Brolin's Thanos is the real star of the movie. A background villain, ever looming in the shadows and on the horizon, he finally gets his moment, and garners ample screen time and development, unlike so many villains before him. His motives are laid out in an expert sort of way, much like Killmonger's in Black Panther, and it creates a richer experience. Thanos relies on Brolin's capabilities as an actor to become real, and Brolin is more than up to the challenge.

The visuals on Thanos are remarkable as well; every subtle facial tick and reaction is intensely detailed, and incredibly realistic. That sort of skill elevates the product as a whole, immersing the audience in its world seamlessly.

And then there's that ending. Oh, we must talk about that ending. There have been none like it, and the reactions in the theater when you see it will be unlike any you've ever had in a Marvel movie before. The Russos took some big chances, brought together the universe that so many before them have built, and blasted the whole thing into space for one two and-a-half hour thrill ride, with another installment to come.

"yotrelepsa","Unpopular opinion: Over hyped!","16 September 2018","Well, major spoiler bellow, beware

I have mixed feelings towards this movie. I could have given it at least extra three points if it weren't for its cheep, underdeveloped ending!

All of a sudden, Gamora, Black Panther, Falcon, Star Lord, Groot, Mantis, Drax, Dr. Strange, and Spider Man all die!! I mean, most of these characters have huge potential (BP, Dr. Strange), rising stars (Guardians of the Galaxy), and Spiderman!!! WTF?? Even their deaths were really cheap and missing sufficient drama for such a HUGE turn in Marvel's track! When Wolverine died, it took them an entire movie to develop his death story, not a few minutes of meaningless finger snap! Not to mention Loki who died in the opening scene in such an undeveloped incident

What I expect, which would be even cheaper, is that some of the protagonists in the next movie will get the Time Gem and reverse the events and revive the deceased superheroes. Quite cliche'ish and cheap, if it was

Overall, the movie had much much bigger potential with such a plethora of Marvel superheroes and villains. Unfortunately Marvel rushed the story to fit it into the available time slot. Splitting it into two movies, with more time and elaboration to the same story would have made it a true classic, plus a better crafted ending!

I had a couple of concerns before going into this feature and thankfully: I was wrong on both of them. Number one: I was dreading an hour plus long battle like at the end of Lord of the Rings 2-3, Matrix 3 and any Transformers movie. Personally, anything longer than 20 minutes of on-screen battles bore me. If I'm at home watching them, I will literally pull out my phone and play games while the battle rages on. This did not happen here. Thank you so much. I really didn't want to take a break and leave the theatre during a far-too-long battle scene.

And number two: I was concerned about the aforementioned Purple Homer Simpson. In the brief moments we've seen him before, he looked incredibly corny and fake and I never once believed he would be as all-powerful as they built him up to be. BUT, he ended up being the best character of the entire 16,090 characters they chose for this Part 3a. He was deep, interesting and the CGI wasn't that bad.

Now, the rest of the characters...were spot on from the same characters we grew with and loved for the past decade. Not a single actor stepped out of bounds and they owned their scenes.

So, yeah, you simply cannot go into Avengers 3a without seeing, well, all of the previous 18 films. Most specifically, Thor: Ragnarok, the Guardians of the Galaxy films and Captain America: Civil War. But to sum up this mercifully simple plot, a big baddie is attempting to collect all the stones that originated the universe so he can play God with his warped sense of mercy. Our heroes, or ""Avengers,"" are spread out and thin across the universe, but do have a common goal of preventing Purple Homer Simpson from achieving his collection.

I already knew this before going in, but if you didn't, you should prepare yourself for a Lord of the Rings 1-2 conclusion and an Empire Strikes Back storm before the calm. And also, for only 2nd or 3rd time in the ENTIRE MCU library, the post-credit scene is absolutely necessary to see. The other 15 or so times, I say just skip the post-credit scenes and wait to see them on the net. This one, yes, you really should see.

The movie got some many things right and a few minor errors. What went right: they chopped down the humor. In most Marvel movies, the humor seems to be 80% of the script leaving a small percentage for Superhero'ing action. I did find myself laughing out loud here a few times, but thankfully, it was just a few sprinkled jokes. I was there to see a Superhero movie and not another comedy.

Also, as stated, the characters were spot on and the action scenes were intense, fresh and wholeheartedly used every bit of the Avenger in those scenes to their absolute potential. Further, aside from some major pacing and editing choices (MAN, some scenes seemed to end and the camera just kept on rolling for upwards of 5 seconds on more than a dozen scenes,) the movie never felt too long and certainly not 2½ hours.

I can't give away my other huge gripe with this movie (other than the pacing/editing) without spoilers, but suffice to say, the third act, specifically the final moments really irked me. And no, not the abrupt ending - again, this was basically the ending to the first two Lord of the Rings movies. I hope, like I stated above, I am wrong on how I see the ending to this when I observe how Part 3b is handled. If I am wrong, then the stars I gave this movie will suddenly rise.

Avengers Part 3a doesn't hold a candle to Avengers 1, but it does blow Part 2 out of the water. Still, you definitely need Part 2 to have any of Part 3a. Infinity War is definitely recommended, but I'd probably wait until the day Part 3b comes out and make sure you see, um, all of the previous 18 films prior, as well.

***

Final thoughts: Since this movie is really just a first half of an overall chapter, I'd probably have to wait until Part 3b comes out before completely forming an opinion on where this ranks. That said, right now, I know it absolutely ranks high in the (so-far) 19 MCU films.","6"

The plot at its basic level is a good story line but the surrounding elements are bad. The humor which is usually stellar in the Avengers movies is poorly timed and poorly delivered. The story is disjointed and feels like they wanted to cram as many superheroes into the film as they could regardless if it made sense.

We have here the MCU continuing with ""Avengers: Infinity War"". T'Challa and his cohorts get added to the mix in a battle against the ruthless Thanos.

Basically, if you've seen any superhero flick from the 21st century, then you should know what to expect here. For me, it's neat seeing the Scarlet Witch and her robot companion, as they got a TV series last year called ""Wandavision"", where they exist in a number of TV settings representing different eras.

In short, if you're anything like the characters on ""The Big Bang Theory"", then you'll enjoy this movie. Stan Lee's cameo, plenty of CGI, and all manner of battle scenes make it one for the attendees of ComicCon. Improbable but harmless.","1"
"arimatic","Not as great as everyone is saying","29 April 2018","First of all I am a marvel fan. I must say Avengers infinity war was a good movie not a great movie. To me it was on par with justice league and that's saying a lot. Yes it was darker than the marvel movies that came before killing off some marvel characters but it's obvious that most of these characters would be back because they have scheduled movies for next year. Thanos strength was very inconsistent after an opening scene where he kills Loki and make light work of the hulk without the infinity stones he then struggle to beat iron man and even captain America lived after an encounter with him when he had most of the infinity stones. Also thanos goones came for vision who at the time was with scarlet witch. Both from previous movies are powerful characters but thanos goones makes light weight of them and if it wasn't for captain America black widow and falcon who all are human possessing no actual power but they were able to beat the goones it was really mind numbing. If you really analyze it you would realize that there is an agenda here to just mindlessly praise everything marvel does while being overly critical of DC. Both movies were ...meh I honestly don't see why everyone became so brainless to just give this movie a 10 or 9 as if it was the best movie ever created when it was just in the same vein as justice league but much more super hero's who at times get overlooked or does nothing.","8"
"jacobstevenmillen","Rating one star to balance out all those 10/10s","11 November 2018","This movie doesn't deserve to be rated so high. Having a bunch more fan service, action scenes, and deaths (which was a pretty unsatisfying ending in my opinion) than the other marvel movies does not make it better. And it definitely doesn't qualify this movie to be in the top 100 films of all time (currently ranked #51 right now).

Now, this isnt a bad movie. I sort of enjoyed it at times, even though it was a bit hard to keep track of the characters. Im just saying it isn't really any better than the other marvel movies, so should be ranked similarly (so around 7 to 8 stars). It isn't anything special, and definitely isnt a ""masterpiece"" as one reviewer put it. Its just an entertaining action movie (although the ending was not entertaining and was just disappointing).

My feelings about this movie might just be because I dont really care about the characters. I was annoyed every time a character came on the screen and people started to applaud, and I didnt really care that half the characters died at the end because I wasnt emotionally invested in them (because there are just too many of them in my opinion). The only characters that were sort of sad to see die were spiderman (because he sounded so scared) and nick fury (because Sam L Jackson is awesome). Otherwise, I was just waiting for that depressing end to be over. Maybe if I read the comics I would be more affected by this film. Im assuming that is where most of the 10/10 stars came from. However, a movie shouldn't depend on people having read the comics, and as someone who hasnt read them and doesnt care about most of the characters because of the lack of time the movies spend developing the characters, this movie was slightly disappointing and also doesnt deserve the rating it has now.","8"

This film did not blow me away. A 10/10 film should be able to stand alone as a great film; this clearly wasn't that.

Due to the fact there were so many characters, you couldn't help but feel the rush to make sure everyone had screentime and that was at the expense of storytelling, which as you'll see below, it could have done with a bit more of.

As I hadn't watched all the other relevant marvel films, I didn't quite understand some of the character's strained relationships with each other - they could have at least done a flashback...but then I guess there'd be even less time for storytelling!

It was a 'good' film, but I regret going to see it at the cinema. Good Netflix fodder.","9"
"bertrandborn","too much and yet so little","22 September 2018","Inflationary overload of superpower special-effects when suddenly ECERYBODY in the whole film is a superhero and there are no normal people left..!

There are also too many characters featured, giving each only a short stage appearance, so beyond a handful of witty jokes no real character development is possible and most actors become superficial support roles with no real function in the plot - just one more superhero crammed in there who's also there.

On top, the characters are almost all excessively powerful, way more than in past movies, so every scene becomes bigger and louder... and after a while just a boring sequence of mindless excesses - unrealistic even in the superhero world's setting, making it dull.

The only surprise to an otherwise bland film is the shock ending where the bad guy wins and kills half the universe and half of the superhero cast. (you almost feel grateful to him for cutting the inflated number of superheroes i half!)

On a positive note, the special effects are great including Thanos' animation and expressive facial features. All-in, alas, not a film worth watching.","10"
"eparazak","Infinity War needs to be seen to be believed!","30 April 2018","Avengers: Infinity War is finally here after much anticipation and it features an ensemble cast of nearly every single hero from the Marvel Cinematic Universe. It tells the story of how all of the heroes from the MCU must team up with the currently broken Avengers to take down Thanos, who has been searching for the Infinity Stones so he can use them for his own selfish purposes.

The events for this movie have been building up since The Avengers' post credits scene. We've gotten a few glimpses of Thanos and his plot, but we haven't had a good idea on his plans. That all comes together here, where we see almost all of the heroes split into small teams before coming together and forming one large one. There is a lot of fun, yet tense action here; the opening, for instance helps set the tone, showing that this is going to be a much darker film compared to most Marvel movies. There are some high stakes that are fought for that could end up shaking the status quo permanently.

Josh Brolin does a fantastic job as Thanos. Thanos gives off a very, very serious and dark vibe, which shows that he is not somebody that should be messed with. I feel as though Brolin did a perfect job doing so and is one of the best performances of the film, and that's saying something. You can tell that he had fun with his role, don't just take his word for it when he says that he had fun with it.

The humor's also there and thankfully isn't too jam packed into the film. Since this is a film that fits in an onslaught of characters in a 2 and a half hour runtime, it doesn't try to fit in too much humor. I find it to be a good thing considering that it mostly tries, and succeeds in trying to be very bleak. My main issue with the movie, however, is that there is often too much going on at the same time. In the first act, (Which is pretty long since there are many characters to establish) the movie tries to juggle around 4 or 5 different plots at once. That's where the film can get disorganized and hard to process.

It's hard not to spoil this film, but Avengers Infinity War is a fantastic addition to the MCU and definitely worth the hype that it's been given.

After half an hour of suffering I stopped watching.","6"
"Asuka-Fan","OK but not great movie - 4 out of 10","1 May 2018","Pros:

1. It took 19 movies, but for the 1st time ever MCU finally has a villain who isn't awful or lame. A ""former"" MCU fan (who has been invited to never come back to this forum) used to say MCU is better than DC because MCU always makes the heroes the main character while DC makes the villain the main character. Well, Infinity War takes a page out of DC's playbook and makes the villain the main character and it's the 1st time in 19 movies that the villain of an MCU movie isn't awful or lame.

2. Loki repeating Tony Stark's line from the 1st Avengers movie (""We have a Hulk"") and then Thanos proceeding to give Hulk such a severe beatdown that Hulk turned into a 1000-pound coward and was too scared to show up for the rest of the movie.

3. Loki finally getting killed. Loki (""I'm evil because I was adopted and Daddy Odin loved Thor more than me"") has always been an awful, lame, and useless villain.

Cons:

1. This movie was a big mess, constantly jumping all over the place from 1 location to another.

2. Drax claiming to be ""invisible"". Stupid scene that added nothing to the movie.

3. MCU ripping off The Illiad with Thanos sacrificing his daughter to get the soul stone.

4. Too many MCU characters were ready and willing to put half the universe at risk for their own selfish needs:

a. Starlord - threw a hissy fit and helped Thanos to break free

b. Doctor Strange - gave Thanos the time stone (which Thanos used to reverse time and get the mind stone from Vision's forehead later) just to save Iron Man and sacrifice half the universe; also knew which of the 14 million possible paths was the only path to defeat Thanos but took that secret to the grave and let Thanos kill half the universe rather than tell anyone else the winning path (MCU fans made the dumb excuse that telling others the winning path would bias their decisions. Of course, it's supposed to bias their decisions - so they can make the right decisions to defeat Thanos! If you're given the correct answers to a test BEFORE the test, of course you're going to write down those correct answers when you take the test. Who would be so stupid to NOT write down the correct answers if they're given the correct answers BEFORE the test?)

c. Scarlet Witch - made an entire country fight Thanos just so she can keep her robot sex toy

5. Spider-Sense not working properly again as Spider-Man gets ambished and taken hostage by a guy with no superpowers.

6. An ending that will probably be reversed in Avengers 4, resulting in this movie having no stakes and basically being a waste of 2 and 1/2 hours since 90% of what happened in this movie will have been reversed in Avengers 4. Also, why is there even a need for Avengers 4? If Strange can use the time stone to see how to defeat Thanos, then Thanos should be able to do the same thing and see which is the only possible way he could be defeated and prevent that from ever happening. So it should now be impossible to defeat Thanos and there's no need for an Avengers 4 since it's now impossible for the Avengers to win.","10"

"jadediamond","Adios Marvel Universe!","3 May 2018","After being on Marvel train since 2008, I am finally hopping off because I am burnt out on their formulaic superhero movie plot. Black Panther was the best Marvel movie to date because it took a chance and stepped out of the traditional superhero movie format and told a compelling, yet relevant story with a great hero and a well-rounded villain in Killmonger. Its weakest moments occurred when it had to conform to the Marvel formula. Thor: Ragnarok was also a great movie because it stopped taking itself too seriously and was fun and refreshing. Yet, this movie rubbed me the wrong way. Don't get me wrong. It's a good movie because Marvel played it safe again with its formula. Thanos was a great villain and this was really his movie. The Russo brothers already showed their greatness when reinventing Captain America with the excellent sequels Captain America: Winter Soldier and Captain America: Civil War, which was the real Avenger 3 and way better than this movie. I can tell from this movie like with Joss Whedon's Avengers 2, the brothers creativity was stifled by studio heads thinking more about milking the movie for as much of the billions its worth and will make regardless instead of creating a great movie audience can enjoy. I have four main annoyances with this movie. The First Annoyance: Infinity War was advertised as not being split into two movies anymore and it was only going to be one movie. Which is why the ending was confusing along with the post credits because the studio did not inform the public it was going to be split into two movies leaving the audience scratching their heads after expecting a complete movie. The remaining audience members who stayed behind to watch the post credits laughed at Samuel L. Jackson famously about to curse being as confused as we were about the ending. As we exited the theater, one brave audience member bravely asked out loud if anyone got the ending. Everyone burst into laughter because none of us did. The Second annoyance: There was no need to have a second movie. Just like Twilight: Breaking Dawn Part One and Two, this movie could have been completed in one movie. There is no need for a second movie because thirty minutes more and the already long movie could have ended in one satisfying movie. The ending is like watching the final act of a movie and then the film abruptly ending right before the final scene. It was a cheap shot from the executives to get more money out of the pubic and introduce new Marvel superheroes when the movie was already oversaturated with unnecessary superheroes who only spoke a few lines to say, ""Hey, I'm in the movie."" The only relevant characters in this movie are Thanos, Gamora, Dr. Strange, Tony Stark, Thor, and maybe Vision because he is an Infinity Stone carrier. The rest was completely unnecessary filler. The Third Annoyance: Defying the laws of Physics. I am no genius but if Thanos if stronger than Hulk and Thor, then how can Iron Man and Captain America survive a punch from him? Shouldn't they both be dead? Oh and speaking of death. My Final Annoyance: The Deaths. It's quite obvious who's coming back for sequels to their own individual movie franchises and who didn't renew their contracts? Why make the ones you know are coming back for sequels disappear and then keep the ones who didn't renew their contracts? It's like they are afraid to kill off Tony Stark and Captain America. Robert Downey Jr. is in his fifties now, and Chris Evans is tired of the superhero gig just like Hugh Jackman was of playing Wolverine for seventeen years. Give them a noble death and passed on the torch to the next generation. Yet, both characters survived moments that should have killed them. Another complaint was that the deaths in this movie had no emotional meaning or impact. You know it's a superhero movie and if characters are popular enough, the studio heads will bring them back from the dead in the sequel or starring in a TV show. So moments when you should mourn the lost of a character, you feel nothing when that character is killed off. Which made the ending more bizarre on the studio's part. Diehard Marvel fans are going to say it's the greatest movie because they have been conditioned to love Marvel and go to every Marvel movie, even waiting during the five minutes of credits to see two extra scenes. Yet, for someone who is burnt out on seeing grown men running around in their underwear fighting each other, I'm hopping off the train. Black Panther and Thor: Ragnarok were both great movies, yet, I don't appreciate the stunt the movie executives pulled, and I feel like I wasted two and half hours of my life. I finally understood the ending, but it still could have been wrapped up in one movie. So if you love Marvel, go watch the movie. If you're a casual fan, wait until part two comes out and watch this movie right before you go see part two.","5"
"jami-imaj","I was Bored","18 May 2018","My wife usually sleeps through movies at the theater, sort of my own geiger counter for boring with snores instead of clicks. More popcorn for me so I'm ok with it but this movie had so many long drawn out parts that I was bored. I guess part of the problem is so many stars in each scene, they all need screen time, all need important lines, so if something is going on like say ... trying to take a glove off Thanos there's a bunch of characters who've been in other movies that have endeared them to audiences that the scene takes a very long time. Most people liked mantis, and the new spiderman is perfect, ironman is awesome as always ... the list goes on. It took them ten minutes trying to take the dudes glove off !! Who takes ten minutes to take a glove off ??! I mean yes before Going to the movie one of us took about ten minutes trying on different shoes but Come On it's a Glove !! And the dude's almost asleep strap a rocket to it (you did this to gamora) push a button and it comes off. So much of this movie was like that, long drawn out scenes of looking ... thinking ... brooding ... they could have taken an hour off this movie and not lost any content. And speaking of lack of content, there was almost no hulk in this, he was in it for what, a minute? I think it was about one minute, yes I like ruffalo but when I was a kid I didn't watch the show for bixby, it was to see ferrigno. The only redeeming quality, my favorite part was Peter Dinklage. My second favorite character in the game of thrones world and they made him a Giant. Awesome. I might rent this, only because I can fast forward a lot of this but I will not buy it, and I have a bunch of marvel movies on my shelf.","5"
"alva3901","Infinity War is brave, brilliant and spectacular","25 April 2018","Infinity War is the pinnacle of what blockbuster films should be. Directed by the Russo brothers, they manage to achieve the almost impossible feat of culminating all the characters and their stories into one epic film. The action, the characters, the story and the overall experience is spectacular to behold. Each characters has their own moment to shine, as we see new fun and somewhat emotional interactions between characters and story arcs that pay off as the film progresses . The result is a film that often feels surprisingly earnest and emotional. It pays off our emotional investment into these great characters over each of the 18 previous films through a great culmination of storytelling. The humor we have come to expect in Marvel films is lively and full of banter, particularly between Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr) and Doctor Strange (Benedict Cumberbatch), and the quick-fire interplay between Thor (Chris Hemsworth) and the Guardians of the Galaxy. Unlike Marvel's cascade of villains who are turned secondary to their superhero counterparts, Thanos (Josh Brolin) is the central character in this epic, with a moral compass that is beyond what many might expect. Whilst he may seem to be the most demonic villain that the Avengers have come across, he is by far and away the most complex of them all, testament to the directing and writing of the film. There's a lot going on in this movie, with many scenes occurring almost simultaneously, leaving the ending on a much vague yet appropriate cliffhanger. Overall, Infinity War epitomizes the perfect blockbuster film that ends in poetic grace and is sure to leave you questioning what will happen next.","9"

"snoozejonc","Strong piece of escapism","2 April 2021","Thanos puts his master plan into action.

This is an enjoyable action-adventure set in the Marvel Cinematic Universe.

The primary function of the storytelling is to bring everything developed so far in the MCU together using the infinity stones mcguffin and give lots of popular franchise characters the opportunity to share the screen. This for the majority of the movie is done successfully.

Rather than throw everyone together the writers sensibly opt to group certain characters together for the majority of the running time. It helps that many of the characters have natural chemistry that generates much humour.

In some ways it reminds me of Lord Of The Rings with its ensemble of characters undergoing a variety of adventures towards the same objective of preventing a powerful antagonist obtaining the ultimate weapon. Overall it works very well, providing solid entertainment, mostly good dialogue and the great spectacle of seeing famous superheroes combine powers to battle a common enemy.

The themes are moderately interesting, with familiar superhero movie subjects of heroism, sacrifice and genocide a big part of it. The concept of the universe having finite resources and Thanos extremist idea to solve the problem is the most memorable. Ultimately it's a mainstream, popcorn cinematic event with escapism and enjoyment as its main priority and it does its job.

There are strong character moments, humour, emotional scenes and of course the hyperkinetic action sequences. All this is combines well for the all round entertainment value.

As you can imagine for a marvel blockbuster, the visuals and effects are loud, colourful, eye-popping and very well designed. For me it just about reigns in the spectacle enough for it not to be distracting.

I do have a few minor bugbears, but most of them did not impact my enjoyment. Not all the comedy banter works for me, some of the conflict between certain characters feels slightly forced, the Bruce Banner/Incredible Hulk issue feels contrived and the pace at times feels slightly rushed in order to give screen time for everyone.

All actors are great, particularly Josh Brolin's motion capture performance and voice work as Thanos. He really is the star of the show. Robert Downey Jr is funny and charismatic as ever. Chris Hemsworth's accent is poor as always, but his acting is good and has great chemistry with some of the other franchise characters.","10"

When uniting a team of 1960s superheroes in 2018 it's important to first weed out all of the racist characters.

Fortunately, the antagonist in the epic sci-fi/fantasy happens to be purple and powerful.

In his endless pursuit to amass all infinity stones and bring balance to the universe, omnipotent extraterrestrial Thanos (Josh Brolin) invades earth to obtain to the final gem.

Standing in his way, however, are not only the Avengers (Robert Downey Jr., Scarlett Johansson, Chris Evans, Chris Hemsworth) but also their intergalactic counterparts Guardians of the Galaxy (Chris Pratt, Zoe Saldana, Bradley Cooper).

Striking a perfect balance between action and emotion, this third entry in the franchise is the culmination of Marvel Studios first decade of filmmaking and it offers up a myriad of shocks and surprises, including an earthshattering ending.

Incidentally, now that his bejeweled gauntlet is complete, Thanos is going to be hawking shoddy replicas on QVC. Green Light

"atlasmb","Thanos Is Coming","25 April 2019","I have not seen all 21 films in the story arc that serves as the background for this penultimate episode in the MCU series that will soon culminate in ""Avengers: Endgame"". Seeing those films could only help, but it is not necessary. A general knowledge of the Marvel characters is probably enough to enjoy this wonderful spectacle.

A complex villain named Thanos is determined to collect all six of the infinity stones, which would give him nearly infinite power. An extraordinarily large cast of Marvel superheroes combines forces to stop him. CGI is used in abundance to create a non-stop display of environments and conflicts.

Like other Marvel films, the production relies on three major cornerstones to create an enjoyable experience:

1. Comedy is used to offset the heavy emotional elements of the film. Sometimes this is achieved by juxtaposing grandiose speech with commonplace speech, often employing pop culture references.

2. Suspension of disbelief is required in large doses to allow the writers to manipulate the epic elements of the story for conflict and dramatic effect.

3. Larger-than-life environments are used for their wow factor.

""Infinity War"" has these three elements in spades. The plot requires our heroes to overcome nearly impossible odds, say 1 in 14,000,605. Disparate factions of the Marvel superheroes collection are introduced to each other in an all out battle. The film ends with the ultimate cliffhanger, especially considering that Marvel promises a grand conclusion that will reset Marvel's future forever.","9"

How even now as Tony is holding Peter before he crumbles to ash I almost succumbed to the tears forming behind my eyes.

Watching Wanda try to hold back Thanos as she destroys the stone, the pain and heartbreak in her eyes. Elizabeth Olson won me for life.

I didn't know if it would stand up, if it would last on rewatch. It exceeded my expectations a SECOND time.

I am overwhelmed with love for this film and sadness at the somber ending.

They have to try hard in order to defeat him and they have also to work together to succeed.

Since I had already watched the previous Marvel movies, I have to admit that I was expecting this movie and I had high expectations by it, and I was not disappointed. It had an amazing plot that contained some plot twists that made it very interesting and also plenty of action and suspense. The direction which was made by Anthony Russo and Joe Russo was simply amazing and they succeeded on making the audience follow their characters and be with them through the whole duration of the movie. Regarding the interpretations of the cast each and every one of them was also very good and did their best to have this beautiful result. Finally, I have to say that ""Avengers: Infinity War"" is the ultimate action science fiction movie and I strongly recommend everyone to watch it.","6"
"thoehne2","Very entertaining","29 April 2018","Wasn't the best marvel movie but still very enjoyable to watch. Was better than black panther though which only got great reviews from critics bc of diversity.","6"
"nscoby93","One of Marvel's best","22 November 2022","This has got to be one of the longest shortest films I've ever seen, at 2 hours and 29 minutes I did not feel the length. Its extremely fast paced and nonstop action from beginning to end.

The culmination of 10 years of Marvel films to this absolute blockbuster smash hit of a film. Marvel is in top form in this film and the Russo brothers knocked it out of the park.

But it is not completely perfect nor without it's faults, nonetheless it is one of the best in the MCU. Also that ending probably one of the satisfyingly shocking endings in the MCU, I will never forget the stunned silence of the packed auditorium I was in during the conclusion of this film.

"dieseldemon85","Not my cup of tea","17 February 2022","My bf for some reason enjoys these comic book movies, with the exception of Deadpool, Thor Ragnarok I don't see why fandom. I have seen three now where the story jumps about, the cockiness of the protagonists of not willing to work together, hence why they fail dragging these scenes way longer than they need to. This film could have ended If Starlord didn't interupt the gauntlet removal, or Thor not doing a head shot which he should have known. Somewhat predictable, and felt like 3 seperate unit directions going and slapped and edited together to make a film. I prefer spy, giallo, comedy, action, Thriller things with realism.","10"

"martinpersson97","Thanos strikes back","4 March 2023","This is it, after 10 years of buildup, we are finally reaching the beginning of the conclusion to the story that has been promised. And this is a very dark one at that, as my title suggests, very reminiscent of The Empire Strikes Back in its tone and role in the story.

Is it possible to incorporate all the different MCU characters in one film, making them all main characters? It sounds like a fool's task, but somehow, the Russo brothers actually succeed and it all feels very warranted.

One breakout star of this film, though, is Thanos. If some MCU villains have been interesting but a bit underdeveloped, he is anything but. After so many years of buildup, he finally makes his true entrance, and he's up there with the greatest movie villains of all time. Very reminiscent of Darth Vader in many ways, and like Vader in The Empire Strikes Back, he wins this round.

The ending is just so dark for this kind of colourful adventure film - probably the only superhero film where all the heroes die at the end.

And on a technical level, it feels like a great culmination of all that has been achieved. The effects are some of the best ever put on film, and there are some breath-taking action scenes.

Overall, definitely one of the best installments in the franchise.","9"

"Potzdorf","Glad I saw it with MoviePass","7 May 2018","I'm not a follower of the Avengers movies, and I only went to see this one because I had a MoviePass. Yes, I know the comic book lore of the Avengers team and Thanos and the Soul Gems, it's just that the movie falls under its own weight of too many superheroes with too many subplots. Each character's presence is diluted because of the need to give fair screen time to each. Spider-Man, Bruce Banner, Black Widow, Black Panther, Doctor Strange, each Guardian of the Galaxy. And I don't know if it was just me, but the actors kinda seemed to phone it in for the most part. Of course, this isn't Tolstoy, it's a bunch of people with mutant or augmented superpowers traveling through space-time to stop an intergalactic warlord from retrieving gems that will give him the ability to rebalance the universe. There's a lot of contemporary humor in the movie, namely the millennial snark found in modern sitcoms. I don't get the hype, but I do appreciate that some people will like this. That's the beauty of having individual tastes: someone's pudding is someone else's broccoli. It just wasn't for me, and I don't have an interest in seeing the conclusion of this anthology, even with MoviePass.","9"

"joshbarton15","It's all been leading to this...","27 April 2018","Ten years ago, the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) was birthed with Iron Man, a supremely confident film which resurrected a career and started a shared universe of unprecedented proportions. Eighteen films later and an impressive number of superheroes introduced on the roster so far, we arrive at Avengers: Infinity War, a film so hugely anticipated that even hiding under a rock wouldn't let you escape it.

With relationships shattered after the events of Captain America: Civil War, the Avengers must team up with the Guardians of the Galaxy to put a stop to Thanos (Josh Brolin), a mad titan hell bent on collecting all the Infinity Stones and bringing balance to the universe.

The Russo brothers were the ones handed the unenviable task of bringing together pretty much every single superhero introduced so far in the MCU and having them share the screen without the film becoming a complete mess. Having achieved such great things with Captain America: Civil War, there was nobody I'd rather have take on the challenge. Now with Avengers: Infinity War, they've managed to deliver a non-stop thrill ride that is well and truly worth the ten years of character and story building it took to get to this point.

Due to the balancing act of reintroducing characters and the film's narrative, things do take a little amount of time to really get going however, it's very much a necessity and it makes for such a worthwhile second act as our heroes team up to take on Thanos. Thor coming across the Guardians of the Galaxy and Doctor Strange trying to tame Tony Stark's ego, both sets meeting for the first time, makes for an entertaining adventure and once again proves that these MCU films are at their best when these characters interactions are played out so well.

When it comes to the action side of things, driven by superior visual effects and such ferocious scale, Infinity War is one of the craziest films I've ever laid my eyes upon. The team-ups that play out in this film are exciting enough but then the moments that the Russo brothers deliver with them take them to the next level. It's really expected in today's cinema to see such grand visual effects, particularly in action sequences, but what really stunned me was how incredible Thanos looked, the detail in his features making him so much more of an intimidating figure. More on that guy later.

Infinity War features probably the most A-list cast of all time so you'd expect them all to get a major amount of screen time for this film to run smoothly. It's shared as equally as possible, some getting a bit more to do than others, and it's a tactic that pays off, both in terms of narrative and spectacle. Robert Downey Jr. has been synonymous with the role of Iron Man for the past ten years but it doesn't stop him from giving it his all here, the combination of his assurance and naivety as Iron Man making for a dangerous cog in the Avengers wheel as they suit up to take on Thanos. I could go through all the performances but Downey Jr.'s is the one out of the heroes that stood out for me.

I mentioned how Thanos is brought to life through amazing visual effects earlier but none of it would be possible without Josh Brolin's motion-capture performance in the role. Thanos takes no time in showing just how much trouble the Avengers are in, his physical presence obviously giving him a bit of an advantage however, Brolin's voice work and facial expressions bring a whole new dimension to the character. Furthermore, Thanos is given plenty of screen time to delve into a bit of his backstory, adding an emotional weight and gravitas which in turn leads to him becoming one helluva villain, the best in the MCU by a mile.

Avengers: Infinity War is event cinema at its finest, the balance of comedy and drama works wonders, as do these characters forced together to fight the true evil threatening the universe. There's plenty of crowd-pleasing moments as well as a fair share of crowd-shocking moments, the Russo brothers closing the film out rather brilliantly. Don't forget though, there's more to come when the Avengers return next year so, for now, it's time to take a deep breath and think about what you've just witnessed.","8"
"benslammin77","Mastered opportunity","28 December 2018","Applaud these movie makers; with so many characters with huge roles, the pressure of making a good movie is high. This isn't just an amazing superhero movie, it is an amazing movie.

Go in with little to no expectations, just like any movie.

Thanos' motive is extreme, but you can see where he is coming from (don't worry I don't agree lol). The storyline is classic: evil villain has a motive and the god guys try to stop him. This movie doesn't just stop there, there are twists, turns and unexpected instense emotional situations that keep you guessing. When the whole movie is explained at the beginning, and the ending you were expecting happens, you might be disappointed.

Here, the movie mysteriously ends in a fashion open for interpretation. The twist at the end is something you might expect, but the manner in which it is executed leaves you speechless. The remaining persons after Thanos' stint on earth are left with questions regarding what happened to their friends. Some die, some live, but the real question is what actually happens to those ""turned to dust"".

Allow me to explain my interpretation. When Thanos uses his guanlet, some part of the person or item is usually colored similar to the infinity stone used (purple fire emerges when he uses the power (purple) stone). When he uses his gauntlet to destroy a moon and literally pull the remains towards Iron Man, his gauntlet turns blue and purple. However, when Thanos uses his gauntlet to execute his master plan (once he has all of the infinity stones), there are no colors, either on his gauntlet or on or near anyone affected. These people literally ""turn to dust"" and fade into the wind. But are they dead? I am under the impression that they are transported to some sort of spiritual prison or something like that under the supervision of Thanos. Also, since Thanos has the time stone, the people who ""turn to dust"" likely can be brought back.

Overall, it is more than just a superhero movie, it is a great movie. The previous movies help for background purposes and allow the movie to illustrate the current issues. The acting is incredible and the characters are fun with watch. The story is incredible and the ending is open for interpretation, but not too much so that you are confused to the point of frustration. The Prestige made me want to watch the whole movie over again the second it ended, but Avengers: Infinity War made me want to watch the next Avengers just the same.

Just don't be mad at StarLord.","1"
"mindaugas-909-272423","Over the board","28 April 2018","Dizzying mash of CGI. Fully predictable until the very end. The first 2/3 we outright slow and boring. The last 1/3 is bearable.

"connorwburnett","Admittedly fun however quite a let down.","17 May 2018","For the last month Avengers Infinty war has been a huge discussion at school, everyone was displaying their admiration to this film as if it was life changing. After being hyped up to such an extreme amount I finally went out to see the film in my local cinema. I admit I was having a lot of fun with the first 30 minutes, full of action and witty dialogue although the film wasn't able to carry on with the immense fun which is to be expected after almost 20 movies of buildup. The second the guardians met Thor the movie fully halted and I became very bored. The entire time I was wondering about the more interesting plot of spider man, Dr strange and Iron Man but that was put to the side for countless jokes that missed and only a few that I actually found funny. After this though the film did pick up a lot of pace allowing this review to not be negative, I really enjoyed the breathtaking fight scene on Wakanda. Finally the ending of this film was such a cop-out, there is next to no chance that the characters taken away will not come back within the next movie. In conclusion this is definitely a film you should see even just for the one fight scene at the end, but the whole movie entirely became an extreme victim of hype. Don't expect the impossible.","4"

"henriquevtbarbosa","A Balanced Review of Infinity War","24 May 2018","I've never written a review here, but seeing the ratings of this movie comparable and above to films like Inception, Inglorious Basterds and others just made me want to write it.

Is it the best Avengers movie up to now? Probably yes.

However, the film relies too much on cheap deaths to make itself interesting with some dull moments and ""witty"" jokes to try and keep the viewer entertained. It really is a fun film to watch and MCU's has really paid off in here. People rating this 10/10 or are stupid enough to not realise that all the characters that we have seen die will come back or are less than 10 years old.

It was a fun experience and definitely worth the watch, but does its current rating reflect the actual movie? Absolutely not.","1"
"huskap","Worth the hype!","1 May 2018","If you ask me it was good and bad. It was certainly better than age of ultron and and in par with avengers 1. Personally I felt Infinity war was better than Avengers 1 as it was the movie we had all been waiting for. Thanos was amazing but some deaths were unnecessary and useless in the ending like Spider-Man and Black Panther, if you asked me they should have taken out the main avengers which would have been pretty dope. Overall movie was enjoyable, still don't know if it would be the best Avengers movie compared to Avengers 1. But I think infinity war takes the lead because of Thanos and the the direction. Well done for the Russo brothers. Badass characters like Thor who came at the ending with his new weapon and just destroyed Thanos's army. It changed the movie. I would have given it a 10 if the ending could have been better. But well made. So excited for Avengers 4. The thing which sucked most was that the Black Order was defeated so quickly because they are strong and powerful. Damn!. And also that Cap was only there for like 20 minutes in the entire movie. But I guess it was by far the 2nd best marvel movie I would have watched.","1"
"AGfox16","Different and epic, but there are many, many issues","30 April 2018","Some parts of this movie are absolutely deep, touching, and well done. Thanos' sacrifice of Gamora, along with the haunting of his consciousness afterwards, makes for real villain character depth, a rare feat in superhero films. The scenes in general featuring the GOTG were stellar in my opinion. This film truly had many charming moments.

That said, the movie was very unsatisfying and had me leaving the theater with countless questions. Why did Loki go down so easily? Loki's ""betrayal"" was amateurish, surely he didn't expect to actually be able to stab Thanos only seconds after pledging allegiance to him. Also, Loki has prior experience with the Tesseract, why didn't he teleport him and the other Asgardians to a safer place? What happened to Valkyrie and Korg? And why was the ending of Thor: Ragnarok completely nullified with the genocide of the Asgardians? How did Iron Man stand a chance of fighting Thanos when Hulk succumbed to him within a few punches? Why was Bruce later throughout the film unable to turn into Hulk?

Ignoring Strange's ""I only saw one good outcome"" nonsense, why didn't he use the Time Stone when on Titan? The Time Stone is capable of stopping time and thus freezing whoever you want to, surely this could've been used against Thanos instead of Strange doing nothing more with the Eye than acting as if he was wearing a peridot necklace. Why didn't Thanos eliminate all threats to him as soon as he attained the Soul Stone? If I understand correctly, the Soul Stone would give him the ability to snap his fingers and kill specifically whoever he wanted, not just randomly selected people. And why was Scarlet able to destroy the Mind Stone? The Stones are primordial objects, it makes no sense for something that was exposed to a Stone's effects to have the ability to destroy an actual Stone.

Also, just the fact that the Soul and Time Stones exist makes me more apathetic to the events during the film, as they are not permanent. All of these points I've brought up are why I can't give A:IW more than a 5/10.","10"
"vithiet","MCU at its best. Had huge expectations and it completely delivered","29 December 2018","I've read the original comic book trilogy countless times as a kid and I was trying real hard to keep my expectations low for this movie so my inner super fan kid would not be disappointed. But it totally delivered and is a worthy culmination of what Marvel started with the first Iron Man movie.","10"
"kjproulx","A Crowd-Pleasing and Shocking Entry","28 April 2018","With many people speaking about superhero fatigue when it comes to watching movies on the big screen, you'd think that we'd be in a box office drought by now. Obviously, that isn't coming anytime soon, because as long as this Marvel Cinematic Universe continues to surprise its fans and become one of the longest-running franchises in film history, I can't see myself ever losing interest. The hype surrounding this film is massive and arguably the largest ever, due to the sheer notion that people have been watching this series for the last ten years.

Nobody could've expected them to make it this far and be this grand, but have they ever done it with this one. Avengers: Infinity War marks the 19th film in this franchise and easily has the most storylines happening at the same time, but if I said I didn't have an absolute blast watching this movie, then I would be lying. From an emotional end to some very funny and exciting action sequences, here's why I loved my experience of this film.

This is the type of movie that will be ruined for those who choose to know more about the core premise than they are given at first. Honestly, every ten minutes brings a surprise that leads into the next scene, so it's very difficult to discuss this movie in depth. That being said, Thanks has finally arrived and plans on wiping out half of humanity in order to bring balance to the universe. Pretty much at random, he will select the half that he wishes to live or die. To do this, his mission is to track down six infinity stones that will allow him to accomplish this with the snap f his fingers. Any other information would ruin this experience for you, so I'll leave it at that.

As far as the characters go, that's probably consecutively the biggest positive and negative that this film has to offer. Yes, seeing everyone is amazing and some of the interactions were the most welcomed portions of the film, but there are times when the movie does seem a little overly ambitious in including everyone that it possibly can. There are a few members left out of the movie, and I personally feel they did that in order to leave room to breathe during this installment. With that said, I personally just enjoyed seeing everyone and didn't let the overload of characters bother me.

Throughout the years, whether it was starting fresh with a movie like Guardians of the Galaxy or jumping into Iron Man 3 without having seen the rest of the movies, newcomers could've easily figured out the missing pieces. Avengers: Infinity War doesn't quite game that same effect, solely due to the fact that there are callbacks and blatant references to films at the very beginning of the franchise. So yes, my recommendation would be to see every movie in the series in order to be fully connected to the events of this movie. For fans of this universe, I don't believe they could've received a more satisfying climax.

From Robert Downey Jr. to Tom Holland, Elizabeth Olsen to Benedict Cumberbatch, the spectrum of performances is on another level here. Everyone is devoted to these characters, but the true standout is easily the performance of Josh Brolin as Thanos. I have a feeling that everyone will be talking about him as the most fleshed out villain this franchise will ever see. His backstory and motivation definitely bring a needed layer to this movie and everyone else gets their time to shine as well. This is a crowd-pleasing movie that also takes risks that I don't think people will be expecting.

In the end, Avengers: Infinity War is one of the most satisfying theatrical experiences I've had in quite some time. From the running time being the longest one yet and feeling pretty fast, to the climax of the movie leaving me quite emotional, to wondering about where they could possibly go next, to the sheer notion of seeing this many characters on-screen at the same time and it not feeling too bloated, I loved my entire experience of this film. Aside from it feeling a little overstuffed at times, Joe and Anthony Russo have crafted yet another fantastic entry in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. It was also a joy to hear the score from The Avengers making a comeback as well. For fans of the franchise, I can't recommend this movie enough. For newcomers, make sure you've at least seen most of the movies. This is a wonderful blockbuster.","1"

(PG-13)

The first half of the Marvel Cinematic Universe's grand smackdown finds cosmic supervillain Thanos (Brolin) collecting infinity stones to give himself the ultimate power to wipe out half of the intelligent life in the universe. Depicting the efforts of some fifty or more characters across several storylines in both outer space and on Earth, this exhausting ""event movie"" is so relentless yet dramatically diffuse that it's difficult to engage with anything besides individual moments: a snappy quip here, a brief break from the fever pitch for reflection there. Requiring the absorption of about a dozen-and-a-half prior movies to be able to clearly follow what's happening, the effort lacks proper isolation, resulting in what feels like an incomplete film (and experience); it even opens with a mise-en-scène and ends on a cliffhanger. Despite two-and-a-half hours of action, most of the cast get only a few minutes of screen time to leave a mark (even major players from previous films, like Chadwick Boseman and Don Cheadle, don't manage much more than glorified cameos), but Brolin does manage to create a formidable yet conflicted--even humanized--enemy, which only makes his decisions more startling to behold. Has all the fingerprints of filmmaking-by-committee, but it should still satisfy most fans to at least some degree.

"jon.h.ochiai","So in the end: Was it worth it?","1 May 2018","""Avengers: Infinity War"" is awesome. Surprisingly, much beauty arises in its imperfection. ""Infinity War"" embodies the catharsis of the superhero tale of The Avengers. The visuals are dazzling; the battles have never been more spectacular or more costly. Despite having way too many superheroes in this 2 hour 40 minute experience, what makes ""Infinity War"" so compelling is the villain Thanos.

Charismatic and sad Josh Brolin gifts the amazing motion capture performance of galactic warrior Thanos, the hulking man-like creature Son of Saturn's Moon Titan. I agree with my buddy Marc: I get who Thanos is. As a child he watched his vibrant Titan die, due to over population; thus exhausting its resources. That was his epiphany. Thanos ""adopts"" daughters Gamora, played by Zoe Saldana, and Nebula, played by Karen Gillan, on his merciless conquests across the universe.

Now the feared warrior Thanos possesses the Infinity Gauntlet, the golden mechanical glove with the Infinity Stones. When he possesses all six stones, he will have the power to wipe out half of all humanity with the snap of his finger. In his own enlightened twist way, he believes that he is benevolent. That is he for the greater good.

At the narrative arc of ""Infinity War"" Thanos tells Doctor Strange, master of the Mystic Arts and Earth's defender, played by understated and powerful Benedict Cumberbatch, of killing off half of the known universe with the snap of his finger, ""I call that mercy."" Doctor Strange asks, ""And then what?"" Thanos replies, ""I finally rest...""

Directors Anthony Russo and Joe Russo string a cohesive narrative thread with the inspired screenplay by Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely, wisely focusing our attention on Thanos. Thus, humanizing him before our eyes. ""Infinity War"" is great, yet not greater than ""Black Panther"". Where ""Black Panther"" was the self-sustained tale of becoming greater, ""Infinity War"" is more the Act 2 of the Avenger's hero morality play.

Even amidst the often tangled story lines of the rift between Robert Downey Jr.' s Iron Man and Chris Evans's Captain America, and Chris Hemsworth's Thor's displacement from his home World Asgaard, ""Infinity War"" is surprisingly and poignantly about the cost of being right; however justified we might be.

In that the Russo Brothers do the little things humanely: child Gamora asks her father Thanos, ""What did it cost?"" Thanos replies, ""Everything."" So was it worth it?

Chris Hemsworth, Benedict Cumberbatch, Zoe Saldana, and Chris Evans rock as Thor, Doc Strange, Gamora, and Captain America - Steve Rogers are amazing. Hemsworth is refreshingly badass as Thor, fueled by his vengeance upon Thanos. Cumberbatch is quiet confidence and wisdom as Doctor Strange, who may possess the key to the actual ""endgame"". Evans always embodies such conviction and earnestness in idealist Captain America. Saldana is so powerful stealing the movie displaying authentic humanity in her love - despise relationship with her father Thanos.

Their personal story resonates above the sometimes distracting number of heroes and splintering narrative threads. So in the end was it worth it for Thanos? Does he get what he really wants? At least for me, I was surprised in ""Avenger: Infinity War"" in a great way. So it was worth it. Even with the totally WTF conclusion, I still have hope. I can't wait to see what happens in May 2019.","8"

"jboothmillard","Avengers: Infinity War","3 May 2018","The Marvel Cinematic Universe movie series has been fantastic, many fans including me were happy to see it celebrating its tenth anniversary, this next instalment in the Avengers series, bringing together over twenty Marvel superheroes, was the most ambitious and high anticipation, directed by the Russo brothers (Welcome to Collinwood, You, Me and Dupree, Captain America: The Winter Soldier & Civil War). Basically, Thanos (Josh Brolin) and his lieutenants - Proxima Midnight (Carrie Coon), Ebony Maw (Tom Vaughan-Lawlor), Corvus Glaive (Michael James Shaw) and Cull Obsidian (Terry Notary) - have acquired the Power Stone. They intercept the ship carrying the survivors of Asgard's destruction, they extract the Space Stone from the Tesseract. Thor (Chris Hemsworth) is subdued and Thanos kills Loki (Tom Hiddleston) and overpowers Hulk (Mark Ruffalo), Heimdall (Idris Elba) transports Hulk to Earth before being killed, then Thanos and his lieutenants leave and the ship is destroyed. Hulk crash-lands at the Sanctum Sanctorum in New York City, reverting to Bruce Banner, there he meets Doctor Stephen Strange (Benedict Cumberbatch) and Wong (Benedict Wong) and warns them of Thanos' plan to kill half of all life in the universe, so Strange recruits Tony Stark aka Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.). Maw and Obsidian arrive to retrieve the Time Stone from Strange, drawing the attention of Peter Parker aka Spider-Man (Tom Holland), Maw fails to take the Time Stone due to an enchantment, but captures Strange. Stark and Parker pursue Maw's spaceship, while Banner contacts Steve Rogers aka Captain America (Chris Evans), and Wong stays behind to guard the Sanctum. In Scotland, Midnight and Glaive ambush Wanda Maximoff aka Scarlet Witch (Elizabeth Olsen) and Vision (Paul Bettany) in order to retrieve the Mind Stone in Vision's forehead. Rogers, Natasha Romanoff aka Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson), and Sam Wilson aka Falcon (Anthony Mackie) rescue them and shelter with James Rhodes aka War Machine (Don Cheadle) at the Avengers Compound. Vision offers to sacrifice himself, to have the Mind Stone destroyed to keep Thanos from retrieving it, Rogers suggests they travel to Wakanda, which may have the resources to remove the stone without destroying Vision. The Guardians of the Galaxy respond to a distress call from the Asgardian ship and rescue Thor, he surmises Thanos seeks the Reality Stone, which is in the possession of the Collector (Benicio Del Toro) on Knowhere. Rocket (Bradley Cooper) and Groot (Vin Diesel) accompany Thor to Nidavellir, Thor is also given a new eye, on the now deserted planet they and Eitri, King of the Dwarves (Peter Dinklage), create an enchanted battle-axe called Stormbreaker capable of killing Thanos. On Knowhere, Peter Quill aka Star-Lord (Chris Pratt), Gamora (Zoë Saldana), Drax (Dave Bautista) and Mantis (Pom Klementieff) find Thanos who has already got the Reality Stone in his possession. Thanos kidnaps Gamora, his adoptive daughter, she is forced to reveal the location of the Soul Stone as her captive adoptive sister Nebula (Doctor Who's Karen Gillan) is being tortured. Thanos and Gamora travel to Vormir, where Red Skull (Ross Marquand), keeper of the Soul Stone, informs him the stone can only be retrieved by sacrificing someone he loves, Thanos reluctantly throws Gamora off a cliff, granting him the Soul Stone. Nebula escapes captivity and asks the remaining Guardians to meet her on Titan, Thanos' destroyed homeworld, Stark and Parker have rescued Strange and killed Maw, ejecting him from his ship, they land at Titan and meet Quill, Drax, and Mantis. The group forms a plan to remove Thanos' Infinity Gauntlet, while Strange looks into the future, he finds only one in millions of possible futures in which Thanos loses. Thanos arrives, justifying his plan is necessary to ensure the survival of a universe threatened by overpopulation, the group manage to subdue him, until Nebula deduces that he killed Gamora. Quill is enraged and retaliates, allowing Thanos to break away and overpower the group, Strange surrenders the Time Stone in exchange for Thanos sparing Stark, Thanos then departs for Earth. In Wakanda, Rogers reunites with Bucky Barnes aka Winter Soldier (Sebastian Stan) before Thanos and his army invade, the Avengers, alongside T'Challa aka Black Panther (Chadwick Boseman) and the Wakandan forces, mount a defence while Shuri (Letitia Wright) works to extract the Mind Stone from Vision. Banner is unable to transform into the Hulk, he fights in Stark's Hulkbuster armour; Thor, Rocket, and Groot arrive to reinforce the defenders, while Midnight, Obsidian, and Glaive are killed, and their army is routed. Maximoff attempts to destroy the Mind Stone, but Thanos arrives and retrieves the stone from Vision, destroying him, Thor severely wounds Thanos, but with all stones completing the Infinity Gauntlet, Thanos activates it, clicking his fingers and teleporting away. Thanos' plan succeeds, as a result, half of all life across the universe disintegrates, including Barnes, T'Challa, Groot, Maximoff, Wilson, Mantis, Drax, Quill, Strange, and Parker; Stark and Nebula remain on Titan, while Banner, Okoye (Danai Gurira), Rhodes, Rocket, Rogers, Romanoff, M'Baku (Winston Duke), and Thor are left on Wakanda, meanwhile Thanos rests and recuperates on another planet. After the credits, Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson) and Maria Hill (Cobie Smulders) witness many people disintegrating, causing destruction, Fury is able to transmit a distress signal before he and Hill disintegrate, the device displays a star insignia on a red-and-blue background (meaning Captain Marvel). Also starring Gwyneth Paltrow as Pepper Potts, William Hurt as Secretary of State Thaddeus Ross and Stan Lee as the Bus Driver. All of the cast as the superheroes are fantastic as usual, and Brolin is brilliant as the malevolent supervillain, there is a lot going on at once, but thankfully I followed it all, the special effects are spectacular, and the constant explosions and fight sequences are exciting, I wasn't expecting to end so dramatically and sombre, I cannot wait to see what happens next and how the heroes will be returned, overall this is a fantastic fantasy action adventure. It was nominated for Oscar for Best Visual Effects, and it was nominated the BAFTA for Best Special Visual Effects. Very good!","9"
"jedimasterdad","Disappointing!","28 April 2018","I enjoyed all of the Avengers movies, but this one was very disappointed.","9"
"kingdukus","I want the 2.5 hours of my life back","20 June 2018","The people who love this are idiots. Have all the great CGI you want, fill it with action and laughter BUT when the movie ends with HALF THE UNIVERSE DEAD it's a waste of time for me","9"
"Sidbono","Overratted","15 May 2018","I saw this film the Thursday it came out and I wanted to see if what everyone was saying was true and it wasn't. I'm gonna go through the thing I thought were good and bad. Good: #1 CGI, visuals The CGI in this film was really, really good. aside from a couple shots of Thanos the CGI was basically perfect. The CGI on Thanos made him look like an actual big purple man. Even getting little facial expressions and markings on his face that other company's wouldn't care to put the detail in for. The visuals in the film made everything look really interesting and gave the film some eye candy all throughout. #2 Thanos I would still say Loki from the first Avengers was better than Thanos but damn Thanos in this film was relentless and intimidating. Though I didn't care for his motivation, he was much better than Ultron mainly because Thanos never spit out any dumb and painfully unfunny humor. #3 Characters (I liked) and character interactions The only characters in the film I liked were: Iron Man, Hulk (or more appropriately Bruce Banner ) , Spider-man, Doctor Strange, Thor, and Thanos. I've already talked about Thanos so I'll talk about the others. The Interactions between Peter, Tony, and Strange were probably one of the best parts of the movie. They were actually kind of funny and were really entertaining. Thor's interactions between the Guardians were good. I didn't find it funny but it was entertaining. #4 Action The action was really entertaining and fun. It was creative and done really well. and of course it looked great. There was only one shot of shaky cam and it such a bad shot I literally couldn't see anything. Bad Things #1 Pacing The pacing in the first act wasn't very good. every time it cut to a new group of people the film was just frantically trying to catch up with itself. It gets better in the second and third but but every time it cut to the Guardians the film just came to a grinding halt. #2 Humor Humor is subjective, I know that. but the humor in the film was painfully unfunny and it wasn't made all that better by the crowd laughing every ten seconds in the theater. #3 Character deaths and other characters All the other characters I didn't care for mainly because they either did one thing or nothing. I get that a film with this big of a cast can't include everyone, but damn, to many characters did nothing, they were kind of just their. It's not all the better by the fact that most of the characters that died were characters that did nothing. All the original Avengers were left alive, and I feel like it would've been better if they killed at least one or two of them. the character deaths also weren't that heartbreaking or sad. Some just died and the Film moved on. The only death I cared for was Spider-Man cause he actually had a scene that was at least a little bit sad. #4 Romances The romances were just terrible. Wanda and Visions romance was just extremely awkward that was also accompanied with terrible dialogue. The romance between Bruce and Black Widow came back for one or two lines of dialogue and it's literally never acknowledged again. #5 Gamora's death. This has a section of it's own because of how horribly obvious it was. It actually amazes me that people were surprised that she died. after she said a line to Star-Lord about killing her if Thanos catches her I instantly knew that she was going to die. and what do you know she died about 30 minutes later. I personally feel it would've been more effective if she started begging Peter to kill her when she actually got captured. #6 Star-Lord His entire character was ruined for me. At a point in the film when Thanos is pinned down and they almost have the infinity gauntlet off him and Peter decides to hit Thanos in the face waking him up and thus dooming half the universe. It felt extremely out of character and I thought it would've been better if Drax did it. Thanos did destroy his planet and his family so shouldn't he do it. He is more of a loose canon and Peter is more logical. You might say he didn't attack him because he knew it was a bad idea and he didn't attack him earlier. But that's because Thanos had his guard up and would've easily destroyed him. So, Star- Lord killed everybody. #7 Wanda (Scarlet Witch) For my last section I would like to talk about Wanda. She could've easily defeated Thanos because of how powerful she is. There's a point on the Wakanda battlefield where five giant rolling saws are released and she comes out and destroys them instantly. And if she has the power to destroy an infinity stone she should be in battle killing everything. In conclusion this film is massively overrated and shouldn't be the 15th best film of all time according to Imdb. This is a 4/10.","9"

An industrially-made crapfest akin to MacDonald Hamburgers with bored-to-death actors easily repleceable with robots from a car factory. Avoid.","9"
"KnightFall1047","Flaming hot garbage","24 June 2018","A bloated smorgasbord of uninteresting protagonists (save Iron Man) fighting an oaf with magic crystals. Not to mention, an overzealous color pallete and use of CGI that left me longing to stare into a dark, bottomless pit for hours. The obligatory Marvel laugh lines were embarrassingly stale, though inexplicably humorous to the audience. From the cheap moments of social awkwardness or the annoying insecurity of Quill vis a vis Thor, I found myself constantly groaning. I say all this recognizing Justice League was also hot garbage, but at least a few of the characters were interesting. Oh how I miss those halcyon days of Christopher Nolan's Dark Knight trilogy - where the drama prevailed and the characters were worth caring for. Batman v. Superman had it's flaws (Martha!) but at least it's got heart! I found myself checking my watch less than an hour into Infinity War. This crossover was indeed too ambitious.","1"
"JohnDeSando","Yeah, every bit as good as critics say and more.","30 April 2018","Because my index for great epic adventure is dictated by Homer's Iliad and Odyssey, the Marvel heroic tales like Avengers: Infinity War supply my modern need to experience excellence but fall short of Homer's weighty themes and complex characters. However, with super-human visuals, contemporary heroic films do a credible job of taking the place of my imagination.

Not that that substitution is preferable to Homer's working my mind to create Cyclops and Sirens and assorted baddies as well as the original modern smart hero, Odysseus.

The Avengers and their buddies must come together to fight the mighty Thanos (Josh Brolin), whose goal as he decimates half the universe's population is to possess all six infinity stones. Because Vision (Paul Bettany) has the last one, you have an idea what the ending choreography will look like.

Yes, there will be the usual explosions and guns, which still strike me as incredulously outdated even though super-hero films abound with the munitions. I see in Infinity fewer explosions and fistfights than I have previously witnessed, a source of my abiding criticism of this genre. The Russo brothers directors have judiciously larded the film with these tropes while leaving plenty of room for wisecracks, a joy for me.

Nobody does them better than Tony Stark (Robert Downey, Jr.), with his better-than-thou intelligence and impeccably caustic wit: ""I swore off dairy, then Ben and Jerry's named a flavor after me.""Peter Quill/Star Lord (Chris Pratt) has some good ones as well: ""Let's talk about this plan of yours. I think it's good, except it sucks. So let me do the plan, and that way, it might be really good."" I like the witty repartee much more than the explosions.

With as many major warriors as could be possible on one screen, Infinity rarely develops character as we should expect in any drama, Greek or otherwise. Yet, the writers and directors can then guarantee the action to be constant and no one fall asleep, except those hard-core comic-book fans that wait for the scene after the end credits.

The final conflict guarantees a financially-rich opening for part two, which will have to move some to match the record-breaking first weekend take for Infinity. Homer would be happy enough with the new epics but much happier that his adventurers are guaranteed infinity or at least immortality.","1"

"juliankennedy23","A really good film from a series that has not lacked for great films.","28 December 2018","Avengers: Infinity War: 9 out of 10: Well after eighteenth or so movie you know the drill. Big Universe killing bad threatens puppies and kittens and our heroes put aside their differences to defeat the big bad and someone dies because the contract negotiations were at a standstill. Yup, I am sure that is what happens. Okay so the opening scene reminds me of Alien 3 but I am sure we are done with indiscriminate killing of beloved characters in brutal ways. (Two and a half hours later) Oh dear god...

The Good: This is a hero's journey. The fact that the hero in question is the big bad Thanos makes this a unique Marvel film. While having a big bad on a hero's journey is hardly unknown, it often isn't done this well (I am looking your way Star Wars Prequels). Thanos is a man with a plan. The Avengers are simply obstacles. And for the most part, they play the role of obstacles and setbacks on Thanos' journey.

Almost everyone comes to the party (sorry Hawkeye) and it is a blast. Thor meets the Guardians of the Galaxy was a particular treat. I liked the way they managed to reward viewership of the previous eighteen movies or so. Avenger's Infinity War is stuffed with Easter eggs and trivia. In fact, the movie really is amazingly stuffed over a very long runtime. Forget added filler, you actually get the sense they wanted to put in twice as much stuff as they did.

The Bad: With truncated participation by the individual Avengers some of them tended to revert to their baseline trope even though they have had growth over the recent films. I liked Thor in this film but he seemed to be more a person who had had a psychotic break than an actual hero. (In fairness this is called out in the film by the rabbit... sorry raccoon.)

Starlord as well seems to have lost two films worth of character development in many of his scenes. He also got chubby (also called out in the film by the rabbit). There is also some flotsam left over from the Civil War film that needed to handwaved better than it was. Overall though a great job bringing such a large cast together.

Is it bad form to wish that the Silver Surfer was in this film. Don't get me wrong I am not a fan of the character per se. But if you have a Thanos film you need a Silver Surfer.

The Ugly: Bruce Banner in the Iron Man Hulkbuster armor just never looked right. He looks like a Goomba had escaped from the set of the old Super Mario Brothers movie.

In Conclusion: You know I got some flack from reviewing the original X-men movies when I pointed out that Magneto had a good point. I am not saying Thanos is right mind you but the movie does make a compelling case. If it was just humans I think I could get behind it but since it includes kittens I am morally opposed. A really good film from a series that has not lacked for great films.","10"
"jace_the_film_guy","Culmination and Cliffhanger","16 July 2021","As a fan, I absolutely love ensemble films. As I have begun evaluating films with a more critical eye, I have realized how ensemble films make me tired and even bored at times. The dozens of ""main"" characters and 6 or 7 different subplots create a disinterest for me rather than heightened interest. That being said, this film is fantastic! It takes a fairly simple plot (Thanos trying to get the 6 stones and the Avengers trying to stop him) and weaves in nearly every character we have grown to love from the MCU.

The tension is real as we wait to see if Tony, Steve or other favorite characters will meet their end by the hand on Thanos. The culmination of ""the snap"" and its far-reaching consequences is one of the best moments in modern cinematic history. Infinity War leaves the audience dumbfounded with an unprecedented cliffhanger. You leave the film with tears in your eyes, sorrow in your heart and Peter's words echoing in your ears, ""Mr. Stark, I don't feel so good.""","5"
"Blarg-Kliggle","No actual depth","11 April 2019","I keep hearing about how complex and unique villain and how philosophical it is, so I decided to give it a chance. I'll be honest and note that as far as I'm concerned comic books are among the lowest forms of media, and the movies all feel more or less the same. I've always been a fan of second chances so I watched it with a friend and by the end it felt like we had seen two different movies. It was just another generic superhero ensemble movie with extra pretentiousness and angst, thanos was just a madman who convinced himself he was rational. It just further shows that being a nerd doesn't automatically mean you're smart, I can't wait until Hollywood gets past it's nerd phase...","3"

Not much character development but I guess that is what the sequals are for. The consequence of that is that the film really feels like another filler movie to cash out more on the Marvel universe. Hence the ending of the film of course.

Avengers infinity war does some good like showing different sides of the antagonist, explaining his motives and the reasoning behind them (unlike that stupid villain in Justice League), and making him do challenging decisions. I also liked the dialouge between the superheroes, especially the Guardians of the galaxy crew and Thor. Their scenes were really funny and I like the fact that humor is a central part between these characters, it makes the movie stick out from other typical superhero action movies, and it shows that it doesn't take itself so seriosuly. Those were some original points that stood out to me and made me not rate it a 3/10.","9"

With a cast as big as Thanos and action that blows you back into your seat, it's hard not to re-queue when the film is over. Unlike the destruction caused by Loki in the first film and Ultron in the second, with this film, Thanos brings a whole new definition of threat. The heroes' greatest battle begins here and the special effects, acting, emotion and intertwining story arcs make for an exiting Marvel experience. The humour element was well balanced, unlike the changing trend with some of the latest Marvel instalments, and the chemistry between characters seemed authentic. I do admit, however, that some scenes seemed disjointed and proved to block the flow of the narrative - a minor nit-picking issue. The pacing of the film flowed well and at no point, in the 2.5 hours, did I feel bored. Infinity War is a high-octane, action-fueled, amazing instalment that succeeds in living up to its insane fan hype.

"bononista","EPIC Beyond Words - Someone identify the Rickenbacker At Avengers HQ Please","29 April 2018","I fear that the theater box office might be slow as people who haven't seen the preceding films have to catch up before the film, or people who have only seen some of the films have to go watch the rest before returning for a second viewing.

Minimally one should have seen Ironman 2, all three Thor films, the GotG films, all Captaiin America films, and all the Avengers films along with Doctor Strange and Black Panther. If you these or read the comics it is a film that would be very difficult to follow ( you won't know the collector or why the Reality stone aka the Ether is there, etc.)

That said, if you've been all in since 2008 you're golden. And if you haven't read the comic arcs from which much of this is taken (five different books I think), you might be in for a shock. For me, all the speculation especially as it related to the comics and the actors contracts ends up being blown apart and I was relieved and shocked at the same time.

PS: The Real Question: In the scene at HQ when they discuss Vision and what to do, in the back on a stand next to Black Widow, is a Rickenbacker. Is it a 620 Fireglo DV247 and is it in homage to Tom Petty? It's not the Pete Townshend 360 and its not a bass. Someone find out which Rick is in the stand in the scene.

"shetty-05258","10 years in the making","29 April 2018","Avengers Infinity War is probably one of the most anticipated films of all time but does it live up to the hype? Yes it totally does live up to the hype and exceeds all expectations. In no way is Infinity war a perfect film as much as I wanted it to be but it is extremely ambitious and one of the best the MCU has to offer.

Avengers Infinity war finally gives us what we've waiting for so long, one massive event which brings all our favorite characters together fighting against the big bad Thanos. Thanos is finally here and he truly is spectacular but more on him later.

Let's begin with the fact that this film is super ambitious. To fit dozens of characters and several plot-lines into one cohesive two and a half hour film is no easy task but the Russo's have done it. The film feels grand andEpic. The film could've suffered from pacing issues what with all the characters and several things happening in different locations but it never feels rushed or slow but just right. The visual effects are spot on especially when it comes to creating elaborate fight sequences and realistic looking characters like Thanos and his children who are all computer generated.

Almost all the characters that we know and love are in this film and its quite awesome to see them interact. Watching characters that have never met each other before finally meet and fight together was like a dream come true. The banter between the heroes is well written and the chemistry between the characters is just perfect. The movie explored Doctor strange's powers a lot more which was fantastic but failed to do the same with Scarlett Witch as she does the same stuff she's been doing ever since Age of Ultron. Several characters get their jaw dropping goosebumps inducing moments that made the audience go crazy. Characters that stood out in this film for me would be Doctor Strange, Thor, Iron man and of course Thanos.

Before I get into Thanos I would like to address one of the gripes I had and that is the children of Thanos, Korvus Glaive, Proxima midnight, Cull obsidian and Ebony Maw. These four looked great but there was nothing much under the surface. They were just mini bosses the heroes had to fight before Thanos. But for the most part I can forgive that because of Thanos is the best MCU villain ever. Thanos is great at beating the crap out of everyone but he was also a villain I could empathize with. He had compelling motivations and a lot of character depth. What's great about Thanos is that he isn't just a large strong guy but a character you can care about. Josh Brolin is perfect as Thanos and I can't think of anyone who could have done it better.

The fight sequences are well balanced with each character getting their time to shine. Creating a long and elaborate fight scene with multiple characters takes a lot of planning and hard work but the Russo's have done it well before and they did it even better this time. The comedy is present and for the most part is handled properly but sometimes they do manage to ruin serious moments with jokes that don't always work.

Avengers Infinity War is a near masterpiece that has it all. From spectacle to shocking twists and revelations and a perfect villain. I highly recommend Avengers Infinity war and I'm gonna go with a 9 out of 10","5"

Now that's out the bag, let me get down to the grit.

After 10 years and 18 movies, finally, the War is here! As a spectacle summer popcorn movie this has no equal, as a technical achievement, there is no better, as a moving relationship drama with real depth and threat, The only other time I have experienced anything close was the LOTR trilogy... its that good!

Yes, its safe to assume that I am a Marvel fan-boy and may be just a tad biased in my opinions, however, I always try to go into MCU movies with an open mind, never expecting what happens on screen to rival the many stories I have consumed over the decades in the books. This does, in every possible way.

Less politically relevant than Black Panther but with ten times more heart, as funny as Ragnarok but with a million times the threat this is the culmination of thousands of hours of hard work and devotion from a studio who not only know what they are doing but also clearly love what they do too, and it shows In every beautifully framed shot, every character interaction and every emotional death scene, right up to the cliffhanger to rival that of the first Matrix.

The biggest surprise to me was Thanos. A genuine force of nature. The biggest bad in the MCU. The Mad Titan himself.... a loving father with a complicated back story and impossible decisions to make whilst carrying the fate of the universe on his vast shoulders! This is no doubt, 100% HIS movie. Brolin nails it, with the assistance of the best mo-cap in cinema history, he is able to convey a tortured, moving performance that resonates with the audience who can not help but almost agree with his logic, you almost want him to win!

The rest of the ensemble cast are great as usual, the dynamics between the team-ups are superbly handled, especially the scenes with the Guardians, who, thanks to Drax, inject most of the humour. The Tony Stark/Peter Parker relationship also expands on the groundwork laid in Civil War and continued in Homecoming, to great effect. Tony, more than ever truly cares for Pete and as such feels a greater sense of responsibility than ever. With great power, right? Furthermore, the Wanda/Vision, Quill/Gamora, Rocket/Groot, relationships are all dealt with incredibly well, with heartfelt emotion and genuine love for each other. Trust me, there will be lumps in throats! on the flip side is Thor and Cap, who are both dealing with loss, Thor dealing with the destruction of Asgard and Steve with the state of the fractured Avengers, they are very much the 'solo' heroes, both with nothing to lose, both at their most dangerous. Dr Strange also plays a huge part in the narrative of the film, however, alongside Hulk, Black Widow, War Machine, Falcon, Winter Soldier and Black Panther, they are very much the window dressing to fill the gaps between the main event.

The pacing of the movie is spot on, it really never felt like 2 and a half hour film and had Avengers 4 started right after I could have probably sat (on the edge of my seat) through that too!

If I had to find a negative it would probably be Hulk shaped, but that's really clutching at straws, this is an outstanding achievement and a milestone in cinema. Go see it. Go see it again, you will not be disappointed. I'm off to catch viewing number 3.","9"
"dreddjuddge","X-Force + Avengers + Magneto = Good!","26 June 2018","SPOILERS: Justified expectation of the fan MARVEL I decided to make my review of the third part of the Avengers. Immediately I can say that I'm doing reviews for the first time.

So, I like watching movies MARVEL, and I was happy to wait for this part, like everyone else, because it was the fate of the car-kicking MARVEL. But in a year there will be ""Avengers 4"", but the third part did what other films MARVEL could not. And this is the death of the main characters to the clicks of Thanos. I was very surprised. I can tell only the pros and cons of this film:

Pluses:

* Thank you for long-wating DEATH Loki! ...

Unexpected twists and turns, like the mysterious location of the last Infinity stone - the Soul stone, well-designed special effects and graphics, a huge number of MARVEL heroes and of course Thanos. The Rousseau brothers made a real villain of Thanos with normal motivation. This bastard is ready for anything for the sake of stones and will not stop at nothing. We can hate it somewhere in moments, understand it and empathize with it. I believe that Josh Brolin perfectly got used to this character. The main female characters are as always ideal and good, an excellent soundtrack, action scenes and good humor in some moments.

Minuses:

Unjust ending, stupid actions of the main characters, more that some characters forgot their abilities, or at the right time they did not use them at the first opportunity. Also, I did not like the fact that Falcon's eyes were not shown with the Ant-Man. Although we were told that they would appear in this film. Too much pathos and prolonged dialogue.

Conclusion:

Despite the shoals of the film, he may like everyone, even those who begin to get acquainted with the films about superheroes. But I strongly recommend that you first look at all 18 movies of the movie-market MARVEL before watching the third Avengers. And also it's a pity that the competitors of DC can not withdraw their kinomiks, which will surpass the War of Infinity. Although the DC comes out Aquaman and Shazam, but still they can not surpass this masterpiece. Still very happy for the fact that this film Joss Weedon did not shoot, but he could turn into an unfriendly comedy.

"sathisk","Did NOT live up to it's hype!","26 April 2018","If you love CGI and special effects, I think Marvel did a fine job. Other than that, it did not live up to it's hype, at least for me. I felt the entire movie was science vs sorcery and the latter won...for now. By the way, I loved all the previous Marvel super hero movies.

WARNING: FULL SPOILERS AHEAD

SPOILER:There seem to be no coherency with other Marvel super hero movies (although it was supposed to be) and with too many plot holes. It felt like the movie was everywhere and nowhere at the same time.

A lot of scenes didn't make sense if you have watched previous Marvel super hero movies. This movie makes some of the super heroes a lot weaker and some a lot stronger for no apparent reason except to enable Thanos to wipe out half the Universe.

The movie starts of with a decimated Asgardian spaceship. Where was Hulk and Valkyrie when this happened? Sure, Hulk pops up just before Loki hands over the Tesseract. The strongest Avenger is no match for Thanos. What? Seriously? I get it. Thanos is something like 10x stronger than Hulk even without the infinity gauntlet. But come on? Did they just do that to make a short scene before Heimdall transports Hulk to Earth? I felt it's such a waste that Hulk doesn't appear in the entire movie after this scene.

Loki. Isn't he the god of mischief? Why didn't he just clone himself or appear as a hologram of himself like he did in the first Avenger movie or in Ragnarok? Where did his powers go?

Thor: Is he only powerful with his weapon? I remember in Ragnarok when Odin said Thor is powerful even with his hammer, the Mjolnir. And he took on Hela and her army without a weapon. Later in this movie, Thor is blasted with the force of a supernova, during the process of making the Storm Breaker and he survives, although badly bruised and battered. My point is if Thor has such powers to withstand the force of a supernova, why couldn't he leave a scratch on Thanos during the attack on the Asgardian ship?

Bruce Banner: Remember in the first Avenger movie during the battle of New York when Bruce tells Steve Rodgers ""Captain, that's my secret. I'm always angry""? What happened now? When he couldn't turn into Hulk, why didn't Tony Stark just shoot him or roll him under a bus or push him off a building like how Black Widow did in Age of Ultron? That would have turned him into Hulk for sure, wouldn't it?

Bruce Banner is funny but he is not a comedy actor. Too bad Marvel turned him into one in this movie long with Tony Stark to a certain extent.

Proxima Midnight. If you know how powerful she is and the spear she holds (created from a star trapped in a quantum singularity), there is no way in hell Captain America, Black Widow and Falcon could have beaten her and Corvus Glaive. Here, Marvel makes these 3 super heroes way more powerful than they are. I think Scarlet Witch has more powers to take down these 2 villains. Sadly, they portray her as a weaker super hero in this particular scene. Don't even get me started on Vision's apparent weakness. He's supposed to be made of Vibranium and fly through solid objects as shown in Civil War, right? Did he leave those powers at home?

Is Titan's atmosphere (nitrogen with methane and ethane clouds) breathable? Let's send Matt Damon to find out. Oh wait, Marvel has already sent Peter Parker, Tony Stark and Dr. Strange. Apparently, you can breath.

Hulk is the strongest Avenger. If Thanos is 10x stronger than Hulk and can knock him out with a few punches, I'm sure one punch from him would kill any of Earth's other super heroes. Even with his Iron Man suit on, you'd think Tony Stark wouldn't stand a change. Well, you'd be wrong. And to add insult to injury, even Captain America can survive a punch from Thanos, with just a bloodied nose. Really Marvel? If Marvel wanted to keep Steve Rodgers and Tony Stark for the next Avenger movie, the punch scene was really unnecessary as it does not serve justice to Thanos' strength.

Oh and by the way, the new Iron Man suit is just freaking awesome. Tony Stark definitely can take out Thanos (without the infinity stones of course) with it. But why was it so difficult to pull out the gauntlet from Thanos' arm is beyond me.

Credit roll: Did I see the names of the guys who mows the lawn and cleans the pool for Kevin Feige's and the Russo brother's vacation homes? I sure felt like I did. (Hint: It took that long to show the post credit scene).

Spoiler: With Spider-man, Black Panther, Star Lord and Dr. Strange wiped out from the Universe, I guess these super heroes related movies will be coming out after Avengers 4!","9"
"boblipton","An Infinite Number Of Characters In An Infinite Length Of Time","15 November 2021","Thanos is busy collecting Infinity Stones for his Gauntlet, starting out by killing Loki, and spends the bulk of the movie roving around the universe collecting most of them, while his minions try to get the two on this planet, thwarted by the various super-powered individuals (and the Black Widow), while the Guardians of the Galaxy hook up with Thor to thwart him from one and build the anti-Thanos weapon, preparatory to the final battle which (spoiler) takes place in Wakanda.

The three hour movie rambled hither and yon, with most characters getting enough screen time to be identifiable. Nonetheless, at the forty-five-minute mark, I whispered to my cousin ""I've lost track of who's who"" and he muttered back ""Me too"", despite having seen all the earlier movies. Chris Hemsworth as Thor gets the best jokes, there's one major continuity issue that annoyed me in the big final battle, and the visuals abandoned their adherence to comics I could identify -- understandably so, given the great range of sources they used. Still, it was a well-run matter, even if the MCU has gotten too large for a single movie to include everyone.

For those who look forward to the little scene that runs after the credit starts, you'll have time to duck out for a quick bathroom break (almost three hours, as I said), as it takes place at the end of the credits and leads into CAPTAIN MARVEL, schedule for 2019 -- which is supposed to be set in the 1990s.","10"
"nickdnk","Comic book hack and slash cannot go above 7","29 April 2018","It does not matter how much of a fan you are, this movie is generic, lowest denominator entertainment. It's fine, but does not deserve its current rating of 9.1. Are you guys kidding? This is as good as The Godfather or Shawshank? Please.

"sufyaanrashid95","A Gripping Epic of Superhero Proportions","21 May 2023","Avengers: Infinity War is a gripping and epic superhero film that brings together the entire Marvel Cinematic Universe in a battle against their most formidable foe yet, Thanos. Directed by Anthony and Joe Russo, the film features an all-star cast, including Robert Downey Jr., Chris Hemsworth, Mark Ruffalo, Chris Evans, Scarlett Johansson, and many more.

The film is a masterful blend of action, drama, and humor. The action sequences are stunning, with intricate fight scenes and explosive set pieces that keep you on the edge of your seat. The drama is intense, with high stakes for all of the characters involved. And the humor is well-placed and never feels forced, providing much-needed levity in the midst of the chaos.

One of the strengths of this film is its ability to balance so many characters and storylines. The film weaves together multiple plot threads from the various Marvel films, creating a cohesive and engaging narrative. The film also introduces new characters, such as the Guardians of the Galaxy, seamlessly integrating them into the larger universe.

The performances in this film are top-notch. The cast is clearly invested in their roles, and their chemistry is palpable. The film also features a standout performance from Josh Brolin as Thanos, who manages to make the character both terrifying and sympathetic.

Overall, Avengers: Infinity War is a must-see for any superhero fan. With its gripping storyline, stunning action, and outstanding performances, it is a worthy addition to the Marvel Cinematic Universe. The film is a testament to the power of the superhero genre and a thrilling ride from start to finish.","3"
"TheHonestCritic","After all this time, I'm still trying to process this movie. To this day, it's still mind-blowing!","17 April 2019","The 10 year build up of Marvel movies was definitely worth it, and certainly worth the hype. ""Avengers: Infinity War"" (2018), directed by Anthony and Joe Russo. Starring Robert Downey Jr., Chris Hemsworth, Mark Ruffalo, Chris Evans, Josh Brolin, and many more! All I can say is, just like ""Captain America: The Winter Soldier"" (2014), this movie was mind-blowing. Mentally, I was not prepared for this masterpiece of a movie. I went in there with high hopes, and those hopes were exceeded. Everything ranging from the acting, the special effects, the story, etc. It was all first-rate (AND THEN SOME!) Now, one thing that can ruin a movie is annoying one-liners, or jokes. Marvel movies are full of them! However, this film keeps them to a minimum, which was very refreshing. They're finally realizing how unnecessary most one-liners are in their movies. What jokes they do have in ""Avengers: Infinity War"", are funny, and they are few and far between. It is a very well-balanced film from action, to comedy, and to drama. It was one of those rare experiences where a movie was so good, that the theater was silent during the whole movie. When that happens, you know you did a good job with your movie. I do have to confess something. A lot of you know that I didn't like the ""Black Panther"" (2018) movie, I also really hate the ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" movies, ""Ant-Man"" (2015), and the ""Doctor Strange"" (2016) movie. I was worried that those characters might ruin the movie, or be distracting. But, they were not bad at all. Like I said, Black Panther works better as a team player, and so does Doctor Strange and the Guardians of the Galaxy. In solo movies, those characters are dull, boring, cringeworthy and sometimes obnoxious! However, when they're part of a team, or playing side characters, they're not obnoxious at all. Also, since Ant-Man isn't in this movie, he's not a factor! Is this the best superhero movie? It's phenomenal, but there are some that I still personally like better. Is it the new best Marvel movie? Well, it's certainly in my top 5 on my Marvel Cinematic Universe ranking list! Overall, the cast is insane, but Josh Brolin as Thanos really steals the show. I will not spoil anything about this movie for you. You'll have to go see the movie to find out for yourself! Believe me, you won't be the same. If you think you know what this movie will be like from watching the trailers, you have no idea what you're in for! Props to you, Anthony and Joe Russo. You guys did a Marvel-ous job! I look forward to the sequel, and other future movies with your involvement. It's worth the money to buy on DVD, or to find some other method of watching it. Obviously, I give this film a full 5 out of 5 star rating, which equates to 10 out of 10 IMDB stars. If you haven't seen ""Avengers: Infinity War"" yet, what are you waiting for? You must check it out!","9"
"erikbojesson","Writing this a month after having watched Endgame..","27 May 2019","..and to me this is on another level. I just watched it for the second time not having seen it since it premiered last spring and it was as least as good as I remembered.

IW is probably the most entertaining superhero movie I have ever seen and it's not just action.

To me it gets so many small details right and I think it's emotional in a much better way than Endgame.

Thor, Cap, Doctor Strange etc. are showing themselves from their best possible sides and I just enjoy it.

And a few lines about Endgame.. I know I am in a minority here but to me it was average. Way too much about depression, way too little about hope. Fat Thor was terrible, the use of Carol Danvers wasted, the interaction between the characters strange.. Especially that there was no introduction whatsoever for Carol Danvers was a huge disappointment for me.

Infinity War gets all those things right in a much better way and there are no such bothering ""mistakes"" anywhere.

9.5/10 and I am truly sorry Endgame didn't live up to my expectations.","1"

It seemed to me that avenger team was loosing the battle with ""Thanos"" deliberately and intentionally so that ""Thanos"" can be dragged for another installment of this franchise.There were so many scenes where nothing made sense. It all felt like the director wanted avengers to loose .Even Hulk cried like a baby and never showed up after getting ass kicked by Thanos. Dr Strange had control over time but he didnt use it rather he handed over the stone to Thanos. Loki died like he never existed.Galaxy girl didnt want Thanos to find her so she took a smart move and went straight to him.Her Boyfriend who was about to shoot her himself, woke Thanos up while other team members were about to take the source of his power just to know the whereabouts of his lost girlfriend.Thor knew that thanos's power source was his gauntlet so instead of aiming at the gauntlet he aimed for his chest so that he can live and kill all others.. Spider man who is a superhero and always ready to give up his life to save humanity was crying at the arms of Iron man saying ""I don't wanna die"".Vision who was one of the most powerful super hero kept other super heroes busy to save his own ass instead contributing to the greater cause.Other than all these, everything was awesome!!","6"

It was too much and much too inconsistent. Battles that should have been won were not for stupid reasons. I started to cheer and then had this WTF happened?

It's worth watching, but, well... just but...","5"
"alekspredator87","Purple enemy is enemy number one","20 July 2022","""Losing is always bitter... Consider yourself right and lose..."". These words always come to mind when it comes to ""Avengers 3"" or Thanos. Powerful, painfully truthful and devastating.

Infinity War wasn't just an expected movie. He was mega-expected. The whole history of the Infinity Stones, all the storylines led to this final point of action. The intensity of expectation has reached unprecedented peaks. Therefore, the film had to be two or even three heads higher than its predecessors, so that the viewer was really stunned. And it was quite possible for the creators.

What did you remember about the film? Yes to everyone. There are so many emotions at once, but you need to put them on the shelves. The obvious thing that probably delighted me and everyone was the masterfully staged development of the plot. Almost all the characters from past films are here. So much was not even in the ""Citizen"". A couple dozen, if not more. And that's cool. The directors perfectly show each character, their experiences and difficult decisions, dedication and striving for their goal. Of course, when watching the viewer looks back at the previous films, he already has an opinion about each character. Therefore, in ""War"" all the attention is on the action, which, by the way, is insanely much.

The film starts, immediately setting up a serious and uncompromising mood. The first scenes are gloomy, the music presses, and the henchman of the villain literally sentences with his monologue. And it was strong. Let the film then change its tone from gloomy to cheerful and back several times, still the general mood remains not at all comical.

The main antagonist is remembered. Thanos, in my opinion, stands above all the villains who were in the film universe. He is diverse, his thoughts, clothed in words, are well understood. Sometimes it doesn't leave the feeling that his plan is a bit childish, and the decision to deal with everyone is a bit silly, especially with artifacts such as Infinity Stones, but in his reality this is the best decision, he came to it, and he defends it.

The film is gorgeous in its visual component. In 2.5 hours, the viewer gets just a lot of impressions, sees the maximum possibilities of the cinematic universe, every frame, every scene is full of events and a magnificent visual component. The pictures are diverse. There are cities on Earth, and Wakanda, and Titan, and space. And everything has its own unique colors and shades. There is also sound and music. Oppressive, and somewhere victorious, brutal or sentencing - all the sounds absolutely organically fit into the concept of the film.

And of course the finale was simply stunning. I remember how the whole hall fell silent, observing the metamorphoses that were unclear at that time.

The movie came out great. Marvel has shown its true trump cards, including emotional clashes, unpredictable deaths in the best traditions of the ""Game of Thrones"", and the viewer suddenly realizes that it turns out that even here the heroes do not have absolute invulnerability, and they are mortal. And that's right. Let the stereotypes be broken.

""Infinity War"" demonstrated an excellent result, rose above all previous works within the film universe, broke off suddenly, forcing the audience to guess for another year what would happen next and thereby making the interest in the next picture even greater.

10 out of 10.","2"
"darkshadows1981","Lives up to its name","6 January 2019","This film lives up to its name ""Infinity War."" This film is an action packed thriller with nonstop battle sequences and a few filler content along the way. The special effects and CGI is extraordinary.

There are two major downsides to this film. The first and obvious one is if you have not seen any of the past 30+ Marvel movies or read any of their comics then you're not going to identify too many characters and you definitely won't know their backstory. The second downside and the one that has me giving this film a six of 10 instead of anything higher is the total lack of plot development. The plot was so poorly developed that it even affected the character development in the film.

Thanos wants to wipe out lives but it never is fully explained why. He talks of his ""destiny"" and need to wipe out lives but there is no backstory explaining why. You are introduced to his relationship between him and his daughter but it is so brief that you end up with more questions than answers.

The film has too many plot holes throughout that leads me to tell people who haven't seen the movie to wait until the second Infinity War movie to come out before trying to watch this one because the abrupt ending and poor storytelling will leave you very disappointed.","9"
"WooderIce64","Epic, exciting, and Loaded","13 May 2018","Infinity War was just about as hyped as a movie can get. It had the most viewed online trailer ever, was #3 all time in pre-sales, and was first teased back in 2012 with The Avengers, and most of the MCU movies since then have all been building up to this. Ever since the Infinity Stones were first introduced in the first Thor movie, people have believed that we would see Thanos' quest to collect the all on the big screen. Perhaps most impressive is that it had the biggest opening weekend ever, beating Star Wars: The Force Awakens in the U.S. with $257,000,000, and beating Fate of the Furious globally with $640,000,000.

Now, it's impossible to talk about this movie without spoilers, so be warned. Given the sheer number of characters and plotlines in this movie, there's quite a bit to take in. It alternates between sets of characters such as Team Cap+Vision, the Thor/Rocket/Groot combo, the Guardians/Iron Man/Strange/Spidey combo, and, of course, Thanos himself. It's definitely true that there isn't enough screen time to go around, which for casual viewers, may be a problem. However, for fans of the MCU, it's fine. It doesn't introduce any new major heroes, so most of the character development already happened in the previous films in the franchise. It also has some good humor and several memorable lines (Get lost, Squidward!) There is some development to be had. Thor does deal with Loki's death and the aftermath of Ragnarok. There are new things happening with the Guardians. However, some characters, notably Captain America, Black Panther, and Bucky don't get enough screen time.

If there was one thing this movie absolutely needed to get right, it was that Thanos had to be a great villain. And he was. On the outside, he was everything he needed to be; threatening, serious, cruel, intimidating, and still really believes that what he does is right. But yet on the inside, he does have some heart. Right after he kills Gamora, it really does seem like he's really heartbroken by it. Part of why the movie works is because Thanos is the central character. He gets the most screen time. It's called ""Avengers: Infinity War,"" but the Avengers aren't the central focus. This is really Thanos' story. The Black Order isn't really the best set of villains. But they are side villains, so it's fine that they don't get as much screen time. Ebony Maw was pretty cool. Proxima Midnight and Corvus Glave felt like glorified minions. Cull Obsidian was lame.

Another part of why this movie works is because the stakes feel real. It subverts the tropes of heroes always winning, killing Loki and Heimdall in the first 10 minutes. Not only are the stakes there, but the situations where characters have to kill each other to prevent Thanos from getting a stone have a great amount of tension to them. (Star-Lord and Gamora, Doctor Strange and Iron Man, Vision and Scarlet Witch) You know they're not afraid to kill off their heroes. Whenever there's an action scene, there's the uncertainty angle. You don't know who's going to die, and it could very well be anyone.

The action scenes were absolutely spectacular. There are several of them, and they last for quite a while. The New York fight, which is Doctor Strange and Wong vs Ebony Maw and Iron Man and Spider-Man vs Cull Obsidian, was the first real fight, and a great, exciting action scene. The Battle of Wakanda wasn't as cool as we hoped, given how much it showed up in the trailers. Still, it was very fun to watch, very extensive, and has the same high stakes. Heck, it even delivers somewhat of a sword fight, between Okoye, Black Widow, and Proxima Midnight. Coming off Black Panther, though, it feels kind of rehashed, given that we saw this three months ago. The battle on Titan was probably the best. We saw a new Iron Man suit, new Doctor Strange powers, some Spider-Man one liners, and even Mantis gets in on the fun. And, of course, there's the part where Iron Man gets impaled. He lives, but it's shocking nonetheless.

Then, of course, there's the elephant in the room - the ending. Holy crap. The shock factor was definitely there. I knew going in that there was a shocking ending. I thought it was either the Snap, or that Iron Man dies. The snap was absolutely devastating, taking out by my count, 6 Avengers, 4 Guardians, and others like Nick Fury and Maria Hill. I'd say the most shocking death was Black Panther. I thought he was untouchable given the popularity. But then again, by the time that came out, this movie was probably in post-production, so what can you do? Spidey's was really painful to watch. Doctor Strange hit hard personally. But it just felt cheap. Those of us who know the comics know that the snap got undone. You know they're coming back. There's no way in hell they'd kill off Spidey or Black Panther for real. But there's no other way to end it. Thanos was unbeatable with 5 stones, you can't have the whole movie be about #6. Plus, everyone who doesn't know the comics (which is the vast majority of the MCU audience) didn't expect it. The biggest spoiler they expected was that either Cap or Iron Man was going to die. But with the resurrections, it feels like anyone who died could come back. Except Heimdall. He's dead. Loki has ""died"" before. Gamora is in the Soul Stone. Vision could be rebuilt. But how else could this end? Like Doctor Strange said, this is the only way.

Infinity War is quite the film. It's a lot to take in, but it's a very exciting, well paced film that delivers on most of the hype it's been building up to. Fans of the MCU will definitely enjoy it more than casual moviegoers, and some may find the ending leaves a bad taste. However, it's clearly a Part 1, and it will be interesting to see how it unfolds in Part 2.","3"
"pulikd","""Avengers"" versus Thanos versus ""Guardians"". Insanity Store","8 February 2022","There are two reasons Thanos is a titan. First, he is big. Second, he comes from a planet named Titan. Once upon a time that planet faced a serious problem. The population was too big and the resources were not enough. That was when Thanos came forth and said he had a solution, and that was to kill half of their population so the remaining half would prosper, and he wanted to kill individuals regardless of their social position and wealth, so it would be fair. He was labeled mad, but the problem of the planet, eventually, got worse, and now there are two things to say about these titans. First, the planet is a wasteland with no apparent life. Second, our mad titan Thanos has now been flying from planet to planet with his big army, killing half of all life on every planet on his way. But something has changed. There are six supernatural artefacts known as the infinity stones, and they give their owner colossal power should the owner be big and strong enough to deal with their energy. Thanos, the mad titan, has been collecting these stones for their power, and should he get his hands on all six, he will no longer need to kill anyone anywhere in a fight, because the six stones will, apparently, enable him to kill all the life in the entire Universe with the snap of his fingers. But because he thinks of himself as a merciful creature, he only wants to kill half of all life.

How many populated planets are there? And how many of them are overpopulated? Does Thanos check if they are overpopulated or not before wreaking havoc on any of them? And why does he care so much about all of those alien planets? What are they to him? One of the so-called infinity stones is, apparently, responsible for time, and it gives you the ability to go back and forth through time, so why not use that one stone to go back in time and fix his own planet instead of a murderous rampage through the whole Universe? And again, how many populated planets are there in the cosmos? And how many of them are overpopulated and in desperate need of resources? Is there any realism at all to any of this? Or is this a cartoonish joke?

What happens if he does get his hands on all the stones and snap his fingers? What if there is a nuclear reactor somewhere on Earth and half of the personnel just vanishes in an instant? What if it leads to a nuclear explosion? What if there are multiple installations like this? What if half of all the car drivers instantly vanish? Does Thanos realize that his snap will cause more problems than help? And is killing the only thing that the stones can do or do they basically grant wishes? The movie shows Thanos using the stones to manipulate reality itself, so why can he not terraform planets and create resources for the excessive amounts of populations on different planets? Why, with all the power he now has, does he only want to perform murder? What is it he wants exactly? Does he want to help someone or is he just a bad guy that wants to do bad things but also wants to justify his bad actions with pretentious nonsense?

The heroes of the film try to stop Thanos. And in spite of all the magical power he has when facing any of them, they manage to put up a serious fight. And he, in spite of being the merciful mass murderer he is, does not kill any of them. He encounters them, tells them what his plan is, the stupid movie villain he is, and then he gets what he wants using much more efforts than required, and then he just leaves with all of his opponents alive. What if they show up next time and prevent him from getting the last stone, or what if some of them find a miraculous way to seriously damage him? Does he think at all or is he just dumb?

One of our heroes used to live with Thanos and do secret missions for him. One of such missions was to find one of the six stones. She did accomplish that mission but she is no longer with Thanos, she is with the good guys now, but she is the only person in the world who knows where that one secret stone is, and once she learns that Thanos has been collecting the stones for some time, she rushes to where Thanos is most likely to show up next. What is it she wants here? At this point in the movie it is already clear Thanos is the mightiest living being out there. There is no stopping him. Does she hope to kill him? Why not do the smart thing and keep as far away from the monster as possible? Why carry the secret to the one creature that is most dangerous should it know the secret? What nonsense is this?

Anyway, all of these movies are dumb, but the good thing about them is, they can be entertaining, and they can look good. ""Infinity War"" is cartoonish nonsense that tries to make you take it as seriously as possible, no matter the insanity happening on that screen, no matter the stupid jokes littered here and there. This isn't the next ""Star Wars"", and this isn't the next ""Lord of The Rings"", but it may fool you into thinking it is. But this is a huge movie with a lot of expensive visual effects, and Thanos is a computer generated humanoid creature that can easily rival the quality of those blue aliens from ""Avatar"", and the so-called Battle of Wakanda bears clear resemblance to the Battle of Naboo from ""The Phantom Menace"", only this one has no gungans, so, all of this is supposed to look impressive, right? Well, the warriors of Wakanda do not boast great weaponry and have no battle beasts.

The visual effects themselves may be good or even great, but they account for little if the movie is unable to handle and present them. And that is the case because the director of photography here is the one behind 2013's ""Elysium"" and a few ""Marvel"" movies like ""The Winter Soldier"". What does that mean? It means the camera is handled in a rude way and a lot of the footage is akin to found footage, and the light is handled in a way that is more akin to J. J. Abrams and his two ""Star Trek"" movies. ""Avengers: Infinity War"" has visual accomplishments but they are damaged by how the film looks in general, it looks raw and it makes your eyes hurt.

As for the characters, there are two teams of heroes in the movie. Some of that screen time is wasted because they are idiots that cannot communicate with one another in a competent way. Apart from these idiots, unlike what 2012's ""The Avengers"" had, there's nobody else involved in the global fight, no armies, no governments, nothing. And the movie ends with the bad guy winning. And because of how much he talks about what he is doing, some may be easily fooled into taking his side and rooting for him, but in reality, Thanos is an idiot and probably the best character in the whole film is Groot, the walking and talking tree. He is a child that wants nothing to do with any of this madness. He just wants to play that game of his. And that is all he does for quite some time, but things keep happening around him. First, the team he's a part of encounters a human being surviving outer space. He turns out to be Thor the God of Thunder. He has been through a lot, and now he needs a new superweapon to use against a new super-enemy. Groot ends up on this weapon making mission and sees how Thor suffers making the weapon because the equipment is in horrible condition. The weapon itself is an axe, and the metal part of it is now ready, only there is no handle. The weapon deals with magic, if it is completed, Thor will not die from the damage he has just sustained forging the axe using the power of a star, and Groot has now seen things more impressive and captivating than some silly game. So he puts the game down and uses his own wooden arm as the handle for the axe. He can grow it back. And from now on, he is in the fight.

Ironically, too much is happening in the movie, unbalanced. It lacks precision and focus, and because of how cinematography works in the movie, saying the movie looks good would be a lie.","1"

"stevenrotherforth","Finally a villain we can believe in","27 April 2018","Avengers: Infinity War

From watching the trailers for this epic summer tent pole movie. I got the same feeling as I did when viewing the trailer for The Dark Knight Rises. A real sense of real peril. The feeling of dread that our beloved heroes may not make it all the way through this one. Just as Bane looked like the unstoppable force too powerful for The Batman to stop. Thanos appears to be too big and bad for all the Avengers assembled together to take on. Boy was my initial feeling spot on! From the opening ten minutes enough happens to solidify the fact that our heroes are neck deep and some may not get to hang up their cape at the end of the day and kick back with a nice glass of Chardonnay. Even with the help of the Guardians of the Galaxy and a couple of new recruits in the form of Spidey, Dr Strange and the Black Panther, Thanos is the villain we've been craving for. Unlike the poor generic CGI creation of Steppenwolf from the Justice League. Here we have a baddie we can believe in and most importantly fear. He has a motive and depth to his character. Not just another big smashy blow stuff up villain. He is wonderfully realised on screen with a commanding performance from Josh Brolin. The computer wizardry used to bring him to life is jaw dropping. Facial expressions look realistic and Brolin""s performance is able to shine through.

Anyway enough said about the bad guy, what about our heroes. I'll not go into story and plot. If you are planning on seeing this you'll most likely already have the gist of things. If not then going into this with no expectations will further elevate the experience. I can say that there's good news as everyone seems to get their moment in the sun but for me it is both Thor and Starlord that steal the show. It is the scenes with Thor and the Guardians that are the highlights of the movie. Thor in particular has risen from being the bland member of the MCU to one of the most likeable. His turn in Ragnorok and now here further proves this. Also this time around we get a bit more Banner and a little less Hulk, which on paper sounds disappointing but Mark Ruffalo's performance is most enjoyable. Tom Holland as Peter the Spiderman Parker once again cements the fact that he was the right choice for the role. For me he's the best onscreen incarnation of the character yet. Benedict Cumberbatch nails it as Doctor Strange and Robert Downey Jr once again is supremely likeable as the Ironman. Everyone is great but some get more screen time than others. It is commendable how the Russo brothers have managed to weave everyone into the plot and give weight to their involvement in the story. No one is included just for the sake of it. Certain characters are side lined but this is understandable and necessary to help the story proceed in part two. Infinity War is definitely a movie that will get even better with multiple viewings. There's so much going on that it's impossible for the human brain to absorb it all first time around.

This movie may not be a perfect one but it is perfectly entertaining. CGI, cinematography and set design are second to none. Only a scene right at the end with Bruce Banner inside the Hulk buster armour looked a little jarring. Sound is ear shatteringly good and the score gives a real sense of dread and looming threat. Despite all the doom and gloom this movie still has a good dose of humour. There's something deeply satisfying in seeing all your favourite Marvel heroes from separate movies uniting and interacting with one another. The Russo brothers played a master stroke in pairing certain characters together for the first time. Stark and Strange worked wonderfully together as did the aforementioned Starlord and Thor. Avengers: Infinity War is a ten out of ten movie for me. It did exactly what I wanted it to. It gave me plenty of surprises, humour, peril and action and left me hanging on. It's going to be a long wait til part two rolls into theatres.","9"

"DoNotComeToTheCinemaDepressed","SUCH MAGNITUDE. It's the best movie, not just the best Super hero movie, It's the best movie I have ever seen 👑","20 March 2020","Basically it's the Best movie I have ever seen, it is also the Greatest Cinematic Experience I have been a part of, and it has the best Villain I have ever witnessed. Nothing I have seen in a Cinema has been remotely close to this experience. This is the Apex of Marvel.

Pieces of this Masterpiece:

° Thanos is the best villain that was ever written. He has hunger and drive, he radiates power, he is a deep philosopher and he also has emotional depth to his character. He had a task to undertake and after, he just wanted to sit down and watch the sunset when he had accomplished the mission.

° The going from one planet to the next and exploring the galaxy thorough cinematic means gives the movie a Swift and Compelling feel to it.

° When the huge Ring Ship enters the Earth, you could feel the stakes and notches went up by 2.

° The Entire Movie Felt like a Major World Event

° You could really feel the stakes at hand for the Avengers since the Hulk is removed from the equation.

° There is a specific battle that is made really well. The sounds in that battle were terrific. It was Very very Good.

° The 'Did you do it' scene really tugged at the heart strings. It was powerful.

° The Demonstration of Each of the Infinity Stones were Great 👍

° The Audience I was with actually felt the snap. I heard the gasps in the Audience.

° The Ending was Absolute Perfection

I don't think I will witness anything like This for quite some time. I think only when Galactus himself appears, I would get the same feeling or perhaps of an even greater Magnitude than I had with Infinity War.

"pgcarvajal","Rushed, Predictable, Overwhelming","14 May 2018","When the first Avengers film was released in 2012, there was much hype for it, much like Infinity War, but it actually lived up to it. Fast forward six years later, with Infinity War and many new members in the crew, and now fans are given a rushed action film with cheesy one liners. Upon going into the film, I checked the writing on IMDb and saw it was a 9.0/10. Seeing the rating really intrigued me, in which I was expecting so much only to be disappointed. 1. Thanos in no way intimidated me like he did when I read the comics. Josh Brolin could have done better at the role. I found him more intimidating in Labor Day, or the Goonies back when he was 17. 2. There was just too many stories for one movie. In order for it to work, this film would have needed to be nearly 5 hours long, like Gone With The Wind. 3. Why did that massive battle scene on earth with Cap and the rest of crew resemble Star Wars: The Phantom Menace? Literally all I could think of was Jar Jar Binks throwing blue balls at Thanos' army and calling it a day. 4. Out of all 80 of the main cast, I felt the only characters with the best chemistry were Rocket and Thor. 5. What was up with Bruce Banner having hard time turning to Hulk? Is that his way of having an Erectile Dysfunction? I mean Hulktile Dysfuntion... That whole bit was just weird. 6. Some of the characters, like Starlord, Drax, and The Vision were not the same characters they were in previous films. Starlord is smart, sarcastic, and cocky. In this film, he's dumb. Same with Drax, he was real insecure and always on edge. In this film he's just there. Lastly, The Vision. What happened to the wise man we saw in Age of Ultron? Yes, he had feelings, and I understand he had evolved, but has millions of traits and personalities. I don't understand how such a strong character became so weak. Overall, this film was pretty mediocre when it came to acting and the action scenes. We've seen them all before. Of course being a comic book/superhero fan for nearly 20 years, I will watch the next film, but most likely wait till it releases to redbox or other streaming services. I rate this film a 5/10 because 1. The all star cast. 2. Decent action and CGI that will most likely attract younger viewers. 3. Rocket and Thor's chemistry. 4. Scarlett Johansson. 5. It's Marvel. Other than that, if you haven't seen the film, just wait till it's released on DVD or Netflix. Not worth the trip.","10"
"jhonycakes","Very poorly handled","13 May 2018","If you love all the other mcu films, you will probably love this one. If you are an avid film enthusiast like myself, you will probably have similar complaints to what im going to say. For one, this film tries to focus on more things than what it is actually capable of pulling off. There are so many characters in the film that characters like black widow and black panther are reduced to seconds of screen time. Characters that are actually somewhat integral to the plot are so one dimensional they might as well get seconds of screen time. On top of that, characters that usually bring forth tons of charm regardless of the movie's quality (like thor or star lord) are completely unlikable in this movie. Actors like Robert Downey Jr completely phoned in their performances, and it made for a dull atmosphere even compared to other sub-par mcu films. The direction in this movie is TERRIBLE. It was so poorly handled. For example, Gamorrah's death scene was shot like a low budget sappy music video. The shots were so distracting I actually laughed at some attempted dramatic moments in the film. Overall this film is not good cinema. If you enjoy mindless entertainment with an underdeveloped villain and hipster captain America then this is the movie for you. If however, you want some form of artistic value in your films, I would skip this one and go watch the hiding place (its much less of a waste of your time).","10"

"ellimic","A good film and worthy of the MCU","29 April 2018","I saw Avengers Infinity War at the cinema and thought it was a brilliant film and a really good addition to the MCU collection.

I have been a fan of the MCU since it began with Iron Man in 2008, and after 19 films the only one I have disliked is Dr Strange. I liked the character of Dr Strange but the film itself just got weird with the buildings turing on thier head and everything spiralling around them.

Dr Stange is himself a good addition to the MCU, and putting him with the rest of the Avengers kept him more 'grounded' (for lack of a better word) than if he were alone or with other magical beings. One thing that I thought was strange is that he had an infinity stone yet never used it? During that fight with him, Iron Man, Spider-Man and the Guardians Vs Thanos, how much easier would it have been if he had simply frozen time? Ok he used it once to see all the possible futures, and claims there was only one in which they win. But he clearly saw something else that he kept to himself because he was quick to surrender the stone to save Stark.

I was dissapointed that one of my favourite originals - Hawkeye - was missing (and why hasn't he had his own film yet? He more than deserves it) there is a reason I'm sure but it's still dissapointing. And as a relative new-comer I had expected to see Ant-Man in the mix. And on this note what happened to Korg, Meek and Valkryie? They were on the Asguardian refugee ship with Thor, Loki, Hulk and Heimdall at the end of Thor Ragnarok so where did they go?

I thought how Iron Mans suit had evolved with Wakandan nano technology was a good touch as it showed how Wakanda was intergrading itself into the world, but I thought they went a little over the top with it: turning his arms into swords and hammers etc almost instantly seemed a bit too much (it was almost like watching the fight scene between Peter Quill and a Ego in Guardians of the Galaxy 2 when a giant rock Ego attacks a rock Pac Man) and the extra weapons that sprout from his back to hover at his sides just seems implausible. Both Black Panther and Spider-Man's suit were also using the same nano technology but couldn't do that, so why do it to Iron Man?

I liked Spider-Mans new suit, it looked really cool; they had hinted at this suit at the end of Spider-Man Homecoming and it was great to see it in action. I liked the spiders legs that sprout from his back, reminiscent of the spider suit Peter Parker has in some Spider-Man games I've played, but where was the A.I. KAREN of his previous suit? I hope this new suit doesn't mean she's gone (hopefully it's like JARVIS and FRIDAY, whereby she continues in whatever suit he wears)

I thought they went wrong with Thor. In Thor Ragnarok they let him explore his true powers after Mjolnir was destroyed by Hela, but suddenly they have back-peddled and gave him a new hammer/axe - Stormbreaker. I see why they wanted Thor to go to Nidavellir, to show that the same dwarfs that created Mjolnir also made Thanos' gauntlet, and therefore hint at its power, but I thought how they tied Thor down to another hammer/axe stifled him. I didn't really get how a small hammer/axe has the same power as the bifrost, where does it draw its power for a start?

All that aside it was good to see him using Stormbreaker it the big fight on Earth, and he did use his new-found powers to a degree, but I would have liked to see him build on the power he had unlocked at the end of Thor Ragnarok more, and they were quick to ditch the eyepatch.

Why was Black Widow suddenly blonde, what is the point of that? I did like the fight scenes with her and the Wakandan Captain Vs Thano's followers.

I thought having Paul Bettany looking like himself over Vision was a good touch, it had been shown in Captain America Civil War that he was starting to evolve and develop human traits, so showing him with a proper human form seemed right, but he was only like that for a short time, then for the rest of the film he remained in the robot form he'd always been which was a shame.

I thought how they retained the personality of the Hulk (which they established in Thor Ragnarok) was good, giving him the ability to control himself in not allowing Bruce Banner to bring him out, then allowing him to communicate with Bruce. By not having the Hulk and giving Bruce Banner the 'Hulk Buster MKII' suit was an excellent idea, it gave the team the power and strength of Hulk, a nod to Iron Man (who was absent from the fight as he was on Thanos' planet) and we got to see more of Bruce than in previous films where usually the Hulk would take over.

Sticking loosely to the Hulk, it was weird how suddenly Heimdall is able to summon the power of the bifrost to sent Hulk to Earth (but then how else would he have got back) but if he could do that why not also save Thor, Loki and himself at the same time? And how are we only seeing this in him now after 3 Thor films? I will say I was sad to see Heimdall executed.

I thought it was sad when Loki was killed by Thanos, but it did inspire Thor to fight back - and honestly we've seen Loki 'die' in nearly every film he's been in, so I wouldn't be surprised to find him alive somewhere down the line. Thanos did make a mocking comment about 'no more ressure ting' but I don't believe that.

It was good to finally see the Guardians of the Galaxy properly intergraded with the Avengers, although I was very sad to see Gamora 'die'. Spider-Mans references to films continued in this film, and how he and Peter Quill talked about movies I thought helped to cement the Gaurdians with the Avengers.

I liked the cameo by Red Skull, I didn't think he had just died at the end of Captain America The First Avenger, so it is good that we got closure by seeing his fate.

Nick Fury's scene at the end was really only there to give a link to the MCU's next big character - Captain Marvel. Having not read the comic-books I'm not fully familiar with all the characters, but from what I've read online Captain Marvel has superhuman strength, durability and speed, she can fly and is able to project and absorb energy. Not that I'm against Captain Marvel, but she is basically there to fulfil the roles of a creature that won't show his green face anyway (Hulk), two dead men (Quicksilver and Vision) and someone who has been 'destroyed' by the soul stone (Scarlett Witch) it seems she is only there to ensure a victory for the Avengers.

I say 'destroyed' with quotation marks against Scarlett Witch because, also from reading online, people 'destroyed' by the soul stone are presumably retained inside the stone, and can be resurrected from it should the bearer choose. So it's possible that everyone 'destroyed' by Thanos with the stone could be resurrected later; as too with Gamora who was sacrificed by Thanos in order to claim the soul stone - and her survival was hinted at further by her child self appearing to Thanos (presumably she appeared as her child self because that is how Thanos always remembered her)

And we all know that eventually that HAS to happen; they already announced that there will be another Spider-Man film, so he must return. There is likely to be another Guardians film so that's Peter Quill, Gamora, Mantis, Groot and Drax to come back (otherwise who's left? Rocket and Nebula) this would also apply to Black Panther and Dr Strange. Assuming the absent Hawkeye survived Thanos' universal mass-exodus, none of the original Avengers were destroyed. Very curious, I don't see yet how Iron Man can get back from Thanos' world as he was left there alone, but are we going to see an original team reunion?

This was a very good film, but the mass-exodus the end (that we already know wouldn't last) did lose the film a star in my opinion.","10"

"zeekwunlau","10 years of finale work","13 April 2020","This is a reversal of the previous two ""Avengers"", this time obviously did not complete a story, but left the suspense. The broken relationship between Captain America and Iron Man has not been eased by the coming of the Bully. Just because of frequent patronage, it seems to work hard to protect the earth together. From this point, it is not difficult to see that Marvel is still worried about the separation between the American elite society and the grassroots society. However, due to the second generation of Thor, the desolate god, it is not ugly to let the Avengers split. But on the whole, the Avengers in this work did not play as a whole, but divided into two teams to fight each other, which also led to the destruction of the bully.

Judging from the battles in this work, Thor, Iron Man, Doctor Strange, and even Black Panther still play a larger role. Here, we see the role of the Avengers ""elite"" alliance, and the role of the Avengers ""grassroots"" alliance is mainly in the sensational and clear soldiers.

Raytheon, as the second generation of the desolate god, has experienced the tragic situation of his girlfriend running away, the whole family dying, and his home destroyed. The son of Odin, who was once reckless and arrogant, after having no father and no weapons, after cleaning the lead, finally took on the name of Thor, and he was relentlessly looking for the opportunity for revenge, and he was almost Succeeded. Every hero may be carrying a tragic past. But by being unyielding and tenacious, he eventually became a hero. The image of Thor in this work is quite perfect, even surpassing the traditional Captain America. This also expresses the director's expectations of the ""elite"" with Thor in the background. Iron Man Tony actually wanted to be a dad, perhaps because of his love for Spider-Man. Let him realize that he is no longer, that young master who can do whatever he wants. The life of the rich second generation born with the golden key has also experienced inhuman suffering. Under the bright appearance, it is still full of danger and fear. He is thinking about all the time, what a powerful alien army will bring to the earth. It is this sense of responsibility and care for his juniors that made him have no hesitation in the face of the onslaught. It is also the closest time they have collided with the Guardians of the Galaxy, Doctor Strange, and Spider-Man. Unfortunately, the restless Star Lord broke everything. This is not to blame the recklessness of Xingjue, after all, he is not yet a good commander, or just a restless big boy.

On the other hand, Captain America, a ""traditional hero"", can be said to be pitiful in this film. It has not shown its previous command role, and has also published too many exciting words. Perhaps Marvel wanted to weaken the American team's role in order to attract more young audiences, or it may be to pave the way for subsequent heroes. On the whole, this hero who has been in a position to ""treat the crime"" has not been vindicated, and the mainstream will inevitably not promote a ""criminal"" too much. The role player Chris Evans may also give up playing the role in the future, all of which have led to the marginalization of the role of Captain America in the film. To say that the most outstanding in this work, there is no doubt that the villain tyrants. This wise man pursuing the so-called ""balance"" seems interested in the slaughter. Of course, every villain must have a set of philosophical theories. This time it is the so-called master control of the collapse of the world and the response to the exhaustion of resources. Marvel's classic villains always like to use these ""strongman tyrants"". They are ruthless, crazy, and overbearing. This tyrant is no exception. Not only did the Hulk Hulk stay down, but he also adopted his daughter Kamora as the material for the sacrifice. Destroyer relies on his hard-working style, without alliances and without any effective assistants, he has gathered 6 gems and opened his fingers. Still under the layers of siege of the Avengers, escaped dashingly. Facing the ideal sunset, he showed a fatherly smile. The Avengers met the strongest opponent. It seems so impeccable, especially after winning the wish, it should be matched with the song ""How Lonely is the Invincible"" to reflect his status as the boss of the rivers and lakes.

But when we look back, he is indeed lonely. No one understands his so-called mission and responsibility, and no one supports it. In particular, his carefully cultivated daughter ""Kamora"" became the person who hated him the most. I do n't know if I should call him an ""idealist"" or an ambitious person. After deciding to give up his daughter 's life, this figure with contradictions in his heart will inevitably go further and further on the path of the husband. And if a person has the right to destroy with a single finger, the general life of the universe. How should he manage himself? The bully used people's emotions to get pieces of gems. From the beginning, Rocky, who wanted to protect his brother, to Kamora, who wanted to protect his sister, and Dr. Strange, who wanted to protect Iron Man, and the Scarlet Witch, who wanted to protect Vision. Any one of them, the heart of the heart, the dream of tyrants to collect gems, may be broken. But anyone can make mistakes, and the protection of family and friends cannot be regarded as complete mistakes. It's just that ordinary people will not be shameless and use their emotions to make transactions. Perhaps when you use emotions to make transactions, you are not far away from the achievements of bullying.

The movie stopped abruptly after the destruction of half of the entire universe. Leaving us a bit of a question, such as whether Iron Man and Captain America will join forces? For example, can those people who disappeared eventually be resurrected? Another example is why Dr. Strange would surrender to the Iron Man, and surrender the gem of time? Can even Dr. Benny become the Hulk? All these questions, like the last egg, are full of reverie. But in the face of such a huge market, Marvel is bound to earn more eyeballs and money. This work can be said to have jumped out more successfully. Before that, there were concerns about ""superhero"" fatigue. I believe that before the end of this tyrant series story, fans will still have a very high enthusiasm for the Marvel series, so let us wait and see.

In the end, ""Avengers 3"" as the finale of Marvel's 10 years, fully reflects the unparalleled advantages of the American film industry. These American-style ""superheroes"" help the United States promote their ""American-style culture"" around the world. But thinking about it in depth, what is the difference between this so-called spread and the tyrant? After all, a diverse world is a beautiful world. Any civilization and culture has its own opportunity to choose its own existence. But the aggression displayed by American culture makes people shudder. Therefore, if China wants to maintain its own autonomy, it must produce its own superhero to fight against the possible invasions. Of course, this first step may still be a reference.","4"

One of the things that annoyed me right off from the beginning was Hulk fighting Thanks. He takes a few combo punches and the just goes down. He doesn't get angrier and stronger, but just sort of slumps over. If they explained that part better it might have made some sense to me.

"kermitkid","Breaks the ""Spider-Man 3"" and ""Dawn of Justice"" curse","30 March 2020","I was a bit worried about this film. Yes, Marvel is nearly perfect, but I was also worried that we would have another ""Spider-Man 3"" or ""Batman v. Superman: Dawn of Justice"" situation where it's too overstuffed with characters that it becomes hard to follow. This is not the case. It does jump around from place to place frequently, and I wish the plot had flowed better, but I was still able to follow what was going on. This has possibly the best villain in all of the MCU! Thanos is the Darth Vader of this franchise! He's the villain you love to hate and are genuinely afraid of. The actors bounce off of each other very well and the dialogue is as fast-paced and witty as we've come to expect from Marvel. While at times, it does feel like watching a bunch of video game cutscenes edited together, the movie is so enthralling that my first reaction to the credits (other than pure surprise for reasons I don't dare spoil) was ""It's over already?! It just started 20 minutes ago? What? It started almost 3 hours ago?! How is that possible?"" That's how much this film pulled me in! It's well worth the 10 year wait! It's amazing to see all these characters interact with each other! There are some really amazing shots and moments, which again, I won't spoil. There's a reason Marvel was unusually secretive with this film. Other than the story not flowing as well as it should have, there isn't anything to complain about with this film.

"muvbuff-45737","Speechless...","5 May 2018","This film could have failed in many ways, especially if the writers dulled the stakes, but that is the opposite of what they did. This film is tense, dark, hopeless, yet humorous. The film takes risks that will no doubt leave audiences shocked and by doing this alone has made it a revolutionary comic book movie. The characters, the action, the acting, and the setpieces are all done marvelously, and the villain, Thanos, is one of the most intense and frightening villains in Marvel film history and possibly in Cinema as a whole. Whenever he is onscreen you feel as though all hope is lost and that our heroes are in great peril, making this a thrill ride of a film that must be seen.

I am not a BIG fan of this Franchise ,but the last installment, which I saw, Avengers- ""The Civil War"" , which had different script as compare to the other heroic movies. The Idea of fight - against each other , was not new , as we saw in Batman Vs Superman prior to Civil War, but in that movie something was missing and which results the less interest of the viewers. This movie, is a very gigantic movie because of the characters and their super powers, so there's no question that kids won't like it ! They do, off course. Movie, has very different kind of emotional scenes, I can hope, they were emotional enough to make the fans cry ( Avengers' fans again). So apart from the mesmerizing script , the thing which was a bit more amusing was you don't expect , comedy from HULK, c'mon, keep the comedy for the kid - spider man , not for a guy like HULK. But from the Director has a different point of view- might be an experiment , which results in a successful attempt. So in short , it's a movie specifically for the fans of AVENGERS Franchise, not for every one. Fans & kids will love this one, as they see converting their print media into visual media. it's 5 on 10.","10"

"Vivekmaru45","I still prefer the original 2012 Avengers movie.","2 September 2018","This is the full live-action film debut of Thanos(voice-acted by Josh Brolin of No Country For Old Men fame). The film's plot seems heavily inspired from the works of J. R. R. Tolkien. Namely: The Lord Of The Rings.

Plot: Iron Man, Thor, the Hulk and the rest of the Avengers unite to battle their most powerful enemy yet -- the evil Thanos. On a mission to collect all six Infinity Stones, Thanos plans to use the artifacts to inflict his twisted will on reality. The fate of the planet and existence itself has never been more uncertain as everything the Avengers have fought for has led up to this moment..

This movie like all the other movies before it relies heavily on modern C.G.I. graphics. These days Hollywood movies use C.G.I.(Computer Generated Imagery) like a crippled man uses his crutches. And also beefed up sound-effects...

All the actors play their roles as programmed R.P.G. characters play out in a video game. There is a lack of casting and acting talent these days in Hollywood. Indeed this era is the most uninspiring compared to the legendary 80's era, where some of the greatest movie to ever grace the silver screen were made.

Verdict: I would recommend this film as a time-pass sort of movie where you have nothing to do but kill time(figuratively speaking).","9"
"aminifatimaaa","hillarious, intense & heartbreaking","18 May 2019","Avengers: Infinity War is an epic, bold, & brutal blockbuster whose apocalyptic sensibilities never outweigh the film's colorful and personality-rich soul. The plot sews together a decade of story threads, characters, & tones allowing Marvel's cadre of superheroes to square off against a killer of world's. Directing with an eye on the individual personalities of the film's characters and the weight of the plot's machinations, Joe and Anthony Russo create a balanced and invigorating piece of work. Action sequences are imbued with emotional heft, and characters spar with the unique tone and color developed in previous films. Every resource onscreen is committed to bringing something larger than life to bear. Whether it is the cast offering individual and stand-out portraits of supercharacters; or the filmmakers involved in shooting, editing, scoring, and designing the visual and sonic world of the film; every element ticks with cinematic gloriousness and grand scale. Avengers: Infinity War is spectacular yet beats with a compelling humanity. It may be a comic book tale, but it connects to some place deep within the hearts and minds of its audience with a snap of its fingers.","8"

"kaden_lewis","Avengers: Infinity War","25 June 2021","This was one of the best Marvel movies ever made. It is a truly amazing experience watching this movie. There were so many things this movie did well, but I will only talk about a few. The first thing I liked was how we got to see The Guardians of the Galaxy with some of the Avengers. We got to see Thor with the whole team. Later on, we saw Thor with just Rocket and Groot, then those three eventually United with the rest of the Avengers in Wakanda. We also got to see a comedic fight between Quill, Drax, Mantis, Iron Man, Spider-Man, and Doctor Strange. After some confusion, they realized they were on the same team and fought together against Thanos. I also liked the plot and story of this movie. I really liked how it was all about Thanos' quest to find the Infinity Stones, and all the different places he had to go. I liked how the story was written to have all the heroes we have been introduced to (except Scott and Clint due to their house arrest) in the movie, it was beautifully written. The writing did however cause for the Avengers to be split up the entire movie. I actually liked that because it had the Civil War feel to it with the two separate final battles. The Avengers are also still technically split up, so I though it worked out.

Like I said, this was an amazing movie, and an even better experience to watch it. This was definitely one of the best Marvel movies. I don't even need to recommend watching this movie, if you are a Marvel fan, you have watched it.","8"

"amichnea","Amazeballs","5 August 2018","Going to keep this short. Probably the best action movie of the year, if not ever. Has all of the Marvel Superheroes mashed up just like the comics do when massive scale events happen. This last statement takes me to all the negative reviews. Why oh why?? You guys do realise it is Part 1 of 2 right??

Before you give it a 1 star because, oh well you have no idea about the actual MU and MCU. I suggest you at least google ""Infinity Gauntlet"" which is the original story of Thanos, also the actual Infinity War from the comics.

I am not providing any spoilers here since what I have mentioned can be seen in the trailers and synopsis, what I did mention was based on Marvel Universe knowledge. No idea which route the directors will take but please bear with the 2nd part before you tell people not to ""waste"" their time, that this is the last marvel movie or by giving it a score under 5 stars.

Here are the main reason why this movie doesn't deserve the under 7 reviews it got:

1) It is a 2 part movie so bear with it until you actually watch the second part? 2.a) Huge, massive scale event in the Marvel Universe. Due to Thano's goal every being in the known/unknown Universe WILL come to take him down. Frankly the movie didn't have every Superhero Character in existence, for example the X-Men and Fantastic 4. 2.b) The supreme beings of the Marvel Universe; an all-star lineup including Galactus, Kronos, Epoch, the Living Tribunal, and a bunch of others like the personifications of concepts like Chaos and Order come after him. 3) Many many people and superheroes would have not realised what Thanos did until after he snapped his fingers. So don't go crying that it is the end of the world. 4) Guardians of the Galaxy Vol.2 - End Credits - Hint hint Adam Warlock. Even though he may not make an appearance in the 2nd part. 5) One of the most powerful superheroes in existence and not quite as known should make an appearance in the 2nd part to help out. End credits, Carol Danvers. 6) Following point 3 (for all the whiners), anyone can put the gauntlet on and snap their fingers one more time... and... wait for it, wait for it... undo what has been done.

"rupert-ian","As close to a 10 as I've seen","27 April 2018","I knew from past Marvel movies and the trailers that this would be a good movie, but it exceeded my expectations in every way.

One big problem with the excellent MCU is their weak villains and the lack of consequences for the good guys.

This movie brought us excellent and very strong villains, as well as plenty of consequences for the good guys.

There was lots of well-placed humor. Unlike the new Star Wars movies which can't place a good joke to save their lives, the MCU really gets that aspect of these movies.

I was wondering how they could make this movie without considerable violence...not our usual fights, but true violence. They didn't pull any punches. This movie is the most violent of the MCU by far. They didn't sugar coat this movie for the kiddies.

Thanos is amazing. Not just a mindless bad guy, but someone with a fleshed out character and clear motivation. Whether you agree with his reasoning or not, you can still relate to him because our own history has seen similar ideas from the Communists and Nazis. ""Genocide for the greater good"" as monsters from our past have declared it.

If you are a fan of the MCU, this movie has everything you love from the previous films and everything you have wanted but haven't seen.

I give this a 10/10 after two viewings (now five two weeks later). I find very few flaws.

Edit: A couple weeks later and I have to laugh at all the recent 1/10 reviews. The DC fangirls are waging a unified rating war from their Mom's basement in an attempt to drag the rating down to that of movies like Justice League. All the while, Infinity War races to 2 BILLION dollars and is already #5 top grossing of all time. Keep hoping for a good movie, DC fans. Nothing will touch this, though. Over half of the people who have seen this rate it 10/10 while 1/10 is less than 2%.","2"
"krational66","This is what a group play should be.","12 April 2020","It is recommended that you drink less water, because this is almost a zero point movie, nearly two and a half hours from beginning to end. A few places do not play, or the place that the rhythm is more gentle has before and after looking after, is not idle pen.

Although there are a lot of violent scenes, there are also plenty of funny points, and all kinds of jokes are everywhere, forming a buffer between the endless fierce battles. (although I'm not happy with the Internet slang used in the subtitles) and iron man is as mean and fart as ever, the captain of the solemn veteran + commissioner, brother hammer that pose is show MOE, there is a reference to the original black widow sister and hawkeye relationship, and finally see a brain of Dr. Banner. As an adaptation, there are many things to please comic fans, including classic lines.

Original characters like agent colson are also great (my favorite in the whole series). His final performance may feel a little bit overrated, but for him, it's actually dark in his belly, so deep in his consciousness that all he can think about is how to make the most of the situation.

Although it draws a lot of elements from the ultimate universe, including the characters' costumes and the names of alien RACES, the movie is not the world view of the ultimate universe. It seems to be a mix of the main world and the ultimate world. Loki says that he has an army, and that the aliens are really tough hybrid soldiers without any of the machismo of the original, but the post-credits Easter egg reveals that the really tough guys are still out there.

As a group of heroes, the film is thoughtful: each character has enough to show for their character and ability, and the interaction between them is interesting. Avengers protagonist, is a team. The growth of the protagonist, here is the team of the run-in. See them from each other pk (this pk has a tribute to the original reason), to two cooperation, and then to the overall cooperation, the context and rhythm are very clear.

Unlike the x-men, which are dominated by young students, the avengers are established heroes. So the movie borrows entirely from the comic book model of the year -- starting with the individual story of each member and then the origins of the team.

Marvel had previously used five feature films plus two shorts as a starting point. Therefore, it does not need to explain the history and background of each person in detail in the film, but only carries out the ""simplest"" explanation, showing the core characteristics of each character. (the better part is showing another aspect of the hulk, Bruce banner as a famous scientist, which the hulk lacks.) This spare time is all focused on the core events, so the film can climax, burning the sky.

This is a good example of how to make a team of heroes, but can this model be copied? Who could have done ten hours of foreplay for a movie that always had an orgasm? (I saw this film, dc pressure is very big, I hope one or two films against the sky, after all, it is not as good as M's solid accumulation of six years)","1"
"Semisonic","Sentimentality for sale","6 August 2018","Let's admit it, people love watching sacrifices made out of love. We just can't get enough of that mushy pathos of the most pointless, irrational and simply plain wrong things being done just because it would lessen the suffering of a single human being (or maybe even a puppy), albeit just for a moment.

This is humanity. And, judging by the rating, it is madly in love with Avengers Infinity War. Well, no surprise, since, for the first time in a while, Marvel Studios made a film that dwarfs most of the melodramas ever created in terms of making the soft-hearted people shed a tear or two. The war is waging across the whole galaxy over the topic of sheer survival of myriads of living beings, and our brave heroes, so eager to care none about the collateral damage before, have suddenly become too soft to handle the fact that someone might not make it eventually.

And what a time to grow a conscience! Thanos is about, the looming figure from the past Marvel movies, the phantom menace of this cinematic universe, and he's come to strike it big this time. And with him, a huge army of creatures equally ugly and disposable and a few special units he calls his children, finally with a speck of individuality, but still ugly as the rest. Makes you start wondering if those Titan genes are really the best judge of the galaxy's fate.

As for ""the good guys"", they are quite aplenty too. Maybe even too aplenty to actually have any decent interaction among each other, unless we count some quarrels and a few flashy co-op FPS action scenes interaction. Tom Holland does try to bring his old lively ""friendly neighborhood Spider-Man"" attitude, but he's severely outnumbered in this game of big talk and personal issues. Even Steve Rogers, the only guy who was previously known for bringing charisma and integrity into everything he's involved in, is demoted to a mere fighting machine. He's good at that, no doubt about it, but after Winter Soldier and Civil War you expect much, much more from that character. But this time your expectations are your own problem I'm afraid.

The rest you have probably seen yourself - and if you haven't then you probably should, because, even with its somewhat generic and one-dimensional taste, Infinity War is still quite good as an action flick. The moving figures won't let you doze off too soon, and a few ""deep"" dialogue scenes will keep your palate from getting too numb if you have a taste for anything besides punches and gunshots.

Still, after all we've seen from Marvel in these ten years, Infinity War leaves a rather dull aftertaste. Not as pathetic as Iron Man 3, but something between GotG2 and Thor Dark World. In other words, the intense buildup and high expectations make the actual endeavor feel faded. Like all those figures from the ending, this movie doesn't present any substantial endpoint - but rather flakes away, so that instead of feeling absolutely overwhelmed you simply go check on your Instagram updates while the (surprisingly rather impressive) ending credits score keeps banging, find no new posts and feel somewhat disappointed.

The film wasn't bad per se. But most of the fan theories and memes people generated while waiting for this to hit the theaters were indeed more exciting. In a way, that does create a balance of sorts, something Thanos would have appreciated, but, as for you, I wouldn't be so sure.","6"

Whether you are a Marvel enthusiast or not, this film does not hold a candle to masterpieces like The Dark Knight, La La Land, Pulp Fiction, or Inception, despite either surpassing them or coming close in terms of its IMDb rating. While the movie's hype was off the charts, and it was thrilling to see our beloved Marvel characters united on the big screen (such as The Guardians of the Galaxy, Thor, Spider-Man, Captain America, Black Panther, etc.), we should not overlook the fact that Avengers: Infinity War is an excessively long film that relies on poorly executed, unrealistic character deaths to generate excitement, and it lacks strong writing and editing.

The directors and writers did a commendable job interweaving so many narratives, but the film feels drawn-out with scene after scene of fights. Although the performances are solid, and the script has its moments of humor, the movie is not original, and its only saving grace is the characters we all adore. It's amusing to watch Thor poke fun at The Guardians of the Galaxy, and it's fun to see Iron Man and Spider-Man interact with Doctor Strange, but objectively speaking, this is merely a run-of-the-mill superhero movie (albeit with more superheroes than usual) that relies on shock tactics to create excitement and emotion. Regardless of how much we love the Marvel universe, we all know that none of the characters who ""died"" are going to remain dead, especially considering there are publicly announced sequels for each franchise. The filmmakers expect us to believe that Black Panther (who generated over a billion dollars for Marvel), Spider-Man, and The Guardians of the Galaxy have all reached the end of their respective stories, even though we know that is not the case. In the end, all the character deaths are simply present for the sake of creating shock value, which is an overused and cheap trick.

From a technical standpoint, the fight scenes are well-directed, but that is the only aspect that stands out. The editing is subpar, and the movie feels too drawn-out, clocking in at 2 hours and 40 minutes. I believe that much of the time spent traveling from planet to planet could have been cut down, and the film would have been just as good, if not better.

Overall, Avengers: Infinity War has the potential to be a remarkable film, but it falls short due to its excessive length and reliance on cheap death scenes to generate hype. I believe that Captain America: Civil War is a far superior movie, and I would give Avengers: Infinity War a 6.5 out of 10.","4"
"christianakara","And then Thanos leaves his chair...","27 April 2018","Oh boy what can I say about this movie...well facts that I loved: 1. Thanos..yes he is the villain I did not know I wanted to see..for a long time I was reluctant of how Marvel studios would introduce this guy..I mean until infinity wars Thanos didn't look as very promising villain more like the purple muscle-dude on the chair.. but the deepness of his character, his personality I didn't see that coming..The mad Titan was worth the waiting..his philosophy, his relationship with his daughter and the snap of his fingers..GOD where do you go after all these? 2.So many encounters..I mean if you are a nerd as am I you never really get enough of these.. seeing all these super heroes team up was giving me a nerdorgasm after another.. 3.Closure..Many of our favorite superheroes faced some of their deepest emotions (and then most of them died)..If you were curious to find out how Lokie feels about his brother?How Gamora feels about Thanos?or Quill?This is your type of movie.. 4. The long game..Now this is a huge spoiler but the key character for all that happens in the movie is by far Dr Strange.. Just pay attention to the dude..this might save you some tears...no need to say more..just watch the movie 5. The Hulk-Banner relationship.. This might sound silly but I feel that there is some deeper explanation to Hulk's behavior that really intrigues me to find out. If that is not the case it still is hilarious as hell..

Overall, this was the best Marvel movie!!","6"
"WubsTheFadger","Avengers: Infinity War","27 April 2018","Short and Simple Review by WubsTheFadger

After 10 years of character and plot building, we finally get what we have been waiting for. Infinity War is a film of epic proportion that makes first Avengers film look like a small feat. Infinity War has a complex story filled with exquisite fight sequences, humor, and amazing characters. The biggest hurdle for this film was fitting in a lot of characters in only two and a half hours. Anthony and Joe Russo successfully give all the characters a fair amount of screen time and introduces use to the amazingly effective Thanos. The story is filled with emotional moments and has some power when it comes to the reality of Thanos' power.

The acting is very good. Robert Downey Jr., Chris Hemsworth, Mark Ruffalo, Chris Evans, Scarlett Johansson, Don Cheadle, Benedict Cumberbatch, Tom Holland, Zoe Saldana, Chadwick Boseman, Karen Gillan, Tom Hiddleston, Paul Bettany, Elizabeth Olsen, Anthony Mackie, Sebastian Stan, Chris Pratt, and many others perform very well. Josh Brolin performs the best in my eyes. He plays Thanos who is extremely complex and is the second-best superhero villain I have ever witnessed behind The Joker. Thanos truly is the best part of the film in my eyes.

The pacing is perfect. Infinity War throws us into the action immediately and doesn't let up. The runtime is also perfect.

There are a couple of things I didn't like in the film. Peter Dinklage's character looked rather foolish. His accent and the way his character looked made him seem fake. I also didn't like the Wakanda scenes. Their accents are extremely annoying, in my eyes, and some the characters in Wakanda are kinda cringy.

All in all, Avengers: Infinity War is a masterclass superhero film. It is the second-best superhero film ever made right behind Christopher Nolan's The Dark Knight. I truly loved it and I am really excited for part two.

Pros: Intense, emotional, and heartbreaking story, good humor, amazing characters, very good acting, Josh Brolin as Thanos, Thanos being one of the greatest movie villains ever, great pacing, a good runtime, and how Thanos is a really effective villain throughout the entire film

Cons: Peter Dinklage's character is and looks bad and most of the Wakanda scenes and characters are kinda cringy

Overall Rating: 9.5

P.S. I would recommend watching all the MCU's movies before watching this film. If you don't want to watch them all just watch these: Iron Man, Thor, Captain America: The First Avenger, The Avengers, Captain America: The Winter Soldier, Thor: The Dark World, Guardians of the Galaxy, Avengers: Age of Ultron, Captain America: Civil War, Doctor Strange, and Thor: Ragnarok. This list leaves out seven Marvel films that should be watched but could be skipped. Enjoy!","10"
"subxerogravity","Changes the definition of Epic","28 April 2018","It's possibly the most ambitious movie I've ever seen.

Celebrating 10 years of the Marvel cinematic universe, Infinity war has everyone in it. all the Avengers all the Guardians of the Galaxy, spider-man, Doctor Strange. It is overstuffed with comic book characters, but I did not find it overwhelming. I was more exciting to see all these characters do a team up. I will say that some characters got more screen time than others. some characters you think would dominate the movie did not and some characters you never thought were that important show you that's not the case.

Josh Brolin as Thanos was an exceptional villain. the best these movies have to offer. As the Avengers and their allies attempt to stop Thanos from killing the universe, the character goes on this strange Lord of the Rings-like journey to find the infinity Stones, turning this Superhero movie into a Fantasy film.

Too slow at times as we get to know all the Avengers over again, and we also had to follow three different stories that sometimes drag, but everything is made up for with Thanos, who put this movie on a new level of drama.","10"
"TheFirstExecutioner","I'm Left Speechless (in the Good Way)","28 April 2018","Avengers: Infinity War might just be the most insane movie I've ever seen. I'm literally left speechless coming out of this movie. The Russo Brothers have once again made a great Marvel film, this time on the biggest scale in MCU history. Basically every Avenger you've seen on screen is in this movie and it's pretty awesome.

There's a lot to love here. First, it was such a joy to see all the Avengers on screen together again. The comradery between all of them is great and the interaction between characters who meet for the first time is both hilarious and powerful. Second, Thanos is officially the best villain in the MCU. Killmonger was great but Thanos takes it to a while another level. This is by far the darkest Marvel movie and Thanos is the driving force behind it. Josh Brolin gives an amazing performance as Thanos, who is much more layered than I thought. Thanos made the stakes feel real, which is often a knock on the MCU, and he made the heroes feel a sense of real desperation that honestly seemed to lack in the other Avengers movies. The movie took great risks story-wise that will leave everyone thinking hard for a long, long time. What makes Infinity War stand out is the bold new directions it goes in, and it completely pays off. The way the movie wraps up will undoubtedly cause so much craze. I'm still flustered by what I saw. Even though the movie is so dark, the humor is great (again). As always, the action scenes and music are amazing.

However, no movie is perfect. There are so many characters in Infinity War and it easily succumbs to this throughout. The Russo's handled it as well as they could have I think, but the pacing and tone are really uneven at times, especially in the first hour. The movie jumps to so many different places and tones, and it felt way too fast. Also, some of the character decisions did not make sense and left me confused.

Overall, Avengers: Infinity War is another great addition to the Marvel Cinematic Universe. The villain Thanos is the best and his impact on the heroes is ridiculously amazing. I really have no idea where Marvel goes from here going forward in all honesty, and that's a testament to how bold this movie is in its endeavors.

"TheMovieDiorama","Avengers: Infinity War is a decade culmination of strategic cinematic building with triumphant results.","26 April 2018","10 years since 'Iron Man' commenced the cinematic universe. 10 years. Just let that sink in. Now, the superhero soap opera draws closer to its conclusion and the stakes are higher than ever. The Avengers, Guardians and a myriad of supporting heroes encounter the wrath of the villainous Thanos. They must unite and prevent him from harnessing all six infinity stones, because if he does...we all know what will happen. Total universal annihilation! With each chapter, the MCU becomes more and more predicable as the narrative follows the exact same three act structure. Whilst there is a tiny sense of predictability here, the sheer boldness of the Russo brothers' execution has made for an excitingly tense blockbuster that I'm sure will leave many in awe with what they just witnessed. The colossal enormity of this chapter, the raging pressure for the directors, the astronomical expectation from the fans, all immeasurable factors that somehow have been measured and implemented to create heroic entertainment. The intricate balance of all the superheroes felt like an impossible task, however each member received enough screen time to validate their presence within the story. All the actors performed with sincerity, particularly during the more emotional moments. Finally we are presented with a multi-dimensional antagonist who's motives, may unquestionably be evil, are nonetheless relatable. You see his perspective. The inclusion of Thanos' backstory and the focus on the ferocious power of the Infinity Gauntlet cements him as the strongest adversary within the MCU. Impressive visual effects and memorable action set pieces ensures the thrills are consistently imaginative throughout. It's certainly a behemoth, where the narrative's pacing is slightly inconsistent during the first half and the humour misses more than it hits, but with such confident direction they have made an impossible chapter possible. Geeks, fans and film lovers, rejoice! However that ending though, left me speechless...","9"

"brent_or","Exceeds Expectations","28 April 2018","It's a blast when a film not only meets expectations, but exceeds them. This uses the whole toolkit that the Marvel films have accumulated over the years, and finds exactly the right mix of familiar and new, humor and drama. It's like a runaway freight train but it knows that and does nothing to take away from the rush of being on board. Great stuff.

As far as specifics, the new combinations of characters are a joy, it's confident and intrepid visually and the rationale of why the villain is doing what he does comes across better than one would expect. There are a couple of scenes that seem contrived to push a lever for the story, but in such a grand scheme, hardly worth mentioning. This is far better than Age of Ultron, a real return to form for the Avengers.","10"
"nightwing90","A Sure Shot Take from the Marvel Studio","25 April 2018","A movie that lived up above the hype, that's what I felt like after seeing this movie. I am huge fan of Russo brothers after seeing their epic Winter Soldier movie but felt disappointed with their take on Civil War (Strictly personal). So, in order to avoid the hype, I decided not to watch any tv spots that released, and that method worked btw.

The movie started exactly where Thor: Ragnarok finished. As usual the movie followed the same pattern that every marvel movies does. Its loaded with a lot of fun during the battles but everything is well balanced. Each character got their own screen time. If anyone ask which character scored above all it is so hard to tell. I felt like Russo brothers managed to give the importance that each character deserves. The movie is packed with a lot of Goosebumps scenes which is enough to burst out the cinema hall.

I'm not getting into the story as there is no point in explaining considering the hype but everything that a marvel fan needs is included in this movie. It took more than 10 years to see Thanos properly, but I would like to say that he just went a long way beyond my expectation. Visually the movie is top notch as we can easily identify that the studio invested a lot of money which resulted into eye popping action.

Overall in my opinion THE BEST MARVEL MOVIE ever made by the studio (Previously it was Winter Soldier). The movie got only 1 post credit scene which was scheduled at the end credits.","10"

I love the Marvel characters (intelligent, quick and witty) and how the movies seamlessly weave the characters/stories together to come to this huge climatic ""war"", with a cliffhanger ending that makes us eager for more.

"Mklangelo","The same old, same old","28 July 2018","I will begin this review by stating that I am highly biased against all Superhero films. As in (almost) all the others that have ever been produced, Avengers: Infinity War falls in with the vast majority as a collection of over-worked cliches that are the backbone of this ""genre"".

I will admit that the banter of Tony Stark is clever. It always has been. I love Mr. Downey's ability to talk that talk. He is master of the fast, catch you on your heels style of verbal attack. For Tony Stark, it's a mixture of self defense and bringing you to the realization that you are actually dealing with a world class genius. A fun character. (Mr. Downey even sang on stage with Sting. Do a youtube search. You'll probably like it. I know I did). They toned the Stark character down simply because every one and their Superhero brother, aunt and sister made an appearence in this cliche. On to my other gripe. We have the trope of the Superhero landing. You know, one foot, one knee and a hand on the ground with the other hand and the head in some stylized pose. I permanently turned off the Wonder Woman movie, featuring eye candy Gal Godot, the minute I saw it.

I puke each time I see this trope and thankfully, I didn't see it in Infinity War so my thanks goes out to the cast and director but my trusty barf bag was at the ready. Mark Twain is reported to have said, ""History doesn't repeat itself but it often rhymes."" Right once again, Mr. Clemens!

I won't talk about the specifics of the film since truly, if you've seen one, you really have seen them all. I will confess and say that Deadpool 1 and 2 are the only two movies of this type that I actually enjoyed. We have actual human motivation and genuine, character driven drama and not just bombastic CG driven tripe. Plus the 4th wall is broken from time to time with irreverence. In other words, the DeadPool movies don't take themselves too seriously. That appeals to me.

As for the social aspect of why hungry audiences gobble up this tripe as quickly as Hollywood can churn it out is anybody's guess and here's mine. You live vicariously for the escape for 2 plus hours as you long to forget yourself and your society of hollow, mindless consumerism and its vapid celebrity worship. But I'll go no further with that since ameteur anthropology is best administered in very small doses.","9"

"ZySask","For the Marvel fans","27 December 2018","If you are a Marvel fan then you've probably already watched this movie and really enjoyed it. I thought that there was more of a story than a lot of the other Marvel movies and the special effects were very well done. But... I am not really into the whole lore of the Marvel universe and for me it was a bit of a so-so movie. Eye candy and fight scenes really only hold me for so long when watching a movie.","10"
"PedroPires90","Well, it's dark...","16 September 2021","If I had to choose a movie where I don't connect AT ALL with something almost unanimous for the audience and public, it would have to be this one.

There was no shortage of opportunities. This is the 3rd time I've watched it - because I want to see Guardians 3 with all the chronology on my head - and...I fell asleep all 3 times, always in the 2nd act. People always think that this is one of the MCU movies that I should really like when in fact I prefer to watch movies like Captain Marvel, fully aware of what they are.

The truth is that narratively, this is a huge mess. The first two acts are bad. In the first two-thirds of the movie, it jumps from place to place without any coherence, without any development, with ugly and dark settings, and without being able to involve me at all. One of the characters that I love the most in the MCU died and I felt nothing. A character that had made me feel a lot in two Guardians of the Galaxy movies. Another essential character of the MCU - the main? - that everyone loves died and...I felt nothing again. As for the others who died, I never cared about them, so whatever.

But I think that's really one of the reasons why this movie is so beloved. Because there are several surprising deaths because it was seen in theatres by large audiences (and probably kids/teens cried a lot), because it has several ""wow moments"" (even if they are poorly developed), and because it's a story that many people invested a lot of their time in. As a movie, it's not good. No. The childish humour is always present in the first two hours in a ridiculous way for what is happening on screen and without any funny jokes - except for the scene where Quill meets Thor - and it made me roll my eyes 30 times. Every time. It made me completely withdraw emotionally from the movie.

But well, it's dark, it's full of action (almost only action, to be fair), it has surprising deaths, and a dramatic ending. I'm absolutely sure that's why it's loved. Nothing to do with its qualities as good cinema.","5"

"cherold","terrific movie except for the ""ending""","24 August 2018","Infinity War does a truly amazing job of stuffing as many superheroes into a single movie as possible and keeping track of most of them. Sure, some get lost in the shuffle, little more than cameos, but a remarkable number are given emotional depth, which makes it light years ahead of the overrated first Avengers movie, in which the characters were little more than cardboard cutouts designed to support the action.

The movie is witty, likable, and engaging, establishing huge odds and placing it's full bet on crazy, leave-no-man-behind heroism. It goes on a little long, and towards the end the action becomes a little bombastic, but overall it's tremendous fun.

The movie also, like The Empire Strikes back, ends in the middle. I really hate that. I also feel it telegraphs the next movie. I mean, you really can't engage in such wholesale slaughter without the assumption that in spite of all odds something will be done, and this blunts the emotional impact of the whole thing.

Is the resolution to this movie really so elaborate that it requires it's own movie? Couldn't the bloat and some of the nonsensical plot extenders (like a blindingly stupid and unlikely moment from Starlord) have been removed to make a single zippy film? Probably, but that's not what happened. Alas.","2"

"FlashCallahan","We kick names, and take a**.........","27 April 2018","The Avengers unite to battle their most powerful enemy, Thanos.

On a mission to collect all six Infinity Stones, Thanos plans to use the artifacts to inflict his twisted will on reality.

The fate of the planet and existence itself has never been more uncertain as everything the Avengers have fought for has led up to this moment....

After ten years of big budget, even bigger box office movies, here's lies the first key to the conclusion of all three phases, and was it worth the wait? Yes, and then some.

This is the movie that holds the key to ten years of dedication and respect to some of the most beloved comic book characters ever created, and even though it boasts an absolute plethora of characters, they are all included, even though Stark, Rogers, and Thor predictably get the lions share of the screentime.

The film is almost split into three, we have different arcs. One featuring Stark, Parker, and Strange.

One featuring Thor and The Gaurdians.

And the other featuring the rest of the Avengers preparing for Thanos.

As for the audience, we could have never been prepared for Thanos, easily the most humanistic MCU villain since Killmonger, and his goal is simple, collect all six stones in order to create a more tranquil and peaceful universe.

Is he really the epitome of all evil, after all, his purpose is sound to him, even if it is genocidal, and this makes him such a difficult and complex villain. There are times when he has to make difficult decisions, there are times when it seems that he may be able to be reasoned with.

But this is their infinite adversary, and it really has been worth the wait, it really has been worth sitting through a few clunkers, because this semi conclusion goes way beyond what you have been building up for, and to say that the Russo Brothers have gone dark for this, is an understatement.

It still has that wonderful sense of humour that has been rife throughout the films, and the chemistry between all characters is seamless, but the final third will have your mouth left gaping, especially if you have invested so much time with this universe.

As expected, the effects are amazing, and even if Thanos looks like Bruce Willis, you soon forget he is a walking creation of the computer.

But with the ending, it's either one of the biggest red herrings committed to celluloid, or the Disney/Marvel monster are aware of superhero fatigue, and are not scared of sacrificing a few franchises.

Believe the hype, and then some, this is the movie event of the decade, and it has the best ensemble cast since The Longest Day.

"lesleyharris30","Triumphant,","24 August 2018","Avengers: Infinity War is a fantastic movie with a very well developed plot and a tremendous cast. This really does break new boundaries that have never been crossed with a Marvel movie, or any superhero film for that matter. From the very first scene, we are pulled in, we are made aware that this film is bold, daring, that the stakes have been risen to the max and the circumstances are dire. It genuinely had me at the edge of my seat, the atmosphere in the theatre was phenomenal, as we reacted and shared the journey with one another, it was a film experience I will not soon forget.

The movie also deseves to be applauded for how seamlessly it manages to combine all these franchises in to the one, it never felt overstuffed somehow, I never got lost, and, what it especially deseves credit for, never felt any one of the Avengers, Guardians of the Galaxy, Black Panther, Doctor Strange or Spider-Man were under utilized in any way, everyone got a good amount of screen time and a solid arc.

One of the film's highlights is, without any doubt, Josh Brolin as Thanos, he completely knocks it out of the park as this intimidating, petrifying character that we know from the get go is going to put all of our favourite superheroes in jeopardy. He had me both trembling and riveted every time he is on screen, and I was amazed with the turn the Russo brothers took in actually getting us to somehow sympathise and see a little eye to eye with a character that so easily could have been presented as just a villain.

All around tremendous. Entertaining, action packed, funny at times, suspenseful at others, Avengers: Infinity War is a film that needs to be seen on the big screen, it is a sight for sore eyes and it does not let down one bit.

The Avengers face their biggest challenge yet as they learn of Thanos, who has his hands on the Infinity Gauntlet and will stop at nothing to collect all six Infinity stones, which would render him unstoppable.

All the characters manage to make themselves visible and noticed and the movie was very well organized! Hats off to the director duo.","8"

"comitti-249-373582","Awesome Movie","24 May 2018","Some of the reviews writen here blow my mind on how ignorant people can be when they are watching a movie about a comic book.

Hey, guess what, the unoriginal script is based on a series of comics from the 90's, there's nothing really new here, except for the unfortunate lack of key Characters (mainly Silver Surfer and Adam Warlock) wich are too deep to be presented on this movie (case of Adam) or belong to other studior (case of Silver Surfer, the Fantastic Four, X-men), and the writers need to make a few changes, but that's all.

I guess no one is dumb enough to think that everyone that died in the movie, will remain dead. Marvel doesn't think we are that stupid as well, cause guardians of the galaxy 3 is confirmed to 2020.

I'm sorry to say, but this kind of review, saying the script is unoriginal e full of obvious deaths and turn arounds, is very, very stupid.

It's like watching a biography, and complain about it, because you knew what was going to hapen, even before watching the movie.","7"
"bowmanblue","What we've all been waiting for","1 May 2018","I can't help but think of 'Star Wars: The Last Jedi' after watching 'Avengers: Infinity War.' The two of them may have been made by Disney, but they are worlds apart when it comes to giving the fans what they were after. The latest 'Star Wars' may have been okay, but it was generally disregarded by many die-hards. However, despite the Avengers - technically - pumping out more films in its franchise and therefore potentially suffering from fatigue regarding its premise, it's been hailed as a classic - and for good reason. It shows that, despite having numerous previous (and dare I say similar?) outings, a sequel doesn't have to be stale.

I suppose there must be some people out there who have never seen an 'Avengers' movie before (or even one from the Marvel Cinematic Universe), so, for the two of you, this is the third outing where Earth's mightiest superheroes are forced to come together to defend the planet from an alien, hell-bent on wiping out 50% of the universe.

You may be thinking that this is just another modern action film, filled with computer-generated special effects and scripted one-liners. And you'd be right. However, I always find that computer-generated battles are only bad if the effects are bad and they drag on and scripted one-liners only don't work if they're forced and there's no chemistry between the actors. I'm pleased to say that, although 'Avengers: Infinity War' has both, they only add to the proceedings.

With a cast as big as is needed to bring characters from every Marvel movie together, there's always going to be a couple who don't get quite as much screen time as some of us would like. However, you should really expect that and realise it was going to be difficult for the writers to please everyone. Personally, I've always been a fan of Robert Downey Jr's portrayal of 'Iron Man' (I don't think I'm alone on that one), so I was happy to see that he was - possibly - given the most screen time out of anyone.

However, no matter how good the goodies are, they need a good bad-guy to fight. The Marvel movies have often been criticised for a lack of real threatening baddies (Loki excluded), so we finally get to see he who has been in the background for so long, Thanos. And he's worth the wait. He's a bad guy we can not only love to hate, but also - in a strange way - see that he has a point, or at least a point of view from his own perspective. Josh Brolin portrays him brilliantly and you'll forget that most of him is computer-generated after a while.

Yes, 'Infinity War' is part of the overall franchise, but you don't really have to have seen every previous movie to 'get' everything that's happening here (obviously, the more Marvel movies you've seen the more you'll get out of this one, but it's not essential). I suppose if there is one complaint of mine it's that I know which characters are truly in danger here, due to the actors' contracts either due to expire, or only just being picked up. Either way, it's a definite improvement on the previous 'Avengers' movie, as the 'Age of Ultron' felt strangely 'meh' for one that should have been so much more.

If you like the MCU, you'll like this. If you like action film, you'll also love it. It's - sort of - a family movie in that a lot of families will go to see it, but, either way, it's so epic in scale that most should appreciate it for the sheer spectacle it is. Poor Justice League - it never really stood a chance.","8"

"Richie-67-485852","Overkill Kill Kill","28 April 2018","At some point the question of what do these super-heroes do if there are no threats comes-up? One thinks they are just ordinary people going about ordinary lives. Is that what you should do with these powers? Then, the threat of threats come and they all join-up to take it on. I get it. However, what do we do next time? How many times can you save the world? With all these other life-forms, different worlds/planets etc. and different types of super-heroes and their powers why all the fighting all the time? Leaving that alone for now, I remember the days of Superman, Batman, Spider-Man, Green Lantern and the like who stopped burglars, armed robbers, rescued people and kept law and order. Boy things have changed and I am okay with all that too. However, how many dooms-day scenarios can we come with here? Take Thanos for instance. Okay, he's bad. He likes to kill and he goes after planet after planet. Why? Well in this case it is to find what he wants. Okay. What then? What if he gets it all? Now what? He can kill better, faster & cheaper? It doesn't compute. One other annoying thing that comes up in the dialog is the expression OMG or oh my God. If super-heroes are uttering this then there must be a God and if so HE is all powerful exceeding the whole movie premise. That phrase called me back to reality and these movies could do with out it because it doesn't work well in make-believe worlds. All this aside, the theaters were packed, people were rushing in, everyone had their snacks, drinks and pleasant company and apparently we the public like this stuff. It all works rather well if one considers it is all only in the Marvel Universe and the viewers must leave their real Universe behind to visit there. Same with the DC world too.

"Chalice_Of_Evil","Give this man a shave!...","26 April 2018","I took a break from seeing MCU movies at the theatre, since 2017's offerings didn't appeal to me, but having enjoyed some of the previous solo movies/half-enjoying the previous two Avengers movies, I checked out A:IW for the characters I *cared* about, knowing full-well time would also be spent on those I *didn't* care about. We begin with Thor, Loki and the film's big bad, Thanos. It feels like Thor got more screentime here than he did in the two previous Avengers movies. Most surprisingly, his main interaction's with Rocket from the GotG movies, who he calls ""Rabbit"". Like in A:AoU, Thor is absent for long periods of time/shows up towards the end, seemingly with a means to defeating the villain...that doesn't quite work out this time. I enjoyed his first movie, but am disappointed with what they've reduced him/his movies to since.

Tony is...Tony. If you're a fan, chances are you're never going to dislike him (no matter what he says/does), whereas I'm someone who's *never* been a fan of RDJ's mumbled-speed-talking a-hole of a character, so I just tune out when he's eating up screentime/cracking ""jokes"". RDJ's/Paltrow's scene just made me wish the screentime was spent on something/anything else. His relationship with Tom Holland's Spider-Kid may tug at some people's heartstrings (especially near the end, where Holland/Peter ripped-off the Tenth Doctor's exit from Doctor Who), but I personally find his whole shtick tiresome. Mark Ruffalo does some questionable acting early on when he's describing the severity of the situation to everyone else, Bruce is also made to look the fool on more than one occasion, and the Hulk doesn't show his green face again after losing a fight to Thanos in the opening scene . There's an all-too-brief acknowledgment of his past 'relationship' he developed with ScarJo's Natasha/Black Widow (who sports a new short blonde 'do and is sadly underutilised) that I personally appreciated.

Disappointingly, a bearded Steve Rogers/Cap has suffered a similar fate to Thor (for me). His screentime's been reduced significantly (despite his third solo film having already been hijacked by Tony & co...which should've meant he was owed *more* screentime, not LESS) and what I enjoyed about him/his first solo film has been stripped away. He's much less fun to watch now...though I still choose his side over Tony's. Steve/Cap has some brief exchanges...and that's about it. I was super-disappointed that the 'brother-like' relationship he'd developed with Wanda was dropped here (as was her one with Hawkeye, who's entirely absent). That other Steve, Doctor Strange, has become Tony's new verbal sparring partner, as they immediately clash thanks to Tony's inability to go without snarking at/insulting others for even a minute (how I wish Strange's Cloak of Levitation would've slapped the snot out of Tony instead of just giving him a light slapping when he was disrespecting an ancient artifact). Thankfully, the cloak remains awesome.

Not-so-awesome? The GotG. I'm not a fan of them/their movies (John C. Reilly's character summed them up best in their first film: ""What a bunch of a-holes.""), and their brand of 'humour' doesn't work for me. The only one I half-like (Karen Gillan's Nebula) is sadly wasted here. She's tortured, then awesome, then gives Star-Lord some upsetting information which causes him to muck up everybody's ONE REAL CHANCE at defeating Thanos. Not fun when someone lets their PERSONAL FEELINGS get the better of them IS IT, TONY? While others don't appreciate the characters of Wanda/Scarlet Witch and Vision, or the actors' performances, I thought Elizabeth Olsen/Paul Bettany made the most of their screentime. I've always liked them/their characters' relationship. The actors make the most of what they're given and I enjoyed what little time we got with them (especially when Wanda started kicking major butt. And despite her feelings for Vision, she makes the ultimate sacrifice/does what *needs* to be done). As I expected, they're given short-shrift/tossed aside near the end without anyone mourning/caring about them.

Chadwick Boseman's T'Challa/Black Panther hasn't much to do. Danai Gurira's Okoye makes more of an impression (particularly in the scene where she/Natasha help Wanda. Too bad there wasn't more of this trio). There are other characters who're given moments here and there (and even some cameos), but a large percentage of the film is taken up by Thanos. Josh Brolin's certainly given more material to work with than the last few Marvel villains prior to this film, but I personally would've rather spent more time with the *good guys*, as I don't feel for Thanos no matter HOW much the movie wants me to. Why *should* I care if he looks sad/cries, when he'll kill half the universe's population without a second thought? Some of the action is hard to follow, the film cuts back and forth between many different characters/plots (thus making things feel 'scattered'/all-over-the-place) and the cliff-hanger ending elicited a ""WTF?"" reaction from the audience I saw it with (while my main reaction was finding Bruce looking sad in the 'Hulkbuster' armour unintentionally comical).

This film was never going to please everyone, and while there are those who're unfairly critical towards it, there's also those who overpraise it too. I might sound like I didn't enjoy the film, but that's not entirely true. Parts of it worked. Other parts? Not so much. The problem with trying to cram so much together is that everyone 'loses' in some way (except Tony, of course!). Also, I think the film overdid the 'deaths' throughout, which just felt like they were there for 'shock value'. There's such a large number of 'casualties' that you just *know* most, if not all, are going to be undone in the following film. The end credits haven't anything interesting/special to look at, which is disappointing. The after-credits scene doesn't offer much except the promise of hopefully something better yet to come with Captain Marvel.","8"
"tmpsvita","The film that has everything that was missing from the other Marvel movies","29 April 2018","10 years, 19 films, 15 billion dollars and a huge fanbase composed of an extremely homogeneous audience of women, men, children, teenagers, adults and the elderly; In short, Marvel with its MCU has created an unprecedented film phenomenon that seems not to want to decrease but instead does nothing but expand more and more from year to year, especially in the American and world box office where it continues to break records on records so much to create almost an economic monopoly while the DC counterpart, as much as I appreciate it, remains helpless to look with great envy. All this immense work to get to this point, to get to this huge, impressive and epic, as well as exciting, dark and, however difficult it may seem, even deep film; all this to get to ""Avengers: Infinity War"". A waited film, as already mentioned, for ten years and a huge number of fans and not only, which had the task of being able to bring together all the Marvel superheroes so far cinematically known, to link the various films, to give a species of conclusion, which will then be more concretized in the fourth, to this complex scheme that is the expanded Marvel universe, and above all to succeed, at least, to satisfy the great expectations that have grown together with this universe. To do all this, Joss When, after creating ""Avengers"" and ""Avengers: Age of Ultron"", is replaced by two brothers, Joe and Anthony Russo, former directors of the last two chapters of the trilogy dedicated to Steve Rogers aka Captain America, ""Captain America: the Winter Soldier"" and ""Captain America: Civil War. The two directors have managed to give the film a heart and a soul, you can perceive in each frame, sequence and dialogue the love on their part and of each of the actors in the film that have invested in this project and, above all in this movie. They also managed to give to Infinity War probably what really distinguished this to all the other Marvel films, that is an almost perfect villain, Thanos, a villain who does not believe in his ego to be such because he is motivated by a real, tangible and understandable motivation, a villain who is able to experience feelings beyond anger and desire for destruction, a villain with whom the spectator almost manages to tie because as immoral and ruthless as he may be it is also almost understandable, a villain that has not only the characteristic to be such but that has different facets, different nuances and different reasons that push he, almost against his will, to be such, in short an extremely complex villain, characterized in an exemplary manner and that marks a real strength and turn to the internal of the MCU; if there is something missing in each of the previous films that are part of this universe is the presence of a great bad guy, absolutely not flat or forgettable but that proves a real challenge for heroes protagonists. It is also interpreted with great credibility by an extraordinary Josh Brolin, which we will see soon also in the role of Cable in the sequel to Deadpool, who immerses himself totally in the character and manages to be worthy of his intense and really complicated role. The Russo also impress the audience with a balanced and well calibrated alternation of ironic moments with others darker, of moments more emotional and moving with others more sensational and with a strong visual impact. They also succeeded in giving the right time to each character, perhaps one of the most difficult tasks given the large number of them and the duration of ""just"" two and a half hours. Basically they managed to make a film not difficult to work, almost impossible to achieve, they did a job that will enter, if it has not already done, in the history of cinema, which will be studied in film schools and will act as an example for many others movie. Nothing of this film is not in the right place or does not work, especially if considered the technical aspect that really turns out to be a real triumph: extraordinary special effects, extremely credible and realistic despite their abundant amount, especially in the realization of Thanos give the best of themselves; a direction, as already said, impeccable; an extremely suggestive and exciting cinematography, with truly sensational colors; an incisive, noisy, perfectly contextualized soundtrack that gives the right tone and the right atmosphere to the whole film; and a perfect editing in every sequence. An unforgettable film, impossible for a fan to see objectively because it touches the emotions that have formed over the past ten years, an immense, extreme, epic film and I could continue for many lines giving it the best compliments for a blockbusters of this size. But above all for me is a film that has managed to awaken in me that great fan who grew up with this universe and that in recent films was lost because demoralized by the repetition and the stalemate created inside the MCU, they aren't bad movies, especially the last ""Black Panther"" but that were beginning to repeat itself in the structure and in the plot. So I can only be more than happy with this ""Avengers: Infinity War"", a film that has everything that was missing in the other Marvel movies.","9"

They manage to tell the story with several side plots that make sense throughout the movie and keeps you engaged the hole time though.

Now for the character that I think didn't get any character development was Black Widow she is hardly seen in this movie and every time she is on screen she is under use and gets no character Development.

The rest of the cast are used to their best of the ability.

Robert Downey Jr, Chris Evens and Chris Hemsworth are the best out of the cast in this one they bring the best performances and they bring really funny moments. I also got to mention Josh Brolin he gives one of the most terrifying and menacing villains yet.

What I appreciate most is the fact that while this is certainly the avengers' movie, it's also the main villain Thanos' story.

One thing that this may seem is overstuffed. It's a lot to take in, certainly, and with so many characters to fit in, of course it's going to seem that way. There certainly could have been some improvements to the story, but overall the plot was well done.

The direction is what stands out. The Russo brothers have crafted an addition that truly serves as a fantastic piece of blockbuster action while remaining faithful to the previous MCU directors.

One last thing I don't normally compliment: the CGI and visual affects were on point. Marvel has never had a real problem with it in the past, but this was just plain amazing. One of the most visually dazzling films of this last year.

"soneil12","Too much going on for too little payoff","26 April 2018","This was an ambitious film. Capping off 10 years of Marvel superhero films. In a nutshell, it confirmed my impression that Marvel are at their best when they focus a film on an individual hero or group of heroes (such as Black Panther or Guardians of the Galaxy). The crossover films tend to suffer from the story being spread too thinly over several story arcs and this film was yet another example of that.

The good. Visual effects were the usual high standard we expect from these films. It's an amazing spectacle. The action sequences were also superb as we've come to expect. What Marvel have always done well, they continued to do well here. Cheeky humour was used in good doses, mostly at appropriate moments (as opposed to the grossly overused and often inappropriately timed humour in Thor Ragnarok).

The bad. There were many corny, predictable moments in this film. For the most part, Marvel were playing it pretty safe. Early in the movie there were a couple of moments where a character appeared without clearly showing who it was, leaving the audience guessing for a few seconds. Would it be Iron man? Captain Americal etc. A little tease before the full reveal. That was cool the first few times. It got old pretty quick, however, by the time they'd used that trick 7 or 8 different times. My overall impression of the first half of the movie was plenty of action. But too much happening with too many characters in too many places. The rapid switching from one location / group of characters to another was often jarring and made it difficult to really care about some of the character arcs and sub plots that were clearly meant to be pretty important. It seemed to lack continuity, flow, whatever you would call it.

The last half of the movie was where Marvel became less predictable and defied expectations. Normally I'd say that's a good thing. Honestly though, I hated the ending. Without spoiling anything, I'd say it left me feeling highly unsatisfied after what was generally a very enjoyable film. Usually I stick around for the post credits scene to enjoy the nice little extra they throw in. This time I stuck around hoping it would improve the ending. It didn't. It seemed a lot of build up to... nothing? I'm sure it was meant to be a bit of a cliff hanger to get us excited for the next Marvel film and I'm sure it's an ending that would appeal to hardcore comic fans. As a casual marvel movie fan though, it left me feeling very flat and overall disappointed with which was otherwise a pretty solid film","3"
"Gelaos","I shut up and gladly gave Marvel my money","18 September 2018","Infinity War doesn't differ from other Marvel production. Dialogues and jokes are sometimes good (e.g. Thor meeting Guardians), sometimes really cheap (Thanos + Gamora + Soul stone). The characters don't surprise, but the team interaction is still great to look on.

Unfortunately, story jumps from place to place across the universe, some characters disappear from the story for so long that you almost forget them. On the other hand, having 20 characters in one place would be likely even more unbearable. Unlike in previous two Avengers, where it took an hour before things started moving, Infinity War is agressive from first to last scene.

The biggest star is clearly Josh Brolin and his Thanos. Compared to previous villains, Thanos gets a lot more screentime, so his character and motivations make sense and it's easier to symphatize with him (to some extent). He's a bulldozer, smashing all superheroes like flies, without anything/anyone being able to stop him. The movie ending serves, of course, just as a spectacular effect. The feeling of hopelessness and fear from Thanos is pretty well transfered upon the viewer.

Infinity War doesn't show anything new. It's not easy to entertain with the same thing over and over again but Marvel did it. Despite having 10-15 main characters it still holds together and doesn't feel like some confused mash-up (ehm, Justice League, ehm). Bravo Marvel, bravo.","8"
"Mnemosyne15","Unbelievable!","20 March 2020","Despite my contribution to the box office of this movie, I still can't believe it can actually rank 60 on the TOP250 list. Perhaps not all superhero movies end in the same way, this big villain finally won. Well, in fact, I think Thanos is very environmentally friendly. You think about it, because there are too many people, resources are limited, and the distribution is uneven, so he considers erasing part of the population randomly to achieve an even distribution of resources. The destruction of Tynos is random, you know, he is so equal hahaha","8"
"Jackbv123","Action","11 May 2019","The story is simple and even thin, but it's not quite shallow. It covers a lot, but can be summed up quite briefly. It is mostly about action and tragedy.

Like many of the Marvel movies following the Avenger story-line, it is full of cold blooded killing on a grand scale and this movie adds torture. Thanos is developed to appear that he is not sadistic. Instead he is insane and his motivation makes no sense. The film develops the appearance that he is thoughtful and self-sacrificial. To me this concept is insincere, even irreverent.

This movie is like so many other Marvel movies in that it is full of absolutely invincible villains. They control everything around them with a wave of their hands. It is magic with no limitations. And in this movie, it's not just Thanos, but some of his minions as well.

For so much of the early part of the movie, it had the feel of video name-dropping. Many of the Marvel movie characters are introduced one after another without dwelling on any.

We see perhaps the most romance of any of the movies where several couples have moments of affection.

For me the humor is stiff and inappropriate, not in a obscene or crude way, but the transitions between drama and tragedy vs comedy is clumsy, almost as if the comedy is it's filling a quota.

At first the tragedy is heart-rending, but then tragedy follows tragedy and then it becomes a flood and the impact is negated. The viewer has to strongly suspect that something is going to reverse it all and looking at the cast for Endgame seems to verify that thinking. (But I am guess since I haven't yet seen Endgame.)

I really dislike movies that end with defeat when you know that it is not the final outcome. It's half a story. A cliffhanger in the credits is one thing. A story has been completed and there is a teaser for the next one. But I don't like half a story when I've paid for a full movie and I know the completion may be a year or two away. (No, I don't like TV season finales that hang either.)

Despite my complaints, some of which are personal preference, I recognize that this movie is highly successful in telling the story it intended.","3"

"iquine","Maximum Superhero Smorgasbord to the Max","6 April 2019","(Flash Review)

I feel like Marvel managed to get each character into this movie; as far as I could tell. They all team up to halt Thanos from collecting all six colorful Infinity Stones. Once he possesses them all, which fit nicely into a stylish metal glove, he will force the universe fit his personal will. Which is the destroy have the population of the entire universe as he feels overpopulation is a problem. That of course is a contrast to all the people who live in the universe. Aren't there better solutions!? So the Avengers team up to battle him without much success. Thanos is able to thwart each special power thrown at him. Can Thanos be stopped or will the expected happy ending come through? This movie was full of comprehendible action, dazzling effects, solid humor and some somber moments. Not being a superhero guru, I'm sure many insider points flew past me as there were so many superheroes, the action felt a bit scattered about but I got what I expected from it and to the MAX.","10"
"Special-K88","the crew at Marvel prove that it was worth the wait","21 May 2018","The world is on fire...the stakes have never been higher...it all comes down to this; ten years in the making, the stage has been set for Marvel's gritty, somber, epic-scale collaboration, as a powerful intergalactic despot sets his sights on collecting all six Infinity Stones in order to ""fulfill his destiny"" and rebalance the universe as he sees fit. Old grudges will have to be put aside, egos will have to be kept in check, and unlikely alliances will have to be formed as all of the world's heroes (Iron Man, Thor, Captain America, Star Lord, Doctor Strange, Black Panther, et al) must band together to take on an adversary unlike any they've ever encountered before. This intense, sprawling, multi-character saga has the requisite amount of witty humor and relentless, edge of your seat action, but pushes far beyond the boundaries of the comic book world and emerges as an ambitious, allegorical, and often heartbreaking spectacle of heroism and sacrifice that will resonate with viewers long after the film is over. Goes on for a long time, but seeing ten years' worth of MCU characters united for a colossal front is more than enough to compensate. Brolin makes Thanos a compelling, multilayered, and somewhat tragic villain who is sure to be remembered for years to come; a solid outing for non-fans, and a sure-fire hit for dedicated followers. ***½","8"
"masonsaul","Epic and emotional","18 December 2018","Avengers: Infinity War is Marvel's best film to date, balancing humour, action and emotion surprisingly effectively. It's also surprisingly well paced allowing all of it's incredible cast to have at least one memorable moment. The direction from Joe and Anthony Russo is incredible. The music by Alan Silvestri is incredible. The CG and action is phenomenal and undoubtedly some of Marvel's best. Surprisingly, Thanos has a really good amount of depth and Josh Brolin gives an incredible performance. All the Avengers are great but Robert Downey Jr. and Chris Hemsworth give the standout performances. The script is amazing, both bold and unpredictable.","6"

"hooma814","I forgot how good this was!","12 April 2020","Infinity war is fantastic!

It and Endgame make watching all the previous MCU movies so worth it. The best part is seeing a villain be truly powerful and ultimately to the point of defeat. After watching movie after movie of the superheroes coming out top, never really losing anything meaningful to them. We get a much better look at who these characters are when they've lost all around them. Thor especially is interesting to see him continually getting broken down.

Thanos' minions were a waste of time. They were quickly dispatched, especially the crew on the ship.

Gamorah and Nebula were excellent again. I pretty much really enjoy any scene they're in. Their character arcs are again advanced well in this movie especially with the death of Gamorah. Lucky Thanos came with someone to sacrifice, otherwise he'd be a bit stuck.

I appreciated the pace of the movie in the fact that it didnt drag out over two or three movies for Thanos to get the stones, instead it increased the fear by the urgency required as he gathered all six. As you knew more and more that they were going to lose, it forces you to be more invested and the anxiety is much more intense, with such a high point of ending.

It was also so good having all the characters together, working together. This was well balanced and trumped Avengers 1 and 2. They moved on from trying to have cool 360 degree fighting shots to actually advancing the story. And in fact the fight scenes they did have were much smoother with panning from character to character.

Good to see Paul Rudd and Hawk eye side lined for family that makes sense.

All of this I picked up on my first watch and loved it all. However rewatching this two years later I had forgotten how good it actually was. This movie has a lot of rewatch ability. Some people are anti superhero movies but these last films are a different breed and a must watch.","2"
"drqshadow-reviews","Marvel's Payoff: A Flashy, Risk-Taking, Galaxy-Crawling, All-Hands-On-Deck Melee","18 September 2018","A decade's worth of intertwined superhero adventures culminates in one staggering, towering behemoth of a film. It sounds like a tall order - and, clearly, it is - but Marvel's been doing this for quite a while now and seem to have a firm grasp of the essentials. Effectively juggling so many competing stars, flavors, themes and aesthetics was my largest concern, especially ones as disparate as Captain America and the Guardians of the Galaxy, but obviously this was a core focus for Infinity War's producers. Not only does each scene retain the characteristic tone and identity of its unique featured franchise, it also mixes fluidly with those of another, creating a fresh blend that works almost effortlessly and moves in exciting new directions. This is the essence of the Marvel universe, particularly so from a long-term reader's perspective, and it's something I've yet to grow tired of seeing on the big screen. Creating a great cast is step one, but watching them grow and interact with the unfamiliar is where the real magic happens. Each subsequent installment in the Avengers franchise ups that ante just a little bit further.

No doubt, I would've been content to just watch these familiar faces bounce around in the same enclosed space, trading zingers and butting heads, but there's an underlying reason for all this, and the film (somehow) doesn't shortchange that, either. Thanos, the big wrinkle-chinned monster who's been hinted at and referenced for years, has finally come to town with a destructive cause in mind. Well-rounded villains have not been a strength for the MCU thus far, but in this case they make amends. Thanos is quickly and efficiently established as a galactic-level threat, far and away the most powerful creature we've seen so far, and then thoroughly fleshed out as a fully-realized three dimensional character. We may not agree with his means, but his motivation is certainly understandable. That's a new thing, a clearly addressed criticism, and it makes the film far stronger.

So, yes, I enjoyed myself. The new Avengers is a big deal, it takes big risks, and judging from the box office numbers, it's reaped big rewards. There are also several little flaws for those interested in picking. Most glaringly, it falls into the trap of being merely half a movie. After the better part of three hours, I left the theater with the feeling I'd just binge-watched an entire season of an expensive TV series and been left hanging with a ""tune in next time."" Its story is obviously incomplete, and while that's played for maximum effect in the stunning conclusion (the first time I've ever seen an entire theater sit through a credit roll in complete silence), that stuck in my craw. My other complaints can be largely brushed away as inconsequential - inexplicably missing characters, too many guest spots, a not-insignificant barrier of entry - but that's a relatively big one and something that I keep revisiting. Having cleared my chest of that, though, I'll strongly recommend it as a fundamental bit of summer blockbuster history, even if it isn't quite summer yet. Potential viewers should already know what to expect (Infinity War is just another refinement in the well-worn Marvel formula) and whether or not that's remotely up their alley. If so, by all means, go see it more than once. This is the best entry yet. And maybe, just maybe, it'll shine even more brightly as a Lord of the Rings style all-day anthology. Once the story is actually complete, that is.","3"
"toseale","Marvel Knows How to Make Crossovers","31 July 2022","While Avengers: Infinity War does quite a bit of jumping around, it creates a great crossover event unrivaled until Endgame. Thor and the Guardians of the Galaxy are a blast to experience, Steve's team in Wakanda is full of action and intensity, and the same can be said for Tony's in space. To this day, I think this movie has a few of the top greatest action sequences in Marvel movies and action movies in general. I have found myself watching this movie just to enjoy the choreography and intensity of the fight scenes. The big fight scenes are insanely fun and have some amazing visuals that can make any watcher feel like they're in the moment, holding on for dear life. This movie carries itself well in comedy, and, in contrast, depressing situations. While some scenes I thought were a little too much, and still do, it's still a great watch, and something to look forward to when binging the MCU.","10"

"pozahedi","Avengers: Infinity Wast","21 July 2018","If you want to envoy this movie don't watch it as a cinephile, watch it as a geek. Then all those profusion of characters which doesn't make sense will appear to be so cool that you will ask for more. Yeah ""more and more"" could be an apropriate summary and at some point I was expecting Batman and Superman joining in the battle (even if they aren't from Marvel). From a marketing point of view putting as much characters as possible isn't a bad idea since you can target the largest audience possible but as a consequence the plot is going to suffer from it.

Concerning the CGI it was quite enjoyable to watch and I must admit that Thanos has a lot of personnality and was really well made. However I wasn't impressed by any of the battle's scenes and giving that budget it can be considered as a wast of money.

I expected more from that film but I don't want to be so rude and I'll give it a 6 because I was quite surprised by the ending. This may be the main strength of the movie!","10"

The ending was great, exciting and thrilling. Which is makes me so excited and impatient to see the next avengers movie, which I hope it has an epic final fight. But it really is the best movie in the MCU.","10"
"Red_Identity","Very entertaining and well executed.","29 April 2018","Avengers Infinity War: So I thought it was really good. My concerns before it came out were about the possibility that it would feel overbloated and overstuffed. For the most part the film is able to juggle its various storylines well, although not perfectly all the time and it's definitely flawed. It wasn't an absolute homerun but it wasn't nearly as messy as it could have been. The action sequences are entertaining and it does feel like there are real stakes, something which is rare for these films.

Now for the spoilers section: I think killing a character like Loki in the beginning was the right move. The Gamora arc was well handled, but it also felt like it could have been given even more meaning. The Vision arc was also well done. As for the entire final sequence where ""people at random"" were killed, it doesn't ring true. If you really want to hit home the point that some people will randomly die and some people won't, don't have all of the main, original avengers (Thor, Iron Man, Captain America, Hulk) stay alive while a lot of the lesser characters and new avengers fade away. I feel like all throughout the film the stakes felt real, but once this happened they didn't because of that same problem: the obvious characters stayed alive while the lesser characters (and a few main new avengers didn't) and additionally because it's clear that they will be coming back somehow. Having seen it, I am now less sure about the risks the writers are willing to take.

As for the individual characters, I loved that Thor got more screentime than Captain America. I think with Ragnarok they now know he could become one of the favorite superheroes. Hemsworth is the most adept at handling the comedy/drama balance I feel, and it's great to see him finally being used for his full potential. Tom Holland was again impressive (his final scene with Tony was so well acted). Zoe Saldana was also one of the strongest in the cast, and she will be missed.

As for characters not used as well, Peter Quill/Star Lord was dumbed down and made to be too much of comedy relief, to a point that it was out of character. Peter Parker was his complete contrast in that he was used very well and the comedy for him works, but for Quill it did not. Or maybe it's just my dislike for Chris Pratt shining through, but he's so annoying. Oh, and what does Black Widow do again? I feel like both in Civil War and here she's just... there. Here in particular, she has one of the main spots in the poster and in billing and yet she has no arc and does barely anything of note. Even Wanda/Scarlett Witch seems to have more screentime and a better arc. It just seems like the writers, after so many films, have still not figured out how to write Black Widow, and it's a shame they're underutilizing Scarlett Johansson.","10"

My son says he wants to buy it.

It will be interesting to see where they go from here. Can't wait for part II.

We (and EVERYONE at the theater) stayed throughout the credits to get our Marvel tidbit. Not worth the LONG wait...

A couple surprisingly moving moments among all the whizzbang stuff.

D.C. really has an uphill battle now.

I still don't know who that gal with the power to destroy an infinity stone is.

The Guardian and prior Avenger movies were so good and funny that it made me want to see this movie. What a surprise when most of my favorite characters are gone. I will not be going to the next one. Maybe the people who love this are Marvel comic fans.","1"
"hiraishinnojutsu","Not the greatest or the best MCU has to offer, but damn, it's the darkest one....","30 April 2018","From the very start of the movie, we can already feel the serious tone that marvel usually tries to avoid, from the beginning where no iconic MCU intro song was played (it was instead, replaced by a distress call as a continuation from Thor: Ragnarok's mid-credit scene) to the end where..... ummm... *SPOILER*, no wonder many fans were left scarred for (possibly) the rest of their lives (some of them even reported being passed out at the end of the movie lol). But not for me, on the contrary I'm Happy! I'm so happy that finally, FINALLY! A Superhero/Comicbook movie where, the bad guy that you know and love........................................WINS!!!!! Though not without great effort and sacrifices, which make the bad guy even more badass.

Thanos is easily the best and the greatest character in the movie, he is probably (and arguably) one of the greatest movie villain of all time (side-by-side with Darth Vader, if they decided to make infinity war saga into a trilogy like the original Star Wars or The Lord of the Rings). He's not that all-powerful like in the comics (which becomes one of my disappointments from the movie, in which I think that Thanos was not as powerful as Korath from the first Guardians of the Galaxy movie said when he consider him as the most powerful being in the universe without the gauntlet and the stones) he has feelings too, especially for Gamora. The difference of Thanos' motive in the movie from the comics actually disappoints me a little bit. The force of true and pure evil, violence, megalomania, destructive ambition, and absolute psychopathy suddenly turned into a well intentioned extremist.

Another factor that downgrades the movie was the fact the last battle scene in Wakanda is not as long or as great as the battle of new york. It almost ends instantly the moment Thor arrived at the scene. The Outriders are not as formidable as the Chitauris with their laser guns, flying rovers, and the massive flying monsters (they are called Leviathans by the way) whereas the outriders only relies heavily on their savagery, claws, teeth, and blood-thirsty instinct like a massive horde of zombies. The Black Order aren't so great either, in which all four of them die in just this one movie where they are first introduced.

So far, I enjoyed the movie more than almost anyone who needs therapist because they cannot accept some of their favorite characters turned to dust once Thanos' masterplan come to fruition. while they cried, I was like ""Oh yeahhh....!!!"" in complete happiness. I don't really care if some of them don't make it into the next phase of the MCU. In fact, I'm curious on how Marvel will try to produce the next 20 or so movies while half of their characters didn't even survived Infinity War. only time will tell the future of this astonishing and hell-of-a-ride cinematic adventure. will it ever stop, or, to paraphrase Buzz Lightyear from Toy Story, going infinity and beyond? you may never know.","10"
"panagiotis1993","Very Unique: Definitely one of the Best Films of the MCU","28 January 2023","This is the 2nd time watching the movie for me. First time I watched it in theatre. I will never forget how good Thanos looks in this movie, his design and the CGI for him is flawless. I still don't like how easy it was for Thanos to beat Hulk. The scenes in the beginning with Peter's spidey sense and after that seeing Tony's nano suit were so good. First 20 minutes and we already have around 7-10 jokes. While jokes are fine, they can be bad when you want to have a serious moment, example fighting a powerful villain.

The way Captain America, Falcon and Black Widow came to defend Vision and Wanda was epic. Love the scene with kid Gamora and Thanos. I really like Steve's suit in this, it has that dirty / dusty look. Gamora and Thanos have a very beautiful and disturbing relationship. The movie has great pacing, I like that. Maybe having less jokes could make it better, it ruins certain moments. It's like we get a scene with super dramatic music etc and seconds later a joker, like come on. I love how Gamora thought that Thanos loves no one. Thanos sacrificing Gamora was intense. Shuri is smarter than Bruce, ok we get it...

The ''Wakanda Forever'' or battle of Wakanda scene has to be one of the most epic scenes in CBM and cinema history. ''I am Groot'', ''I am Steve Rogers'', lol. The CGI for Thanos' henchmen is not as good as Thanos', that's sad. In many scenes they look like Playstation characters. The scene with Wanda destroying vision's stone is still so emotional and intense. I really enjoyed the ending with half the characters becoming dust, really dramatic. Thanos is a great villain and feels like a big threat. Good direction, decent dialogue, some good jokes, some bad ones, good cinematography, good performances. My rating is 8.2/10.","8"

"badoli","Okay for Non-Fans.","26 April 2019","If you're a superhero-fan, you don't need a review, you will have seen this anyways. For people without this disposition, Infinity Wars is a harder sell.

Best working are the characters. Even though there is an army of support characters, not one feels really cheap and unnecessary. It's a party and as such it feels a little claustrophobic sometimes, but it's still fun.

The story though is a superhero-quagmire. Especially after about half of the movie logic went fully overboard and the plot happens via incomprehensible superhero actions. Time is irrelevant, distances are extremely liquid and neither the MacGuffin nor the relationships of the different ""superhero abilities"" is ever satisfyingly explained. As such drama happens predomantly in the faces of the actors. Visual fidelity distracts from all questions starting with ""why"". It's like you're watching a sport you don't know the rules of - Who is winning? Why was that action helpful? Why is everyone cheering?

If you're new to the Marvel Cinematic Universe, don't start here. The movie strongly presents itself as a chapter of an epic, so you're expected to have a certain idea of the characters to begin with and you won't see real closure unless you plan to visit the next Avenger iteration. And to be honest, i'm not sure this episode warrants the investment, as i had little enthusiasm or emotions for the protagonists and was left observing the spectacle. The humor and the actors save it from becoming another Transformer, but i never felt really engaged.","8"

There's in no way I can stop thinking about the film. It's really phenomenal, and is absolutely astonishing in each and every aspect. This is not just another cool summer movie, it's much more than that. AVENGERS INFINITY WAR is a masterpiece of the superhero genre. There's in no way a superhero fan will return home disappointed. Plus, the film is visually so powerful that it needs to be seen in IMAX 3D (I did) for the best experience. After a long time, I saw the multiplex audience cheering and clapping throughout a film, and found even myself doing the same.

AVENGERS INFINITY WAR is the pride of world cinema as a whole. It's something you won't have seen or even imagined of seeing, ever before. Much more than just an experience, the film is something which has the power to unite the world with the sole aim of watching and enjoying the film. And I can really see that happening around me.

I won't say too much. I don't want to reveal even a single bit of the movie. I'll just say that the performances were excellent, the action scenes were mindblowing, the visual effects were spectacular and the screenplay was masterfully written. This film can go down in the history of filmmaking as (one of) the best superhero film(s) of all time.

Just like any superhero film, this one is also an out and out action entertainer filled with excellent and grand action sequences, but another thing which makes it impactful apart from the action is its plot, character and emotional depth.

This is one grand masterpiece that shouldn't be missed at any cost. Each and every second of the film is rewarding, and watching it in the best possible quality is probably the best gift you can give yourself. Don't wait for the DVD or BD. Just go and experience this visual spectacle which is much more than just an experience. This action fantasy movie is, the best superhero film of all time.","9"

Too silly then super serious, switching back and forth. There were more humorous moments in this movie than any other MCU film, more than Thor Ragnarok. Avengers Infinity War should have some comedy description or category. Disney needs to stop with the excessive humor.

Thanos motive is weak and uninteresting in film. I don't recognize Thanos THE MAD TITAN from the comic books, he's too simple in this movie. LADY DEATH's influence over Thanos is more coherent. But that's what happens when a children's company takes over a sophisticated comic book company, they change the stories for kids and add lots and lots of humor.

One more thing, title of movie is incorrect. This movie is Disney's adaptation of the Infinity Gauntlet series, not Infinity War. What was the point of Disney' mixup of titles? The answer is Disney wanted to confuse people that might spoil movie with their comic book knowledge. This avoids negative reactions from social media during production to post production. 2/10 stars because of Disney's cheesy Mickey Mouse adaptation of Thanos the Emo Crybaby, Peter Quill should dance for Thanos to cheer him up.","10"

"keniwhat","Enjoyable but a Disjointed Mess","7 May 2018","Marvel have embarked on a massive project to link up many movies over a decade to a grand finale featuring all of the main heroic characters of the movies. However, the inifinity stones are more of a thread linking the movies than a story in itself. The story of the stones is what infinity wars is about. So it's a new story but populated with characters already developed so the character development is that of Thanos, the villain. Josh Brolin is brilliant as Thanos but his back story is a biit lame, perhaps as a result of distillation from the comics, but still for a movie of this scale a bit thin. All of the Marvel characters are involved and it is just too much for the film, giving it an air of contrivance, Comic relief is probvided largely by the Guardians of the Galaxy even that is not so fresh anymore. On the whole it is enjoyable family fluff but falls in many respects due to ridiculous levels of suspension of disbelief.","8"
"fibulator777","Love the movie, but Thanos motive is botched","18 June 2021","So, ya... I loved the movie. However, ""cutting the population in half"" would do jack squat.

Populations double every X number of years (depending on species) until they find balance.

So, *at best*, it'd buy each respective species X years (assuming Thanos was correct that every species would wipe itself out). Though, a ""hop to any planet you want"" species would be practically impossible to ""wipe itself out due to too much population"" because of natural nutrient recycling, combined with unlimited resources.

At best, he gave them an extra couple of years... at worse, he was a mass murder for no reason other than derpin' stupidity.","5"
"lambiepie-2","Excting, heartbreaking and -- makes you think that even Heroes can't last forever.","26 August 2018","Yes, this is a Marvel Superhero Movie. Many of the fan favorites are here. They are all doing what they are good at doing with their skill sets used for protecting the Universe. There are the fights, then the battle. Then they lose. They lose big. What? Yep. Why? Logically, how can they not? Logically, And that is the beauty of what is presented here. A bold move for beloved characters but it works.

These Super Hero characters are faced to confront the inevitable. How can they combat an egotistical maniac with power who thinks he knows what is good for the Universe as he sees it --and knows if he can capture the five stones that (basically) represent a corner of each existence to do so? Nothing will stop him. He will destroy family, friends, Nations, Worlds to get what he wants. And gets it. That..is Thanos. (What..? Who'd you think I was referring to? If so, then maybe that's why the film irritates some, and saddens others. It takes you from fiction to a possible reality and that makes you..think).

No plot? Really, it's the oldest plot in the world and presented here it is entertaining, but heartbreaking. Heroes win, don't they? Evil gets defeated, doesn't it within 2 1/2 hours with all your favorite Marvel Superheros at battle? This film starts with horror, and ends with it too. That is the beauty of this entry. Fans will walk away musing as things are left open (not unsolved). Fans also know that Thanos will not magically disappear and everything will turn out perfect. It didn't. It won't. Thanos is the part of the Marvel Universe you'd never expect to see in an entertainment film, but had to. And now is a good a time as any to do so.

Iron Man, The Hulk, Thor, Captain America, Black Panther, Doctor Strange, Vision, Guardians of the Galaxy and all the characters that surround them are all here to battle to save the Universe. Universe. Big place. It was great to see them all on the screen, and as I've already mentioned, doing what they do best. The BEST part of it for me is seeing them act as teams to do so. But, they are battling a more than formidable entity no matter how much teamwork they try to overcome it.

Hope? Well, that I won't spoil for you -- but let me tell ya, the Marvel Universe is HUGE, and this film only touches the surface of what else can be introduced. And one part of the MCU I've been waiting for, is strongly hinted to arrive, and I cannot be more happier to see it (in the next installment, I'd bet big, yes!). Will there be a happier ending there, maybe? Um, not sure. But that what makes this a great film -more than just a summer blockbuster, more than just a bunch of Super Heroes in the screen mulling around the Universe. It actually makes you think.","8"

I'm going to keep this review short and snappy and I won't dive into plot details (as requested by the Russo Brothers). #Thanosdemandsyoursilence I went into this movie with the mindset that I will be blown away and this will not only be a home run but out of the park. All I can say that my expectations were met. Thanos is the most powerful villain we've seen to date and the avengers, who are torn apart (following Civil War) are not prepared for this. And then insanity ensues accompanied with real stakes and potential dire consequences. It's a great story filled with twists and surprises. I enjoyed it a lot and I think so will everyone as I predict this will beat the opening weekend record (set by force awakens) and cross the $250 million line.

I really liked the new spider man and black panther, and absolutely loved Thor Ragnarok. I thought civil war was the worst movie in the franchise and it gave me a lower expectation for upcoming avengers films (yes it was technically a captain America film, but I mean it really wasn't was it..), but this movie was so well written with some emotional moments, I'd totally recommend it to people who enjoy a long, breathtaking but also overwhelming movie. 9/10","9"
"martin-hristov-92","Best Marvel movie","26 April 2019","Infinity war is a high-paced masterpiece that combines so many interesting characters in a unique way.

I am truly impressed by the way the directors have brought things together and have built up the culmination for the whole MCU since 2008.

Visuals are phenomenal, funny moments are plenty. Despite the relatively smaller focus on character development, I liked that you can clearly see the motivation for the actions of each side. This brings more depth to the story and brings the viewer on a emontional ride.

Infitiy war is full of twists and suprises, and is never boring. I feel like I can watch it again and again without ever having too much of it.","3"

The graphics and special effects - brilliant. The story line, well. I do think that they should maybe consider appoint better script writers in the future. It just maybe work on paper but it did not go that well on film. The other major point that just beat the heck out of me was the over focus of certain characters and then the total lack of others.

This was more a ""cleanup"" movie than anything else. The end also, just WAY too much and the result thereof - really. The plot was good to a certain point and then this over focus of elements / characters.

My sisters (twins) LOVE this movie. Probably watched it in cinema already 4 times together. We do have different taste in stuff and that all fine, I just donated the majority of the Avenger / Hulk / Marvel DVD's to the library. Maybe someone will have more perspective than me. This movie halted it all on my side.","9"
"dakotadickenson-83457","A film that lived up to expectations","2 May 2023","Avengers: Infinity War is hands down one of the greatest superhero films made to date. It brings every current MCU hero together to fight the common enemy that fans alike have been waiting years to see come to the big screen. When mad titan Thanos is on a mission the collect all six infinity stones, it's up to Iron Man, Hulk, Thor, Captain America, Black Widow, Black Panther, Doctor Strange, Wong, Spider-Man, The Guardians of the Galaxy, and the rest of the remaining Avengers to fight the powerful titan in a fight to save the universe. So first off, The Russo Brothers did a fantastic job bringing all these hero's together for this film. Robert Downey Jr is great as always as Iron Man putting his new nanotechnology to good use. Chris Hemsworth Thor is magnificent, bringing us probably one of the best versions of the character we have ever seen. Mark Ruffalo as Bruce Banner/Hulk is also great even though we got more of Bruce Banner instead of Hulk in this film. Chris Evans as Captain America is great as always showing us more of his character that is now on the run including Scarlett Johansson's Natasha Romanoff/ Black Widow and Anthony Mackie's Sam Wilson/Falcon. The Guardians of the Galaxy are great too with there interactions with some of the Avengers. Zoe Saldana's Gamora stands out the most out of all them in this film. Chadwick Boseman's Black Panther is also fantastic that is not only just joining the fight against Thanos, but bringing the whole nation of Wakanda with him along for the fight including Sebastian Stan's Bucky Barnes/The Winter Soldier who is also great. The best character throughout the whole film that really made this film as great as it is, is Josh Brolin's Thanos. He really brings the long awaited character to the big screen in fashion, as the film mostly follows his journey to collect the infinity stones, while the Avengers try to stop him. On the journey, he must deal with what his destiny is, tragedy, and stopping anyone that gets in his way. Thanos is so far my favorite villain to ever come to the MCU mainly, because I think he has the best purpose out of any villain in the MCU for what he's doing and the way it's captured is absolutely extraordinary. Overall, Avengers: Infinity War is hands down one of the greatest superhero movies ever made, while also bringing us all the hero's we've waited so long to see in one film as well as bringing us one of the greatest superhero villains we have ever seen. Rating 10/10.","9"
"Avwillfan89","You didn't see THAT coming?","28 April 2018","I am a person who has never read the comics, but has fallen in love with the films. And it has to be said with this particular universe, all of the filmmakers have transformed what were either unlikable or one dimensional heroes and villains into fully fledged, lovable, three dimensional characters. They make you care for these people - which is why this film works extraordinarily well.

This movie is many things: extremely relentless, fast-paced, funny, heartbreaking and action packed. And contains one of the most jaw-dropping endings I've ever seen. When a mass-market appeal blockbuster is totally invested in consequences, storylines and character arcs, as well as taking big risks, I absolutely love it and wish more movies had the balls to do it.

That being said, there is a small part of me that wished I wasn't so geeked out and in love with the characters. But it's too late, as Doctor Strange says at one point, ""We are in the endgame, now.""

The filmmakers did right, they didn't joke about and they meant it when people should not spoil the movie.

"rockman182","Avengers: Infinity War (2018)","28 April 2018","I can't remember the last time I was so hyped for a film like this. Probably back in 2008 with the release of The Dark Knight. Well, ten years later here I was doing the same routine. Watching trailers over and over, avoiding all possible spoiler news about the film, and aching to watch it on opening day. Finally, the wait was over and I finally watched the film. While, I still don't think its my personal favorite Marvel film despite expecting it to be, the film is overall a very good film despite its different tone. Furthermore, there are no plot spoilers in this review, there may be thoughts but no real spoilers.

The film is the next installment in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, which sees the Titan, Thanos, on a serious quest to find the Infinity Stones. The various stones let him control basic aspects of the world and make him powerful. The collection of all of them could change the universe drastically and make him the decider of anything that occurs Of course, The Avengers and surrounding heroes make it a mission to stop him and so we see our heroes unite (and split up) to attempt to take down this force that is unlike anything they've ever seen before.

There are a few negatives of the film but nothing that really bring down the quality of it so much. I think the Russo brothers did a generally good job of doing this ambitious crossover combining many characters from different films. However, some do not get enough screen time. Its nothing crazy, but it was expected. There are a lot of humor moments, most hit but not all. That might bother some of the viewers wanting less of that. Also, there are some major plot points that were dumb and questionable, not getting into it though.

I highly appreciated Josh Brolin as Thanos. One weakness of previous Marvel entries was a weak or generic villain. Finally we have one with a well fleshed out back story and one that is unpredictable. Thanos is legitimately threatening and you feel scared for the superheros when he is on screen. There are some moments that feel emotional and it ropes you in well. I feel like the tone and nature of this film is darker than anything in the MCU which I liked. Finally, things feel like they have consequences. The battles are for the most part fun and what you expect. The film is definitely incomplete because it was shot together with the next Avengers.

I have a lot more to say but feel worn out, in a good way. The real strength of Infinity War is being able to see characters you love interacting with one another. Ten years of films, were all leading to this and you can tell the filmmakers but a lot of effort and heart into it. It won't please everyone and does come with flaws and complaints but I think its an event that every comic book fan has to see in the theaters. I am ready for the hype for the next Avengers.

"Maximusgonzales","The Best of the Best","14 May 2018","Generally with superhero movies you know your hero will win, and as a result the viewer couldn't care less about the story. Why care when you know it will work out in the end? Infinity war tropes that stereotype and gives the viewer new interest into the super hero world that may not always end with puppies and rainbows.

This is a great movie that tells an in-depth story line of interpersonal relationships while maintaining the action of the story, something extremely hard to do. Thanos was a well constructed villain who truly did make you afraid for the heroes we hope will prevail.

This one will go down in the record books.","10"

"RforFilm","With most of The Avengers and Guardians of the Galaxy ready to play, Avengers Infinity War is an exciting crossover event that'll satisfy most Marvel fans","28 April 2018","We've spent ten years with Disney's Marvel Cinematic Universe. Whether you think it's a groundbreaking character driven story or a corporate cash cow, the MCU has managed to not only adapt the famous comics of Stan Lee and Jack Kirby (yes, I know there were a lot more people involved, so let's say all of those creative artists and writers of Marvel), but has managed to change how super heroes are seen on the big screen. They can have grey lines, they can be anti heroes, they can have moments where they don't even trust the government. I've personally love the MCU movies and will keep coming back to them to see where our heroes end up next.

Ever since The Avengers, the MCU has been teasing the upcoming villain Thanos. He had spent a good chunk of these movies on a throne, hoping that one of his minions can acquire certain stones, such as the power stone in Guardians of the Galaxy and the reality stone in Thor: The Dark World. Time has finally come for the Avengers and the Guardians of the Galaxy to team up in the major crossover event movie that is Avengers Infinity War.

What I won't do is list all the actors, but I'll give a brief look at the story without going into spoilers, as much of the film's enjoyment is what you don't know.

We open on Thor's ship where Thanos and his children has caught up with them and have acquired a couple of the stones. Thanos understands that if he can collect the rest of the stones for the gauntlet, he'll have the power to control the universe, time, and the fate of every living creature within his grasp. A last ditch effort sends Hulk/Bruce Banner back to Earth where he meets up with Dr. Strange, Iron Man/Tony Stark and Spider-Man/Peter Parker.

Meanwhile, Thor manages to get a distress call out where the Guardians of the Galaxy, Star-Lord, Gamora, Rocket Racoon, Drax, Groot, and Mantis, respond. Their fully aware of the danger that Thanos possesses and agree to help. Back on Earth, Vision and Scarlet Witch are attacked by Thanos' children, but saved by Captain America/Steve Rogers, Natasha Romanoff, and Falcon/Sam Wilson who all sense the danger. They make it to Wakanda to meet up with T'Challa/Black Panther. Together, all of these heroes end up in different areas as they try to stop Thanos from getting the rest of the Infinity Stones.

While Avengers Infinity War has a lot to live up to, I decided to not keep my expectations too high as I know that this is a tough movie to pull off. The good news is that I was very happy with what I got. You get your favorite superheroes and a lot of action that's warranted from the film's villain and his scary desire. I'll start off with. Josh Brolin finally gets to shine as one of the most complex villains of the MCU (which has not had a good track record of villains).

The heroes face a villain who is genuinely scary, thanks to several scenes of them fighting which I won't spoil and a lot of his view of the universe, which I also won't spoil. He is beyond powerful, smart, and does have a moral compass; just not a traditional one. We get more time with him and his relationship with Gamora and just what his children mean to him compared to the bigger picture. The other villains too, prove to be powerful, even if their not as memorable. It's made up with their overall impression of worship and how a lot of that driven emotion can generate into persuasion.

For a movie with a lot of characters, Avengers Infinity War has a lot of work juggling them. I'd say that one of the bigger flaws is that the editing around that is not done well. It'll spend a good twenty five minutes in space with dazzling effects, but then suddenly cut back to Earth in Africa. While we definitely see the consequences for the heroes, it doesn't give us enough at how the rest of the world would deal with such a threat. Why couldn't have more of the marvel heroes from ABC and Netflix also get involved? I can't blame them for this, but the movie might have benefitted from being longer, making the editing of the longer sequences feel justified.

I'll give this eight Infinity Gauntlets out of ten. I think most Marvel fans will be happy with the movie and the surprises it throws (yep, there are a lot of them here). If your not as well read and haven't seen the other movies, I'd recommend watching the other Avengers, Guardians of the Galaxy and Doctor Strange first. Again, I was happy with everything, given that I wasn't asking for too much. More might have been done to really make this an epic masterpiece like Ben Hur, but for a lot of people, this will be a Marvel to sight.","4"
"merpman-94402","Masterpiece","30 April 2018","Went to see this in 3D IMAX, unfortunately we had some kids behind us that would not shut up and kept kicking our chairs.

Depsite this, we still thought the movie was amazing, but had a nagging feeling we had missed parts somehow.

So, we went back the next day, this time in regular movie theater (though the biggest screen in the area).

Firstly, have to say, 3D IMAX gave nothing to this movie, or any other movie i have seen in 3D IMAX for a while now. Done with 3D.

Secondly, after watching it a second time, i believe this is a masterpiece of cinematic entertainment.

How everything comes together, how the characters are injected into the storyline at perfect moments of introduction, interactions and fight scenes, even the Thanos character development. All just brilliant.

The crowd, was like being at a highly competitive soccer match, everyone screaming and applauding.

"anselmdaniel","Ambitious cross over","21 February 2023","This review contains spoilers.

Avengers: Infinity War is the third movie in the Avengers series and is the culmination of the infinity stone arc that has been hinted at in the previous Marvel cinematic universe movies. This movie explores Thanos in more depth as well as utilizing all characters in the Marvel cinematic universe to resist Thanos' plan. The movie is about the event of the infinity stones being brought together and the heroic response.

Avengers: Infinity War is a visually impressive movie. The movie is filled with dazzling special effects in every scene. The sound is likewise at the high quality as the visuals. There is not a weak part of the audio and visual experience. The movie felt like how the Marvel cinematic universe should feel after all of the movies. Thanos' character design resembles his comic counterpart and he looks as realistic within reason as a giant humanoid alien should look. Likewise, Thanos' children have distinct and great designed that allow the audience to pick them out in a wide frame.

The problems with this movie lie in its story and approach-ability. This entry in the Avengers film series is the least accessible out of all of the Avengers movies. The audience must watch the previous Marvel movies or they will be lost. There is not a single main character or group that is followed in this movie. The only character that is followed consistently with an arc is Thanos. He could be considered the villain protagonist of the story, but he is still not followed as in a classic movie. The movie starts with the cross-overs and anybody that is not familiar with Marvel characters will be lost. Each of the characters maintain their traits in this movie. The guardians of the galaxy have their character when interacting with Thor, Iron Man, Spider-man, and Doctor Strange. The flip-side is also true where the Earth's heroes maintain their personality through the dialogue. The writers should be commended for the writing these cross-overs well. The movie splits the plot into separate threads where the heroes try different methods to defeat Thanos. Ultimately none of it matters because Doctor Strange already knows the only way to win. It was predictable that Thanos would get all of the infinity stones. What was not predictable was seeing which heroes would fade away when Thanos removes half of the universe's population. The movie's end was unique where the movie is not afraid to shock the audience with such a downer ending.

Overall, Avengers: Infinity War is recommended. The movie is highly ambitious and is an interesting movie to watch for its universe. The movie does have some problems and it is highly recommended to watch previous movies before watching this movie.

"rustonreviews","Bombastically ambitious, completely exhilarating and emotional, Infinity War is truly epic.","29 April 2018","Everything about Marvel's latest addition in its sprawling, epic MCU franchise feels overwhelmingly massive. Boasting the largest cast of any Marvel movie yet, a storyline on a colossal scale and a supervillain finally getting his chance to step forth into the limelight, Avengers: Infinity War has much to live up to. Since its genesis in 2008 with Iron Man, the MCU has been thriving for an impressive ten years, continuously expanding and, for better or for worse, birthing the term 'cinematic universe'. Thanos (Josh Brolin) searches high and low across the universe to complete his collection of infinity stones. Once all have been retrieved and inserted into his golden gauntlet, he will be granted world dominating power and become an unstoppable juggernaut of destruction. With so much at stake, the Avengers, along with the Guardians of the Galaxy and various other superheroes including Spider-Man (Tom Holland), Black Panther (Chadwick Boseman) and Doctor Strange (Benedict Cumberbatch), must unite to defeat Thanos before their world is torn apart. As much as I was anticipating Infinity War, I was also anxious due to the sheer weight of it all. Sure, the geeky fanboy in me was psyched to see such an ensemble, but there was still the fear that the film would feel too overcrowded. Thankfully, the Russo brothers pull it off with such grandeur, resulting in one of the very best Marvel films yet.

Firstly, Thanos is without a doubt the best villain this franchise has brought into the fold. Marvel is known for its villain problem, only offering a small handful of memorable antagonists such as Loki (Tom Hiddleston) and Ultron (James Spader), but the Russo's quickly establish Thanos to be the most threatening force to be reckoned with within the films opening ten minutes. Convincing villains are difficult to write, but for all his evil and destructive nature, Thanos is given an emotional depth that is sourly lacking in many villains these days, in both comic books and movies. In many ways, the film feels like it belongs to Thanos himself. As they've already proven in The Winter Soldier (2014) and Civil War (2016), the Russo's know how to present their audience with stellar action sequences, and Infinity War's action is just as brilliant. It's a breathless spectacle to witness, and it never relies too heavily on shaky cam, resulting in clear cut action sequences that never feel strenuous to keep up with.

One of the most notable things about the film is its collision of various voices. Throughout the MCU, multiple directors have made their mark on the franchise. James Gunn's wonderful Guardians of the Galaxy films are known for their colourful, upbeat tempo's and infectious soundtracks, whilst the first two Thor movies are rooted more within the dark fantasy genre, particularly it's sequel. Understanding this, the Russo's manage to incorporate all these unique voices into one movie to ensure every character is portrayed as accurately as possible according to their respective solo outings. Throughout the films heavier moments, the Russo's never forget to incorporate humour into the mix to prevent it being 100% doom and gloom. With so many characters to juggle, there are a handful of heroes who don't get as much screen time as they deserve, and a side mission involving Thor (Hemsworth) isn't as engaging as the rest of the film, yet it never drags the film down completely.

It's difficult to dive too deep into the film without giving away any spoilers. What I will say is that Marvel are finally beginning to take risks with their storytelling. The stakes have never been higher, and Infinity War is without a doubt one the most exhausting and exhilarating chapters in the MCU. Bombastically ambitious, bursting with action and emotion as well as a jaw dropping finale that will leave you feeling somewhat cold, Infinity War is truly spectacular and the perfect film to celebrate ten years of the MCU.","8"

"stefankrs","Overrated and boring as hell","13 September 2021","This movie is seriously bad. The story goes that Thanos wants the gauntlet to snap his fingers. He kills avengers and lots of action oh wow so cool lasers rays guns magic wow so entertaining. It throws a bunch of fighting in and talking thats about it with a story not even that good. Its a bad movie and very overrated only made for troglodytes who only watch movies to see action.","9"
"ojvhakkinen","Remarkable achievement that deserves all the praise and its 2 billion worldwide box office.","13 September 2018","This holds up incredibly well upon a rewatch. Now I can safely say that this IS my favorite MCU film and nothing can change my mind (before Avengers 4 arrives, of course).

It's not perfect, but who expected that. The fact that they pulled this off and made it one of the greatest comic book movies ever, is an achievement worthy of an Oscar. Okay its pacing is a bit unstable at times, and sometimes no gap to breath even a little is left between funny and dramatic moments. That's why I actually would have liked this to be even longer. But I don't care because the rest of it kicks ass anyway.

It fixes almost all the major gripes I've had with some of the previous Marvel movies. Generic and bland music? Alan Silvestri's soundtrack is a killer. Pretty unremarkable visuals? Seeing it in a theatre was some of the most stunning ones I've attended (sure it's not Blade Runner 2049, but no other film can look that good). It has landscapes and locations that left me astounded. CGI was 95% of the time top-notch. ALL of the actors in this possibly the biggest movie cast ever do fantastic job. And the villain? The villain was the best thing in the movie. He sees himself as a hero of his own story, and you kind of get why he does what he does. His plan is obviously wrong and flawed, but that's why he is the villain. Thanos does appear as a sort of protagonist in Infinity War, it starts with him and ends with him. It's his story. Some describe Avengers 3 as a half of a movie, but it's not quite true. In Thanos' point of view it tells a whole story. In heroes' point of view, sure it's a cliffhanger and Avengers 4 is on its way.

Because of the solid work done for this universe this does not need to flesh out characters as we already know them. Nevertheless, this is still filled with character moments that deepens them even more. Almost all the time it was a perfect blend of dark and light even though it's mostly dark. And the ending, oh gosh the ending. Before you start whinging me how it was a cheap gimmick, let me tell you something, it doesn't freaking matter. They had balls to end it this way, they left us hanging for a whole year. And I know Avengers 4 will somehow surprise us (again), because Kevin Feige has shown love and commitment for this whole universe and he won't let us down. This managed to be both surprising and satisfying at the same time. I really think it was the film Star Wars: The Last Jedi should have been (not saying that Last Jedi is bad). All hail Lord Feige!

Avengers: Infinity War is one hell of an experience filled with moments I will never forget, worth the 10 years in the making, and if you 10 years ago told this little kid, that this kind of movie will exist in the future, I probably would think you as a kind of crazy person. It's an achievement that this was made to happen, it will leave it's mark in film history at some form, you just have to accept it.","4"

The Russo's easily could've made a 4th avengers movie while not reversing the events of infinity war.

"s6655m","I felt lied to...","27 April 2018","***SMALL SPOILER***

I wasn't that impressed to be honest. The build-up for this movie was over the top, yet it failed to deliver. After making so many movies, each better than the one before it (ok, maybe not Ironman 2), I was expecting this movie to blow me away. Yet I felt cheated and lied to.

After months of questions about Hawkeye's whereabouts, we were told that he had a very special part to play, that by including him on the posters would give away plot points. However, the only thing we get is a passing comment about his and Scott Lang's location. Why not be upfront? Why lie?

In addition, cast members made numerous comments about how ""full"" the list of characters was...anyone and everyone was going to be in the movie. I didn't know that meant counting extras, craft services, and production staff.

How do you get out of having dead characters, the ones that have movies coming in the near future? To me, Marvel just jumped the shark. I won't be seeing the next one.","1"
"kyle-86387","When will these end?","8 May 2018","It's not a horrible movie but I don't get the point of super hero fight scenes anymore, they are just a distraction. It was kind of ridiculous Dr Strange handing over his stone at the end but at the same time it's like 'whatever, you'll get the stone anyways'. I wish the battles would have taken place in heavily populated areas so that the aimless fighting would have destroyed cities and populations.

No super heros really seem to have very unique of powers or skills anymore as well, at least none that really make a tactical advantage.

Guardians of the Galaxy were the best part (and probably Thor even though he was even more ridiculous) where they have at least some personality but in the end they were brought into the world of silly super hero battles.","1"

"jordansanders-92728","Avengers: Infinity War (2018) - Quantity, Not Quality","13 October 2018","Well, here it is, what the MCU has been building towards, a showdown of epic proportions and a gathering of (most) of the numerous superheroes we've been subjected to mercilessly over recent years. So the big question is, was it worth the wait? To put it bluntly, no, it wasn't.

No doubt Marvel fanboys (and girls) will go crazy for 'Infinity War' and regardless of the quality of the film itself, it is going to be loved and lauded by the franchise's enthusiasts simply for the privilege to see all of their beloved characters together in one place. Unfortunately the enthusiasm of the fans does not seem to have reached the actors themselves, who now appear to have reached the point where they've realised that the film is going to be a commercial, and to a degree, critical success, no matter how well (or poorly) they perform. So, consequently, they don't really bother to put in much effort. And why should they? Their sizeable paychecks are already guaranteed just by showing up. So, just showing up is what they choose to do. After all, let's face it, unlike the devoted audiences that continue to spend their hard-earned cash to go and see these films, they're in it for the money, not for their love of the source material.

The lead actors universally deliver not only the worst performances of their MCU careers, but in some cases (Mr. Downey Jr., I'm looking at you), arguably the worst performances of their entire cinematic careers. Content to just coast through proceedings without a shred of genuine emotion or charisma, they seem to be merely fulfilling the terms of their contracts, as opposed to what you'd call 'acting'. And these are not bad actors, by any stretch of the imagination, almost each and every member of the ensemble cast have proven they are capable of delivering outstanding performances (Chris Pratt and Tom Holland not included) in their other filmic endeavours. So it has to be said that their devoted followers deserve better. The one shining light in all of this is, ironically, the film's chief villain (or hero, depending on your viewpoint, but I'm not going to get into that now), 'Thanos', portrayed brilliantly by Josh Brolin, who seems to be the only actor that's aware he is in fact in a very, very big film and not some frivolous dress rehearsal. Maybe, as a newcomer to the franchise, in his excitement to be a part of the biggest cinematic universe of all time, he was determined to deliver an outstanding performance worthy of the Marvel name, or maybe he's simply the only one who cares enough to try. Either way, it's extremely hard to find anything to criticise him about personally. Well done, Mr. Brolin.

Now, the reason I've been so critical in my lambasting of the acting in this film, is because of how important is is to the outcome of the end product. This is supposed to be a genuinely emotional, moving cinematic experience, which if you can suspend disbelief enough, is not out of the realms of possibility. But when the characters appear to be completely indifferent to the events unfolding around them, it's very hard to empathise with them, much less care about what happens to them. Without giving to much away, as many of you will know, it's in this film that we have to say goodbye (at least temporarily) to some of the saga's most beloved characters, I won't spoil anything by stating who these may be, but I will say that it's very unlikely that you're going shed a tear over, or indeed, give a damn about any one of them.

As for the plot, well obviously it's no 'Citizen Kane', but it's far from boring either, however the generic action sequences, though typically spectacular in their visual effects, can begin to border on tedious at times.

I know i'm not alone when I saw enough is enough. This exercise in escapism has been enjoyable enough at times, but it has now run it's course. I'd love to believe that after the next instalment of the Avengers, this whole MCU fiasco can finally draw to a close, however, I've got a sneaky suspicion that the powers that be will still manage to drag this out for at least the next few years, if not the next decade. But, as a passionate film fan, i'm now going to try to avoid these movies as best as i can and stick to more intelligent, adult-orientated and, for lack of a better word: 'real' cinema. 4/10","9"
"satin-48250","Far and away, the best Avengers movie","10 July 2021","I don't like the Avengers. Captain America is a pain in the neck and the actor is just bad. The first Iron Man was good but the sequels were embarrassing.

Apart from Iron Man and the 2 Guardians of the Galaxy, the MCU movies are just boring imo. I don't count the Deadpool movies in the MCU (they're Ryan Reynolds movies! ^^).

And apart from Infinity War. Not for the heroes. They aren't really better or more interesting. But Thanos is the first interesting character created by that franchise. Really good!

Since it's still MCU, they justed wasted their best creation in Endgame which was so disappointing, again imo.

But Infinity War is very good.","7"
"SebMoz","Quite unorthodox, and amazing because of that","26 December 2020","When I went into this movie I had already heard the praise, so naturally I had high expectations. With that in mind, it's even more impressive how much I ended up liking this movie. Marvel really suprised me with the direction they went with this story. I expected a boring villain, a few cool CGI-infested fightscenes and an epic final showdown where all the heroes gather, but this movie went in a completely different direction with almost every aspect. The visuals and score are obviously good, but nothing groundbreaking, as per usual, and the plot is really simple: A bunch of people try to stop an overpowered alien from obtaining the ultimate power, nothing special there. The pacing is solid though, and even though the plot isn't super interesting, it's still passable, and is made even better by this movie's greatest strength; the characters. This movie incorporates almost every single character previously seen into the movie, and makes it work by not really having any filler. The conversations are simple yet engaging, the characters are, as always, well-defined and entertaining. The movie juggles its different tones very effectively, it has both great comedy and some of the strongest emotional moments in the entire franchise. The biggest suprise of this movie however, is its villain. MCU villains has been bad more often than not, so it was incredibly satisfying to finally get a villain that is truly fenomenal. Thanos is by far the best villain Marvel has ever created, and a lot of that is thanks to the human attributes he has. Despite being a giant space-monster, he doesn't feel comical at all. He feels threatening, and while his goal is simple, his motivation makes sense, and it's fascinating to watch him talk about how he is right in doing all these evil things. He also has a strong emotional core, which is showcased the clearest in his conversations with Gamora. The movie also has a very unexpected ending, which caught me completely off-guard, and frustrated me a lot, but in a good way. All this, combined with the usual great performances and comedy we've gotten used to seeing from Marvel, makes for one of the best superhero movies released this decade.","8"
"wellthatswhatithinkanyway","Works if you just try and enjoy it as one long visual spectacle, without looking at anything else","6 May 2018","STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning

The mighty, evil Thanos (Josh Brolin) is in need of one more 'infinity stone' to place on his giant glove in order to control the universe. In New York, Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) is approached by Doctor Strange (Benedict Cumberbatch) and his ally Bruce Banner (Mark Ruffalo) in order that they reunite to battle him, and gets treated to a big demonstration of his powers in a massive city battle, during which young buck Peter Parker (Tom Holland) makes his presence known as his Spider-Man alter ego. As the old gang reunite, they cross paths with Skylord (Chris Pratt) and his gang...

After an endless stream of singular Marvel universe entries where individual characters have faced their battles and revealed their back stories, directors The Russo Brothers have here decided the next logical step is to create a big, all out spectacle of a film, where the stand alone characters meet up with the Guardians of the Galaxy characters, and combine their powers to take down an epic super villain. It's no doubt something the die hard fans of the series will have been looking forward to, and will have been on the cards for a while given the huge box office takings. But, while it's as big a visual splendour as all the others, in the end it sadly works best only on a superficial level.

The central plot is paper thin, and not nearly strong enough to sustain a movie of its length and scope. Not only that, it's also overly reliant on the viewer having an extensive knowledge of all the previous films, rendering it a benign mystery to anyone who's casually chosen to see it. The original Avengers Assemble film (now unbelievably over five years old!) managed to get all the featured characters to gel together well, but this seems over eager to examine all the characters back story and relationships with others, and all together here, there's too much to take in, in a plot that goes nowhere and drags on for far too long.

Overlong, overblown and over-ambitious, this will end up over-whelming even the most ardent Marvel fan. It just about manages to succeed by being as colourful and visually exciting as all the rest, with dazzling special effects and thrill a minute action sequences. But this, sadly, is pretty much the best it has to offer. ***","3"
"Badmoviessuck","Should have gone for the head","27 April 2019","Avengers infinity war is great. I will keep it short cause the reasons why I like this movie people have already said in a better way than I could ever do

CHARACTERS Thanos is the best villain in the entire MCU and a great protagonist. We can understand his goal for wanting to whipe out half of the people In this galaxy and there is alot of sacrifice conflict and sympathy for what he is doing to achieve this goal which makes his motivation more personal. He kills Gamora so that he could succeed in his goal to get an infinity stone and that makes him suffer. His planet got destroyed cause of over population and Gamoras planet became great because of Thanos whipping out half of the people in that planet and that makes us understand Thanos even more. If he could have saved people by killing half of the population in that planet why can't he do the same everywhere else? And that's what makes his motivation so great. Understandable but flawed. He could have also used his mighty power (I.e. when he gets all the infinity stones) to give resources to people so there was no need to kill of half of the people in the galaxy but because he is a flawed person he dosent see that (and his character gets better in endgame) he is an imperfect character with great development depth and arc and the fact that he won makes the movie even better when you see the last scene of him in his farm.

OTHER STUFF The structure was really good and everyone acted in character and I think Peter Quill and Tony stark were the best characters of the heroes who were fighting Thanos. Peter Quill being emotional over the conflict of Gamora and that makes him act irrational. And Tony stark dealing Great consequences for what he has done (and it gets better in endgame) And the action is really amazing specially in the Titan fighting scene were every thing was so well choreographed. this movie is one of the best MCU movies.

VERDICT This movie is really good.","8"
"Derek117","Downer","4 August 2018","I have the feeling that the makers of this film wanted it to be ""The Empire Strikes Back"" of the MCU. Without speaking to any story details, I'll say that from the very opening scene until the final shot of the film (and the post-credits preview scene) it's a ""downer.""

So, if you're the type of movie-goer who feels entertained by emotional downers, then you'll enjoy this film. My guess, however, is that most people who go to a Marvel film expect action AND a ""feel good"" at the end. That's not this film.

Wow! It took 10 years to get the setup for this movie. I had been waiting for the Infinity War for so long. I just have to say that it was amazing and definitely worth the wait! As most of you know, the movie is about almost literally everyone in the MCU teaming together to fight Thanos so he doesn't collect all of the Infinity Stones and destroy half of the universe. I'm not going to talk much about anyone else but Thanos since everybody did superb and knows about their character. Josh Brolin as the lead villain was amazing. He is the best Marvel villain ever made. Thanos has a good reason for what he's doing rather than other villains that are bad and beat up guys. The film delved deep into his mind so we can understand him. We love him so much but as a villain we hate what he does. Every time Thanos is on the screen we can all feel tension and fear. We're not like ""Oh he's here to do something bad."" It's like we panic a little because we don't know what he'll do and we're scared for what he's going to do. Thanos also has emotion and he isn't just a tough guy. That's all I'm going to say about him. The heroes were all great. It's not like the other Avengers movies where they team up to stop a bad person. They're teaming up in desperation because they don't know how they should approach the problem. They know if they don't stop him, basically everyone will die. It was a very serious and darker movie for the MCU. There were some greatly timed jokes, like usual, so we could breathe rather than hold our breath praying for a miracle to happen. Now on to the technical stuff. The effects for the movie were fantastic. Most of the movie relied on them. There were a minimal amount of times where you could tell it was fake, but I don't consider that a flaw. The cinematography was pretty good too. For an action movie there wasn't too much shaky cam but more on wide shots. The Russo Brothers did amazing with directing, as they did with Captain America: The Winter Soldier and Civil War. They understood all of the characters and motives. The movie did jump around a lot which some people didn't like but there was a lot happening so it was necessary. I had no flaws with this movie. It was absolutely amazing and had everything that a Marvel movie should have. I would definitely see it. You will not be disappointed in how great it is. My Grade: A+

"ayoreinf","An epic failure at script writing, kills a would be great film","2 May 2018","Let me start by saying that no superhero movie is supposed to be realistic. We all know that. Still, script writers, and comic books writers too struggle, to make the story feel as if it was real, otherwise, none would relate to the story. In order to get this real feeling, the emotional base of the story is crucial, the character development must be first class, if these two work, we've got a film we can emphathize with, we might even forget the entire premise is unreal. But very often the writers don't trust their own ability. Sometimes they feel the whole story is so farfetched they have to go an extra mile to make it more real. That's when things start going wrong. That's where it went wrong for this movie. I never expected a real life drama, if that was what I wanted I wouldn't be watching this movie to begin with.

It's very hard to explain my point precisely without spoilers, and I don't do spoilers. So what can I say. I can say that by the movie's end we're left with two choices, both steming from a desire to make the story feel more real, maybe to surprise us more than we usually get surprised in movies we came to know so well. Any which way, the two options we're left with are either, the entire movie will be reversed in the next installment. Which means that the whole Infinity War was a teaser for the next MCU installment. Or the entire MCU is getting a reboot.

I hate both options. And it's a great shame, because otherwise we had a perfectly good installment in the MCU. With the great sense of humor we all know and love. With great acting performances (Josh Brolin is really superb, making Thanos one of the greatest villains we ever saw), wonderful cinematography and CGI and everything else we come to expect of the MCU. If everybody loves it so much, why do we need to reboot it, when it's still going so very well. Or else why would you waste an entire installment as a teaser for the next one. We already know all the installments are connected to each other, we all wait for the post credits scenes, no matter how long we have to sit in the dark. So why did we need this silly concoction. It didn't make it feel more real, it made me feel frustrated and even angry because whatever option will come into being in the future I'll still think this one was a waste of my time and everybody else's.","9"

I've read the comics, so I knew what to expect, though I don't recall Guardians of the Galaxy characters in the original story. A lot of great action and surprisingly a lot of comedy still too! Spiderman had the best lines! A very good villain and overall super fun, yet darker movie. Not quite DC level dark, but emotionally I suppose. I did feel close to tears at one point actually, but it's because I've grown very attached to these characters. Of course it ended with a big cliff hanger to be continued next year, but I knew that going in.","8"
"Rob_Lee_W","Over a year later, Infinity War continues to impress","9 May 2019","I had almost no expectations for Infinity War when I entered the theater chamber to see it last year. It was several weeks after the movie's initial release so the theater itself was fairly light on visitors for Infinity War in particular. I was pretty much alone through my experience of the movie. For context, I have only a surface level knowledge of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. I have seen quite a bit of the older movies but only know most of the more recent characters through friends and online reviewers and the like. So, as a normie without any great attachment to most of the prior films, you can imagine my surprise when this movie becomes one of my favorite superhero movies ever made.

Much like the finale to the X-Men Cinematic Universe from a year before, Logan, Infinity War blows all expectations out of the water and provides an experience that stands above all of the prior films in its respective universe. But whereas Logan does this by providing a small-scale character study, Infinity War outdoes its predecessors by going bigger than ever before. A bigger cast, bigger fight scenes, and a wayyyyy bigger budget.

Understand me when I say that I am not a big fan of superhero movies, not even most of the Marvel ones aside from Guardians of the Galaxy, Thor: Ragnarok, and maybe the original Iron Man. But the culmination of all these stories really is greater than the sum of its parts. I believe a big part of this is because the directors and writers took several loathed superhero tropes (giant CG fight scenes, scary alien villain, the MacGuffin) and did them well. This movie, to me, is a shining example that the only thing keeping a trope from being good is how much effort you're willing to put in.

As this movie and Avengers: Endgame are the ultimate finale to the ""Infinity Saga"" of the MCU, almost all major characters introduced in the past movies are featured here. You have the original five Avengers (excluding Hawkeye), Doctor Strange, Spider-Man, Black Panther, the Guardians of the Galaxy, War Machine, Scarlet Witch, etc. All in all, the movie has around 20 major protagonists to juggle. This sounds like it would be an absolute trainwreck if it weren't for the fact that the film dodges two of the biggest problems that Marvel movies tend to suffer from: bland scripts and meandering pace. The dialogue is solid, the story itself is interesting with plenty of unexpected turns, and every scene of the film pushes the story forward. If you want to see a great example of how to fail at these, I'd recommend the Antman movies.

All of this, however, would only amount to an alright movie if it weren't for the main antagonist, Thanos. In a cinematic universe filled with simplistic, uninteresting villains (with exceptions like Loki and the Winter Soldier), Thanos breaks the mold by being an intriguing, quotable, and identifiable villain. Despite being a warmongering space tyrant, Thanos has one of the most altruistic motivations for his evil doings; Thanos wants to destroy half of life in the universe to keep them from depleting the universe's finite resources and plunging into squalor. At first, he attempts this by manually traveling through space and slaughtering half of every intelligent species he finds. At some point, he realizes that his initial will never work and decides to track down the Infinity Stones, five gems that can manipulate the universe to the user's whim. With those stones, Thanos could peacefully and instantly erase half of all life in the universe with the snap of his fingers. Much of the fun of this movie is watching Thanos and his minions hop from place to place, interacting with the many different heroes and collecting the stones. The interactions with Ebony Maw are some of my favorites.

Another plus for the story is how it breaks from the formula and features the MCU cast losing to Thanos and many of them dying in the resulting universal mass killing. It adds much needed emotional weight to the movie since you don't know who could be next. It also helps that most characters dying or reacting to the deaths are effective in conveying genuine emotion. As memey as it is, the final scenes where characters just fade into leaves gives me chills. Shoutout to Drax, Bucky, Scarlet Witch, and Spider-Man for making me really uncomfortable.

All of these positives are held up even further with excellent production value. Visually, almost all of the settings are incredible. I have to give a special shoutout to the scenes in space as they are particularly beautiful. Most of the settings on Earth are nice, too, excluding Wakanda which looks so washed out compared to the rest of the movie. Wakanda is also the location of the weakest fight scene in the movie. In a movie filled with great fight scenes, it's not that bad, but it's the only one that features two giant armies of nameless characters clashing with one another. I prefer the fight scenes featuring prominent and important characters because that leaves more room for fun interaction with dialogue and choreography. Despite my complaints, I still overall enjoyed Wakanda in general and these quibbles should only show how much I love the rest of the movie. The fight scenes have a nice ramp-up, starting small and crescendoing to interplanetary mayhem; most of the humor works other than a few weird outliers like the Starbucks joke from one of the Wakanda scenes; the music is surprisingly nice here, with the orchestral pieces feeling more prominent and characterized than the more generic scores from past Marvel films.

Before I leave, I can't help but shout out the CGI team on their work here. This move has some of the best CGI in a live action movie I have ever seen. I don't just mean to say that looks advanced and expensive (even though it does), but rather that the models are well-integrated into scenes and they're stylized to age much better than contemporary renders. It honestly boggles my mind that the company that funded this is also funding the movie where Will Smith genie looks like an Adobe After Effects edit. The character design and animation of Thanos, along with the great performance by Josh Brolin, carries the character (and by extension, the movie) and saves him from being a laughing stock like most other CG superhero villains *cough Steppenwolf cough*.

To put it simply, there isn't a single thing that Infinity War does wrong. Pacing, action scenes, CGI, dialogue, art direction, comedy, drama ... While it isn't high art and won't satisfy someone with a palette that goes against Marvel movies even when they're good, I'd say that almost anyone other than those that are expressly against superhero movies will find something to remember and appreciate this movie for. For me, it's just about everything the movie does and the occasional slip-up every few scenes is nowhere near enough to put me off of rewatching it.","8"
"xiaoli7377","Great Popcorn Fun","30 December 2022","Do you remember crossover episodes on TV shows? You got a mix of both shows that were crossing over but never quite the magic and strength that those shows had when they were independent of each other. That's kind of how I feel about ""Avengers"" movies. It's great to see all of the heroes team up and kick butt, but at the same time you never quite get some of the great character moments that you do in their solo films as they all struggle and fight for screen time. The fights with Thanos (Josh Brolin) are awesome, love the cliffhanger. Some of the CGI honestly doesn't look too great though. Something about the fact that Marvel Studios has to pump out three or four of these a year.

I don't know, it was a big cultural milestone when it came out, but looking back in hindsight it really seems like one of those ""you just kind of had to be there"" type of movies to really grasp what it meant to people a few years ago. Without the context of the preceding twenty or so films, a lot of it gets lost on its own as a standalone movie. And unless you already watched those movies, this one really is nothing more than a big waste of time.","2"

"pkneer","One of the Best Marvel Movies","28 April 2018","Went in seeing the high ratings, but didn't put too much credence in that because Black Panther got 9+ reviews and I thought it was mediocre at best.

I want to keep this review simple so that people who have not seen the film will not get any spoilers.

This film is not perfect, but it did a very nice job of blending so many characters and giving each one a moment in the lead. Plus the script was pretty good, with some laugh out loud moments.

Thanos is by far one of the best villains in the MCU. He expresses himself well, you get to know his history and actually shows some feelings. Not many films do that very well.

Bottom line - if you liked the first Ironman, the first Guardians, Avengers, and Thor: Ragnarok, then you will like this film. I would recommend that you need to have seen many of the previous MCU films to get a good sense of the interactions between the characters.

This is the pure definition of a great popcorn movie. Not an Oscar winning film for acting, but it is immensely entertaining.","10"

Doctor strange may have said it wrong when he said ""1"" of the 16,000,665 outcomes were where the avengers would win.

2nd outcome: Peter quill screws up when Thanos was restrained under mind control and about to lose the infinity gautlet, dr. strange should have seen that coming if he looked into all the outcomes and teleported peter out of the situation, problem solved!

3rd outcome: Thanos pretty much always closed his hand when using the infinity stones, except for 1 time with the power stone. Couldn't doctor strange have created a portal when stark locked thanos's hand open?, then thanos might not be able to use the space stone and closing the portal would make thanos lose his hand.

"user-714-692831","True meaning of epicness","17 August 2018","This movie is perhaps the most anticipated movie of the year, maybe even of all time. So naturally, I went in the theater with really high expectations. With that, comes the fear that the movie won't live up to its hype. However, Infinity War manages to keep me on the edge of my seat from the beginning to end. With recent Marvel installments being rather stale, the addition of the Russo brothers really took Marvel in the right direction. For the first time, you can really feel the struggles and despair from our favorite heroes. The overall theme and tone are more mature than ever before. Great move from Marvel to keep audiences engaged. Infinity War is, in my opinion, the best marvel movie up to date.","10"
"Sahl_95","Lives up to the hype!","27 April 2018","This was truly spectacular!! A lot more (excellent) humor than I perhaps expected, although it lessens when it goes down for some great emotional moments. And A LOT of shit goes down. the action set pieces are amazing and a lot of fun to watch.

Thanos is also easily up there as one of the best and most menacing villains seen so far. I loved what they did with Peter Dinklage!

That said, I can easily imagine the movie being hard to follow for those not well versed with the MCU, however, I think they do a pretty good job switching between the different groups.

I'll definitely be rewatching this in the near future.","6"
"caseythurman","A fun blockbuster with not much more to it","25 April 2018","Avengers Infinity War is probably one of the most anticipated movies of all time. With that being said it's no surprise that this film has so much weight riding on its shoulders. It seems that the biggest question most have is, Is it good? And the answer is yes, it's a pretty good film but it's not the best.

First off with the good stuff. The characters are done very well, and most are given a time to shine. The Russo Brothers also do a very good job with the action, like Snyder levels of awesomeness. And it's ending is one of the best in the MCU.

Now with some of the bad stuff. The sad thing is that for everything the movie does right there's something done wrong. For example, there's no substance to the film, there's nothing more to it than action. It's feels like a Micheal Bay movie at points. And the sub villains are extremely underused, there's so much promise to them but the movie hardly ever gives them a chance to shine.

Is it the movie to end all movies, no. But in the end it's not a deep character study like The Dark knight nor is it as good. It's not as funny as past films and sometimes the continuity of the characters is sometimes confusing. But it's a fun blockbuster with not much more to it.","7"
"KissMyAss31193","""Opinions are like..","23 May 2018","..subjective."" Would be the obvious answer. Looking through the review section I hardly see any numbers between 1 and 10. So let me get my armchair and psychoanalyze this real quick. Some people love to love, some people love to hate. My rating would be 72 out of 100 by the way. I admittedly enjoy the MCU as it has thus far served me with some unpretentious colorful entertainment and some neat characters. They treat these characters respectfully and fairly uncompromising throughout various different writers, directors and styles. It's a unique enterprise that is usually quite enjoyable. But are any of those movies actually worthy of a 10 out of 10 based on a scale that includes all films ever made. Absolutely not! Would most film buffs resent my 8 out of 10 rating. Definitely! But opinions really are quite subjective and I rate movies based on competence and entertainment value. The latter of which is where all the guilty pleasures fit in. I was damn surprised that this movie didn't turn out a cluster. It really should have, considering it's large cast and insane plot. But it feels very well paced for the most part and flows pretty well. And the big climax of the movie feels actually climactic within the entire MCU. Marvel Fans won't be disappointed. I know I wasn't. And I'm not a fan of anything. Because fandom is for babies.","7"
"d-48544","Infinity War","22 July 2020","In fact, the main character isn't any one of our superheroes at all, but Thanos. But the movie isn't told from Thanos' point of view. Instead, Infinity War does an excellent job of explaining why thisbad guy wants to have all of the Infinity Stones. Make no mistake, he's still the enemy. However, Infinity War does such a good job that at a few parts you nod alongand say to yourself, ""OK Thanos, now I know why you want to do this."" The biggest surprise about Infinity War is how well the movie flows together. At no point is the film at all confusing. Weunderstand who is fighting whom, and what the risks and rewards are for each fight. It's not overcrowded, like one might believe, even with so many heroes involved. Science fiction author Douglas Adams's once wrote, ""Space is big. You just won't believe how vastly, hugely ... big itis. I mean, you may think it's a long way down the road to the chemist's , but that's just peanuts to space."" Replace the word""space"" with""Avengers: Infinity War"", and you have a reasonable idea of the scope of this movie -in terms of cast, complexity, and box office revenue. Indeed, it's both big and ambitious.","1"

I did have doubts whether it would still be possible to make an interesting Marvel movie since the theme has been ""rather"" popular. But some of the Marvel flicks were actually really great. So I was ready to believe the reviews, maybe this one would be good as well.

"ToddeyD","Utterly Amazing.","29 April 2018","So here it is, Avengers: Infinity War. After 10 years of waiting, or 6 if you count from his first appearance in Avengers Assemble, Thanos has finally arrived. All I can say is that the wait was worth it.

Firstly, the story lines are extremely well balanced. I could not imagine the difficulty of the task attempting to fit enough screen time for the likes of Thor, Star Lord and Iron Man into a singular film, however, the Russo brothers have managed to do so. They also managed to combine the 'right' characters in order to play off of one another. The snidey in love with themselves combination of Dr Strange and Tony Stark, to the humor and whit of Thor and the Guardians of the Galaxy. They all blended and worked so well together.

Secondly the CGI is quite possibly the best I have ever witnessed. Josh Brolins portrayal of Thanos shines through in so many way, not just his dark and gritty vocal work, but also the ability to show every single facial movement. Outstanding work from the graphics department for that one,

Thirdly, the tone set from the beginning of the film. It immediately shows the power and devastation Thanos is capable of, and the audience never feel a sense of safety for any of the heroes again.

Finally, and least surprising, is the action sequences. These action scenes have you on the edge of your seat from the get go. The heroes working with one another to try and take down Thanos and his 'lackeys' is some of the most compelling sequences I have ever witnessed. All of this action followed by a breathtaking soundtrack from Alan Silvestri.

The only negative thing I can say about the movie is that it is going to cost me a lot of money going to re-watch it time and time again.

Well done the Russo Brothers.","1"

I have a hard time deciding if this movie wants to be taken seriously or just taken as an action comedy. Peter Dinklage cast as a giant? Thor referring to a raccoon as a rabbit throughout the movie? It's so obvious that every "" death"" will be reversed via time travel in the sequel that there is no real emotional connection to the "" dead"" characters.

-PERFECT, (INFINITE) CHARACTERS Every character is fully developed. Every character, who was build up until now, carries more weight in this movie. The communication between our favourite characters is displayed in a special way.

-PERFECT CGI I really liked the CGI. The CGI was better used than in other superhero movies today. Thanos really looked like a realistic alien. Even though some people called his animation low-budget, i think that Thanos looks great.

-A PERFECT VILLAIN This is the best villain ever in a Marvel Cinematic Universe-Movie ever. He has great motivations. He does not just want to eliminate people, because he wants to. He has reasons behind this. Of course, he is radical and has a wrong view on things, but there were some moments, where i empathized with him.

-PERFECT, ENTERTAINING STORYLINE Every little bit of this movie is entertaining. You can watch it more than a thousand times and you can not get bored.

"trelerke-politics","much better than could be hoped, boffo ending!","30 April 2018","Who would have thunk it? This beast is complex, mostly well written and mostly well directed (some of the action scenes were a mess, per usual CGI hijinks). It starts fast, there is a battle scene with lots of dead and dying but they're not your typical soldiers, these are Asgard's finest, including Thor and Loki. World killing Thanos casually picks up one dying soldier and brings him to stage center, it's Thor........and we're on our way, there is an inevitability here that matches, for the most part, the scale of what is being presented - the killing of 50% of all sentient creatures in.........the universe. There is a quest, but depending on your POV, it's not necessarily a noble quest. A great coalition is brought together to battle Thanos and it's mostly not the cheesy typical ""the gangs all here"" Marvel cluster f__K, this is a big war and everyone is needed, even the guardians of the galaxy and their insipid banter, really out of place in this movie, as was the main guardian's move when they were about to stop Thanos, super mechanically maladroit ""solution, again, the scale of the movie's intent was far beyond this hamfisted scene. This is quibbling though, the pathos embedded in this movie allowed it to achieve escape velocity, Thanos is not Sauron, he as a soul, he has deep feelings for what he does, he sacrifices that which he loves the most for what he believes are noble motives (that's the main problem with people, we all got our reasons). And Thanos most astounding of all, ""wins"", he get's all the infinity stones and 50% of the Universe's citizens simply turn into ash including many of the superheroes.....that was something I did not expect, so not the typical US blockbuster..........most of the apparent good guys die and the villain wins, resting in the long sunset, enjoying the fruits of his efforts.

Movie: Marvel: Avengers Infinity War Directors: Anthony Russo, Joe Russo Writers: Christopher Markus (screenplay by), Stephen McFeely Stars: Robert Downey Jr., Chris Hemsworth, Mark Ruffalo

LIKES:

Character Development: It's always nice to see character evolve and while the 18 installments before this movie have laid strong foundations, Infinity continues that trend. Not everyone gets the full red-carpet treatment (with all the characters at hand), but those that do have some deeper trenches we did not expect. You'll certainly feel things resonate if you've been following the story so far and a fantastic means to tie you into the story.

Story Twists: We all have theories about this movie, most centered on who would survive the war for the Infinity Stones. Despite everything foreshadowed in the trailers, you have no idea what is coming. Infinity Wars is a universe filled with twists, throwing in suspenseful moments with ease and doing everything to keep you on the edge of your seat. The trailers were certainly edited to leave out key details, and that mystery was very well appreciated as the revelations began to drop and the story began to click, up until the very end. Be ready for some answers to lingering questions you may not have realized you have, and some surprises that will have you cheering in delight and excitement.

Acting: A small quality to comment on, and way too many actors to hit up in detail, the acting still lives up to the potential we had set up. All the contenders easily reprise their roles, bringing delight, fun, heroism and heart wrenching moments to life with no hesitation. Mixing the team together, really did feel like an awkward, weird family trying to save the galaxy one minute at a time. Despite all the characters crammed into this mega hit, the chemistry works fantastically.

Comedy: Marvel's writing continues to lean towards the comedic stick, trying to garnish the comic plots in a more expansive way to net more audience members in the box office. Infinity War has plenty of moments mashed into the space epic adventure, a mixture of slapstick, insults, well-timed cursing, and comical references that keep the giggles, guffaws, and laughter coming. Don't worry of the darker atmosphere overshadowing the laughs, there will be plenty to try and keep things as bright as possible.

Action, somewhat: The special effects are hands down impressive, especially seeing the stones powers better utilized than just exploding like previous films. All the sound editing and CGI are worthy of the theater spectacle, perhaps the biggest reason to come see in the theater. Infinity War has some decent brawls that deliver the fist pumping, adrenaline rush you wanted to see as new tricks are unleashed and styles mix together. Especially near the end, there is one particular fight that feels much like an epic video game battle with all the bells and whistles ringing into one. A little eccentric at times, but hey it is a comic book movie.

DISLIKES:

Lulls in Action: While there is good storytelling in this movie, an Avengers movie is known more for the fast pace and battles. There are some major lulls in the action, as the three-story trails attempt to connect all the pieces in the quest for uncovering the stones. These gaps are by far entertaining, but at times I felt another battle needed to be integrated, or others extended to keep the pace going. I liked the emotional warfare in this movie, but come on, a little more resistance.

The Black Order: This is only a semi-dislike, but Thanos elite guards were not as ""elite"" as I had expected. Gross and creepy looking, definitely. Deadly and threatening in design? Absolutely. But in regards to their skills, these masters of destruction were kind of... weak and under developed. It doesn't mean they don't get their 15 minutes to shine, but let's just say these characters really needed more integration in the story for this reviewer to enjoy.

Too Many Characters?: So many people mixed into one movie, brings with it the threat of potentially denying your favorite character the time you want him/her to hold. It happens in this movie, so take what you can get and run with it as best as you can. They do a nice job with most of them, but three of the characters got a bit stiff armed that I wasn't expecting to see. So, this element could have been tweaked to get a better immersive story in my opinion.

The Ending: I can't say much about this, but the ending to Infinity War is almost as mixed as the characters in this galactic quest. There will be many questions generated from it and even more theories as to how the next wave will proceed, which I guess is good to keep interest coming. However, it kind of felt cheaply delivered and rushed over, in a manner that was sort of a cop out to be honest. Based on that last sentence, this component is why the ending was not as well-received, not for the questions it generated.

The Fight at Wakanda: The biggest selling point of the trailers was that war on the Wakandan plains, where Wakanda soldiers join the elite squad to fight thousands of CGI aliens. With all the storytelling elements building up to the climax, I had very high hopes this battle was going to be the climactic piece to bring it all together. I'll admit, there are some parts that are true creative genius, but much of the battle was glazed over, dull, and missing so much of the battle chemistry I had expected. Quick finishes to semi-suspenseful moments, and much shorter than I anticipated, this battle was certainly the element I was most disappointed with.

The VERDICT:

Infinity Wars didn't quite live up to the hype that the marketing brought with it, but this does not mean it was a bad movie. A very edgy tale awaits the theaters, with twists and character development waiting to evolve our characters to the next level, with a few flashy battles to liven things up and comedy to ease the tension. Yet, this project may have been a little too big to tackle, leading to many things being glazed over in trade for others. Try to lower your expectations and I think you will be okay, just try to accept that there will be answers to come, one just has to wait.

My scores are:

"matej-trkanjec-133-920386","Perfectly balanced, as all things should be","30 April 2018","Amidst all the hype and all the expectations, considering that the last few MCU movies were good/decent, and considering that this it the culmination of 10 years of MCU movies, there are no words in this Universe that can describe just how powerful this movie really is. At this moment, without any hesitation or doubt, especially considering my reservations in the light of Civil war, I can honestly say this is the best superhero/comic book movie ever made.

I actually had to go back into the theater the day after I first saw the movie because of the shock it put me in. I honestly could not write a, sine ira et studio review. Watching it a second time around got me even more emotionally struck and left me in even more awe.

Sincerely, after 10 years of playing certain characters (some more or less), there really isn't much that one should say about the acting abilities of Downey Jr. or Cumberbatch or Pratt etc. They are all, primarily fantastic actors but they have such a degree of understanding their characters that at some point they reall are not even acting (especially noticeable in Downey Jr.'s case). Still, certain members managed to surprise even after all this time: Evans' take on the Cap this time was SUPERB, FLAWLESS, SPECTACULAR. His moral superiority and all those little characteristics that made him who he is are now so base and so minor in comparison to his charisma and dominance of the entire rogue Avengers team. His presence (even though short) i overwhelming at the least. But, the one that stole every scene was Hemsworth. All of the humor of the catastrophic Ragnarok is still there, but it feels much more in place. Thor was the one that suffered a lot (maybe the most) and Hemsworth does an amazing job portraying it. Everyone else did a splendid job, up to the task, used every second of the scenes they were in (because not much time was given to some of them). But regardless, the acting and characters never feel overstuffed (unlike Civil war).

But the one we should be talking about is Brolin. In all my time watching comic book movies never have I seen a villain (or is he?) with such depth and emotions, with such philosophy behind his actions. Even though he is fully CGI the way Brolin portrayed him is astonishing. At a point one can even consider the possibility this movie was not about the Avengers, but about him. He took most of the screen time and was the driving force behind the whole story. But the things that make him a character like never before seen in an MCU movie are his Greek-tragedy-style decisions and final confrontation with himself. These scenes show that MCU movies can have depth, meaning, that they can be tragic and meaningful. He was worth the wait.

The story itself is not too complex. As I said, more of the movie is based on Thanos than on the Avengers, and in the end that actually is not a bad thing. We are all a bit fed up with them and their personal stories so this one, focusing on something completely different was a superb idea, MARVELously executed. Also, regarding the story, the movie itself was nicely edited, with not to many abrupt jumps from one scene to the other (with a few forgettable exceptions). But the highlight is the simultaneous final battle taking place on multiple locations. But all that would be nothing new if it were not for the scale of the battles themselves. The Earth battle is a classic final showdown - epic, large in scale, violent etc. The fistfight with Thanos is, on the other hand, almost identically grave and menacing as the army battle on Earth. That is not easily accomplished and high regards must be given to the directors and screenwriters.

Last but not least, the music. If today we are to choose the greatest composers of our time, Silvestri is to be one of them. The way his notes strike into the very heart of the viewers is superb, and his solo piano rendition of the Avengers theme fits so perfectly with the end credits that one feels the entire movie all over again by just listening to his music. But the one thing that hits harder than anything else is his ending/Thanos theme. The contrast between the magnitude of what he has just done, and the calmness and simplicity of his theme is utmost perfection.

Even if I tried (and God help me I tried), I could not find a single flaw to this movie. This is the movie Civil war warned us about. This is the movie the DC movies try to be, and fail in their effort spectacularly. This is what a culmination of 10 years of work in the MCU looks like. This is the definitive comic book movie. This is something like nothing else in the world exists today. Infinity war is the best movie od 2018. (and I say that in April). Infinity war is one of the greatest movies ever made.

P.s. viewers that have not seen all of the previous 18 movies might have a problem with understanding certain segments or feeling the same way as those who have. So, if you haven't seen all of them, sit down and get to work before you consider watching this Titan of a movie.

"invisibleunicornninja","Amazing.","6 May 2018","If you're not a fan of this universe of if you haven't seen the other movies, you're probably not going to like it. There isn't a whole lot of character development because all these characters have already been developed and established in other movies. If you haven't seen the other movies before watching this one, then you're probably going to be a bit confused concerning everyone's motivations. Except for Thanos. This is basically his movie. Thanos is a giant middle finger to everyone who says that supervillians can't be good as he is probably one of the best villains that I've ever seen.

Though this movie may be long, it is extremely fast-paced. The graphics are all incredible (though there are a few minor shots that probably aren't going to hold up well). This movie keeps you watching with all the different well-executed subplots. Though the script could've been a bit better at times, the action is phenomenal. The boundaries between reality and imagination are tested by the powers of characters such as Thanos and Doctor Strange.

I could go on and on for hours about how much this movie does well, but instead I'm just gonna describe my theater experience.

This was probably one of the worst audiences that I've ever watched a movie with yet. Whenever there was any kind of joke, the audience laughed so hard I couldn't hear the next lines. Well, I say ""any kind of joke"" but whenever there was a couple of lines that were genuinely clever and funny I was one of the only people who reacted. At one point Thor appeared onscreen (it was the bit when he ex machinas his way into Wakanda) and some guy stood up and started clapping and cheering ""WHOOO THOOOOOOOR"" and it was pretty annoying. Also there was a lot of other slightly less loud reactions to other events.

After the end-credits scene everyone left the theater pissed off. This movie does have multiple character deaths and legitimate consequences as opposed to most Marvel movies. Its kind of sad that negative audience reactions to things like that encourage studios to avoid risks in the future. Unlike other movies of this type, I had no clue what was going to happen because of where they took the story, and that's a good thing. I wish that less movies tried to go the route of the happy ending like this one.","1"
"FeastMode","EPIC and ASTONISHING","26 July 2019","I love this movie. I'm basically blown away for the entire runtime, even on the fifth viewing. Action packed and epic. The perfect amount of funny.

I can't believe how many characters are in this movie, as well as the mammoth of a cast that comes with it. So many memorable scenes, and when I say memorable, I mean I remember the exact moment I first witnessed them. The music frequently gives it a Shakespearean tragedy vibe. Well done on all fronts.

"Wuchakk","Moving ending, but the least of the Avengers movies IMHO","2 July 2018","RELEASED IN 2018 and directed by Anthony & Joe Russo, ""Avengers: Infinity War"" chronicles events when the Avengers team-up with several allies to defeat the cosmic despot Thanos, whose goal is to collect all six Infinity Stones to attain unimaginable power and radically solve one of the Universe's most challenging problems.

The story focuses on Thanos, Thor and the Guardians of the Galaxy, especially Gamora, as well as Iron Man, Doctor Strange and Spider-Man. The rest of the cast members are more peripheral, e.g. Black Widow, Captain America, Black Panther, Vision and Scarlet Witch.

This is easily the least of the Avengers trilogy. Not to mention ""Captain America: Civil War"" (2016) and ""Thor: Ragnarok"" (2017) are significantly more compelling and all-around entertaining. Actually, all three Thor flicks are palpably superior, as is ""Iron Man 2"" (2010). If you haven't already, I encourage you to watch these movies prior to viewing ""Infinity War,"" as well as ""Black Panther"" (2018) and the two ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" flicks (2014/2017); otherwise you'll likely be lost because all these movies lead up to this one.

""Infinity War"" is certainly an ambitious comic book movie in that it notably juggles so many super-beings, but this lack of focus isn't conducive to suspense or great drama. It's merely decent with overkill CGI. The big battle in the closing act with the easily slaughtered four-armed dog-creatures is curiously dull; moreover, the attempts at humor sometimes feel forced and fall flat, but several jokes are laugh-out-loud funny, e.g. ""Rabbit."" Thankfully, the film adds moving drama and gets extra points for a bold, poignant climax, which sets up the 2019 sequel ""Endgame.""

The evil side even has more than 1 bad guy. One thing you have to say about Marvel versus DC though, the bad ones in the DC world have bigger egos that the Marvel ones. This can only mean 1 thing, the heros with the bigger egos squash the bigger ego bad guys at the box office.

It's true here again. The Universe is a big place and a large portion of it is brought into the war this time. All in all, it's a great show. There are contributions from several countries, and lots of action. Because of the size of the battle you come to fully expect being set up for the next one. And, yes, we are set up.

The humor here more understated than other Marvel films. There is some to be sure, and this movie lacks for it. When there's a massive war, something has got to give. The film has so much going on that character development is assumed from people watching the other Marvel Films. No time for characters here, just lots of action.","10"

"matitya-33937","I despise this film","13 September 2022","If you wanted a review from someone with nice things to say about Infinity War, then you came to the wrong place. What do I not dislike about this film? I suppose some of the jokes land and actually that's pretty much it. First of all, it's far too infinite a war. The Avengers, Dr. Strange, Spider-Man, Black Panther, the Guardians of the Galaxy, the Revengers, in fact pretty much everyone aside from Ant-Man and Hawkeye appears in this movie and features in an extremely prominent role. That is far too many protagonists to have to follow.

(The movie also follows suit the example of Spider-Man: Homecoming in making Peter Parker into Robin instead of Spider-Man which thankfully was rectified by No Way Home but was in full force here.) Speaking of which, Spider-Man's death scene wasn't a particularly well-executed one.

And it's an unfortunate reality that the Marvel Cinematic Universe lowered our standards for villains enough that Thanos qualifies as a great one instead of merely a decent one.

With Valentine from Kingsman: The Secret Service, a supervillain with the same motivation of Thanos was much better done. Valentine is an eco-terrorist whose neo-Malthusian alarmism and paranoia lead to him seeking to cull the world's population because he views humanity as a virus and global warming as a fever. Yet Valentine also can't stomach gore and therefore relies extensively upon his henchmen so as to enable himself to avoid seeing the violence and while he is genre-savvy enough to kill the local James Bond pastiche by shooting him dead, he's still disturbed as he does this. As a result he works quite well as a villain in stark contrast to Thanos.

For context, Thanos repeatedly forced his adoptive daughters Gamora and Nebula to fight half to death and punished the loser by amputating her limbs and replacing them with metal prosthetics resulting in Nebula becoming more machine than humanoid and Gamora being rewarded for it with employment as an assassin in his service (the original purpose for which he salvaged her from her home-world after butchering it.) That's abuse, plain and simple. Yet the movie still characterizes Thanos as truly loving Gamora, though not Nebula. And it's inconsistent in its efforts to deny or embrace Thanos's sadism from earlier films. In Guardians of the Galaxy, Thanos killed his own right-hand man out of pique and threatened to soak the Milky Way in Ronan's blood should Ronan fail him. And while there are some aspects of this film (such as his treatment of Nebula and of the Dwarf King) which are entirely consistent with his sadism most of the movie attempts to emphasize that Thanos isn't a sadistic brute. And I can actually live with Thanos's demographic paranoia being utter nonsense (which it is) given he's supposed to be a villain but his monologuing in practically every scene he's in about his motivation and plan actually grows quite tiresome by the end of the film.

And the ending could hardly have been worse. In the movie Monty Python and the Holy Grail, at the end of the film King Arthur and the Knights of the Round Table are arrested by anachronistic police before they get the Grail thus ending the film. Eric Idle, who wrote that ending, characterized it as the worst ending any movie ever had. He was wrong. The ending to Infinity War is the worst.

Dr. Strange said that if he were forced to choose between Iron Man and Robin (sorry, Iron Man and Spidey) or the Infinity Stones he would protect the stones. But after looking into all possible futures and finding one to stop Thanos, Strange readily gives up the Infinity Stone because it's ""the only way"" while Thanos gets off scot free and in the post-credits scene Fury signals Captain Marvel to negate the events of the film.

I could also rant about Iron Man's character regressing though that was honestly business as usual by this point or about Hulk being easily defeated and Banner being turned into a joke or the fact that Thor's arc in this movie goes nowhere (and I don't mean the space station) or that Star-Lord has turned into a light-weight or any of the other myriad problems this movie had. But if I did that, I would likely never stop ranting about it. If you liked this movie that's entirely fine. Enjoy it to your heart's content. But I do not for a moment share your high regard for it. I despise this film.","10"
"southdavid","Infinity Scores !","30 April 2018","Thanos is coming. That's about all I can write for a plot synopsis without delving into the many potential spoilers that ""Avengers: Infinity War"" contains. Obviously, Earth's mightiest heroes will stand against him, joined by the various other characters that the MCU have introduced in the decade of success we've enjoyed since ""Iron Man"".

""Infinity War"" is one of the rare films that, for me, lives up to the gargantuan hype that has revolved around it, since is announcement. Tonally, it's spot on. The moments of levity releasing a tension that caused by the honest belief that this is going to be the end for some of the characters we've spent that happy decade with. Somehow, despite the history with the previous 18 movies, that the heroes will win in the end, there's a sense of purveying dread throughout ""Infinity War"", that any encounter with Thanos is going to be the last time we see that character and if it's even possible to stop him, the cost is going to be astronomical.

Marvel are often accused of having a problem with their Villains, but that is not the case here. It really is Thanos' film, he's in virtually every scene and even when absent he's the focus of discussion from the other characters. It's testament to Josh Brolin and the writing and animation teams that Thanos is not simply some genocidal madman, he believes in the justification of what he's doing and the price he's had to pay to do it.

One of the initial concerns I had was how they would balance the 50 odd named characters without making them token. My concerns were unfounded - the writing team do a masterful job of explaining why each hero is where they are and their justifications for staying or travelling to where they do. It's full of little hero moments, that make your heart beat a little faster and as I say above, the comedy is spot on. Doctor Strange is much more compelling here, than he was in his solo film - the sorcerer supreme at the height of his powers, his dialogue, event he early comedy is much better written than before. The heaviest work from a hero point of view is probably done by Thor, who continues to show the character development across his films arc, and the humour that Chris Hemsworth is becoming so adept at.

The ending (No spoilers here) is perhaps the only real blot on the copybook. Despite the immediate shock of it, you realise fairly quickly that it's . . . not going to stick, I guess is the best way to describe it and that next year's Avengers film will be about sorting out the situation that they are left in. But this is a relatively minor quibble, soon routed by the realisation that we're actually only half way through an epic story of loss and redemption.

The Avengers have to put everything on the line to stop Thanos, before his thirst for never-ending destruction puts an end to all life on Earth.

Avengers: Infinity War is an awe-inspiring film. Directors Anthony Russo & Joe Russo have given us the most ambitious Marvel Cinematic Universe film to date. The final product is a dark, funny, action-packed & emotionally overwhelming movie. The banter among all the various Avengers & the action set pieces are the highlights of the film. The visual effects are flawless. The 3D is eye-popping. The climax of the movie just leaves you absolutely shocked & in high anticipation of next year's Untitled Avengers Movie(2019). The star-studded cast, is the main reason this movie is unforgettable. Robert Downey Jr. is outstanding as Tony Stark/Iron Man. Downey Jr. brings even more emotional depth to his usually fun-loving character, this time around. Chris Hemsworth is brilliant as Thor. Hemsworth portrays a wide variety of emotions, as the film progresses. Mark Ruffalo is fantastic as Bruce Banner/Hulk. Ruffalo provides some much needed comic relief, amidst this generally dark movie. Chris Evans is spectacular as Steve Rogers/Captain America. Evans continues to play his part as the first Avenger, to perfection. Scarlett Johansson is superb as Natasha Romanoff/Black Widow. Don Cheadle is effective as James Rhodes/War Machine. Benedict Cumberbatch is excellent as Doctor Strange. Tom Holland is amazing as Peter Parker/Spider-Man. Chadwick Boseman is great as T'Challa/Black Panther. Zoe Saldana is awesome as Gamora. Karen Gillan is wonderful as Nebula. Paul Bettany is impressive as Vision. Elizabeth Olsen is spectacular as Wanda Maximoff/Scarlet Witch. Anthony Mackie is good as Sam Wilson/Falcon. Sebastian Stan is outstanding as Bucky Barnes/Winter Soldier. Pom Klementieff is great as Mantis. Dave Bautista is hilarious as Drax. Vin Diesel & Bradley Cooper are amazing as Groot & Rocket, respectively. Josh Brolin is highly intimidating & menacing as Thanos. Brolin's character is the best villain in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Chris Pratt is hysterical as Peter Quill/Star-Lord. Tom Hiddleston, Idris Elba, Danai Gurira, Peter Dinklage, Benedict Wong, Gwyneth Paltrow, Benicio Del Toro, Letitia Wright, Tom Vaughan-Lawlor, Carrie Coon & Winston Duke are unforgettable as, Loki, Heimdall, Okoye, Eitri, Wong, Pepper Potts, The Collector, Shuri, Ebony Maw, Proxima Midnight & M'Baku, respectively. Avengers: Infinity War is a must watch. Can't wait to watch it again, in IMAX 3D! Another gem in the ever expanding Marvel Cinematic Universe.","9"

I had some concerns, the trailers made it look like a typical save-the-world storyline, and Avengers 2 was terrible. But man I was completely wrong, this was great and mostly thanks to the villain Thanos, who is one of the better movie antagonists in recent memory and probably the best MCU villain (except perhaps Killmonger). He is cunning, ruthless, and physically very powerful.

Marvel villains are usually foils to the heroes, and only exist for the hero to defeat them and learn more about himself in the process. Here, Thanos is a fully fleshed out character who experiences a range of emotions and spends a large part of the movie on his own personal odyssey. He shares surprisingly little screentime with the Avengers (he sends his minions instead) and there is little gloating, cackling or lame quips. When they do clash, they are mere obstacles to be swatted away rather than his genuine rivals.

Taking the action away from Earth and into the cosmos allowed for very imaginative and psychedelic battles. There is a battle on an alien planet that could be ripped straight from the comic books.

I had some problems with the ending and the usual Marvel humour got a little tiresome at times, but other than that this was as close to a perfect comic book movie as you will likely get.","1"

"jamesrupert2014","Excellent superhero ensemble adventure","6 January 2019","The story arc continues as ""Earth's Mightiest Heroes"" face Thanos, their most implacable and powerful foe yet, whose goal is nothing less than the elimination of half of the universe's denizens. To do this, he must acquire all six of the infinity stones, colourful MacGuffins with a complex metaphysical backstory - a plot device that allows for a series embedded stories involving subsets of heroes and villains. The story is quite good and relatively internally consistent, and the characters interesting and well worked out (although I have my usual suspension of disbelief problem with The Avengers somewhat asymmetrical powers: Black Widow knows martial arts and is a good shot, Thor is an immortal God who can fly though space and withstand the focussed power of a degenerating neutron star, yet both seem to get equal hero billing). Even the most heavy made-up (or completely CGI) characters have a lot of personality, especially (IMO) chief villain Thanos, emotionally-expressive Mantis, and my personal favorite: giant dwarf Eitri (Peter Dinklage). The script manages to hit a good balance of action/drama and comedy (tricky to do and often a weak point in the genre). The ending is a set-up for the next film, in which we can expect Captain Marvel to put in an appearance (perhaps a harbinger for the next generation of Avengers). Given the God-like powers of some of the heroes and the fact that Thanos can now control reality and time (always a convenient plot gimmick), pretty much anything could happen.","7"

First of all: when did The Avengers, whom I like to think of as The Get-Eveners, as they are indubitably out there to even the score with the baddies and wreak vengeance aplenty-------when did The Get-Eveners morph into Guardians of the Galaxy comedians?

Sure, the Guardians cast is there, so you'd expect those silly jokes, bad puns, and, of course, The Get-Eveners have always had their own style of quipping , albeit a bit more sophisticated. . .But . . .when did *every other line* become a quip? Gad, that was a bit much.

Quip . . . action . . . quip . . .action. I have coined a new term for this and I dub The Avengers: Infinity War a ""quipaction"" flick. Honestly, does there have to be some inane, barely ""cute"" quip every other sentence? If so, let's get some better jokes at least.

Other things stood out for me and, don't worry, I enjoyed the movie, but just had to put a few more ""insights"" out there for you readers (both of you.):

Robert Downey, Jr. is FINALLY looking old. Gorgeous Iron Man, where oh where did you misplace that Fountain of Youth? Still a looker, but I hate it when actors suddenly age. It makes me feel . . . old. Love the voice, Downey; love you.

Josh Brolin is awesome in his role. ""Thanos,"" as I am sure the die-hard fans amongst you know means ""immortal"" in Greek. Thanos was terrifically acted. I thought the CGI was kind of bizarre and plenty distracting a lot of the time, but I love how Brolin's mannerisms and facial expressions came through on the big screen. Brolin makes a formidable baddie.

I'm tired of writing now, so I will only mention two other things that I REALLY liked about the film. I LOVED IT when Scarlet Johansson says, in her initimably super sultry and SEXY voice, ""She's not alone."" I wish I could have played that back, right there in the theatre, over and over again. (I will do it now, online.)

For me, those three little words made up one of THE best moments in the entire movie. Black Widow had so little time onscreen. Hearing her speak that one line was worth the price of admission.

Scarlet's voice and the Wakandas chanting. Yep. A solid 9 for this flick.","10"
"intrepidami","Whoa Nelli! (10 stars and I'll tell you why!}","2 May 2018","You want action? This here's the MCU's version of an All Star event. With the dunking contest, the home-run derby, and the main event. It's half time and the team has seriously taken a beating. Let's recap. The other team looked downright invincible at first. But our team got in their licks. Several players on the opposing team were taken out too. This is a war anyways, it's like everybody forgets that.

It has drama! It has a villain that actually thinks he's in the right. He's not just doing this because he likes being a villain. His followers actually believe in his cause, aren't just there as mercenaries. There are people on our planet who feel the same way Thanos does! That overpopulation is killing our planet. Thanos actually cries real tears.

This is the closest thing to an actual comic book adaption that has ever been filmed. It follows the storyline.It wasn't messed with for Hollywood audiences. A lot of the critics just don't seem to get that. I would not recommend taking pre-teens to see this without a conversation first about how this is a comic book adaption. These characters aren't real and neither are..their deaths.You've already seen many, many Marvel characters die on screen in other movies. Why this is effecting people so much is ridiculous. Of course most of them will return...hello..they have movies scheduled for several of them.

I for one am joyful because I've been reading the Thanos saga since the old Captain Marvel comics(Mar-vell) and can even see elements of those storylines in here, and can pretty much follow what's going to happen and it's awesome!

The movie is everything you want without going overboard. It's laugh out loud funny at times, it connects all the character seamlessly. Most of the second tier characters will have big roles in the following movie. That's a great thing. Remember ""So you're saying theres a chance""","9"
"mertzi","A lot of people think The Room is superior to Infinity War","16 May 2018","So there's a trend lately with all these 1/10 reviews bashing IW, especially by saying it doesn't belong in the top 250. Firstly they don't understand how IMDB's rating system works, fanboyism can't get movies in the top 250. Secondly, and this is the funniest part, at the same time they think this movie is not better than e.g. LOTR:TTT (I don't either) they also with their 1/10 votes think IW is WORSE than The Room (3.6/10) or Britney Spears' Crossroads (3.4/10). They must think these movies are awesome compared to IW. Go watch some really bad movies and get some perspective.

Now for the review part. IW was really really good, a spectacle. It was so intense that it took me hours to settle down, it might even have been too much. When I have extremely high expectations it is very rare that I'm 100% satisfied, but after one viewing I had nothing important to criticize. However I always need a second viewing before having my final opinion so I'll rate this 8/10 for now but it will probably land in 9/10. Don't miss the opportunity to watch it in theaters, even if you don't like it, you will miss an historic movie event.","9"
"bethgondales","Not worth my money and time","10 June 2018","This movie made the good cast look stupid and no common sense. Made the bad or evil cast dominating from start to finish. I vote for nonsense movie of the millennium!!!!","9"
"darnosmyhrvold","ASTONISHING IS AN UNDERSTATEMENT","12 August 2018","Where do I start?

I think I might start with all the big-headed people who have taken the time to badly criticize this movie. How can you honestly sit there and complain; 1/10, plot holes, it's like watching Harry Potter, too much CGI, I was hoping it would be more like Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. Come on give me a break!

How else would you do it? Let me guess, animation? How would you 'critics' align space, planets, action scenes, battles, every superhero character, character development and their individual super powers etc. with the marvel comic books? It's a superhero movie for god sake! of course there's going to be plot holes, it's a big job trying to bring all the characters together in one move, hence the 3 or so hours.

The Avengers finally have a worthy villain, and unfortunately it will take a few sacrifices along the way to defeat the great Thanos. I also honestly believe half the characters haven't yet died, that would just ruin the franchise and Infinity War movies all together. I have a gut feeling Dr Strange has something to do with it, I could be wrong but just don't believe the latter would occur.

Come one guys stop over analyzing things, relax enjoy it for what it is. This movie has it all drama, suspense, despair, bravery, courage, sacrifice, humour, anguish, I can go on.

I'm an avid movie watcher, have seen every Marvel movie there is, I collect Marvel comics $10,000 worth, i'm also an artist and a writer, so like to think my opinion is worth something.

Well done Marvel, keep bringing them out....","8"
"fuad_tarin_58","Best movie of all time","4 September 2022","For me.. this is the best movie ever made.

Great actors, great music, story and probably the best villain of any movie of all time. It also have allot of funn moments wich allot of movies fail with to bring in.

Its starts with a 100/100 and finishes with a 200/100 Its a long movie but it felt like a 15min movie when i watched it. Not a single boring moment.

Anyone that says this movie is bad need to start rethink about their lives and that maybe they are a mistake to this world.

Marvel shouldve stopped doing more movies and series after after endgame aswell. Cause all after that is just milking money and not good enough.","5"

I'm swearing off Marvel, swearing off Disney except for the kids' movies, and trying to figure out how to get the theater to not send the money from my ticket to the studio. I don't care if I actually get the money back, I just don't want it to go to the studio for making that train wreck.","6"
"veljkobogdanovicofficial","Good but not great","24 April 2019","My rating is weak 8/10 but I almost gave it 1 because it is so overrated and sooo overhyped. I think the movie is very enjoyable and very funny at sometimes but it has problems and its not perfect.

I really dont like what they did with the Captain America. He was there just to show off with his beard. And I like that the Thor is most powerful but I dont like that he didnt use powers untill he got stormbreaker. Star-Lord is in my top 10 heroes and they just ruined him in this movie. Movie has some plot holes that im not gonna mention. And all deaths after the snap felt forced. Fanboys are saying it is best superhero movie ever. I mean, its not even best mcu film I think Civil War, GOTG and Iron Man are better movies.

Overall as I said very enjoyable and funny but I still dont think it deserves 8.5...","6"
"MihaiSorinToma","The best of the Avengers so far","2 January 2019","As the greatest threat the universe has ever seen seeks the six stones which allows him to decimate any living creature, the disassembled Avengers must do whatever they can, even if that means making the toughest sacrifices, in order to prevent Thanos from achieving his goal.

This third installment in the Avengers franchise brings a different approach to the series. It gathers its very popular characters/superheroes and puts them in a situation they've never faced before. Threatened from multiple places and also working on multiple plans, their actions are now bound to bring drama, rather than joy. Thus, the much darker atmosphere this movie generates is a very welcome change at least from my point of view. We still get the awesome scenery and the deeply satisfying action sequences, but the drama which they tend to generate has a much bigger impact. We also get some laughs seldomly and even some interesting sarcasm which are a good addition to the film, but those are somehow expected from a Marvel movie.

As you might have guessed by now, the plot represents the movie's greatest aspect. The way it unfolds and the way it generates such emotion is unique, thus you have to give it credit for that. The characters are very well known from the other Marvel movies so there isn't much to say about them, besides the fact that they keep their characteristics, both good and bad, and that they are very well played by their impressive and charismatic actors. It's needless to say that this movie's cast can easily impress anyone without even mentioning the title or the plot.

The visual part is top-notch. You get such great CGI that you're eyes simply cannot believe what they are seeing. Everything is so well thought and implemented that you cannot avoid saying ""wow"" at least a couple of times. We tend to get accustomed with CGI and special effects these days, but the ones features here are simply extraordinary.

In conclusion, it's so far the best movie which ""wears"" the Avengers name, bringing a new approach to the franchise while leaving plenty of room for a highly expected sequel thanks to its unpredictable but also very profound finale. It managed to impress in every single way so I give it full credit for that.","10"

Speaking of which, it is perfectly okay if the humor is a little much as long as it carries a certain wit about it, instead of sounding forced and cosmetic and just downright tasteless.

I have experienced the audience's reactions throughout the whole movie and there were so many expressions. (SPOILER) The ending left me speechless... I was overcome with emotions, in a good way.

"bodhi-13262","Destiny has arrived...","28 April 2018","After a decade of spectacular films and cast of characters, the culmination of the entire MARVEL Cinematic Universe has led to this. 'Avengers: Infinity War' marks the first-half of what is to be a monumental cinematic event. With years of hype, does this film deliver and meet every expectation we've been hoping for?

1. This review is SPOILER FREE , but there will be mentions of certain sequences, however, I assure you there won't be any reveals. To make things simple, the mad titan Thanos (Josh Brolin) has finally decided to scour the universe in a hunt for all six infinity stones and deliver a balance to life and death that he sees fit. Blood will be shed and fear spreads as a fractured Avengers face their greatest threat as the fate of the world hangs in the balance. In all honesty, this film delivered on everything I wanted to see all whilst exceeding my expectations at the same time. One must remember that to fully appreciate this film, you had to have seen every MCU film prior to this. If you've missed films in between or if this in your first MCU experience, I'd heavily recommend that you catch up as soon as you can before seeing 'Infinity War' because you'd be utterly confused viewing this on its own.

2. Although all the characters are in one film, they're not all together (if you know what I mean). Certain Avengers are handling things in different places across the galaxy, so don't expect a unified team-up on this one. Everything has its place and I continue to stress that this is part one of two in the 'Infinity War' and Thanos' story. The three leading heroes (Captain America, Iron Man & Thor) are all on their respective quests until the ultimate convergence during the climax. Personally, the more intriguing story was Captain America's (Chris Evans) quest and the defensive actions in Wakanda, as well as Gamora's (Zoe Saldana) relationship with her adopted father Thanos. Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) and the Guardians' plot is a close second while Thor's (Chris Hemsworth) was the least compelling. Not to say having three different story-lines is a bad thing, rather than which is more entertaining to follow.

3. Thanos is by far the greatest CGI creation I've seen come alive on-screen since Gollum. The effects are impeccable and Josh Brolin delivers an outstanding motion-capture performance as the mad Titan himself. There is an ere of sympathy to Thanos that I found interesting and all credit goes to the writers. He is (most certainly) a force to be reckoned with and can definitely be placed in the category of the greatest cinematic villains in history. What was equally impressive were Thanos' minions/followers, 'The Black Order'. Corvus Glaive, Proxima Midnight, Ebony Maw & Cull Obsidian respectively, are badass characters all of whom I'm dying to see more of. The action is spectacular and some of which I've never seen before. It was hard to contain my inner nerd the more the movie progressed closer and closer to that spectacular climax. So as far as action goes......no complaints whatsoever.

4. The one thing I found a little campy and I guess the only flaw of this film is that Vision (Paul Bettany) and Scarlett Witch's (Elizabeth Olsen) relationship. As seen in the trailers, Vision has evolved to the point in which he can now generate a human appearance. It's insinuated that both he and Wanda are intimate (having sex), and that's just awkward and somewhat gross to think about considering Vision is still a robot/machine of sorts despite his intellect. Besides that, I must warn audiences who've been spoiled by the happy/hopeful/humorous MCU endings thus far, because 'Infinity War' has a rather dark ending. When it was all over, I was unable to move from my seat and just sat there for a few minutes to wrap my head around the final event and realization of the films climax. Its somewhat of a cliffhanger but not entirely, because the film does have a legit conclusion.

I felt fear and shed tears for certain characters as there is so much emotion tied into this film. Some sequences are truly heartbreaking despite the amazing action and moments of humor. Kudos to the direction of the Russo brothers and writers Markus & McFeeley, because 'Avengers: Infinity War' is truly one for the ages and a spectacle of a film. It it so fantastic that MARVEL has indeed succeeded the likes of DC and even Star Wars, as this is easily in the higher rankings of best comic-book films ever made.","9"

"andrewmivanov","A Modern Action/Adventure Classic","22 July 2021","Loved it when I first saw it, and love it more every time I watch it. While it may not have the exact depth in writing as other films in its genre, Infinity War makes up for that with many great characters moments, a clever balance of humor and darkness (and this film is considerably dark when compared to other MCU installments), breathtaking action scenes that are well-placed and not just used for the sake of having a big action scene to keep audiences entertained. Of course, Infinity War is part of the broader film series, the Marvel Cinematic Universe and although catching up on previous installments in the franchise can certainly enhance the viewing experience, I do still believe it works fabulously as a stand-alone film; I actually like it best when thinking about it as a race against time or heist film. (also, case in point, I saw this movie for the first time with almost no prior knowledge of the MCU, so take that as you will) On top of that, the villain of the story, Thanos, has become iconic in pop culture, and for good reason. While he certainly earns the name of the ""Mad Titan"", his intentions are at least comprehensible and that to me is not an easy balance to strike; many villains in films suffer in writing due to this imbalance. I could go on about this movie as it is somewhere at least in my top 100 films, but I will leave it at that. I do consider this film to be a modern action/adventure classic and absolutely recommend it to all fans of the genre; it is truly worth your time.","8"
"servantofheaven","Blockbuster!👌🏻💯","19 March 2023","Absolutely entertaining. Great story and screenplay. The fights and action scenes were just amazing. Iron Man's (Robert Downey Jr) suit-up in a fight scene was super-cool. Captain America's (Chris Evans) entry was awesome. But guess what?? Thor (Chris Hemsworth) was the real MVP of this movie. Coming to the main antagonist, Thanos (Josh Brolin) nailed it with his chilling dialogues and energetic performance. The climax was jaw-dropping. I am giving 10 out of 10 stars for this movie because for me, it is the best Avengers movie in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Keep it up, Marvel Studios. Hats off! 👏🏻🔥","10"

After 10 years of slowly building a massive ensemble of unique characters, it all culminated into an action packed, fun, adventure with actual stakes and a fantastic ending.

Every franchise, Including Disney themselves, have been trying and failing to capture a glimpse of the success that Marvel's Avengers accomplished, and I think that says something to the immense difficulty of pulling something like this off.

No scene dragged, and everyone got the exact amount of screen time that they needed.

The pacing is relentless. Not a boring moment. It was basically three third acts all together. I was surprised to see it even escalate further than I expected. Being a huge comic-book geek, I was pleased to see the film go to places where I thought it wouldn't. I definitely thought Marvel would play it just a little safe before Avengers 4, but they didn't.

So with that being said, lets start with Thanos. Josh Brolin's Thanos is the MCU's best villain by far, beating out Loki, Winter Soldier, Vulture, Killmonger, and Zemo. Also for a CGI creature, he looked legit. Unlike Steppenwolf, the way the light hits his face, the subtle movements on his face when he expresses himself, his movement, it was just perfection. There are some moments where it's not too polished, but it's not completely distracting. Compared to the comics, the Russo Brothers, Kevin Feige and writers Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely take some liberties to make Thanos more than just a big villain who wants to destroy the world. In his own sick and twisted point of view, he kinda had a point, and the best villains are the ones who think that they're doing the right thing.

At this point if any of you have been following the MCU or at least watched a good portion, you won't be totally lost. The entire cast brought their A-game and came to play. Some characters take a back seat, but they do get their moment to shine and are used very well in service of the plot. Downey Jr. And Cumberbatch have great snarky, prick-like, know-it-all vs. Know-it-all back and forth. Holland, Pratt, Bautista, Mackie, Cooper, Diesel, and Ruffalo bring some levity. Evans and Hemsworth bring it in the action department and at this point they can play Cap and Thor in their sleep. We also get a nice cameo from a character we haven't seen in a while. You'll know who I'm talking about once you see the film.

Kudos for Markus and McFeely for juggling this behemoth. One can make the argument that it can get confusing, but if you're invested as much as I am, then it's a total breeze. With 18 movies in, Infinity War can't afford to bring you up to speed.

I normally find romance in superhero films a drag, but here Infinity War juggles two of them and they work really well. I found that the Vision and Scarlet Witch romance was quite effective. Star-Lord and Gamora worked well also.

Action sequences and special effects are top notch. I know a lot of VFX artists worked day and night and they really did not miss a beat. Like Thanos, some weren't as polished, but it's not to the point where it's so obvious. The battle sequences in Titan and Wakanda are back to back edge of your seat thrill rides. I particularly geeked out in the Titan sequence where Thanos does have a one on one with Doctor Strange and Iron Man. Kudos for the creative team to allow Thanos to go nuts with his Infinity Gauntlet. That was such a treat.

Thanos solves Marvel's villain problem. He got a lot of screen time to be developed and being a fan I wasn't disappointed. I love that I felt a sense of danger. As much as I love the MCU, the criticism of no stakes and weak villains for some of their films are valid. For the first time in a while, we actually feel fear for these characters and it's awesome.

If I had one negative, and that's really all I have, is that perhaps the Black Order, or the Children of Thanos are nothing more than just henchmen. They are primarily new characters introduced in the Infinity storyline back in 2013. I did not expect to get what writer Jonathan Hickman gave us in the source material they're based off of, so I kept my expectations in check, but I really did think we'd get a little more to who they are all about. Out of the four, only Ebony Maw truly impressed me and had the most to do.

Avengers: Infinity War is everything I could have hoped for. It's definitely in my Top 3 list of MCU films, and in my Top 10 comic-book films of all time. Marvel Studios President Kevin Feige and directors Joe & Anthony Russo did not pull any punches with this one. It pulled my heart out, making some bold choices along the way. I love their tone as they bring intensity, knowing when to be serious and knowing when to sprinkle in a little humor here and there.

It's a grim and bleak time for the Avengers and the Guardians. The sense of danger makes all the difference in this film. If any of you haven't seen it, you're all not ready for what's to come. Consequences are real and the stakes are high. I will definitely be seeing this again in theaters and I'm so thankful that Avengers 4 is only a year wait as opposed to two or three.

Remember to also stay after the credits.

"SAMTHEBESTEST","Entertaining & Blockbuster stuff but why such incomplete and complicated end","27 April 2018","AVENGERS INFINITY WAR REVIEW :

A wait of so many years, an anticipation built through so many superhero movies and wait for Super Villain finally comes to the end with Large scale visual spectacular called Infinity War. I was so excited but kept expectations low as such superhero flicks entertain you but usually lacks the content. Infinity War is Super Entertaining, it has all the elements what one expect from Marvel's Biggest Film ever but why such Incomplete, complicated and negative end? Film starts on the good note, doesn't take too much time to set unlike other Superhero films. Thanos looks so powerful and we don't wanna see our Avengers looking so weak for the first time. We expect them to smash Thanos but we'll have to wait for Infinity War 2 for that and that's where film looks slightly incomplete at the end. Watch out for the post end credit scene, that might increase your excitement for the sequel. When film ended i felt like it's Interval and i want to see more, but have to wait 1 year more for that. Poor me. Film has so many pluses but has got some minuses too. Let's take a look at them. Pluses- Visually spectacular, goosebumps while seeing so many superheroes together and their strong come-Backs, Strong Villain, pacy screenplay, Comedy, Explosion etc. Minuses- Heroes looking Weak in front of Villain, unnecessary love making scenes between few avengers, useless emotional scenes between Thanos & Gamora, Lose climax, so many unanswered questions. Overall, Avengers Infinity War is just another Entertaining film from Marvel, nothing Extraordinary despite gathering 20+ superheroes in a single film. Film worths the long wait of viewers but nothing memorable to be left with. Film left viewers with more questions than answers. The excitement for the film was so high that some fans even went on to predict that this film will beat Box office records of Avatar, Sorry to say this, forget Avatar but even $2 Billion can't happen with this Product. I will not say you should skip the film but i can't even strongly recommend you. I'm going with 7/10* which is same as almost every superhero film from Marvel has got from me. Last but not the least, there are No such things called spoilers like who dies in the end, so many disappears but only to come back in a style with Infinity War 2.","8"

"jg_1977","One hell of a first part","1 May 2018","Let me start by saying that I am an avid MCU fan and have seen all the previous entries, however I can acknowledge when the franchise goes wrong (the sequels to Iron Man, Thor, and Avengers comes to mind). Infinity War did an utterly incredible job of tying together 10 years of storytelling. For what this movie was meant to be, I don't think they could have changed a thing to make it any better (save a few lines that didn't land or jokes that ran a bit too long). The acting and dialogue is on par with the past few movies, with good performances all around, but some really stand out ones from Chris Hemsworth, Zoe Saldana, and of course Josh Brolin. The action is great, there's good close cut hand to hand scenes that the Russos are famous for and more impressive sprawling epic battle scenes as well. The CGI is mostly good, especially on Thanos and the alien planets, however a few of the children of Thanos did look like 4 year old video game characters to me. The biggest criticism I've heard of this movie is that it's inaccessible to non-MCU fans, which I think is perfectly valid. If you've only seen a scattered few of the movies, you could very likely get lost as they don't spend time re-introducing characters and previous plot lines. I will say however, that at this point, 19 movies in, you should probably have developed an opinion on the MCU by now. Those who thoroughly enjoy the stories and characters will be caught up and this movie will blow them away. For people who are more casual fans who just go for the action and jokes and aren't wrapped up in the overarching plots and character arcs, Infinity War can still deliver exactly what they want. Lastly, for people who just flat out dislike the franchise, this movie won't change their mind. It's more of what we've gotten in the previous 18 entries but on a more epic scale. As a hard-core fan, this movie had me wanting to jump out of my seat and cheer at some moments, and cry at others. Infinity War is truly the reward fans of the franchise are getting after 10 years. I will say however, that it is hard to rank it compared to the rest of the MCU. Since this movie ends on such a large cliff hanger that must be resolved in the follow up, it's very hard to look at it as a complete story. My guess is that people will lump Infinity War and Avengers 4 together as one large movie, much like people do with Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows part 1 and 2. If the follow up sticks the landing and completes this story in a compelling way, then this movie would probably land in my top 5 just above the first Avengers, but conversely it could get dragged down if the sequel doesn't hold up. I cannot wait to see how this story is wrapped up next year, and strongly encourage fans of the franchise to check this one out in theaters. If you haven't yet discovered the joys of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, certainly don't start with this one, but make sure you come back to it 18 movies later. It's worth the wait.","10"
"e-67102-48412","I love you 3000 times.","25 March 2020","In the process of returning to the past time nodes to change the future, the heroes also stringed up a previous Marvel series of movies, so that many things have a complete account, but also make the characters more three-dimensional full. When the Captain picked up the Thor hammer, there was a small climax in the theater; when the little spider-man came back, it was also a small climax. The Captain ridiculed their American hips, and when he were attached to the person who wanted to catch him in the elevator and said ""Hooray for Hydra "", people who understand were happy. The magnificent fighting scene looks super cool on the big screen of the cinema. In the end, Iron Man's self-sacrifice is really embarrassing. I love you 3000 times, too.","8"
"paul_haakonsen","This was impressive...","31 July 2018","Given my reluctance towards superhero movies, then I have been putting off watching ""Avengers: Infinity War"" up until now. I just simply don't do well with flying men, guys with strength above and beyond all measures, and the like. But I still watch the movies when I get presented with a chance, because of the special effects and because they do tend to have quite good special effects.

I was given the chance to watch ""Avengers: Infinity War"" now, so I took the time to sit down and watch it. And I dare say that this was actually the best of all superhero movies that I have watched to date.

Why? Well, because of the storyline and plot. Because this was so much deeper than a bunch of narcissistic guys and girls in tight spandex running around trying to - and succeeding every time - in saving the world and people they don't know. ""Avengers: Infinity War"" had a more dark tinge to it and it was nice for a change to see that the superheroes weren't invincible and coming out unscathed from whatever villain they take on.

And the plot does actually leave you with something to think about; what if Thanos actually wasn't a villain, but one set out to actually do something that is waiting to happen, to purge worlds and give them a fresh start, as worlds are becoming overcrowded and a hazard to themselves with the pollution and such? If you watch the movie with that mindset then it suddenly becomes a whole different experience.

The sheer amount of superheroes put together in this movie must be an overload for fans of the genre, I believe. Because there was an abundance of superhero characters everywhere. And personally, I found it quite refreshing to see that many of them met with untimely demises at the hands of Thanos or as a product of his schemes.

Granted this being a Marvel movie, the special effects were off the charts. If you, like me, don't enjoy superhero movies all that much, then at least watch it for the eye candy in form of CGI and effects on the screen. But ""Avengers: Infinity War"" offers more than just CGI, because it actually has a plot that is worth delving into. But back to the effects; there were so many things going on all over the screen, that I think the movie should be watched a second time. The first time you watch it for the story, the second time to take in all the special effects and happenings on the screen.

The cast list was just phenomenal, and I am impressed that they can assemble these people again and again to reprise their roles. But of course, with the salaries they are being paid, who wouldn't reprise such characters?

""Avengers: Infinity War"" actually presented a good and wholesome entertaining storyline that kept being interesting throughout the entire movie. I was more than entertained and was adequately surprised with the outcome of the movie.

This might actually be just the kind of movie that persuades you to come to like the superhero genre.

I was impressed, and that is saying a lot because I am definitely not a superhero fanboy.","8"
"valen060","Left Speechless with Looming Questions","30 April 2018","One can say that for ten years running the Marvel Cinematic Universe continues to amaze and their latest installment 'Avengers: Infinity War' is a constant reminder that these characters have leapt out of their comic book pages and onto the big screen. With an all-star cast of familiar names and faces gracing the screen like Robert Downey Jr, Chris Hemsworth, Chris Pratt, Benedict Cumberbatch, Scarlett Johansson, and many others, I couldn't fathom how much they went through to finally come together in one movie. Director Joss Whedon helped kick off two Avengers films in 2012 and 2015, but thanks to brothers Joe and Anthony Russo (Captain America: Winter Soldier, Captain America: Civil War) they've pushed it further with these established characters and have a story worth telling.

With the Mad Titan Thanos (Josh Brolin) unleashing destruction in his wake to gather all the Infinity Stones that the heroes have kept safe in the past, it's up to the Avengers to join forces with the Guardians of the Galaxy to stop him at all cost.

The Russo Bros. did an excellent job in directing and gathering all these actors who not only gave splendid performances, but had its audience immerse themselves into a whirlwind of triumph and tragedy. Compared to a few past MCU titles, 'Infinity War' had the right balance of both witty humor and drama blended well into the action that it didn't derail the story itself. It kept me intrigued and curious to see what its mythos and pathos can do. When the movie ended, it had me left speechless and with so many questions looming over what lies ahead. I've heard some complaints from some people I've met saying they didn't like it because it didn't flesh out all the characters properly, missing other notable heroes, or lacked depth in the film's story, but I beg to differ. Since this is only the first half, surely its second half will bring this story to a decent close. My only nitpick was indeed that a few other heroes didn't show, but that's okay since they could likely be saved for its follow-up. Compared to past MCU villains, I was intrigued with the directors' approach in making Thanos being more than just a typical power-hungry villain, but somewhat sympathetic as well. Music composer Alan Silvestri's underscore is a brilliant accompaniment to the most pivotal scenes too. To close, this movie is, by far, a culmination of Marvel's wide assortment of heroes raising the bar in their shared universe. Only time will tell on what more can Marvel dish out from here beyond this Phase Three.

The works of Stan Lee, Jack Kirby, and Joe Simon are now more than just drawings on comic book pages, they are embodiments who've made their mark in cinema.","9"

"Shilo_R_A","6.5/10 - Cool Premise, Many Flaws","23 November 2021","Vengers: Infinity War. To call the thing that surrounded this film ""hype"" would be an understatement. The world went nuts. Marvel have built this huge cinematic universe, and Infinity War was the climax (or maybe the beginning of it, considering Endgame), but anyway, yeah. It was a huge success, people love it, everybody talked about it, even people who haven't seen all the previous Marvel movies have tried to watch it (btw, this is a good time to say: DON'T DO IT. IT DOESN'T MATTER IF IT'S CONSIDERED TO BE THE BEST MCU FILM BY MANY, DON'T WATCH IT FIRST.) It was everywhere. I, myself, have seen it on cinema, which was a pretty cool experience.

But though I used to really love this film, I'm gonna be straightforward here - I find now many flaws in it that I haven't noticed in 2018. Maybe because then I was just really hyped, maybe because watching some true masterpieces made me more sensitive to this stuff, but still - I like it way less than I used to. It's still a nice film though, and an important one for sure, but it's far from being a masterpiece in my eyes. I'd also like to state before the review that I'm not LOOKING for flaws, but rather...I point out the things that truly bothered me. I don't say it ofter, but this time I feel like I should before people will say that I'm nitpicking and not writing what I truly feel about it.

I usually like to start my review with a quick summary of the plot, but here I feel like I can't do it in an efficient way, maybe because all of the context needed. Let's try amyway, something like this: Infinity War tells the story of how all Earth's heroes combine their forces to fight the ""final boss"" of the MCU - Thanos, the mad titan. As he gatheres more and more power, infinity stone after infinity stone, the threat on the universe grows bigger and bigger. Will the Avengers stop him, or will half the universe perish?

Let's start with what I like, shall we?

I think that the dark moments and the generally darker, hopeless vibe that the film has at points is really refreshing in the MCU. I like how the risk is truly felt and emphasized here.

The soundtrack is fitting, I guess? A bit over dramatic from time to time, but there are a lot of overdramatic points in the film so whatever, it's fitting.

Thanos is quite a good villain, and I do like the way that his character was discovered in Infinity War.

And I mean, the general idea, bringing everything together in a big way, is still an idea that I can appreciate a lot. There are also a lot of cool moments, whether funny or simply epic, but they are scattered across the film and I don't wanna spoil anything so I'll say that stating it as it is is enough.

Oh, and some monologues here are quite well written. There are many cool one-liners, and I especially like the opening scene, actually.

Now, the things that bothered me - I'll start with criticizing just the general tone that this film takes from time to time, the general careless, goofy and a little awkward Marvel-humor tone. You know what I'm talking about. And I don't think that every Marvel joke is bad, or that it can't work, but in the context of Infinity War it just feels kinda like atmosphere-breakers, like Marvel don't wanna risk in being serious for too long. Most jokes here aren't that funny, and are quite out of place imo.

Besides of growing tired of the MCU humor during moments in which it's unnecessary, I also find myself picking on more plot holes, more ""oh, how convenient that this character was here"" type of things, and it just doesn't work that well when you overuse it, like here.

Also, the cinematography feels a little to shaky, chaotic, confusing. There are some good shots here and there, but for me, at least, the camera handling and the general way that each shot was filmed was pretty off, for most of the runtime.

I also feel like the pacing was a bit off, and there where point when it was too fast or dragging, but this is not like a horrible flaw here, just another thing that bothered me. And that's about it for the things that bothered me, the flaws.

So, yeah, let's sum it up. Even though it has many, many flaws, I do generally enjoy this film. The premise, the epicness and cool, memorable moments (+the dark atmosphere that was cut WAY too often) make it an enoyable film for me, but I can't say that it's a good one or that I truly love it. It's just a fine, nice movie for me, and that's all. I'm feeling a 6.5/10 on this one.","5"
"ralph_ikari","More entertaining than Black Panther but far from great.","28 April 2018","My concerns about the balance and cohesion between the cast and the settings prior to seeing the movie were real. Infinity War is four distinct movies stitched together. The different groups do not interact, let alone coordinate with each other, and the conflict should not be called a war but a series of amazing stories.

Each scene change requires the audience to not only readjust their mood and expectation, but also the level of engagement. The films jumps back and forth between melodramas, epic fighting and irrelevant humors which feel awkward and disjoint. While viewers should not expect physical realism or common sense in a comic-book movie, some is still required to convince us to suspend our disbelieve.

The best part of Infinity War is the mighty Thanos himself, who bears the brunt of narrative depth and character development. He seems to be such a nice guy, who tried his damnest to not hurt our fragile heroes, and a diligent achiever that I wish I could buy him a beer and watch the sunset together. The semi-destruction of the universe is a hard day's work after all. Mission accomplished.","1"

"Interman","So looking forward to this movie and was disappointed instead.","27 April 2018","I read an article of how they approached this movie (direction, writing, etc.) and was really looking forward to it. As I watched the first 2/3, I was excited. WOW, I said, this is going to be great.

Then....

It looks like they wrote the ending to take advantage of the success of Black Panther. And the fate of the universe (which I get confused as to. is it the universe or galaxy, probably does not matter), comes down to hand to hand combat once again. Not smarts, not teamwork, but whether one party can hit hard enough to destroy the other party. Really? That is just sloppy writing.

So, here are a few questions.

1. If Wakanda is so advanced, why don't they give Black Panther outfits to everyone? Why sacrifice all your citizens? (hint: future sales). 2. If the infinity stones are indestructible, they why not wipe the population and then take them? 3. Why do I hope movie making will change?

Oh well. Terrific cinematography. Great story (to the 2/3's mark). And great marketing. This movie will make a bunch of money, but not because it is good.","10"

"LloydBayer","Infinity War is the biggest, baddest, boldest superhero film in a long time. Thank Thanos.","27 April 2018","With a never ending horde of superhero characters, you could call this the biggest superhero ensemble in Marvel's Cinematic Universe. Heck, even without the searing white excitement generated by all the hype, this was going to be the superhero event of the year. Anyway you look at it, Avengers: Infinity War is the biggest, baddest, boldest superhero film in a long time.

And it's a long time coming with 19 preceding films in three phases over the last 10 years - it was all coming down to this. Viewers who stayed back for the post credits scene during those films (now a Marvel gold standard), were already in on it, and will be the most rewarded during this film. Although the plotline is simple, old and tired - ala save the world from an intergalactic despot - the mythology behind the story and how it is penned for the screen is by the far the best part about this film, and perhaps one of the best from the MCU. Equally praise worthy is the writing and rendition of Thanos, who is not only the best villain in the franchise but somehow the central character too. What makes Thanos even more lovable (as a villain you love to hate to love) is his human-like flaws despite his colossal repute as the most destructive and feared force in the universe. Even better is the fact that amongst the entire star cast (count at least 25 top name appearances) Thanos, voiced by Josh Brolin, is entirely CGI rendered yet still remains at the forefront of this film. In some ways, and despite the atrocities committed by Thanos, you still find a soft corner and empathetically sound reasons to believe why he does what he does. Now this is the modus operandi of a true villain and not even the avengers and Guardians of the Galaxy teamed together can stop him.

Despite the expected humour throughout the film, those atrocities make Avengers: Infinity War the darkest film in the MCU. This means viewers and fans will have to brace themselves for quite a few unexpected turns in the story, some of which may seem straight out of a Greek tragedy. That is the nature of this film, and at times irresistibly devastating. However prepared you think you are, and no matter what you've heard before going to watch this film, Avengers: Infinity War is always two steps ahead. Just like Thanos. I can hardly wait to see his reincarnation as Cable.","10"

"Troy_Campbell","An immense crowd-pleaser","27 April 2018","Entry number 19 in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU), all roads have been leading to Infinity War since a Thanos-teasing end credits stinger in 2012's The Avengers (and more broadly since Iron Man kicked it all off in 2008). With Thanos (Brolin) the biggest and baddest threat Earth's mightiest heroes have had to face - and many of the franchise's original stars at the finishing line of lucrative multi-film contracts - the stakes are higher than ever. Even the most popular MCU icons are in life-threatening danger this time around. In the unenviable position of juggling over 20 established characters in a satisfying manner, whilst also delivering the high-end action expected from this series, directors Joe and Anthony Russo get a lot right. Two and a half hours allows for a plethora of mammoth set pieces and the Russos don't hold back. The choreography isn't the most stylish (nor the CGI as polished as it should be), but every dollar of the considerable budget is utilised to craft wall-to-wall action. An exciting first-act sequence teaming up Dr Strange (Cumberbatch), Iron Man (Downey Jr), Spider-Man (Holland) and Bruce Banner (Ruffalo) quickly sets the all-or-nothing tone, but also demonstrates just how difficult the balancing act will be across the lengthy runtime. Whilst Iron Man gets an electrifying entrance (arguably the best moment of the whole movie), Strange never gets to show off his coolest trick, use of the mirror dimension. And where Spidey gets a suit upgrade, Banner gets underwhelming assistance from the Hulk. These trade-offs are littered throughout, with some more egregious (Clint?) than others; however, the narrative pace is so lightning fast that a few character absences or minimisations become more of a concern after the credits have rolled. Where the filmmaking brothers really strike gold is in the barb-heavy dealings between our favourite heroes. Thor (Hemsworth) and Star-Lord (Pratt) are hilarious in their one-upmanship, Strange and Iron Man build a bromance through witty insults, and Black Widow (Johansson), Scarlett Witch (Olsen) and Okoye (Gurira) combine for one scene that tantalises the oft-rumoured all-female Avenger flick. It is a shame though, that whilst Thanos is given the time and dedication to be fleshed out as one of the better villains of the series, his four hench-creatures are visually bland and narratively unnecessary, their design and execution reminiscent of Steppenwolf in Justice League. Although it doesn't break through into the very top echelon of MCU outings, it's not far off either; a few sneaky cameos, consistently delightful character interactions and one of the franchise's best climaxes ensures Infinity War is an immense crowd-pleaser.","2"

This film is what Marvel fans have been waiting for, most all the characters from the marvel universe in one film is a big treat, and the Thanos character is very menacing, and there toughest opponent, but I like the way he was portrayed has not just a one noted character, and CGI did not look fake. Everybody who has a little story of there own here, and they all play there parts well, you really invested in there plots. Action scenes are quite well shot.

The atmosphere is perfect, displaying both the seriousness and darkness that Thanos brings while still including some good humor. Infinity War takes the action/comedy combo of the rest of the MCU but also manages to escalate the gravity of the situation. The moment Thanos sets foot on the screen, he is intimidating to audiences and heroes alike.

In the end, this almost seems like a film more about Thanos than about our heroes and is a refreshing approach. Definitely one of the best superhero films ever made.","10"

"Saiyan_Prince_Vegeta","Too many storylines, slightly unrealistic even for Marvel, Thanos is weak, 4DX was amazing","28 April 2018","The movie has many different storylines for different heroes and by the middle of the movie I kind of got lost why is everyone doing what they are doing. In Avengers 2 there were many storylines as well, but somehow they managed to make it more interesting there. The movie started really well, it was cool to see dramatic moments when everyone was shocked that Thanos is coming, especially meeting with Mark Ruffalo and Tony Stark, but then that dramatism pretty much disappeared. Also, this movie is very unrealistic even for a Marvel movie. I mean, wtf is with Iron Man suit, it can do literally anything now. Also Spiderman's multiple spider legs also are quite unrealistic, how can he move them like that? Also, Thanos didn't look as powerful as he is supposed to be. He got many different stones, but he was still vulnerable to the Avengers, but he is supposed to be pretty much invincible, he should just crush them, but avengers seemed invincible instead. Also each stone has it's own role and ability, but Marvel didn't really use it that much. Also, some actors, such as Tom Holland (Spider Man) allegedly dies, but we already know that he has a contract for 3 more Marvel movies, so it was not dramatic for me at all, because it means everyone who died will somehow return. This is the first movie ever that I have watch at 4DX theater and it was amazing experience. Unfortunately, something was just lacking in the story, thus I give it an 8. Or maybe it was because the trailer spoiled some things for me... it's better to never watch trailers if you can.","6"

Vision and Scarlet Witch are outside a takeaway which serves deep fried kebabs when they are attacked by the children Of Thanos, possibly saving them from an even worse fate.

Crackling dialogue, wisecracking from Ironman and smartaleckery by rocket are counterposed to Thor's solipsistic godliness. The Guardians are successfully assimilated into the Avengers storyline as is Dr Strange. Maybe a confusion of characters at times but great fun. 8/10.","9"

With these stones he will be able to decimate the Galaxy and bring forth a 'galactic reset' with a lot less people in it. Up to our Mightiest Heroes and friends to team up and stop him but do they succeed? This Part 1 of the conclusion picks up where the post-credit scène of Thor: Ragnarok(2017) left us. Thanos makes first contact and makes sure we know why he's the ultimate villain. As of this point we get the usual mix of action; humor and pretty scenery that are the trademark of a Marvel Universe-movie. Why should you see this?

Thanos' motives are explored so he's not just the 'superevil dude' but gets a 'likeable' background.

"asb_deutsch","A nice comeback from Anthony Russo to start the summer!","26 April 2018","A moment to rejoice! Welcome to Phase 3 of the MCU. First things first, clever writing from the Russo brothers.

After a long time (since Spidey's Homecoming) the critics are totally in sync with me. Last month I watched Black Panther, and thought it was media-hyped! But today, I found something refreshing. This is the best Avengers assembly ever made!

I watched A:IW in IMAX with Laser and it was nice. This resulted in bright images, especially the galaxy, projected by dual projectors on the giant 42 feet high, 65 feet wide screen of IMAX, completely using the whole screen with a slight chopping of the picture. The images are larger than life. Although they don't confuse the eye but I am still having a strain. Along with 12,000 Watts IMAX proprietary sound system that was used very well for the sound editing!

It may have taken 10 years and 18 movies, but the superheroes have shown redemption. This may have room in the hall of fame!

Spider-man is just a teenage boy but yes,Tony Stark can convince any one and it was watching both of them together again. Thor appreciates Roger's beard. And the suits even support the tone of the film.

Some people in the theater started crying in the end, but I didn't. I don't want to spoil anything, so save your bucks for this blockbuster. Expect a few BO records to be broken and don't forget to watch the end credits.

My significant digit score: 8.5/10","9"
"filipjeglic","Good, but not the best.","28 April 2018","I liked the movie, but I have some problems with it.

-There were too many jokes. That doesn't mean I didn't like them, or that they ruined the mood, but half of them were unnecessary...they could easily use that time for story and characters.

-Too many characters. The problem isn't exactly what I said, but mostly ""the focus"" of the characters, some characters were there just to be there...they were ok (not bad), but I would rather see more important characters.

In my opinion the best characters in the movie were Thanos, his servents, Iron man, Doctor Strange. A little bit less, but also Thor, Star Lord and Gamora. But for all of them I wish they had more screen time, to be even better.

Wanda and Vision were also pretty important, but personally I didn't really like them that much, I mean they were ok. Vision was also kinda disappointing in terms of power (remember, he was very important and powerful in Age of Ultron).

I also wish that they would spend more time on the stones, their story, powers and things like that.

There are also some other things I want to say (positive, or some nitpicks), but it's really not that important and I don't want to go too much into details. Oh, effects were very good, better than in movies before, so that's why I mentioned it.","10"
"YasubMannanJiruwala","Top Notch Action, Brilliant Climax!!!","29 December 2022","Now this is what we are talking about! Mind boggling action sequences and a story line with a nerve wracking ending.

Brilliantly executed! I wanted to watch this in 2 sittings but just couldn't hold on, watched in one go.

One of the greatest villains of all time list got a new entry - Thanos. Viscious fellow.

So many super heroes all in one sitting, such a treat.

2 billion grosser worldwide and no wonder at that. This movie deserved all the accolades it got and more.

Watch it at the largest screen available to you with family and friends and you won't be disappointed.

"jeannefrancoise","Not a fan of Avengers team but this is a great movie","1 May 2018","Dear Avengers lovers, this is your month! Avengers: Infinity War is such a great movie, I am not a fan of Avengers movies, but this is definitely a great movie. One week before the movie is released in my country, there are many spoilers, but the movie is still interesting to be watched. The main story of the movie is quite simple, there is a common enemy named Thanos, who wanted to become the greatest god ever in the universe. The first plot is already beginning with a war between the good and the bad, and how the relationship between Avengers team is united easily. Yes, because they face the one and only enemy. In this game, I am quite supporter for Thanos, look at him, he is on war alone with Avengers team. The Director is really genius to use all special effects and other things that made this movie a great superhero series. I hope there is the continuity of the plots, because it has in unexplained ending for me. Even though there is post-credit scene, yet the final war is infinity, well maybe this is the meaning for the title ""Infinity"". In other superhero movies, we could guess that the main evil will be dead or failed, but here in Avengers: Infinity War, the happy ending lovers will be disappointed a lot. Despite of that, I really appreciate all actors and crew, wow they are all seniors and well-experienced, I could not imagine how much they spent for this movie, even though it is clearly stated in IMDB Pro that this is one of box office movies this week, I still could not imagine this movie has great effects and actions.

"adamsmith-51004","Dread it. Run from it. Destiny arrives all the same. And now it's here. Or should I say, I am.","26 October 2022","This is the most intense, complex, and stirring Marvel Cinematic Universe film yet -- though the sheer number of characters and storylines make it a bit confusing for anyone who's not a hard-core fan. Avengers: Infinity War is also the grimmest MCU movie so far, with consequences unlike any that have come before in this massive franchise. Much of the talk about the film will centre on those events (no more details here, to avoid spoilers), but there's more to it than that. Directors Joe and Anthony Russo and screenwriters Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely were already responsible for two of the best MCU entries to date, Captain America: The Winter Soldier and Captain America: Civil War. With Avengers: Infinity War, they continue to respect viewers' intelligence while giving their characters deep motivations and presenting knockout action scenes. It's as lean as epics get; none of its nearly two-and-a-half-hour running time feels wasted. While the many characters and intersecting plots may confuse casual viewers -- the filmmakers assume audiences are familiar with all that's come before -- for fans, it's one mind-blowing moment after another, starting with a jaw-dropping fight in the first minutes. Plus, Infinity War is also one of the funniest MCU movies yet, relying on character-based humour rather than some of the wacky flights of fancy of, say, the also excellent Thor: Ragnarok.

The performances benefit from the strong script, no-nonsense direction, and the growth the actors have experienced in their roles over many years. It's fun to watch two of the MCU's biggest egomaniacs, Downey Jr.'s Tony Stark and Cumberbatch's Stephen Strange, bump up against each other -- and then for Pratt's off-kilter Star-Lord to crash into the mix. Relationships are deepened, and it's a huge relief to see the Avengers working together again after the events of Civil War. Thanos, as voiced by Brolin and brilliantly animated by the VFX team, is perhaps the most frightening villain ever in a comic book film, largely because he's so thoroughly convinced that he's actually a good guy who's willing to make hard choices and impossible sacrifices in the universe's best interests. Without spoiling anything, the film's dire consequences feel almost Game of Thrones-like, with well-known characters defeated as never before. Some kids will likely be upset by that. But keep in mind that this is a comic book world (so things aren't always what they seem), and -- in the meantime -- appreciate the fact that the overall effect gives Infinity War the highest stakes and biggest wow factor of the MCU so far.","9"

"Darksidecrew","so here it is...","25 April 2018","Avengers: Infinity War (2018, Anthony Russo, Joe Russo)

This is a hard film to judge on its own merits with it being the conclusion of an 18 movie story arc. All the previous films good or bad had a solid story of their own with a traditional story telling format that sprinkled the connectivity and over reaching arc in towards the goal of The Avengers and the Guardians of the Galaxy facing Thanos. So this is the the film that concludes these sprinkles that were set in motion 10 years ago and is 100% not a film that can be watched by someone who has not seen all or at least most of the prior films. The MCU is basically a vert expensive tv show that way and also it mimics large cross over event comics which in my experience, the individual build up issues are better than the grand finale that brings everyone together and leaves little time for characters to shine as they are overstuffed. I think this is that overstuffed 'finale' but that is not to say that there is not plenty of other good and bad factors in this epic.

The Russo brothers started with Captain America: Winter Soldier (2014) which showed their shortcomings in the action sequences (in particular hand to hand combat), from their they moved to Captain America: Civil War (2016) which had a better story with a more emotional finale and better but still imperfect editing and filming of combat sequences but was saved in this vein with a great action set piece in the middle (the airport scene) and a strong final and more personal battle. Two years on they have now brought us this, the third Avengers film which its action/combat scenes are 'mostly' quite bad... I really can't tell what's really happening in a lot of them.

However despite being overstuffed and poorly made in some ways it is well paced with a great tone. It is not overly silly and jokey like some of the more recent Disney tentpoles (Thor: Ragnarok, The Last Jedi), instead it is more appropriately toned for the circumstances the characters find themselves with plenty of more natural humour between the more sombre moments. Another big plus is Josh Brolin as Thanos and the way the character is written. He is the only really fleshed out character in the film and he is a really great three dimensional foil who does not disappoint after such a huge build up. Another positive thing that surprised me was how the film was pretty much half Avengers and half Guardians of the Galaxy.

I think James Gunn would have been a better choice as director for this film but it could have been a lot worse. In the end we have a massive film with almost every character from past films in the series that despite its technical flaws has a great last few minutes that would serve as an even more amazing exclamation mark/ full stop if we all did not realise that due to the way the economics of a successful franchise works that much of it will be undone somehow in the future.","10"
"giodracondrum","Best. Superhero. Movie.","24 January 2020","Infinity War... where to start with this one.

Opening night was something spectacular for me when it came to this film. I went in with the same anticipation I had for most Marvel movies- which is to say excited but not expecting anything more than good. I am so glad that what we got rose above that threshold to be something I will never forget.

From the very start the film grips you by putting the focus almost entirely on Thanos as it's central figure and killing off characters that were just saved only a movie ago in Thor: Ragnarok. This cold open was enough for me to be sold on Thanos as a character and the film enhances him more and more as it goes on.

I have to give huge props to Marvel for letting the Russos, Stephen McFeely and Christopher Marcus be more impactful with this movie and it was well worth the hype. The action scenes carry the movie and are all well thought out, engaging, and creative to the big screen. Not one scene is wasted and the forward momentum keeps you enticed.

Alan Silvestri- what a comeback for his time with the MCU. He had previously only scored Captain America: The First Avenger and The Avengers before being dropped in favor of other composers for the next few projects. Him being back on for Infinity War gives the movie a score that enhances it's operatic weight to heights I did not expect. I knew his score would be great but so many moments are made by the music alone. The triumphant Avengers theme playing at the beginning as I had hoped since Age of Ultron was satisfying and the ending, that ending, was film score perfection. One of the best end credit suites to most recent blockbusters.

Another thing that was striking was the Russo's approach to color in this movie as most Marvel movies all share the same 2010 gritty bland-gray look and take away from some of the fun costumes. This time around they nailed the look, allowing for scenes to pop with their greenscreened backgrounds by having the sets lit identically to how they wanted them to look on film.

One of the biggest achievements of this movie was Thanos himself and all the VFX work that made him believable. That's extremely commendable but has done so too many times and I would rather praise the great VFX and artwork in general. The sound design and CGI blend to create a cosmic comicbook world that looks like something straight out of a conceptual artbook. There are tiny details in every VFX shot that sell these characters' interactions and action beats. Iron Man's nano armor was a stand out and the great colors of Nidavellir contrast the rest of the film to sell the third act.

The ending is what made this movie as big as it is- the heroes lose, what's not to love about that? It felt like The Empire Strikes Back for this franchise and a true epic finale to every story we had been presented so far. Getting to see these characters beat down was satisfying and had some of the most poignant scenes in the end. The infamous porch scene is a standout and is incredibly memorable- and daunting. No one was prepared for this and it made this movie all the more special.

There is so much more to say about Marvel's greatest achievement (in my opinion) but I think most of it has already been said. This is my favorite superhero movie of all time and I don't see any other topping it any time soon.","9"
"klara-pazman","Marvel once again proved that these films are not only made for fans, but also by them","28 April 2018","Despite all the hype I didn't expect much from this movie - I was not a fan of Thor: Ragnarok, and the amount of the characters that were to appear in this film has made me a bit concerned. But as it turned out, I had nothing to worry about. The film was a pleasant mixture of action, tragedy, and comic relief, as all the different characters interacted with each other. The screenwriters did a great job at blending more serious universes (Captain America, Iron Man) with the humorous ones (Thor, Spider-Man, The Guardians of Galaxy), and they managed to keep them at balance throughout the whole film. Still, despite all this, their focus was put on Thanos, and they found time to explain his actions and motivation - so much needed in a character like this. Marvel has a reputation for not having believable villains, but Thanos, as well as Loki, proved this wrong. As for the actors, Chris Pratt showed he is the certified king of comedy, Zoe Saldana surprised by bringing out Gamora's sensitive site, and Josh Brolin as Thanos was just mesmerizing. Robert Downey Jr demonstrated his passion for acting and ability to blend with a role of Tony, bringing to it both seriousness and humor (you could really see he is the heart of the MCU, in this movie in particular). And Benedict Cumberbatch can act out just about anything. Marvel once again proved that these films are not only made for fans, but also by them- while watching the movie I could feel the excitement and dedication of producers as well as the rest of the crew, and it made me feel grateful, like I was also a part of the journey. And this is exactly what is so special abut Marvel - their films have that nostalgic something, where characters seemed like old friends and their adventures can easily be your own.","10"
"mrwnmero","Don't get your hopes down yet","30 April 2018","Before you move on this review contains spoilers. . Okay, this movie, by far, is one of the best movies from the MCU. It has a very decent fighting choreography, the acting is really good (surprisingly) and the plot unfolds with style. no long talking sequences to explain what is going on and no advanced computers/weapons to save the day (as is the case with most of the MCU movies). However, this movie might come as a disappointment when the upcoming movies are revealed. since Marvel won't really kill more than half their characters just like that, there IS a way to bring them back. I felt happy that Marvel actually found the courage to kill some of its characters (happy that things finally got serious, but not happy that the character died), but then, in that post-credit scene, I felt a little disappointment. that scene indicates that some hero (Captain Marvel) is comming to save the day. and given the announced future MCU movies (they shouldn't have announced them too soon, they made things too obvious) which includes some of the characters who died in infinity war, all clues says that they will come back. whether they will come back from the dead, some other hidden dimension thing, I'm still not sure. Also, try to separate between the people who died during the movie and the people who died in the end. During the movie, Loki, Heimdall, and Gamora have died due to natural causes. Unlike the others, who died due to some super powers from the infinity gauntlet carrying the six stones. so there is a fair chance that most of these characters will return. But let's not cloud our judgement by the upcoming movies. Infinity war, on its own, is a great film. But I think it is about time Marvel dropped the super technology mumbo jumbo they always fall back too as a Deus-Ex Machina when the situation gets too dire. And I really want them to get rid of Natasha Romanoff, her ability to fight super strength villians and withstand explosions and strong impacts while she has no powers at all is seriously ridiculous.","10"

I think this is Robert Downey Jr's best performance, and Thanos is definitely the best MCU villain to date. Also, the twist at the end was just perfect to set up Endgame, and the Guardians joining the Avengers was amazing. This movie was a perfect Avengers movie. And the action and storytelling is the best of any MCU flick.","5"
"joshua-303-92778","Entertaining","7 August 2018","This was one of Marvel's better offerings. It has some great scenes, and some cringeworthy ones.

There's a great scene where they team up and try to restrain Thanos. The racoon is hilarious. The axe-forging sequence was great.

Zoe Saldana's scenes are hard to watch. Mark Ruffalo is very annoying. I don't think he should be in these movies, or at least they should give him better lines and better direction. Chris Pratt is annoying as always.

Most of the movie involves battles where a hero is close to being killed, then gets rescued at the last moment by another hero. This happens throughout the film.

I didn't like Josh Brolin as Thanos. Memorable villains are extremely rare. This one had potential but I would have used a more emotive actor.

"leonblackwood","Excellent Movie! Entertaining from the beginning to the end! 9/10","12 January 2019","Review: This is definitely the best film of 2018! After watching it 4 times, and still seeing new elements to the complex storyline, I can honestly say that this is the best Marvel movie to date, and I can't wait to see Avengers: Endgame later this year. The action scenes, especially towards the end, are amazing and the magnificent cast all put in great performances. Although the superheroes were under so much pressure to stop the evil Thanos, I still found the witty scenes quite funny, and the CGI was totally on point. The emotional ending, and touching Gamora storyline was a great addition to this spectacular film, which has left the public questioning what will happen next. The director did a good job by not making the plot overcomplicated, even though most of the Marvel Universe were involved, but I would have liked to have seen the Hulk, who was brilliant in Ragnarok. Anyway, this movie sees the evil Thanos, killing everyone who gets in his way to get the 6 Infinity stones, which will give him the ultimate power to bring balance to the Universe. He believes that the universe will soon collapse because of the overpopulation of the intelligent species. He in his insane way had developed a possible solution to this problem: reduce the population by half so that the existing pressure on the resources will automatically reduce. He doesn't strive to eliminate the life form, rather he aims for wiping half of them randomly so that he can create a balance between intelligent life form and resources. To achieve his goal he needs 6 stones in his gauntlet, which include the Space stone, held by Loki, the Mind Stone, which is in Vision, the Reality Stone, which was given to the collector, The Power Stone, which is on Xander with the Nova Corp, The Time Stone which is held by Dr. Strange and the Soul Stone which is in Vormir held by the Red Skull. The superheroes from the Marvel Universe gather to stop Thanos causing mass destruction, but the more stones he gathers is the more power he gains. That's a quick rundown of the storyline, but believe me, it's very complex. When the superheroes gather in Wakanda to stop Thanos from getting the final stone, which is the Mind Stone, the epic final battle ends in disaster, which is why fans are speculating about the outcome. I must admit, when I first watched the movie in the cinema, the ending baffled me, but after talking to a few die-hard fans, I knew that all was not what it seems. With that aside, the directors have kept the next instalment close to there chest, so anything can happen. I just hope that it's in the same class as this movie because it's hard to find a fault with it. They even toned down Spider-Man, who did get on my nerves in his standalone movie, and they gave everyone an equal amount of screen time, even though there were big names in the cast. Anyway, I think you can tell that I thought this movie was great, and I can see myself watching it many more times. Great!

Round-Up: This movie was directed by Anthony & Joe Russo, who also brought you Welcome To Collinwood starring George Clooney, You, Me and Dupree, Captain America: The Winter Soldier and Captain America: Civil War. They are currently making Avengers: Endgame, so it's good to see that the directors of this movie are returning for the final instalment. If it wasn't for the Captain America movies, they would have been my last choice for this film, but boy didn't they do a good job. At this precise moment, this movie is number 4 in the highest-grossing movies of all time list, but they still have time to take over Star Wars: The Force Awakens, which is in 3rd place. I still can't believe that Avatar and Titanic are still at the top of the list, after so many years. Anyway, Josh Brolin was perfect for Thanos. His facial expressions and deep voice made his character intense, which the role needed. I was a bit sceptical when I heard that the Guardians were going to be involved with, mainly because I thought their comedic personalities would have taken away the intensity of the situation but they also fit in perfectly. The wit that Taika Waititi brought to Thor, was carried into this film, even though he was battered at the beginning, so the directors have obviously been listening to the fans. Bring on the final chapter!

Rating: PG-13, 156 minutes (the longest Marvel film to date)

In a Nutshell: Starring...well....EVERYONE! All of your favorite Marvel superheroes get spotlighted, a difficult task that the Russo brothers capably tackled.

As the 19th film released by Marvel Studios in the past 10 years or so, with more to hit the Big Screen next month and into the summer of 2018, clearly, Marvel is the big boy at the Box Office.

I've been looking forward to this movie for a long time and I don't want to include a bunch of spoilers here, so this review will be, surprisingly, quite short! I want you to be able to experience all of the fun excitement and heartbreaking drama for yourself.

The one word that truly describes this movie is EPIC.

Uplifting theme: · Hope and desperation Sacrifice for others Revenge Love The price of war Friendship, forgiveness, mending old wounds Genocide

Tips for parents: Some profanity, but no F-bombs. LOTS of violence, sometimes with bloody, brutal deaths. Super high dead body count. LOTS of destruction and people in perilous situations. Some characters we have come to know and love actually die in this movie. Your heart will break. It's a bit surprising and especially sad for people who really love these characters. Some creepy, scary monsters and characters.

Things I liked: I loved it when the superheroes met each other for the very first time. The audience I watched the movie with especially howled with laughter when the Guardians of the Galaxy (my favorite Marvel characters) meet Thor. Josh Brolin as Thanos is awesome. Thanos is a truly evil villain because of his motivation. The humor is perfect. The characters play off each other really well with extremely entertaining banter. I'm not a fan of the ""shaky cam"" technique, so I was grateful that the Russo brothers were careful not to use it much. There is, however, a LOT of action, so you'll want to sit towards the back of the theater in order to see it all without getting dizzy. Marvel's storytelling has an unpredictability to it that makes it even more fun for viewers and fans. You just can't always predict what's going to happen. Keep watching after the rolling credits for a final scene that hints at what's to come. The good news is that there is more to come! I love it when Marvel gives Stan Lee a cameo spot. It's always so fun to see where they put him in the movies. Iron Man's new nano-tech uniform was super cool. I adore Paul Betany and loved seeing him ""not"" red for a short time. Fantastic fight and action sequences. Impressive CGI. It's truly amazing what they can do in film nowadays.



Things I didn't like: When you mix that many bigger-than-life characters, the film is bound to be crowded, busy, and uneven in tone. The ending is a bit vague and unfinished. We don't quite know what happened, but one thing is certain...there will be a grand finale! It kind of feels like the Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers, which was good, but somewhat unsatisfying because you knew you'd have to wait another year for the rest of the story. Quite a few Avenger-related characters were not present. You really need to have seen all of the recent Marvel movies in order to understand the back stories of the characters and appreciate the many Easter eggs and jokes.

"rsrkalloe","Incredible","19 July 2021","From start to finish, this movie is fascinating. I can remember being in shock for a couple of hours after leaving a completely silent theather when the movie was over, I guess I wasn't the only one that was shocked. This is the best MCU film by far, the villian is polished and you can understand his motives (even though its crazy). He's very scary and intimidating but weirdly emotional at the same time. I would actually rate this movie a 9.5, I just think the humor is a tad too much and should've been toned down a bit. I've seen this movie many times and it only gets better with every viewing, incredible job marvel.","2"
"sundog-jr","Whatever you're expecting, it's not that.","27 April 2018","Wow.

I just got out of a Thursday night premier, and i have to say... I haven't had a pit of dread in my stomach leaving a Marvel movie before. Ever.

The rest of the movie is great, meaningful action and development happens, it's all great.

But the final stretch... It's a doozy. Like I said in the title, whatever theories you have about the end... Just throw them away. Walk into this movie with an open mind and try and prepare yourself.

This is the darkest Marvel movie so far. I'm anxious to see what the Russo brothers do with Part II next year because I don't know what they're doing at all. It's great, but you will leave this film feeling emotionally ripped to shreds. And it happens like a punch in the gut.

I've already said too much. Go into it without any spoilers, if you can, and just prepare yourself for Thanos.","7"
"pithypip","A fun, daring film, but with problems","30 April 2018","Strengths: Fight scenes were fun. All boom boom smash smash. THOR was badass, and so was Strange. Scar Witch was so great too. Seeing corporation between heroes we've never seen interact with before was pretty refreshing. The pace of the second half of the movie really set you to the edge of your seat. Very thrilling. Sometimes, funny.

Weaknesses: Some things just didn't make sense? Say, Loki's death. After seeing the Hulk unable to put a dent in Thanos, would Loki actually think that his knife would do anything to Thanos at all? Loki's clearly not an idiot.

And also, the asgardians are just gone now? What was the point of the hopeful note at the end of Ragnarok - that home is where the heart is. I guess no hearts needed either.

Above all, Thanos' motives make no sense. His answer to overpopulation is genocide. Great... buuuut, if a single infinity stone, the space stone, can bring infinite power (as we saw in avengers and in the first cap america movie), and a full gauntlet renders the user basically all powerful....? Surely there is a solution other than killing 50% of the universe's population. Can't that big purple head think of a single other solution lol?

Marvel tries to paint him as a villain with a cause, but that cause is pretty ridiculous. As a result, the serious atmosphere they keep trying to build around Thanos, what with his slow, dramatic way of talking etc. falls flat. Compare that to the conflict around the accords in civil war. At least that there was some sort of real dilemma there! It made civil war feel more urgent and tangible.

Not to mention, the whole thing with Gamora is meant to humanise Thanos but, as she says herself, this isn't love. She was abused by him, and they tried to say that all that brainwashing (aka training) he gave her to be his assassin is OK because he 'actually truly loved her'. I imagine the abuse survivors in the audience were feeling pretty great after seeing that.

You could've reduced Gamora to a literal doll, and her interactions with Thanos would barely change. Most of the time, she's just there. We barely see any of the Gamora that we've grown to love in the previous few films.

The plot is repetitive, and a few plot devices are repeated. The ""threaten to torture one person to get the other to give up something"" is used at least THREE times. The plot is: Thanos has stone 1, a fight, stone 2, a fight, stone 3, a fight, etc. until all 6 are on him and he snaps his fingers. The near misses were often just ""the heroes got unlucky"": the battle for the time stone, the final stone with vision (they should've destroyed it ages ago), Thor striking Thanos and ""almost"" getting him. The first time it was interesting, but then it just became annoying.

The idea that ""one person comes before all others"" was the heroic choice??? I don't think there is any reasonable explanation why this is the ethical or moral choice, and we should just accept that this is the basic moral code of every single hero.

Probable because of time constraints, but i felt that most characters were just *there*. They have one or two lines, maybe a one liner that a fan of their solo film will remember. E.g. I don't recall any memorable lines from anyone from Wakanda. It relies a lot on the fact that you've watched every other movie, or there is simply no emotional weighting to any deaths or fights. Feels a bit more like a TV series crossover, in that regard.

Humour was a hit and miss. I admit I laughed, but probably more from the overall tension than the actual humour. The skit with starlord and thor about thor being manlier wasn't very appetising, and dragged on. I missed the humour from Ragnarok. This movie is taking itself way too seriously, for something with so many problems in plot. Ragnarok was great because it dealt with weighty themes, but wasn't afraid to joke at the fact that it was a goofy comic book movie, this movie would've been more fun with a bit more of that added in.

Finally, clearly this was a 'part one' movie, but they should've advertised it as such. Many feel cheated that the ending had no closure at all. We can't mourn because it's likely that everyone's going to just be revived again and no one's 100% dead. some find this a good point, because it's making things exciting, but it's kind of - well, now it's another year before anything else happens.

OVERALL: The Russos did well trying to get something cohesive together for a movie with dozens of characters, each with a backstory that an audience member cherishes. There are some problems overall, and it certainly wasn't the best possible MCU movie because of how loose it felt, but It was exciting and tense for the most part and so I don't regret watching it.","10"
"asifahsankhan","""You're embarrassing me in front of the wizards."" - Tony Stark","17 May 2018","Warning: Major spoilers for Avengers: Infinity War below.

When Avengers: Infinity War opened on April 27th, it exceeded even Disney's own lofty expectations, besting Star Wars: The Force Awakens for the biggest box office opening in history. Given that it's the film meant to bring together all previous 18 movies in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, Infinity War certainly had plenty of audience hype working in its favor. But it also had a secret weapon to help inspire interest: death.

For years now, fans and critics have vocally assumed that when the movie's big bad, Thanos (Josh Brolin) finally came to battle The Avengers face to face, at least one beloved character would end up dead. Some felt it would almost certainly be Captain America (Chris Evans); the constant back-and-forth of contract negotiations made Robert Downey Jr.'s Tony Stark another likely possibility. But as audiences discovered at the end of Infinity War, it wasn't just one character who died. It was half of the team, with Black Panther (Chadwick Boseman), Spider-Man (Tom Holland), Doctor Strange (Benedict Cumberbatch), and Star-Lord (Chris Pratt) just a few of the headliner characters who crumbled to dust when Thanos snapped his Infinity Gauntlet-clad fingers. And that doesn't even count Loki (Tom Hiddleston - who dies meanlessly), Gamora (Zoe Saldana), Heimdall (Idris Elba), and Vision (Paul Bettany), all of whom bit the dust well before the movie's climactic moment.

Thanos slaughtering half the universe, and half the characters built up as stars over the course of the past 10 years, was arresting, shocking, and utterly heartbreaking. It was a stunning ending. There was just one problem: it was totally meaningless.

In the moment, the emotional impact of seeing all of those characters vanish is undeniably powerful. This is a franchise where no topline hero has truly died or even abandoned the series. I've seen the film twice, and both times, the audience in my theater has had the same gasping, horrified visceral reaction. It's a cinematic moment, unlike anything we've seen in modern blockbuster filmmaking. But the best way to gauge viewers' reactions to the ending is watching how they respond to the credits, and what comes after. Marvel fans have gotten used to two extra moments at the end of the studio's films: a mid-credits scene and a post-credits teaser, Infinity War drops the mid-credits scene, and subs in a title card, which crumbles to dust in the same way the fallen Avengers did. Both times I've seen the film, the audience has groaned audibly at that title card, as if they were hoping for some light-hearted moment of reprieve to make everything a little better. (The lone post-credits scene does tease Captain Marvel as a possible savior, but it's hard to get too excited after watching Samuel L. Jackson's Nick Fury disintegrate.)

But the reason savvy movie audiences know to stay for post-credits sequences in the first place is the exact same reason the ending of Infinity War feels so cheap upon further reflection. This is an interconnected cinematic universe, with one movie setting up the next in an escalating series of introductions, team-ups, setbacks, and triumphs. No MCU film operates in isolation. And most fans of the series have an intrinsic awareness at this point that Infinity War sets up both Ant-Man and The Wasp (coming July 2018) and Captain Marvel (set for March 2019), which will inevitably set up the still-untitled Avengers sequel, and so on and so forth.

If Marvel had killed off Captain America or Iron Man, audiences might have believed there would be no walkbacks or resurrections. Their characters have been milked by the MCU in numerous films over a decade, and it would not be hard at all to accept that their time had finally come. Instead, Thanos' grand act of destruction wipes out the characters that represent the future of the franchise. It targets the characters that Marvel's corporate parent, Disney, would simply never let go - especially since some of them already have sequels lined up.

So once audiences step outside the theater and begin thinking about Avengers: Infinity War, what initially felt like a devastating loss begins to feel like the cheapest of stunts. People are just far too aware of the way entertainment is produced, promoted, and consumed to not recognize that none of these horrible deaths are actually going to stick. And to be fair, there is a positive element to that. Beloved characters dying is a downer, and an audience that truly believes their newest favorite character may be gone for good is an audience that could be disincentivized to check out the next Avengers installment when it rolls around. Instead, millions of Black Panther and Spider-Man fans - all of whom know T'Challa and Peter Parker will be back - will head into next year's Avengers movie eager to find out how their favorite characters will survive Thanos' wrath. The plot also sets up a potentially powerful torch-passing moment. The old-school Avengers survived Infinity War, but what if they eventually sacrifice themselves for real, in order to let the new generation of MCU heroes carry on the bigger fight?

But even that calculation on Marvel's part betrays a certain amount of audience meta-awareness, a level of strategic thinking about the way corporations and studios position their intellectual properties to maximize their value across movies, TV shows, books, games, theme parks, and every other vertical possible. It's recognizing movies as pure business, rather than pure storytelling. And that may be the saddest lesson of Infinity War.

I recall seeing The Empire Strikes Back when I was young. At the time, there were just two Star Wars movies. Darth Vader being Luke's father caused all kinds of good-guy vs. bad-guy cognitive dissonance, even for a child. Seeing Han Solo stuck in a block of carbonite and shipped off to a gangster was emotionally devastating, but it seemed all too possible that his story was over. There was no ongoing production pipeline to feed or larger ecosystem that required these characters to exist in perpetuity. The movie's cliffhanger ending set up a sequel, but there were no guarantees about how any of the storylines would actually turn out.

It was a simpler time, and not just because we were younger. It was simpler because individual movies were still their own primary driving force. For audiences, there was no certainty about what could or couldn't happen when a storyline decided to get dark. For the simple experience of cinematic storytelling, it was a purer experience. In the days since I first saw Infinity War, I've wondered how its ending would have played in that environment. I would have been outraged, to be sure - but that outrage would have led to an even more potent catharsis when some of these ""dead"" characters inevitably return to the land of the living.

Instead, we got a facsimile of loss, a moment where audiences go through the motions, aghast that a movie had the guts to kill off a leading character, without having to deal with any messy emotional ramifications. In a way, it does seem like the most Marvel approach possible. These are comic book movies, where nobody can really die - even after we see them turn to ash.","6"

"Bored_Dragon","Series finale","18 May 2018","Last night I went to the cinema to watch ""Infinity War"" and I wasn't thrilled at all. I'm aware that it's partly my fault, but anyway I think it's extremely overrated. Seen by itself, the film is completely meaningless, because this is not a stand-alone film, but the grand finale of all Marvel films that precede it. So, it's not just recommended that you have seen most of Marvel films before, but it's absolutely necessary that you have seen them all and that they are fresh in your memory. I watched most of Marvel films, but some of them I skipped, and many of those I did see I saw too long ago to remember them, so ""Infinity War"" left me with the impression of a bunch of amazingly shot, but empty action scenes, without the story that gives this action a meaning. It's like if you watched the last hour of ""The Return of the King"", without previously watching the rest of the trilogy or reading ""The Lord of the Rings"" ever before. Most movies have a part that introduces you to characters, then introduces them into a story, then develops and elaborates the story, and ultimately takes you through the blow-away finale. This whole movie is one huge finale, while all the other elements that you need to experience this finale right way need to be found in other Marvel films. Each of the previous films brings new characters, introduces you to them and connects them to the characters from the previous films, builds their mutual relationships and portrays small parts of the big picture, and then ""Infinity War"" puts all these characters together and, assuming you already know who they are, what their relationships are and what was happening in their individual stories, it immediately cast you right into two and a half hour of action madness, without any characterization and explanations, and with a minimum of the story that serves just to separate the action scenes. Marvel films are a literally series in which the episodes are somewhat independent, and this is the last episode, and do not even try to watch it if you didn't follow entire series. Although visually excellent, to me ""Infinity War"" was terribly confusing and even boring, and I will refrain from rating it until I see all the movies that precede him, and then repeat it with good background.","1"

"TyJustice","A cinematic triumph 10 years in the making.","30 April 2018","Reflecting back on the over dozen previous entries into the Marvel Cinematic Universe, it's clear that this is what we've been building toward for about a decade and it certainly pays off. From the first time Nick Fury showed up in an end credits scene and let us know that an MCU was about to takeoff, to the first time Thanos showed up in an end credit scene and told us that he was a threat to be afraid of, all the anticipation built to Avengers: Infinity War and the Russo brothers tell an awe inspiring story that makes the 10 year wait well worth it.

What may be a setback of the film for some more casual movie-goers, is that the film certainly doesn't hold your hand or spend anytime introducing you to the heroes of the MCU. You're expected to be familiar with large scale events that took place previously in the universe and the characters who are involved in it. I for one, am thankful they went this route as I don't possibly see any way that this story could have been told in it's time constraint with character reintroductions at every turn. The movie is fast paced chaos and the tone as set right off the bat.

The CGI is near perfection. Thanos, a near full CGI villain with motion capture done by Josh Brolin, is truly brought to life. It's always good to be wary with CGI villains since we so often see them fail miserably, but Thanos was pulled into our reality by the animators with every minute facial expression, squint, and wince. The brilliant voiceover work by Josh Brolin certainly helped establish the villain as well.

The performances by the massive, wonderful cast are all done to near perfection. No one misses a beat and they all stay true to their characters, which is also a testament to how well the Russo brothers worked with the task of bringing MCU characters into their film who were previously established by other minds in their own standalone films.

That's all I want to get into to spare spoiling anything, but I can't recommend this enough. If you haven't seen an MCU film prior to this one, I highly suggest checking out at least the previous two Avengers films if not the entire MCU before arriving to this film.","4"
"dwankan","Weak Entry in the MCU Series","7 January 2019","The Marvel films are not high art, nor are they great entertainment, but they're fun for what they are: cheesy, brainless action fests with some shallow character development to make them feel like they have at least some microscopic depth. I love them, but I'm not under any delusion that they're something wonderful. This film is even further from wonderful than the series has offered so far. The plot is piled high with so many concurrent stories, they all come out as underdeveloped. If you want just a hodge podge of fights and shooting, you'll love this, but there isn't much else going on, at all, and even that aspect of it is disappointing. At a certain point in the film, random Marvel characters just start showing up out of nowhere, as if they'd given up on creating a reason for them to be there. The worst part of the movie is the ridiculous monster Thanos. He's unoriginal, uninteresting, and the animation of his absurd face, body, and clothing are so obviously fake, I felt like I was watching a cartoon whenever he was on screen. I didn't like him when I first saw him in Guardians: I thought he was a silly, cartoonish monster bad guy, and I was greatly disappointed that he headlined this film. Unfortunately, the goofy, kid-bate aspects of movies like Guardians and Ant Man have taken over the entire franchise because otherwise, they would have written a more interesting antagonist for this one. And what's with the beard, or the wrinkles that look like a beard; just another example of how silly Thanos is as a character. Be warned if you haven't seen this one: it's got a ""sad"" and rather abrupt ending. I admire them for trying to break the standard a bit, but it felt forced and unfinished because, I'd guess, the writers aren't used to having such an ending for such a film. It doesn't work, by the way.","6"
"jordanjack-32395","THE Movie... must see","29 April 2018","Wow. I can't even. This movie is a masterpiece. It's an unbelievable culmination of the amazing 10 years that has been the MCU. It's an epic, entertaining spectacle with tons of great one-liners and epic action sequences, but at its core it's a very emotionally driven film that is gut wrenching to watch unfold.

First off, huge props to the Russo brothers for directing this thing. I can't even imagine the sheer size and task of directing this movie. Yet they pull it off to near perfection. It's a masterfully directed film. So many A-listers and characters and yet they merge all of the storylines together and find ways to get each character they're moments.

Now the movie may be titled as an avengers movie but this movie is essentially about the villain, Thanos. Yet Thanos is not an ordinary villain. He is an intriguing and intelligent character with a true motive. Josh Brolin gives the standout performance of the movie (which given the level of acting talent in this film is very impressive) His performance was great. I felt legitimate fear whenever thanos was on screen.

This movie was everything I wanted and more. It delivered to all the hype. And it set up a possibly even better and more epic sequel. This movie was so good it made me forget I was watching a movie and the intrigue and emotion I felt was real and genuine. I'm going to go as far to say that it's not just the best avengers movie, not just the best marvel movie but one of the greatest movies ever made. Wow, what an accomplishment.","8"

Yay, I was wrong.

Seriously, they did a good enough job. They focused on Gomorrah, Thor, and Strange and Stark enough to make a plot despite the insane amount of characters. And the rest they used as filler, with only the Vision story coming up a bit light due to population.

And the Vision story was a bit of a draw back. It was there but it wasn't, but at least it was there, it was important, but it seemed tertiary and a little too much so.

The Humor was also scaled back. But Spider Man did a good job, Cap had a few and laughs,and yet again, it was only Panther and the Wakandans that took themselves too seriously to be in a Marvel movie.

I'm sorry, someone really needs to tell the MCU that it is fine if the Black Panther cracks a smile or a one-line once or twice. We won't mind.

The tone was more action than action/comedy...but with ""War"" in the title, you kind of expect that.

However, they do NOT even address the elephant in the room...why did Widow go blond? Was it to have more fun or was it simply because she was on the run. The world may never know.

What we do know is that we missed Hawkeye, even if he is on and off again retired. And we missed Ant-Man, but given how many people were here, the absences were noted but not really noticed.","5"
"thpmorrisey","Marvel takes it to the next level.","25 April 2018","Ever since the massively successful experiment in shared universe building that was the original Avengers, it has felt somewhat like Marvel have been cruising along at the same level. Although there have been plenty of excellent films in the meantime, nothing has really matched the relative scope and ambition of that first Avengers film, best encapsulated by the somewhat disappointingly formulaic Age of Ultron. Infinity War feels like that game changer, and Marvel upping a gear, showcasing a level of ambition in terms of scope of story and characters only seen before in adaptations of epic fantasy such as Lord of the Rings and Harry Potter, in fact several times the film put me in mind of Return of the King. In terms of what is a purely cinematic narrative (based of course on decades of comics) the sheer scale of the film is surely unique. Despite a run time of two hours forty minutes, the film rarely drags due to a break neck pace that never lets up, there is none of the dull opening exposition and set up that often hurts these films. On the down side, this is likely to leave those who aren't caught up on the series somewhat lost, while it is not essential to have seen every single Marvel film, it is probably important to have seen a large proportion of them. It also finally feels like Marvel has overcome it 'Villain Problem', similar to the success of Michael B Jordan's character in Black Panther, Josh Brolin's Thanos is an excellent antagonist, with tangible motives and an engaging presence. What is perhaps most remarkable about the film is that, it manages its large cast so effectively, not a single moment is wasted and all major characters have their moment to shine, all thanks to the incredibly efficient pacing and stucture. Infinity War feels like the best film it could be. The vast scope means that it is impossible for it to quite engage on the same level as the more 'low key' solo entries in the genre, and the necessities of the fast pacing make it exhausting watching at times. Ultimately though, the film is a wild ride and emotional roller-coaster that is not to be missed for fans of the franchise.","10"

It contains a gripping (SLIGHTLY sporadic) storyline although certainly makes the audience feel apart of the movie, it also executes astutely to fine details the vastness of the universe portrayed through the sheer amount of characters who all have their individualised storylines. Without saying...although in this case it appears that this needs to be said; this particular movie requires a certain level of schematic knowledge in order to PROFOUNDLY enjoy helping the comprehension of key parts in the movie, unless each individual does this and undergoes the ""Phases"" then they cannot fault this movie at all.... the action and scenes may even entice them into exploring this universe. An example of a common ""fault"" is that it is ""too CGI dependant"" ... it's a freaking superhero movie?! 'Out of this world' and all that shenanigans...

"PyroSikTh","Best Line in the Trailers Wasn't Even in the Movie. 2/10.","26 April 2018","To call this an Avengers movie feels a bit off. The Avengers are in it for sure, as are the Guardians of the Galaxy, but this is more Thanos' film. He takes centre stage, soaking up all the best parts. Even when he's not on screen, his presence permeates and threatens. His quest for the Infinity Stones has officially begun. The film opens with him already having taken the Power Stone from Xandar, and is well on his way to getting the Space Stone from Loki.

As openings go, this is up there for establishing the sheer threat Thanos poses to each and every character we've grown to love over the last decade. I mean, the guy beats Hulk into a pulp without using any stones at all, and he only grows more and more powerful as the film goes on. The stakes have never been higher in an MCU movie. The threat of permanent character death is very, very real, and no-one is above it. I won't spoil who dies, but some are easy guesses, and others come out the left field. In truth there's definitely a sense of unpredictability thanks to the pure power Thanos can unleash. He quite literally crashes a moon down into a planet, turns weapons into bubbles, and by the end can even rewind time to suit his needs. And of course that fabled snap of the fingers marks the climax of the movie.

But the real strength of Thanos comes from the treatment of his character. He could quite possibly be the single greatest villain in the MCU thanks to how he's developed. He's unyielding and horrifically strong even without the power of the gauntlet, but he also shows vulnerabilities, and acts out of a misplaced sense of moral philosophy. He's not just evil for evil's sake, he has clear definable goals that aren't entirely incorrect. He seeks balance and paradise, ultimately just wanting to make the universe a better place for everyone. He cares about life in all its forms and sees what he's doing as a necessary evil to save everyone.

What really took me aback is how emotional the movie is (Oh boy, spoilers). While it doesn't let up in it's unrelenting fight scenes and sense of dread, it still takes the time to ponder on how it makes everyone feel. I actually really felt for Gamora and Thanos respectively, not just at poignant moments, but in general considering everything they've endured together. When Gamora appears to kill Thanos, it's not triumphant but full of grief. While she hates him to the end, he was still her father figure. Likewise when he has to sacrifice her later on, he mourns throughout the rest of the movie, because he really did love his favourite daughter. She wasn't just a tool for him; he forgave her betrayals precisely because he loved her so much. As misguided as his methods seem, he still managed to show a human element that not only made him relatable, but also made him oddly likeable - he shows a vulnerability beneath his powerful capabilities that gives him the greatest depth of any MCU villain. But above all it was Peter Parker that broke me, watching those around him fade out of existence, and then feeling the very same come over him - heightened by his enhanced senses. He's just a scared teenager facing the ultimate existential crisis, and his pleading to stay genuinely made my tear ducts fill. Dear god Tom Holland can act.

And yet through all of the dread, the constant threat of death, and the sheer emotional heartbreak, Infinity War manages to keep its head above water with succinct, natural humour that manages to make you laugh out loud. Of course a lot of this is down to simple character interactions, like Rocket asking to buy Bucky's metal arm, or Star-Lord becoming envious of Thor's physique. This is the Avengers movie where unrelated franchises smash together and we're gifted with odd interaction after odd interaction, and each and every one manages to find humour without forcing it out

Entertaining character interactions aren't just restricted to comedy though. The Avengers movies, as well the various team-ups between them, have been defined by how each hero comes together as a cohesive team when taking down a foe, whether it's Thor and Captain America creating a shockwave between hammer and shield, or Hawkeye shooting Ant-Man into Iron Man's suit. Infinity War is no exception, and the behemoth cast extends the options a little further. Doctor Strange creates portals for Spider-Man to jump through and stepping stones for Star-Lord, Bucky dual-wields a machine gun in one hand and Rocket in the other, Bruce Banner takes the Hulkbuster out for a spin when Hulk refuses to show up, Groot creates a weapon handle for Thor out of his own arm, as well as quite a few others.

On that note, the action is simply top-notch. It's unrelenting from the Thanos vs Hulk fight in the opening all the way up to the infamous snap. There always seems to be an action scene going on somewhere, and the character combos I mentioned above are only scratching the surface of the amount of cool stuff that goes on. Thanos himself is a powerhouse, especially once he gets the reality stone, and the way he uses them all is hugely creative. There's one particular fight between Thanos and Doctor Strange that is the epitome of mind-bending as they hurl spells at one another (in Doctor Strange's case, literally). It's all so fluid and stylish. Not only that but the epic scale and unrelenting nature of the action scenes make it feel like an actual war rather than just a small skirmish at an airport, and how it managed to fit it all in and make space for the more emotional beats without ruining the pace blows my mind. Top notch editing for sure.

The CGI is pretty incredible for the most part as well. The Black Order are brought to life by their visual effects, but it's Thanos who really shines, showing each and every hair on the back of his neck and side of his face. The sheer attention to detail is staggering. Beyond that the CGI doesn't stifle Josh Brolin's ability to act at all, and Thanos' personality is palpable through his facial expressions alone. On the other side of the coin though, there's some truly terrible visual effects work when it comes to Hulkbuster and Warmachine. There's a shot very late on where Banner and Rhodey appear in their armour without helmets on, but the blending is so bad that their heads just look stuck on. This corner-cutting for some of the visual effects, especially considering how utterly fantastic other effects are, is pretty much my only criticism of the whole movie.

But I think I've rambled on enough. Infinity War was everything I wanted it to be and more. It surpasses every other effort in the MCU (a claim I really hope I don't go back on as the film sinks in over time and multiple rewatches). Thanos is the greatest villain there is, showing heartbreaking vulnerabilities as well as being a complete and utter badass (although his line about putting a smile on his face was irksomely absent), the humour is genuinely very funny, but also natural and comes about organically through simple character interactions, the stakes are real as characters do die, permanently, and the status quo is forever changed by the movie's close. I don't feel it's that bold a claim to say Infinity War is the MCU's Empire Strikes Back in more ways than one. I almost want to give it a perfect 10/10 straight out of the gate, but for now I'll settle for a still extremely respectable 9/10. My heart was genuinely racing long after the credits rolled, and that can only be a good sign.","7"
"pjbridges_28","A freaking 10!","7 May 2018","I don't give very many movies a 10 ... actually none at all, besides this one. The reason is, there is not really a dull moment in the movie. I actually cheered and clapped at one point in the movie. You'll know when it happens ;). The action is there, the comedy is where it should be. They did a great job in balancing out all the marvel characters into this amazing movie. If you haven't seen it yet and are reading these reviews to see whether or not "" it's the movie for you."" Do you self a favor to all of us. Don't see it. You my friend are not worthy. :). Just watch it ! Thank you for everyone who participated in making this movie possible.

I thank you.","1"
"kaustubh-rajnish","A Near Impossible Task","27 April 2018","The task set out for infinity war is near impossible from a cinematic perspective.

18 movies culminate into this. 10 years of MCU. Over 7 different story arcs, over 70 characters some 20 of which are superheroes and are so thick that they have entire movie franchises built on them and another 30 easily deserve their own movie. And then you need a single villain large enough to take on so many of these superheroes and yet prove more formidable than all other villains who have ever graced the MCU. Not to mention the need to maintain the tonality of a guardians and sync it with the mysticism of a doctor strange and then blend it with the royalty of a Black Panther. All directed by different directors in different styles. And finally make all this live up to the hype. Make all character's count and earn fans, critics and the masses adoration alike. It is fair to say that nothing quite like this has been attempted to date in movie history. From the onset this is a near impossible task.

And believe it or not Avengers: Infinity War delivers and delivers it with an action packed, genuinely funny and yet emotional punch.

So let's begin with the central theme of the film. From frame one you have Thanos walking in and in the first ten minutes you know what you are in for. Anything is possible is Inifinity War and the Russo brothers' vision is going to be as uncomprising as maybe Thanos' own vision of the universe. To be fair this is an out and out Thanos story. He is the central character and with 20+ superheroes, this is a wise script move.

No matter how well you understand the MCU nothing can prepare you for Thanos. His vision is evil yet logical. His methods psychopathic yet emotional. And his power is cruel yet absolute. Even if CGI, Josh Brolin's Thanos will go down in history as one of the top ten villians of all time.

Meanwhile the Avengers and the Guardians assemble together in bits and pieces trying to take on Thanos and his henchmen (who btw may look like Harry Potter rejects but are formidable in their own sense particulary Ebony Maw who floats around and has this eer ie philosophy of expecting victims to welcome death). These fights happen in various parts of the universe with only one objective to prevent the eponymous infinity stones from being taken by Thanos.

The genuinely laugh out loud ego clashes and the interactions of these super egoed super heroes are a highlight of the film but the laughter soon turns into mayhem as soon as Thanos' shadow falls on the scene. There are at least 7 story arcs mostly about love family and relationship and how far will characters go to sacrifice to get to their goals including Thanos. What is astonishing is that there is something for every character. You have this epic scene with Thor, another great one with Dr. Strange, the Guardians light up the screen every time they come on it with their unintended humour and then there is the whole black panther brigade - royal, clinical and deadly.

Mixing all of this together and making it a heart stopping 150 mins is the true cinematic achievement of Infinity war. The last 20 mins is like a Marvel movie on Flakka. Before you can even digest what is happening, it's already happened. It is undoubtedly the unmissable movie of the year and arguably of the decade and if you are an MCU fan watch it before you start noticing the spoilers. As Thanos says ""Dread it. Run from it. Destiny will still arrive.""

Speaking of spoilers - SPOILER ALERT The end credits scene literally spells out what will happen next and if Infinity War 2 will have this character in it then rest assured Kevin Feige is setting up an even more massive MCU part II. Cant wait for part 2 and the interim film that is essential.","10"

"jayjaymadigan","A boring mess","16 February 2021","So lockdown broke me and I finally decided to watch the MCU movies, I enjoyed some of them (Civil War was very good) others not so much (looking at you, Dark World)

I finally watched Infinite War and dear god, there is far too much going on to feel invested in anything properly, plus the god damn stupid ""comedy"" moments just ruin the entire atmosphere, it's clear Disney is scared of making a serious comic book movie and is responsible for people writing off comic book movies as children's films.

A film about half of the universe being eradicated should feel grim and hopeless, Mass Effect 3 and Neon Genesis did this perfectly, this however, felt like a comedy film that was scared to be a comedy yet still went all in on corny unnecessary jokes.

Infinity War feels confused, like its having an identity crisis, is it a film about heroes trying to stop an alien being destroying half of all organic life? Or is it a feel good comedy romp? Why not both? Well why not indeed, so that's what Disney did and you end up with a movie that wants to be taken seriously and make you laugh at the exact same time and it just simply does not deliver on either of those things for me, how many times do characters need to go off the rails and start having petty school yard arguments or sarcastic comments? It's like trying to watch Saving Private Ryan and seeing someone stand on a rake at the Normandy beach landing, it feels out of place.

But the problem is not just the jokes, nothing fits in properly, it's a mess, Disney truly threw everything at the wall to see what would stick.

The worst thing is Marvel stans will continue to insist that these films are not kids films, they are, there's nothing wrong with that but they are marketed for kids, throwing in a few swear words and basic entry level philosophy doesn't change that, but these CGI blockbusters are being touted as some of the best films ever made when they're nothing more than a bit of fun made by a billion dollar company to flog merchandise to kids and man children.

This was a very dissapointing experience overall, I'm dreading watching the next one now.","10"
"taz1004","Spiderman is NOT Ironman's sidekick!!!!","28 April 2018","I really really hate what MCU is doing with Spider-Man. Whenever they do popularity vote on all the superheroes, Spider-Man always comes in 3rd behind Superman and Batman. Which makes him the most popular Marvel superhero. Yet MCU just turns him into a whiny sidekick of Ironman who constantly seeks his approval. And the suit all made by Tony Stark. Come on man. This is ""THE"" Spider-Man. This is why I hated Homecoming too. They're destroying Spider-Man.

I still can't understand a word Chadwick says and he still can't act.

Other than that, I enjoyed it. I liked the fact that they put more personality and character to Thanos and he's not just mindless destroyer like most villains. I don't like how the movie's ending leaves you hanging but I think it was necessary to display the power of the Infinity Gauntlet.

Few other disappointment was no Adam Warlock and Hawkeye. Not sure if Warlock will appear on next one... although writers confirmed he wont be. But they showed the teaser of him at end of GG vol2 post-credit scene and have him omitted for Infinity War is a crime.","10"
"mvpdom","It is a great movie and one of the best in the MCU!!","30 December 2018","Just having all these characters in one movie together makes for a great movie. With the large cast you are always going to run into the problem of the movie being cluttered. The crew did a great job balancing it and it only ever hurts the movie when we return to one story line then I realize that we had been away from them for a while. The build up is well of 10 years really pays off except that it seems that the tension and the build up had died down after civil war. This is not really a problem with the movie its self, but going forward we already have movies announced for ""dead"" characters. And from the moment I watched it for the first time I can agree that it will be undone. Upon re watch there was ) emotional weight to that scene when there should be. When it is most likely undone in the next movie it will be making that scene almost pointless. Though it is a great movie that lived up to the hype they had the story lines from other movies continued through other movies. The action was great and almost everything else. Thanos is a great villain who does succeed and is a well crafted character. This is a great movie and I think my biggest problem with it is that they set it up to have more ways to mess it up in Endgame.","1"
"Darth_Osmosis","Unbelievable.. not to be missed!","25 April 2018","Lives up to the hype and then some! It has everything you could wish from a cinematic event 10 years in the making. All the characters are where we last saw them and this means we'll be taking a ride from places like Brooklyn and Wakanda to many different corners of the cosmos and it does not disappoint! The scenery is always varied and provides some of the most amazing backdrops to this universe wide adventure. The action scenes are fierce, full of emotion and pack a serious punch. As always with the Avengers movies, the character interactions are almost worth the price of admission alone! During an action sequence you are more often than not both afraid to blink, cough or chew cause you might miss something. The stakes have never been higher and this is felt throughout the movie, yet the humor has not been forgotten, it's not in the style of ""Thor Raganarök"" if you were worried about that, but no character is suddenly grim or dark just for the sake of it, everyone acts like you'd think they would. Which brings me to Thanos.. this dude is intimidating as hell, but has a complex personality and is definitely not just evil for evil's sake! Josh Brolin does a great job bringing him to life. The rest of the cast is as good as they have ever been, or perhaps even better since many of them have had so much time in these roles already. It truly is something you want to see on the big screen, maybe more than once!","5"
"kanyid","Let the morons all die!","3 May 2019","Seriously! There are so many plot fails. For example when Thanos is battling Iron Man why not just turn all his missiles into bubbles like you did with Quill's gun?

Everyone wants to save everyone and in the end they lose most of them. Awesome! They got exactly what they deserved.

They say they want to stop trillions from dying but then make stupid decisions.

Loki what the heck. Let's just hand over the tesseract. You barely care for anyone anyway, so why get mushy now.

Gamora should have committed suicide before her sister was tortured. She wanted to die anyway.

Gamora should have let her sister die rather than just handing over the location.

They almost get the glove off and Quill goes all stupid and punches Thanos. Yes, the world is about to end so let's do stupid stuff. Thank heavens he dies.

Dr. Strange should have let Iron Man die but would rather let millions die. Good choice. And then he dies.

Vision wanted to die but no one would destroy the stone. He dies anyway. Twice actually.

It's brilliant. All these smart people doing stupid stuff. You can't even explain their behavior by pulling the ""morally right"" card because there are only a couple heroes that fit that bill.

"Mike_T-Little_Mtn_Sound_Archive","Not much to add, but wow!","20 March 2019","Quite honestly, there isn't much to add in a review that hasn't been said multiple times already, so I'll say this:

I am not, nor have I even been a comic book guy. Even at 45, I've never had an interest. That means that I have no major understanding or connection to the Marvel characters and universerse beyond what the movies feed me. Thankfully, my 16 year old son doesn't get tired of telling me the backstory on certain characters, places, or origins if I want more information on specifics in any of the movies.

This particular film had a lot going on, as there were so many different groups of super heroes on various pieces of the quest. Not that I couldn't follow it, but it was definitely more than a typical Marvel flick.

Overall, this was just a pretty darn incredible flick. The writing was good, the acting was no different than I've come to expect in a Marvel flick, the direction was good, the sound was superb, the fx were absolutely MARVELous, and the production was simply out of this world. Those facets combined made for a great viewing experience. When I saw the duration of nearly 2 1/2 hours I was a little turned off, but after the first 45 minutes, the need for such a lengthy film was obvious, and by the time it finished it certainly hadn't felt like 2 1/2 hours. That's a good thing! Though I must admit...seeing all these Super Heroes die made me wonder what Marvel has up their sleeve, as they can't just kill off a bunch of dudes (and dudettes) who pay the bills for the studio. My son's theory is that they are trapped - or being kept- in the soul stone, but I think it will have more to do with the time stone. Either way, with the next one hitting theatres in 2019, we should find out soon.

Very enjoyable, action packed eye candy of a movie.","8"
"debjyoti1981","Cinematic Opulence !!","29 April 2018","When Kevin Feige brought in Russo brothers to direct Captain America: The Winter Soldier, no one anticipated them to be handling the holy grail of Marvelverse, the Infinity War.

Synopsis: To balance the universe from desolation, Thanos aims to snuff away half of its lifeform, which he believes can be done if he yields all the six infinity stones viz., reality, time, power, space, soul & mind. However, his imposing plan gets stalled by earth's mightiest heroes 'The Avengers' & 'Guardians of Galaxy'.

What MCU had been lacking for so long, was a perfect villain. Loki did impose his mischief charisma in his earlier outings like in 'The Avengers' or 'Thor' but it never was as intimidating & terrifying as Josh Brolin's exhibition of Thanos. He not only nailed the character but demonstrated what a perfect nemesis can be, which not just dictates audience but admiration. Of course, his minions, the members of Black Order were no less daunting, look out for the character Ebony Maw flawlessly depicted by Tom Vaughan-Lawlor.

Kudos for putting in so many characters & yet making it perfectly balanced with coherent plot. Each member gets his & her share to shine. The action sequences were prodigious, something which we now are acquainted with & expect nothing short of spectacular from such franchise.

Infinity War has ventured into an uncharted path, where very few movies will ever dare to do; stakes were high for Anthony & Joe Russo, as it could have gone either way as it did with last year's Justice League. It took a decade of meticulous planning of interlaced stories to finally unleash the wrath of mad titan. Did it pay off? Hell yeah, what did you expect! Infinity War is not just a movie but a cinematic phenomenon, ready to awe & shock the reactionary followers of MCU franchise & general audiences alike. Be ready to be blown away.","10"

"robloxdemonstl","Justice league standards","2 October 2018","The IMDB rating of 8.6 / 10 is undeserved, most of the 10-starers mention the 18 movies coming before it. It's like reviewing a TV series episode based on every other episode, it's misleading. This means, the MCU is 8.6 / 10 but infinity war is closer to a 6-7.

Pros:

Great if you want action.

Thanos is a great villain, intimidating, great backstory, motivation, it's all there.

There are mysteries for you to solve, it may be well written, but the movie is so long with so much miscellanious stuff that it becomes impossible to realize.

All your favorite characters are there.

I don't have much more to say.

Cons:

Because this acts as a TV show episode, because the ""TV show"" is the MCU, we have to sit here with 1-dimensional characters(thanos's minions especially, as they were never introduced in the MCU), a plot which might be possible to come up with as you go along(doesn't mean there isn't one) and inconsistant characters(hulk is scared, but i don't have a problem with that, thor can't use lightning without his weapon like in thor: ragnarok, scarlet witch gets beaten by a black order member, then holds of thanos with 4 stones).

I understand thanos may be hesitating because guardians of the galaxy establishes the power of the infinity stones(atleast 1 of them). But even then a simple black order member wouldn't be more effective than 4 stones.

The 2-part thing is going to be another stereotypical superhero thing, heroes win.

Even in a movie about action it is possible to get bored, my family had to watch this in segments.

When thanos snaps his fingers, the last infinity stone he gets is the mind stone(vision's head) and the fact that there is no evidence that the MCU between 2018-2019 become affected by it, despite thanos saying it's supposed to occur randomly. Characters are affected, even if sequels are planned for them(spiderman, doctor strange, black panther). But i doubt that any new character they add to avengers 4 will talk about the snapping fingers emotional effects on them.

If you don't want a potential plot for avengers 4, don't look beyond this wall. ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Avengers 4 will be more predictable than this to me: Thanos tries to control the avengers, someone snaps them out of it. Prepare to face thanos(unless they already have). Bangs and booms(potentially more travel). Final battle ends with removal of gautlet. Reverse snapping fingers(gamora and heimdall R.I.P)","10"
"robloxdemonstl","According to IMDB, Nearly as good as LOTR?, too much of a tank for that!","1 September 2018","///SPOILERS, IF YOU REGRET CLICKING THE SHOW BUTTON\\\ The plot seems mostly summerized in 10 words: A villain boards a spacecraft, character sent to earth, mostly fights from here on. I can understand it's an end-game movie but the same rules apply everywhere.

Section 1: Plot armour

Ok, i can tolerate Hulk being overpowered, but there is more than that.

Thanos is about to lose the infinity gautlet when peter quill screws up, and stark only asks him nicely to avoid engaging thanos in the meantime. Doesn't peter know half the universe is at stake?, i can understand a loved one dying, but when a lot of other friends are at stake?, WOW! ///MAJOR SPOILERS\\\ Dr. strange GIVES thanos the time stone, what?, isn't half of the universe more important than 1 life?, Dr. strange may doubt that a infinity stone is destructable by anything, but with the time stone, as shown in his own movie, could reverse destruction and decay of an apple by sending it back to it's earlier state. It is clear 1 life isn't as important as half the universe, and the ability to reverse wounds from thor which would have killed thanos without the time stone.

Wouldn't all of the above mean that avengers 4 would be an idiot plot?, as it wouldn't exist if it wasn't for the decisions above.

Section 2: The ability to stand on it's own

The movie has little character development, i understand that 18 movies are prequels to this, but if you can't write a review without using that fact, then you're not reviewing a movie anymore, but instead the entire MCU.

So, IW has little character development, which the rest of the MCU has plenty of.

Though lots of characters die, which is the least Cliché thing i've seen in a while, there's more to a good movie.

Overall, the humour was pretty funny by modern standards.



Section 3: Villain

Then there is the big bad supervillain Thanos, who actually isn't really evil at all it seems as he really cares about Gamorra and is actually trying to save the universe. So that leaves me feeling a bit ambiguous and confused. They also really underused Groot, he just hangs about doing not very much and to top it off, they kill Groot in the end (along with mostly everybody else) How on earth can you kill Groot? That is just sad and depressing, like this movie. So sorry but everything that I loved about all the Marvel movies is just thrown to the side for this film.

Reasons it was cool: Visually pleasing and smooth CGI (minus Bruce Banner's head in the hulk iron man suit [WTF?]) Thanos looked good though!

Great mesh of the different characters (Thor and Guardians of the Galaxy).

I enjoyed the emphasis on Thanos as his story is quite interesting; naturally a stand-alone movie would be nice.

This movie raised the stakes! Maybe our heroes AREN'T as immortal as we thought?

Reasons it was not cool:

Criminal underuse and screen time for some of the cooler Marvel characters like Dr. Strange, Captain America, and Black Panther. I get that it is an ensemble film on steroids, but felt shortchanged with regards to them in particular.

Thanos seemed overpowered at times, not allowing for enough actual war or conflict

It misses the mark a little near the middle of the second half, but not catastrophically. Altogether it's a uniquely imaginative and ambitious ride. The action is pretty much non-stop and each actor's contribution takes the whole production a little bit higher. I would not have thought this kind of group effort possible, but it's almost as if everyone in the production felt the need to give it their all. Kudos to the directors, Anthony and Joe Russo, who have never tackled such a large project before. They definitely have the sensibilities and eye to make a movie rock.

If I had to rank the performances, I'd have to say Chris Hemsworth, Zoe Saldana, Benedict Cumberbatch, Josh Brolin and Chris Pratt were my personal favorites though I'd hate to do without any of the rest.","10"

I found the previous ones especially the old ones like Iron man 1-3, Captain America and Thor series well-designed in story-line and also logical. But Infinity War is nothing like one of those. It felt rushed together and senseless. Each hero just ""feed"" themselves to Thanos one by one after showing off their coolest abilities. Loki as a trickster decided to go one on one face to face with Thanos. You can argue that he tried his best and didnt wanna go quietly into the night. Its heroic but also foolish and it 's simply not something loki would do in my opinion. The war happened in Wakanda. The people mastered laser surgery on infinity stone and the best shield barrier technology i have ever seen but still use spears as their main weapon. The war scene looked a lot like one of the star war movies. And the best part is they decided to open the barrier to protect Vision for his laser surgery, which didnt work at all btw. Well, if you know its Vision they are after, why dont you put the barrier around him instead of forcing to open the barrier. And where were the air support? It looks a lot cooler to go melee against melee with aliens. My dear Winter Soldier is completely useless in this movie even though he got his arm back but only knows how to shoot with M4 and keep getting one-shotted. Why not cast Ant-man instead then? Why wasting precious scene on him just because his buddy is symbol of USA? Not to mention, when Thanos at his weakest, Peter Quill who is so-called guardian of the galaxy paid no attention with the gloves which contains the most important objects in the Universe and key to winning the war but focusing on asking where his girlfriend is and wake up Thanos, who was under control of his teammates. How dare you ask ""did we lose""? Its so ironic that Thor who had millions of combat in him 1500 year of life decided to aim his newly-made axe to the chest of Thanos. I mean did you see the shining armor he's wearing? Can you please cut his hand off or ""go for the head"" or play around with your teammates and not showing off with your weapon at last after teammates are down and lose the war. The movie is full of flaws like these. Thanos is well-fed with each one of our be-loved heroes and grew from quite strong into unstoppable. Good game and well played, guys!","10"

Almost all characters get to shine, Thanos is a brilliant villain with real emotions and motivations. The cgi and directing were great and the ending was amazing! Acting is solid as well but Tom Holland steals the show, especially towards the end of the movie! Only complaints i have are: very mediocre score, the Black Order was incredibly overhyped and all in all very disappointing, Banner not changing into the Hulk was ok from a certain standpoint and made narrative sense but it was preety disappointing, the battle of Wakanda wasn't as good as its Titan counterpart and Shuri is in this, I'm sorry but her character is so awful and annoying that i consider her mere existence to be a flaw. Anyways its only natural that a movie trying to balance 20 something different characters has a few flaws. It's funny (most jokes surprisingly enough land), atmospheric, it is not afraid to take risks, it brings out the best of most characters, it features a great villain and it's all in all better than it ever had the right to be! This movie gets an 8.5/10 from me (might have been a 9 if they didn't make Shuri outsmart Banner).","10"
"jessrivest","Better than the other two avengers movies, but not by much","15 May 2018","I'm a huge fan of the MCU, and the past few movies have been incredible. The build up to this movie was unprecedented, but I didn't think it lived up to the hype. There were a few funny moments, and the characters had equal and balanced amounts of screen time. However, that's where any positive comments I could make about this movie end. Every plot line that had been built in the last phase of movies was destroyed in the first 20 minutes of the movie. Some of the romantic subplots seemed to come out of nowhere or at the very least lacked significant, on-screen build up. One of the worst things about the movie was how easy it was for Thanos to find the infinity stones. It was so easy to collect them, anyone could have done it. Thanos could have done it ages ago. Why wait for something that was so simply accomplished? From what the movie shows us, he finds them in a matter of days, with only one stone posing any real challenge to find. Thanos also lacks real motivation as a character. He doesn't desire any acknowledgment, any material possession, or any power for wiping out half the universe. It felt like something pivotal to the story had been removed (which, from my understanding of the comics, was actually the case). It also seemed pretty convenient that at the end of the movie, the heroes left standing were the same boring, dried up characters whose stories were long over before this movie (looking at you, Iron Man). I've been following these movies for a long time, and the other Avengers movies were disappointing, but this was the last straw for me.","10"
"gav_c","Very underwhelming","1 September 2018","Whilst I found the movie okish I just couldn't get into it and I never got the same feeling I got when I watched the other Avenger movies. As I suspected the movie just had to much going on between to many characters which resulted in a very weak story.

I'm gutted that you barely saw any of the hulk (my favourite character), but Mark Ruffalo did play his part well. I also thought Chris Hemsworth acting as as Thor this time around was not that great. But that might just be me.

I also thought the CGI in places was pretty poor especially around Robert Downey Jr and Tom Holland when they where suited up and talking to each other.

All in all pretty disappointing compared to the other movies I hope it's better in the next one.","10"
"MJL_Uncensored","This Isn't About Hype, This Movie Is the New Standard For Blockbusters","30 April 2018","How do you process a movie like Avengers: Infinity War?

As a fan of comic books and movies, I can safely say this was one of the most exceptional movie-going experiences of my life. Marvel not only matched my expectations for Infinity War, but they also exceeded it. Everything I thought I knew going in, would turn out to be wrong. Every prediction I made about life and death in this film-shattered. This is a movie that shouldn't work yet somehow it does. And what I mean by that is this: Avenger's: Infinity War raises the stakes to a crescendo and then walks away from it all without letting you fall gently. You are left to process your feelings, and Marvel doesn't care how you felt after it's over and done. That's bold. Secondly, no one...no one has ever been able to manage an ensemble quite like this. Reports are there are up to 70 Marvel characters in this film. Like seriously...who takes on this job as director? Well, thankfully it wasn't just one director. It was the powerhouse combo of Joe and Anthony Russo, and they deliver the best summer action flick in history! Hey James Cameron, as much as I admire your work, your opinion on Marvel movies sucks, and I pray they never end if they're going to make movies like this.

Thanos, the mysterious villain that has stalked post-credit scenes (and a Guardians movie) for years, arrives on the scene with some issues of his own. And in his mind, his destructive goals will ultimately save the universe from itself, despite the costs. Thanos argues for the indefensible: genocide as a cure for the battle for resources. He believes this will bring peace to the universe. Well apparently, our heroes will not stand for this, and it sets up the battle to stop him from gaining the last few Infinity Stones. I'm not a huge fan of CGI characters in a movie, but Thanos works-thanks to Josh Brolin's calm and confident portrayal of the sometimes sentimental madman.

This is a movie with some serious stakes, and that's hard to achieve in a film this weighty with characters because time devoted to dramatic impact is limited. But Marvel borrows the best of episodic TV and uses the emotional investment we already have with these characters to tear apart our heartstrings. In this film, the characters find themselves in unique pairings on separate missions, and wow...do these pairings work better than expected. Star-Lord, Dr. Strange, and Iron-Man. Let that sink in for a minute. Three of the most prominent egos in the Marvel universe--together. The interactions work better than imageable. The one-liners never cease, but it's never overly jokey. They know when to insert humor and when to get serious. And things get serious mid-way through thanks to some family drama. I was curious as to how well the Guardians would mess with our Earthbound heroes, but I got to say, that team delivers the heart to this CGI fest.

The characters in this film are all given moments to shine. We revisit the fantastic world of Wakanda, and it's more glorious than ever before as we get to see the city's defense systems. Captain America, Black Widow, Falcon, War Machine, Banner, and Bucky Barnes are all along for the ride, trying to protect Vision's infinity stone from Thanos. Hemsworth's Thor, without question, delivers one of the most crowd-pleasing entrances on film-judging by the roar from the crowd that was with me in attendance. And while it's hard to refer to any of our superheroes in this film as ancillary characters, know that the film focuses on three select groups of superheroes with each group having a few actors and actresses that claim more screen time than others. Scarlett Witch finally garners the screen time she deserves as the reluctant enhanced person with the power to save the world. Everyone and every action in this film have a purpose, which is why you care about the outcome of this film.

This is what blockbuster movies are supposed to be. This is why going to theaters are still more impactful than watching them at home on your television or handheld device. The Avengers: Infinity War takes you on an exhilarating emotional journey that will leave you exhausted, heartbroken and clamor for the next installment in the series.","10"

"Henry-klein","But How?","24 April 2019","Great cast and Amazing CGI. Story line has too many holes to even summarize. Fight scenes, especially with Thanos, are shockingly unimaginative. Where is the thoughtful use of each hero's superpowers to push Thanos to the brink of defeat? How many times is somebody going to try and hit him on the chin only for it to be shrugged off? C'mon. $300M+ budget needs to go into thoughtful writing like what as done with the depth of Thanos character to make this the masterpiece it should be. All that said. Solid 8 star and great movie. Could have been a real classic and not just a blockbuster.","3"

A lot of the humor was contrived; some of those emotional/dramatic scenes were ruined by poorly timed jokes, something that Ragnarok and GotGv2 suffered from immensely. Way too overcrowded with so many heroes and not enough characters development. The plot is good but it's a mess. Doctor strange was a great addition to avengers movie but not with star lord and his crews. Overall it is a forgetable movie as it has absolutley no impact for the MCU. Eveirthing they did in this movie will be undone in the next one, and that is for sure.","10"

Why would you put thanos in fortnite, if in the movie, he doesn't even floss like a boss. Clifford's character was wasted, and Shrek had nothing to do.

No, he wants to save the universe from extinction. He wants to stop what happen to his own home-world happen to other worlds. He wants to save the universe from overpopulation. For that half of the universe must be erased. Thor is the other MVP. Actually we get to see the full godly powers in this movie than anywhere else.

"generationofswine","An Honest Review","29 April 2018","I walked into this frightened that there would be too man characters a the result would be an empty vacant shell of a movie that was pulled in so many different directions ti couldn't make sense of itself.

Yay, I was wrong.

Seriously, they did a good enough job. They focused on Gomorrah, Thor, and Strange and Stark enough to make a plot despite the insane amount of characters. And they rest they used as filler, with only the Vision story coming up a bit light due to population.

And the Vision story was a bit of a draw back. It was there but it wasn't, at least it was there, it was important, but it seemed tertiary and a little too so.

The Humor was also scaled back. But Spider Man did a good job, Cap had a few and, again, it was only Panther and the Wakandans that took themselves too seriously to be in a Marvel movie....again.

I'm sorry, someone really needs to tell the MCU that it is find if the Black Panther cracks a smile or a one-line once or twice. We won't mind.

The tone was more action than action/comedy...but with ""War"" in the title, you kind of expect that.

However, they do NOT even address the elephant in the room...why did Widow go blond? Was it to have more fun or was it simply because she was on the run. The world may never know.

What we do know is that we missed Hawkeye, even if he is on and off again retired. And we missed Ant-Man, but given how many people were here, the absences were noted but not really noticed.","10"

"bsilbor","Very good, but not absolutely perfect like many seem to believe.","25 May 2018","When you combine a decade's worth of characters all in a two-and-a-half hour movie, obviously you're going to have to keep the character development to a minimum. It also won't help if you haven't seen all of the 20-ish movies leading up to this one, where the character development is pretty well utilized, especially for a studio now putting out three to four of these things a year. I knew this going in, which is why I didn't expect some deep character piece. Still, I felt certain scenarios and characters could have shown at least a bit more energy, instead of just seeming like some cardboard cut-outs, but again, it didn't detract from my experience, because I wasn't expecting much from individual characters.

I think it's also pretty clear that this isn't a movie that focuses on the heroes. This movie does something new, where the bad guy takes center stage, and is the one with the character development. Finally, we get a villain that we can understand. He isn't trying to destroy half the universe for absolutely no reason other than to be evil, which is one thing the MCU has been lacking.

The ending made me feel very different from any other ending I've seen. Seeing things transpire as they did was shocking, but not surprising...and what I felt is still just so indescribable because no movie ending has really done what Infinity War has done. Thankfully, certain lines from a certain character insinuate not all is as it seems.

Bottom line is, if you're expecting Tarantino, Hitchcock, or Kubrick filled with deep themes, emotional character studies, or groundbreaking cinematography, then you clearly don't understand the genre. If you're expecting an exciting movie filled with moments that make you want to punch the air, an ending that will leave you stunned and a bit confused, and a film that begins to wrap up over 20 movies, then you'll have a good time, like I did.","10"

"christophershobris","Avengers: Infinity War Movie Review","21 June 2018","I just want to say what the Russo brothers have done is outstanding. Taking a film with such a crowded cast and as a result; a very crowded story. However, I don't consider that a flaw, but nevertheless a roadblock surely. I believe they have made the best movie that they or anyone else could have done. The film felt equally leveled out, giving each character is given their own individual moments to shine. Everyone brings it in the performances, not a single weak link among them. And for once Marvel seems to finally be nailing their villains. They showed it in Black Panther, and they show it here as well. But who's better Killmonger or Thanos? It all comes down to personal preference, but personally it's hard to say in that they are two completely different characters, they both strive for separate goals due to separate motivations. Killmonger's story felt sort of Shakespearean, while Thanos felt more traditional but still very compelling in its execution. Ultimately this film lets the villain be the star, but like I said before it gives the other characters moments to shine. The action is as good as any Marvel film up to this point, along with fluctuating emotions throughout. Overall, everything that Marvel has done seems to have come to fruition and really paid off. This film may leave you wondrous and speechless. For the 3 people who haven't seen this yet, what are you waiting for?","10"

This film is directed by Anthony Russo (Captain America: The Winter Soldier) and Joe Russo (Captain America: The Winter soldier). It has a huge cast, which include Robert Downey Jr. (Iron Man), Chris Hemsworth (The Avengers) and Mark Ruffalo (The Avengers). To name a few.

I love this film, I don't think it is as good as Black Panther, simply because Black Panther destroyed all my expectations, to be absolutely brilliant, Whilst this lived up to my hype, so I didn't have as much of a payoff. But that is the only reason why. The Russo brothers deliver yet again a beautiful film, with much less shaky cam than there other 2 MCU films. all of the performances are great, but the stand out is defiantly Josh Brolin (No country for old men) as the big bad Thanos.

"Ar_Pharazon_the_golden","All you expect and a bit more","2 May 2018","Infinity War manages to be coherent despite the over-abundance of characters. It seemed hard, but somehow all the heroes (or almost all) have their role. And while I find the fact that most of the other MCU films are required material to watch this one disagreeable, it does feel like an appropriate culmination of all the previous adventures. The action is of course great, the stakes higher than ever, and the humour really good, especially among the Guardians of the Galaxy. There are of course glaring weaknesses in the plot - 6 super magical stones that control the entire universe are all just around the corner. Starlord can't control himself for half a second till they remove Thanos' super-glove. But let's face it, it's a superhero film, and a self-aware one at that: when Iron Man explains ""he is from space, here to steal a necklace from a wizard"", you can't complain for such details. It is telling to the film's success how Thanos manages to come off as a genuinely thoughtful and not-entirely-evil villain, even though his philosophy is entirely stupid: he has diagnosed the entire universe's problem to be overpopulation, and thinks killing half of all life (no other measures) will fix everything, because apparently reproduction isn't a thing. I mean, it's a profoundly silly plan for an immortal mega-genius, but kudos to Josh Brolin for managing to hide that.

Of course, the film does end on a 'to be continued' note, so we'll have to wait for the final judgment.","10"

Brolin's Thanos is the definition of what a Villian is. From the very first second of the movie, to the final fade away, you literally dread the next moment. Sure, there's the typical MCU comedy bits in it to keep you from having a nervous breakdown throughout the movie....but Thanos, is ominous to say the least. The bad part is, even though you want him to lose, there's a reasoning behind his madness, albeit misplaced. He even weeps at one point, and you find yourself wanting to feel for him. It's a hate/love relationship. The massive ensemble of the Avengers team we love has grown to massive proportions, although spread apart. They are emotionally tested every single step of the way in this movie, and the viewer is tested along with them. You sit there trying to make the right choice with them, however hard that may be. Do the needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few....or the one? Just one of the questions pressed upon our mighty heroes throughout the film. But excruciating to feel as they ponder the question with only moments to decide each time. Anyone who doesn't rate this movie at least a 9 has no concept of what these 10 years of the MCU have been building up to. The next year of my life is going to be a lon one waiting to see what happens next. Happy viewing.","4"

Sure, Endgame has the Superheroes winning as most comic book films do, but Infinity War changes that formula masterfully and that's why I think Infinity War is head and shoulders above Endgame.

Endgame has lot of fan-service and ending all the plot revelations that Infinity War (and the films before) started, but with Infinity War, there isn't as much fan-service and if there is, it serves a purpose that furthers the plot wonderfully.

The plot twist of having Thanos actually achieve his goal and destroy half of all life is perfectly executed and gives the end of the film the unexpected and solemn ending that it deserves.

"Stars-and-popcorn","Is 'Avengers: Infinity War' the Beginning of the End for the MCU?","27 April 2018","Like every other geek in the world, I was stoked to see 'Avengers: Infinity War.' I bought my tickets in advance. I got a soda that was way too large to drink in two and a half hours. I argued with some teenager who tried to steal my seat. I sat in jittery anticipation once the lights went down... And I was left wanting once the credits ran.

'Avengers: Infinity War' was the equivalent of Marvel's money shot. It's been building to this since the first 'Avengers' movie showed Thanos peeking over his shoulder with a cocky smile on his face. Since then, they've been hinting at the inevitable confrontation that was bound to happen between Earth's mightiest heroes and some big purple spaceman. With Avengers: Infinity War, we see Thanos actually get off his ass and do something, and he does a lot and yet nothing at the same time.

The biggest problem that 'Avengers: infinity War' suffers from is that it tries to do so much in so little time. Fans of the MCU are well aware that there are more heroes than you can shake a stick at and 'Infinity War' stuffs all of them in, in one way or another. Of course, the big three (Chris Hemsworth, Chris Evans, and Robert Downey Jr.) get their share of screen time, everyone else thought has minimal roles to play throughout the film. Tom Holland is Marvel's newest plaything, so he gets plenty of time, but the rest of the big heroes are shoehorned in such a way that screams ""contractual obligation."" Then again, I don't think any fan is something to be upset about seeing their favorite heroes finally meet on the big screen (especially when it comes to Robert and Benedict Cumberbatch). The problem is that none of them really get a chance to stretch their legs.

I have to admit 'Avengers: Infinity War' definitely has some feels in it. Oddly enough, most of these feels come from Thanos himself (Josh Brolin). He's supposed to be the big bad of the MCU, but it seems like his heart is in the right place, even if he's a pretty extreme pragmatist. Still, his character isn't laughing evilly in the wings as he commits acts on par with the worst war crime I can think of. Instead, he struggles. He sees the cost and even admits that achieving his goal costs him everything in the end. So, is it all worth it?

Who knows! The damn thing basically ends in a ""to be continued.""

'Avengers: Infinity War' suffers from trying to do so much that the editing can't possibly keep up with it. There's no downtime between the action sequences, which doesn't mean that they aren't any less spectacular. It just means that there's no time to let anything sink in before the movie is rushing off to the next sequence. That being said, the heroes all achieve a new level of badass-dom, especially Chris Evans as Captain America. The guy is a beast this time around. Unfortunately, there is so much going on that it can be hard to figure out what's going on mid-flight.

This brings me to another point when it comes to 'Avengers: Infinity War.' The damn thing is so busy when it comes to its visuals, that I honestly don't think it's worth seeing in 3D. For the first few minutes of the movie, I couldn't understand what was happening. Apparently, though there was quite a beatdown when it came to Thanos and Hulk. Enough so that Hulk gets performance anxiety. Something I find odd since Thanos actively avoids the Hulk in the comics. I'm not going to knick pick about this though, because I'm not a neckbeard nerd.

Look, here's the bottom line, 'Avenger: Infinity War' is a fun movie. It's competently made by the Russo Brothers, who are Marvel's golden boys. Is it everything that fan might want? No. Does it live up to what it promises? No. Is it still something fanboys should throw money at and be happy they get it? Probably.

You're not going to be disappointed in 'Avengers: Infinity War,' but Marvel does not have the right to act all high and mighty after this. I'm sure 2019 will bring a ""sequel"" that will make it all worthwhile. As of right now though, 'Avengers: Infinity War' is kind of a disappointment. It's a letdown. There have been so many good movies this past year from Thor: Ragnarok to Black Panther that Marvel ended up raised the bar. It had to stumble at some point, it's just lucky that it only stumbled and didn't fall flat on its face with 'Avengers: Infinity War.'","10"
"richard-12867","It's okay if you like one dimensional plots masked by lots of CGI fighting","23 September 2018","It's okay. Basically Thanos is unbeatable. He spends the movie getting the Infinity stones and, when he has them, is even more unbeatable. He sacrifices the adopted daughter that he didn't like anyway and who tried to kill him. Wow.

And, er, that's it.

So because IMDB insist, I have to write more. Trouble is, there's little else to say about the movie. It, erm, contains lots of fighting and an unbeatable Thanos who sacrifices a daughter who he didn't like anyway and who tried to kill him.

And so on and so on.

Meh.

Avengers:Infinity war is one of those rare spectacle that is heart moving and also heart breaking while still managing to fan service the mcu fans. For me the reasons why I enjoyed infinity war more than endgame are the twist and the ending. Honestly not everybody expected almost all of our beloved heroes dying so helplessly and the end scene where tanos just smiles and looks around with pride and with the sense of great achievement and that awesome emotional music, it is to me the best ending in the mcu simply because it was unprecedented.","1"

"AhmedSpielberg99","Infinity War is an epic that every MCU fan deserves","28 April 2018","Hands down Thanos is the best CGI villain ever put to film. He's a compelling character and you can feel he's a real-life human (except he's not). Josh Brolin performance makes Thanos even more realistic and humane. His motion-capture performance adds up to the character of Thanos, and that's really unusual or maybe doesn't happen unless we had Andy Serkis. The CGI in general is very good.

Thanos has many great moving moments when he explains his motives, but despite how indirect and classy he illustrates his motivations, I hoped there were more ways to do so rather than using dialogue and nothing more. Also, I think there was no need for more explanations in the third act of the movie. C'mon, there is a final battle happens and Thanos still gives some reasons why he does that!

There's an incredible chemistry between almost all our heroes, and that enhanced the humor in this movie which, by the way, is splendid! Almost every joke hits the mark. The problem that there was a tonal shift between the first act and the second act that made a dramatic scene not as effective as it should have been, but it's really a very minor issue as it just happened one time.

The character development features all along the movie itself not just as a complement to the previous movies.

There are a lot of shocking moments and unflinching decisions that you have never seen in a Marvel movie.

I have never been confused by the story's developments or many events as all of them are represented simply. Actually even simpler than in some other MCU movies.

The Russo Brothers showed how much they understand every single character in the universe by changing the tone according to the characters and the place.

And the end of it is just -to be continued-. Even that tiny bit of story is not even told to the end. Its a shame that this move stands among great films with a rating of over 8.

It is tightly directed, dynamic and rousingly scored.

"ninjaboyballer","A Mindblowing epic experience....","4 May 2018","I have my life dedicated to marvel. I have watched it grow for 10 years and will continue to watch it for another 10 years after Avengers 4.

This movie is directed by the Russo brothers, who directed some of the best marvel movies, including captain America winter soldier and civil war. And it stars everyone basically. And in this movie, The Avengers, still torn apart after the events of Civil war, team up with the guardians of the galaxy to stop thanos from getting all the infinity stones and wiping out half of the universe. Warning spoilers!!!

So let's talk about the opening, with the deaths of Loki and heimdall. I feel like their deaths really set the tone the film was aiming at. Now this movie is really funny as well. There are jokes to really lighten down the dark tone this movie had. But this is still a really dark film overall, and the directors really show that.

The action in this movie had no shaky cam for like 99% of the time, and it is glorious. This movie is epic and has mind blowing action. I also really love how everyone who meets up interacts with each other. They put all these characters in a film and they made it work really well. Like I did not expect it to work this well.

Let's talk about Thanos. He is....horrifying. At first I was a little nervous and thought they were going to give him the stephenwolf treatment. But thankfully, they didn't. He is the big baddy they have been building up for more than 6 years, and they pulled it off. Thanos is one of the most powerful villains Marvel has seen, so there are actual stakes for our hero's. And that scene where he throws gamora off the cliff is heartbreaking and just proves how far he is willing to go to get what he wants. But also shows he has sympathy and sometimes regrets the decisions he makes.

Now the cliffhanger kinda of pissed me off, but also excited me. It ends with thanos wiping out half the universe, including most off the guardians, half of the avengers, and the Wakandan armies. I hated to see some of the characters I've grown to love dissolve into nothing but dust. But it also really sets expectations for the next film.

Anyway, this movie is my favorite marvel movie so far. Emotional, exciting, and funny, Avengers Infinity war does not disappoint. I am going to give it a 9.5/10","8"

Kingpin is great. Undoubtedly, some of the deaths will be reversed in the second part (either Thanos has not lost all the properties of the stone and we will find those killed at the Grandmaster). If we talk about films divided into parts. Infinity War utterly defeated the Deathly Hallows, and Thanos Volodya. The red skull is the best thing in the movie in my opinion)))","1"

It brings fantastic enjoyment that also brings hard times whilst you sit back and relax on the comfortable seats. You walk out of this movie, realising that everything you have just seen, suddenly tears you apart inside from the love that these characters have given us over the past 10 years. It brings the BEST villain a film could ever afford. Bringing you stunning new detail of evil into a universe that has been going around for a long time. It also brings more excitement to what is yet to come.

The CGI is mind-blowing, everything just appears to get better and better every second, with stunning new plot twists, character team-ups, new fights and battles, and a lot of surprises you never would expect before the film came out. It creates a movie that involves characters like the original Avengers: Iron Man, Captain America, Hulk, and Thor fight for their lives, along with new greetings that we've come to love, whilst the battles ensues as they grieve and fight to survive.

"finfo-02467","Because it is real.","4 June 2018","Everyone has already shed tears over a beloved friend or family member. Nobody says anything. It is accepted by society to mourn our fellow men. But if you sit in the cinema and start to cry because your favourite character has died, the only thing that happens is that people look at you funnily. Why should you mourn something that isn't real?

But...

Fictional characters are real. The people that follow their stories make them real. They are not only in the pages of books or words or sentences of their stories. They are not just in the pixels on the cinema screen. They are in the minds of the readers and fans too. That makes them real.

As a bookworm I have seen more death than a normal human being is supposed to see. I love to get to know new characters, really get to know them. The facts that are provided by the books or movies, are just secondary. Those are easy to figure out. The things that really matter are those which you don't see immediately. If you like a character or not, is not defined by his or her looks or how he or she speaks. It's about the details that are barely recognized, how he reacts when his mother dies, the way he looks at the woman he loves. Every character is also created through the individual ideas of every person who starts to think about the character.

If a character, that you formed in your mind, has accompanied you for a few thousand pages, then the moment he or she dies is the worst thing that could happen to you. Because it isn't the death of a character, but of a friend. If you read the last pages of a book and don't want to reach the end, if you rebel against the end, than the creator has done everything right. The sad thing is if you do so many things right, you can do so many things wrong and spread pain easier. I'm not that disillusioned to say that a character's death is as cruel as a real one. No, I may dramatize, but it hurts none the less. Most deaths aren't just sad because they are sad, but because it may have happened out of heroic courage and you wish to act like that sometimes or because it was tragic, because of love, or because you are afraid that the same illness could be your end.

So, Marvel, I want to tell you something: You have not only ripped my heart out of my chest. No! You threw it on the ground and stepped on in! Not very gentlemanlike.

Let me start with... the worst death of them all. Loki. Mr Hiddleston, you are the very reason, why I have become a Marvel fan. Something about your character fascinated me from the start. It was the moment of hesitation when faced with the destruction of New York, the fury about the betrayal of the own family and the deceptive smile when a lie was involved. He is the kind of villain, whose backstory is so well-written that you pity him. But slowly the pity was replaced with sympathy. With every movie, with every scene and with every discussion with Thor I stumbled deeper into this sympathy and I began to ask myself how it could be that the villain is more popular than the hero. I didn't find an answer except, that it must be you. We both know Loki just had one wish in the bottom of his heart: to do the right thing. Just sometimes to do the right thing differed from Tony Stark's opinion or Thor's or Captain America's. But he wanted to do the right thing, for himself, for his mother, for Odin, even if he couldn't understand it sometimes and tried to hard. So much that he suffered for it, that he killed for it, that he died for it. I started to cry after the first five minutes of the movie and haven't stopped ever since. I have seen Loki die quite a few times now, but this time it felt so final. I thank you, Mr Hiddleston. You have let Loki live and let him die like he would've wanted: glorious and as a hero. But not just as a hero, but as an Avenger. We have a Hulk. In that moment Loki was an Avenger for me, too.

Tom, you have stolen a part of my heart when you took Captain America's shield. Peter Parker is so juvenile, and already so heroic. He jumped out of that bus without hesitation and flew up into space. Of course he didn't listen to Tony Stark. I must say I somehow suspected Loki's death, but your improvised »I don't want to go« scene hit me harder than a punch from the Hulk. I mean, we just got to know you (and fell a little bit in love with you) and what will aunt May say? When you were knighted as an Avenger you looked so proud and then... We need our friendly neighbourhood Spider-Man! I need it! Marvel, you have already taken Loki from me, don't take Spider-Man as well.

Mr Cumberbatch, I must say it's pretty unfair, that only you know the end. I don't envy you, that you had to bring so much pain to us with the direction Dr Strange took. But I do envy you for your cloak.

Life is short. It can be over with a snap of ones finger. But even shorter was the reunion between Bucky and Steve. To kill Bucky once in front of Steve's eyes with his name on the lips is one thing, but twice? Well, fool me once... By the way, the beard looks great, Mr Evans. You had the most brilliant of all entrances in the Marvel history. The music was the trigger for this goose bump filled movie moment. Well done, Mr Silvestri! It was as if you wrote the main theme all those years ago just for this scene. The rest of the movie was provided with wonderful music, too. Especially Thanos had his musical highlights.

Mr Hemsworth, next time please do aim higher.

Mr Pratt, I'm not going to talk to you. I will not hold the actions of your character against you either - he just lost the love of his life - but I'm still not going to talk to you.

I never expected that there would be one moment in this movie, where I would see Thanos as something else than a mad mass murderer. There was this one moment where I felt pity for him. When he killed the one thing that he loved. But this moment was over quickly, because who ever really loves, wouldn't kill for it. The simple thought would repel him. Which makes Gamora's sacrifice even more tragic. After this second of pity I understood that her death didn't happen out of love, but out of lust for power by a monster.

There were good, no great, moments too. Like every time Thor called Rocket a rabbit (well, rabbit is at least more accurate than fox) or Dr Strange and Tony discussed something and you asked yourself, which one demands Watson first. Generally when a narcissistic smart-arse, an arrogant genius and an ironic space criminal had a scene together and tried to save the universe, of course it had to go wrong. I don't know if I find Rocket's idea of stealing Bucky's arm incredibly hilarious or just suicidal. Surprisingly I wished to be a nano particle of Tony's suit just to see something that beautiful up close. There is only one explanation for Tony's fathers feelings: Peter. He had a suit for that boy on alert, maybe even for weeks and then the first thing he does is to assure that Peter is safe. It didn't work that well, but if Tony doesn't get the chance to marry Pepper and have kids with her (and make Peter the godfather) then... I can't even say that it will break my heart... it already has. Mr Downey jr., you're the beginning of the MCU, please make sure that its end, especially the end of certain heroes, will not come too soon.

Let's talk about all the strong and wonderful women in this movie! Shuri can beat you up easily while she lists all the decimal places of pi. Not only Shuri but General Okoye is a picture of feminism. Wanda made the biggest progress in my opinion. She became aware of her own strength, her powers and her feelings. She takes responsibility, but has to carry pain too. To kill the man you love... not everybody can do that. Natasha is Natasha. I think there is nobody who has a drier sense of humor than her. Gamora has the most tragic end, but I think it is great that the relationship between her and Thanos was explained and why she became one of the key characters of the movie.

I asked myself if it wasn't just a crossover between all the Marvel movies, but if there was a little bit of Harry Potter (I wanted to cast a Patronus on Red Skull), Star Wars (the space ships with those creatures looked a lot like star destroyers to me) and Lord of the Rings (I somehow felt strongly reminded of the Hobbit when Thor was in the forge) mixed in as well.

A lot characters didn't get their fair share, but even I can see that it would have been difficult to give every one his entitled screen time. Especially with the discussion that this would cause between the golden trio of »my plan is better than yours«. Where as it would've shortened the waiting time until the next movie gradually.

I cannot quite put into words how this movie made me feel. Empty, worn down, infinitely sad, betrayed. But I left the cinema with a spark of hope, although, with tears in my eyes but hopeful. For Thanos, the sun rose in the end. It will shine for the Avengers again, too. For Bucky, Sam, Groot, Mantis, Drax, Peter, T'Challa, Wanda, Dr Strange, Gamora, Vision, Spiderman and Loki. I am sure about that. There will be a new start, that is what the sunrise stands for, right? For something new. Maybe we have to live with the fact that it will be different now, that it will not be like before. We have to trust Dr Strange. It had to be like this, there was no other way. But this sunrise shows us that even the darkest hours will end. In the end there was a ray of hope. And light will always banish the darkness. As Loki said: »I assure you, brother, the sun will shine on us again.«

Dear Avengers,

you are our light and we will carry your light onward even when you cannot, when you are parted and torn apart by grief. The moment on the last page has not come yet. We can turn the page now and begin a new chapter. Because you are our light. And this light will never go out. Do you know why?

Because it is real.","6"
"Reelnerd","Thanos: A Villain's Journey","30 April 2018","Avengers: Infinity War Film review By Nelson Nantanapibul Directed by Anthony and Joe Russo Starring: Robert Downey Jr., Chris Evans, Chris Hemsworth, Benedict Cumberbatch, Tom Holland, Chadwick Boseman, Chris Pratt, Josh Brolin... The MCU as it's known is 10 years old and has achieved massive financial and critical success which has culminated in the mother of all crossover events in Avengers: Infinity War. Now even though I admire the MCU and what it has accomplished (at least for me) not every film has hit it out of the park story wise and yet most of their films across the board seem to garner near identical critical praise with some rare exceptions. I loved the first Avengers film and saw it eight times in theaters during its original theatrical run. Age of Ultron fell far short of my expectations and in my opinion was their first major misstep narratively and yet that film still made over a billion dollars worldwide and appeared to be critic proof. Then Civil War came along helmed by the Russo Bros and and though it was billed as a Captain America film it was essentially The Avengers 2.5. I'm guessing that was a trial run for the Russos to see if they were worthy of taking over the next major chapter in the Avengers saga and they do not disappoint. Infinity War has the emotional depth that I find lacking in the majority of MCU films and they give us a villain in Thanos who is not only worthy enough to face off against earth's mightiest heroes but is the centerpiece of this film. This is his story all the way through with our heroes serving as the supporting cast. Most MCU villains are completely lackluster and quite frankly have not been all that interesting save for a few such as Loki, Red Skull and the Vulture. Thanos is billed as ""The Mad Titan"" in the comics but in Josh Brolin's performance he comes off as anything but. There is a method to Thanos' madness in the film and he (at least in his own mind) is the hero of this epic story. The best villains in cinema and literature are the ones who do not act purely out of evil intent but who feel as if what they are doing is just and cause and cannot understand why others cannot see things as they do. Thanos has a twisted sense of love and loyalty but he does possess those emotions and they are in full display in this film. Thanos is a fully realized character and has an arc in this film usually reserved for the heroes of the MCU. The Russos have taken the template of the MCU films which had started to become predictable and bland (at least for me) and completely do their own thing under the watchful eye of Kevin Feige to be sure. This film is full of surprises and doesn't always go the way viewers expect it to and in one instance they kind of psyche you out in thinking one thing will happen and pull the rug out from under you. I cannot elaborate without spoiling what the scene is but it definitely had the audience at my screening audibly gasp out loud. For the first time in a long time I have actually felt like there were actual stakes in an MCU film where just about anything could happen and they set up those expectations from the get go. The Russos do not waste time in getting us into the action and they stomp their foot on the gas up until the very end. This film had the usual brand of MCU style humor but didn't overstaurate the viewers with it the way I feel other films in the universe have begun to overly rely on it in lieu of character and plot development. The film also has great emotional depth and resonance that I have not felt within the MCU for a very long time. There were some moments in the film where I thought, I can't believe they actually went there. There was only one time in the film where I felt that they played it safe in terms of the fate of a character where if they had followed through on it would have really thrown viewers for a loop. Marvel has delivered something amazing with this film. The MCU could go in any direction from here on out. Actually if this were to be the last film in the MCU franchise (it's not) it would be a satisfying if somewhat dark and dreary way to end things but it could end. I highly recommend this film and what has been accomplished by the Fiege braintrust is nothing short of amazing and (almost) unheard of. The shared cinematic universe is not a new concept but it has not been accomplished on a scale of this size and it has yet to be successfully emulated by other studios. Definitely see this film and see how seamlessly the Russos intertwine so many characters together with Thanos serving as the thread that ties everything together from one scene to the next.","8"
"yoyopa","If every Marvel movie had been like Infinity War...","30 April 2018","I'd be a diehard Marvel fan. I've seen every one of these movies... sometimes I went to the theater... sometimes I just waited till it was made available and I could watch whenever for free. No matter where or how I saw them I almost always walked saying the same thing... Eh. When Iron Man came out I was still a teenager and I really enjoyed it... but after that it was honestly the most mature of the films until Infinity War or should I say Marvel's Dark Knight LOL! Still had all the Marvel humor but was much darker or really deeper than anything Ive seen from this studio. I bet DC has to be feeling pretty embarrassed about Marvel's CG villain!! Holy crap. Seriously DC... and i'm a fan but go back to the drawing board bc Thanos just literally shamed everything you've done since Dark Knight Trilogy. Obviously I won't spoil anything but I definitely had tears in my eyes at the end... not because I love everything Marvel but bc I was truly that moved. This was a hard earned 10/10... all credit due to the directors Joe and Anthony Russo! The years of hard work I'm sure went into this REALLY SHOWED. Inspiring.","3"
"barmybramgaming","Wow, just wow!","29 April 2018","I will not provide any spoilers here, so you're welcome to read on.

So where to start? There's great comic moments, interspersed with some very tragic moments and the best action scenes I think I've ever seen in a film.

Josh Brolin is tremendous as the super villain, Thanos. You kind of half feel sorry for him, his voice coming across as someone hell bent on achieving the aim of collecting all the stones - almost as if it's his destiny and only way to achieve some sort of everlasting piece. There's times when he appears to show empathy and remorse yet still continues on his path.

If someone wants to flag that as a spoiler ^ that's fine. All I'll say is he is the best villain in any comic book movie, ever.

All of the other characters are fantastic, with particular mention to Dave Bautista for some of the funniest lines in the movie.

You will love it, hate it and most definitely will be hiding behind your hand on quite a few occasions.

Only 3 films I've seen are better: Shawshank, Inception and Dark Knight. That's how good this is!

I'll definitely be watching it a second time.

Let's face it, this is not just one film""......it's taken us ten years to get here, ten years of Marvel wowing us with good, not so good and fairly awesome film, ten years to introduce us to all their heroes and villains and I have to say, if you're going to put them all in one film......this is surely the way to do it. Some of our early heroes are ageing but what's a little make up between friends and well hey it blinkin works. This film is not a single story, it's a gathering of many tales told in many different ways, with all paths heading on a collision course. I can't tell anything of the plot without massive spoilers but what I can say is, it's great meeting all the characters again, spending a couple of minutes fitting their individual pieces into one massive jigsaw as you remember what their role is in the story, and another thing, it made me want to go back and watch all the other films again. This is a film you'll want to watch again and again I'm sure........oh and people....it's Marvel, stay until the end of the credits!!!!","10"

"jessup-86446","Thanos is the best villain in years, but... MAJOR SPOILERS","4 May 2018","Thanos surprised me with his range, he isn't just the big bad, there is some genuine pathos here and Josh Brolin is fantastic here. Pretty much the movie was going great until they went to Wakanda, where the last half hour or so of the film really fell flat for me. I would've liked to have seen the big battle take place somewhere real, a real world city, not a magic city I don't care about, might as well have been in Kun Lun. I would also like to have seen more shots of what Thanos did with that last fatal snap, not just to the heroes and to that one street in New York after the credits, but across the planet and even the universe at large. Trillions died, but it felt more like dozens, there should have been something like when Ego tried to do the same thing with his blobby plant things in Guardians of the Galaxy Volume 2, where you see Xandar and Eath and other crazy planets getting messed up. I realize that this is movie is part one of two, but it still needs to stand alone, and the consequences of the most significant finger snapping in comic book history should have been overwhelmingly displayed. Additionally, I'm afraid that Marvel has overplayed their hand here. I expected a bloodbath but there is no way they will leave THIS half of their heroes dead, as I should point out that most of the ones that kicked it were NEW to the universe (Really? You expect me to believe SPIDERMAN, Black Panther, and Doctor Strange are all dead after only one movie each?? (Not to mention almost the entire cast of GoG) As such you can't take the consequences seriously, which detracts from the narrative, in particular the death of Gamora, which at the time was a tear jerker and really shone the light on Thanos' humanity. Now I feel like they will just bring her back with the rest somehow in the second movie. Boo. And just to nitpick, the new Iron-Man suit is stupid, Iron-Man has always been a heavy hitter because of how SOLID he is, so suddenly replacing his suit with nano-particle Transforers 4 bullcrap was just awful. Sadly, Thor's axe also ends up kind of sucking; as far as names go ""Mjolnir"" is far better than the generic ""Stormbreaker"" and in terms of appearance, the wooden handle is just too big and cartoonish, though I loved that Groot made it for him. In the end, while the film was not a brutal disappointment as I feared, it is still a disappointment. 7/10 Stars","4"
"Sonfeld","I gave almost all Marvels 8/10, this is a 7, why?","4 October 2018","Its interesting to read the 2 extreme sides of the critics and imo it's not that big deal which needs a lot explanation.

Pros: + Good/Solid battles & popcorn action + Endgame feeling comes up + All Marvel Movie Heroes tag team together + Nice villains + Great Boss Villain Thanos aka Josh Brolin

Cons:
Kinda mediocre plot (maybe for a none fan boy?)
I personally don't like cliff hangers
It feels kinda befuddled, coz all chars somehow needed to be included but not focused
Great (humorous) dialogues are missing (just some at the beginning)


To sum up: It's basically like seeing an All-Star NBA Team playing, its fun but I prefer seeing a good league match. ;)","6"

If you're going to see this movie expecting those classics gags and one liners from the other movies this is not it. This movies has complex and emotional carachter arcs and it all comes down in such a perfect tone. 10 years lead up to this. Definitely worth the wait.

"vinniec-53536","The Greatest Comic Book Movie of All Time","29 April 2018","'Avengers: Infinity War' is a film 10 years in the making. Marvel Studios has been building to this since the first 'Iron Man' back in 2008, and it is more than worth the wait. Infinity War has everything you could want in a film of this scale: mind-blowing action, gut-busting humor, extremely satisfying character interactions, a terrifying villain you can kind of sympathize with, and a few truly heartbreaking moments. The film's directors, the Russo brothers, manage to fit all of this into a nearly 3 hour movie and still have it flow perfectly from one scene to the next. The pacing is fantastic for the amount of major characters in one movie. It never felt slow or boring and kept my eyes glued to the screen. The action scenes are the best I've ever seen in a superhero movie. It was like watching a comic book come to life. Seeing the different heroes fight alongside each other was incredible, and every character has a moment to shine. Infinity War marked the first crossover between the Avengers and the Guardians of the Galaxy, and their various interactions were everything I ever wanted them to be. The humor was hilarious, yet never felt out-of-place. The scenes that needed to be serious were exactly as they should have been. The film's villain, Thanos (portrayed brilliantly by Josh Brolin), is without a doubt the Marvel Cinematic Universe's best and most interesting antagonist to date. He commanded the screen and stole every scene he was in. He is also by far the most real looking CGI character I have ever seen. Unfortunately, he is responsible for pretty much all of the heartbreaking moments I mentioned earlier. If you think this is just another happy, bright Marvel movie, you are sorely mistaken. This is a war, and not everyone makes it out alive. My advice? Bring tissues. Lots and lots of tissues. As for standout performances, there are a few. Josh Brolin (Thanos), Chris Hemsworth (Thor), Elizabeth Olsen (Scarlet Witch), and Zoe Saldana (Gamora) all had major roles in the film and their acting was on point. In conclusion, 'Avengers: Infinity War' is not only the best Marvel movie to date, it is the greatest comic book movie of all time.","3"
"Iwona2403","Good but overpriced","3 May 2018","So I just got out of cinema. That ending was huge disappointment. Unpredictable yes but disappointing. Even more disappointing- lack of Steve Rogers / Captain America fights. I mean , COME ON, He deserves more than this!!! Thor had the spotlight. I do understand he is god but I like Cap more and I think he deserved another killer fight choreography as in his own movies. This was about the team yes- but I simply like his character the most of all avengers. Thor scene gave me goosebumps I admit. Humor is amazing through all movie. Especially The Guardians. All in all, this movie was entertaining, much better than the first Avengers (which I didn't like) but it's still not perfect. Most characters still look over cartoonised , or simply look like a psp game. The Lord of the rings convinced me long time ago that a fantasy/sci fi movie it doesn't have to look animated. I am not saying it should be 'DC dark' but Marvel must grow up. It's time!! Teenagers will have the most fun of all while watching this, it fits their age in maturity.","1"
"Yossy_yan","Only one word describes this movie - WOW !!!","21 August 2018","I don't even know where to begin to describe how much I enjoyed this film.

Let's start by saying that if you read reviews, please do not take the criticisms that say this film is without a plot, and those who did not understand what was going on in the film. Because it's really not true.

The film makes you feel so many things: from pain, laughter, sadness, a little more laughter and more sadness. Of all the movies of Marvel it is definitely the best one. And to see the variety of characters in the film - absolutely amazing. Pure pleasure.

The film leaves us with a lot of questions, especially about Marvel's future.

This film is highly recommended for viewing with the whole family, and only with those who know the stories of Marvel - That they will not tell you later: ""I did not understand"" or ""There is no plot here"" And I very much hope that you will enjoy and be filled with emotions like me.","7"

The ending was nonexistent. If Thanos has every stone he would be GOD in all caps. Nothing could stop him and nothing should have. Did anything actually stop him? The ending was so vague. Just an appalling movie that cashed in on the Marvel franchise. Are any of these movies actually that good? They're like products that people buy because they're put out there. There's not much substance to any of them. They're a good watch at the time but nothing destined to be classic cinema. This is one of the worst with Black Panther being the all time worst ever made.","8"

"EthanTheWolf","Ten years all lead to this cinematic masterpiece","13 August 2018","Before I review the film, a disclaimer might be needed. To fully appreciate this movie, you'll need to have seen at least one of the other avengers films or solo films to be somewhat familiar with the characters, otherwise you'll just end up very confused and not invested.

The anticipation for this movie was through the roof. Not often do you see people that hyped for a movie - especially a superhero themed flick. Avengers: infinity war had a lot to live up to. The film revolves around Thanos, not the avengers, but Thanos is the main character. He definitely is a well created 'villain'. Though I am not sure villain is the right word to describe him. His intentions essentially are good, his method is just a tad morbid. It will make you question your morals, and it makes you think about the state of the earth, which is indeed overpopulated You'll find fans rooting for either Thanos or our heroes

The actors delivered a splendid performance, with heartfelt and realistic reactions to the events around them. The producers may have gone a bit overboard with the CGI, but it's done in such a beautiful and realistic way that you won't even notice.

One of the best things about this movie is that for once, you can't expect a good ending. Anything can happen. Usually with superhero movies you know that the heroes will survive, which takes away the tension. With Infinity War you truly don't know who will survive or not, so that makes every fighting scene very intense.

The soundtrack was exhilarating as well. Marvel is well known for its forgettable soundtracks, but this one was definitely recognisable. The avengers theme blasted through the cinema speakers and it was amazing. The cinematography is gorgeous as well.

The film is amazing, but you do need to be familiar with the characters. There's a lot of things going on in this movie, and there obviously isn't any time to introduce every character. Marvel has spend ten years to set up this epic, so every past film is essential to fully appreciate the grand epic that Infinity War truly is.","10"

The movie is funny, has a story (does that matter) and carries one of the best Superhero movie villain in the history of movies (probably). He grabs more screen time than most of the SUPERHEROES in the movie. Moreover, Thanos is a villain who also 'cries'. Surprisingly, the story does not end here, i.e, after over 2 hrs. Yes it has a sequel! I would not be surprised if Thanos is made a SUPERHERO. He has the moves, the voice , the power.","8"

"mukherjeesubham93","Historic!","3 August 2018","Marvel's buildup to this movie starts from 2008. A decade from there, the first part of their big movie is here, and boy isn't it BIG! No matter how much expectations you have for this one, it surpasses it with aplomb. This is Marvel's most entertaining, action packed, and at the same time impactful movie till date. The Russo brothers have surpassed thier own Civil war, which for me was the previous best. All those who are complaining that there's just action no character development, I may want to remind you, most of the character previously featured in movies where there characters were etched out well. Here the focus is rightly on Thanos. Josh Brolin makes the mad titan one of the most memorable movie villians of recent times. Kudos to Russo brothers by adding a emotional angle to him as well, conveyed through his relation with Gamora. The ending is a huge cliffhanger, and leaves you shocked. Can't wait for the next part!","9"

It doesn't really do anything exceptional, and there really isn't a protagonist or 3 act structure since this is more of an event rather than a film. For what it is it's good. Not a masterpiece, doesn't deserve that high of rating on this site, but it's solid.","10"
"maxastree","FX galore, plastic script","30 April 2018","This movie has thousands of visual effects shots - and except for a few tiny moments, they are all designed, rendered and composited very professionally. You can't get much better.

But now for the bad part - I always had reservations that Disney corp. would make superhero films neutered of real menace, too franchise-ey and too polished/bland and that, in effect, is what's wrong with the film.

The script is frequently tone-deaf, as in totally unrelated to the onscreen action or dramatic conflict, which was an issue with previous entries, and the overstuffed ""Civil War"" (this film's ending is ripped from Birth of a Nation, but so are hundreds of titles in the action/adventure/fantasy genre).

Basically, the best parts of the film are supposed to be balls-out breathless action sequences between the Marvel hero's cast and Thanos, a demon-like intergalactic warrior, except Disney, in all it's marketing ""wisdom"", rob ALL the action scenes of drama with inappropriate, flat ""quips"" to carefully telegraph to parents that this is just a 'fun movie' with nothing more at stake than a bit of fun and some wiz-bang VFX. That, in a nutshell, is what's wrong with the film - in an attempt to please an audience who are increasingly exhausted from forty-five previous sequels in the tights-and-CGI genre, they put EVERYTHING into the movie from the Marvel comics canon, but then rob the movie of any real charm or menace with an awful script. Isolated scenes throughout play really well, but whenever the movie's supposed to hit overdrive and turn into a real ""ride"", the dialogue is annoyingly lame. I rate the film at a ""six"" instead of a ""three"" because of the artful VFX, backdrops, sci-fi props and digital camera moves.

Oh - I forgot to mention; the bad guys plan is super-lame also! Great animation, great costume, great backdrop. Lame dramatic goal, therefore the entire film is tainted with an undying lameness that you can't quite shake off, no matter how much key scenes impress. Worth pirating, if you can push a few buttons and it's raining outside . . .","10"

"AW_McGOWAN","Narrative Payoff In The MCU's Climax","15 December 2020","There was a time when Marvel movies failed to pique my interest. I would see the latest one, enjoy it as an action film, and quickly forget about it shortly after leaving the theater. All of that changed when ""Avengers: Infinity War"" came out in 2018.

""Infinity War"" is the nineteenth film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, and it can be read as the climax to the 10-year-old franchise's vast story. Ever since the first Avengers film debuted in 2012, Marvel has been teasing an arch-villain named Thanos (Josh Brolin) being responsible for most of the mayhem taking place in the massive degesis. In ""Infinity War,"" Thanos finally emerges as the direct threat, enacting a plan to wipe out half of the universe's population for ecological stability.

The movie brings together all of the MCU heroes minus Paul Rudd's Ant-Man and Jeremy Renner's Hawkeye. Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr), Captain America (Chris Evans), Black Panther (Chadwick Boseman), Hulk (Mark Ruffalo), Scarlet Witch (Elizabeth Olsen), Vision (Paul Bettany), Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson), Doctor Strange (Benedict Cumberbach), Spider-Man (Tom Holland) and Thor (Chris Hemsworth) all come together to combat Thanos. The impressive cast only grows when the Guardians of the Galaxy (featuring Chris Pratt's Starlord, Zoe Saldana's Gamora, Dave Bautista's Drax, Vin Diesel's Groot, Karen Gillian's Nebula, Pom Klementieff's Mantis, and Bradley Cooper's Rocket Raccoon) also join the fight.

The star power alone is almost overwhelming, but somehow, all characters get their due, each playing a crucial part in the surprisingly balanced plot. Nothing feels forced into ""Infinity War."" It is a huge film, but a well-orchestrated one. Obviously, there is a lot of action and adventure, but the film also makes time for captivating dialogue and humor. Some of the movie's best moments consist of witty bickering between Starlord, Thor, and Iron Man - all of whom are at their finest here.

Really, all of the characters - with the exception of maybe Black Panther - shine brighter in ""Infinity War"" than they do in any other MCU movies, including their standalone titles. Meanwhile, Thanos also stands out as the heroes' greatest enemy thus far, and the series' best-constructed villain.

From the antagonist's perspective, he actually wants to save the universe. A consequentialist, Thanos believes that killing half of all living things will solve the Malthusian Crisis that all civilizations eventually face. This philosophical stance is antithetical to that of the superheroes, who prefer to maintain a status quo despite any long-term detriments. Thanos is thus a character of significant depth, and his presence makes viewers consider the limits of heroism in a perpetually jeopardized universe - a similar theme to the one tackled in Alan Moore and David Gibbon's legendary graphic novel ""Watchmen.""

It is because of Thanos that I changed my mind about Marvel. Through the villain, ""Infinity War"" stands out as a subversion of the superhero genre. However, it would not be nearly as impactful if it weren't the product of the eighteen movies leading up to it. Because of its predecessors, ""Infinity War"" can be larger than itself and hit even harder when defying preconceived notions of superhero ethics.

One can still view the MCU as an amplification of blockbuster sequelization in modern Hollywood, or as an excuse for Disney to sell toys, or as a cash-grabbing, CGI-infused appropriation of cinema. But despite all of these criticisms, Marvel movies remain effectively entertaining, and ""Infinity War"" demonstrates that producer Kevin Feige has been cleverly engineering this behemoth from the beginning. Intricate details going all the way back to 2008's ""Iron Man"" culminate for a momentous conclusion here.

Of course, ""Infinity War"" is not the end of the MCU. In fact, it is not even the end of the Infinity Saga - 2019's ""Avengers: Endgame"" takes that title. Nevertheless, the film still feels like the extensive narrative's most pivotal chapter. It might be somewhat inaccessible for people not caught up on the Marvel universe, but even an outsider can appreciate it as an epic, game-changing movie that justifies the MCU as a wholly worthwhile cinematic endeavor.","9"
"TxMike","Thanos only wants to destroy half the universe. Can the Avengers stop him?","17 September 2018","The best thing about my watching this movie at home was the BluRay (from my public library) presentation, super video and audio. In the last Avengers movie the focus was on Ultron. Here the focus is on Thanos, played very well by Josh Brolin in motion capture to create a menacing character.

What is lacking, for me, is a good story that unfolds nicely. As some reviewers have said, just putting large numbers of characters in a story doesn't necessarily make it a better movie. The story is pretty simple, Thanos wants to get all the infinity crystals, that will give him the power to destroy half of the universe, as a way of saving it from too large a population. But it often isn't easy to follow and understand the meaning of all the story elements that lead up to the final scenes.

For action junkies this movie has lots of it. Almost nonstop action, fighting scenes, big battles, in fact often too much so that the mind becomes numb to additional gore.

Now I see there is a ""an untitled"" Avengers movie in preparation for 2019. The franchise marches on.","3"

"GomezAddams666","The Greatest of All Time","28 April 2018","I can't think of a movie experience as gratifying as this one. This movie was a complete universe in the making, an experiment that had every possibility of going wrong... but it... did... not!

The whole movie lasts about two and a half hours but you can barely feel it, the mere spectacle is so full of surprises mixed with a healthy dose of humor. Infinity War feels like an intergalactic battle with the higher stakes as The Avengers and their allies fight the biggest threat they will ever face, a god-like Mad Titan by the name of Thanos.

Every single film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe feels like a necessary piece of the puzzle as many of the questions we thought were forgotten will get a resolution.

The Russo Brothers did the best they possibly could and it feels almost as a reward of all our loyalty, this is the movie we deserved... and they gave it to us.

This was probably the best Comic Book adaptation of All-Time.","10"
"marshenwhale","The best that the MCU has to offer","20 May 2023","I am not personally a fan of the standard Marvel Film formula, I think the majority of Marvel films end up falling into the 4/10-6/10 range. However, whenever a film branches out from the standard MCU template, such as the X-Men films or Into the Spiderverse, it can be really good. This movie was special in that is was a part of the mainline MCU series, and still managed to do something completely different from what audiences are used to. And not only was this branching out, it also tied together over twenty movies and provided an excellent climax to the overarching plotline of Thanos and the Infinity Stones. While I have mixed feelings about Endgame, which serves as the conclusion to the MCU Infinity Stones Saga, this film is the climax, and is executed in a nearly flawless way.

The film actually manages to massively improve upon the plotline from the comics, as in the comics Thanos was trying to kill half the universe to impress Death, because Death is female in Marvel comics and Thanos wants to be romantically involved with her. This is actually the plot of the comics, and is honestly pretty stupid, so I really like that his motivation was changed for the film.

Only real issue with the movie is that it still has some of the cheesy Marvel ""awkward"" comedy, but it's a lot more toned down in this film compared to all of the other movies. There is also the fact that some plotlines with certain characters are set up and then not addressed in Endgame, but that's more of an issue with Endgame rather than Infinity War, so it should not be considered a detriment to this movie.

9/10 If you like Superhero films this is a must see.","8"
"view_and_review","Another Brilliant Chess Move","30 April 2018","I was so anxious and anticipatory of this movie that I bought tickets for it a month in advance. I couldn't wait to see the culmination of the various chess moves Marvel had been making over the last 10+ years. How could this movie be anything short of spectacular?

OK, I'd be lying if I said it was spectacular but it was darn good. One of the biggest questions I had going in was how Marvel would showcase the numerous talents. How could they possibly give adequate screen time to the important characters such as Captain America, Thor, Iron-Man, Spider Man, Hulk, Black Panther, Doctor Strange and the Guardians of the Galaxy? Not to mention the secondary characters such as Vision, Scarlet Witch, Black Widow, Falcon, War Machine and others. Then, what kind of villain... no, super-villain could Marvel cook up that would require the assembly of such talents?

To the first question: I think they gave proper focus to the right characters. Some characters were more important than others and some had doper fight scenes than others (ahem, Iron Man, Spider Man, Doctor Strange) but they all got in on the action.

To the second question: Thanos was not just a super villain, he was a super badass villain. He was so bad that even his henchmen could've been primary villains. Thanos was legendary status. He wasn't some amorphous super being, nor was he a science experiment gone wrong or just some very powerful maniac. Thanos was a force and his demeanor made him that much more sinister. He carried himself like he was destined for greatness and the steps to that greatness, however brutal, were just the necessary steps to get to where he needed to be. He was impressive to say the least.

The movie was excellent even if it wasn't quite what I expected. We got to see some major upgrades from Iron Man and Spider Man. We got to see Avenger-like team work with cross-over characters. We got to see boss level heroism and self-sacrifice. We got to see major moral dilemmas. And we got to see an inter-galactic plot. If you haven't seen the movie then prepare yourself and don't be angry with all that happens just be patient because this movie is just one more brilliant chess move by the MCU.","4"

"MackMonMay87","Latest MCU Flick a Gem in Marvel's Gauntlet","8 May 2018","It's a general rule that if you invest more time into something, the more you'll get out of it. This could apply to studying, cooking, maybe a good solid nap, or a good video game. The Marvel Cinematic Universe is no exception. Anyone who knows me even in a casual sense can tell you I'm pretty into Marvel Comics. I can still remember all the way back to the early 90's (all the way back, because, I guess it was a long time ago now) when it was a combination of friend's comics, a few select arcade games, and those awesome trading cards that had character stats on them that first infected me with the Marvel bug. I remember seeing that art and the style, and what the characters represented, and what really blew my mind as a youngling was when I realized that not only were these characters incredible, amazing, and mighty in their own right, but that they knew each other! These guys are a part of a whole universe!! I think that realization was maybe my first time that I experienced a story with an over-arcing lore. Stuff that was read to me by my parents as a kid, The Little Engine that Could, or Peter Cottontail, didn't feature outlandish team ups where everything was on the line (not that I'd necessarily be opposed to Clifford the Big Red Dog and The Berenstein Bears teaming up to knock the stuffing out of evil aliens). I think one of the rewarding parts of a whole universe like Marvel, and their contemporaries, is the sense of reward that the fans feel when they see characters that have their own self-contained franchise and world meet each other and work together. To someone outside of the know, it just looks like a band of superheroes, big deal, right? But to fans, you're seeing characters that have their own harrowed origins, unique powers and motivations, supporting casts, and mythology interact with other characters who are their equals, their peers, and have all of those same elements as well. When you center that kind of team-up around very, very high stakes, like the fate of an entire city, or maybe the world, or possibly, even further, all of the universe and known reality, the excitement and scale of the fictional world that these characters inhabit takes on a whole other level of importance and depth. But how do you communicate something like that in a movie, where you have a limited amount of screen time, actors with restrictive schedules, and budgets to balance? I'm sure that for most of film history, something like the Marvel Universe, in its scale and entirety, was considered something strictly for printed, comic book material. You can see in past comic book films that studios that owned the rights to a whole universe of characters never had them meet, never thought of their headliner superheroes meeting each other, and how that would operate. In the past 10 years, Marvel Studios, in conjunction with a few other distributors until they could finance, film, and distribute movies on their own, has become a giant in the entertainment industry, and it's all because of that same idea and concept that drew me to this world when I was in kintergarden. The right minds at Marvel Studios realized that bigger picture, the overall story, was what mattered, and that if it could be communicated properly, would be something that would change superhero storytelling on screen forever. We thought that everything had changed back when Avengers first came out in 2012, after about 5 and 1/2 years of build up, and that with the follow ups, things had changed even more, but I can definitively tell you that after Infinity War, there's truly no going back. There's often a lot of talk that the superhero genre is going to burst like a bubble at some point, like Westerns and the macho-action films of the 80's and 90's, which is still possible, but fans of the genre and characters should be grateful that Infinity War has been released before that point. After the great reception and revitalization that the well received Spider-Man: Homecoming and Black Panther movies generated, Marvel couldn't have timed this latest entry any better. With this being the 19th overall entry into the series, Infinity War keeps the energy alive in the saga by addressing some of the criticisms that often gets levelled at the MCU by impatient critics and people who might not be as familiar with the overall story: that the stakes aren't high enough, the villains aren't threatening and compelling enough, and that there aren't any consequences for the main characters, that they're insulated and protected to keep the franchise going. One of my main concerns about the MCU since the first Avengers, is that since there's so many moving parts in the saga, how would Thanos be handled and introduced? In the 6 years since he first appeared post-credits, we haven't seen a whole lot of action and development from him as a character. He's a looming background presence, and despite being teased and established in a very basic, general way, we haven't really seen much from him, despite having the opportunity. I'm relieved to be able to say that any worry I had about his authenticity is gone. Thanos is one of the most dynamic, ruthless, yet also fascinating villains in the series and for all of comic book movies yet. Josh Brolin's matter-of-fact and stoic delivery, occasionally dipping into a few surprisingly heartfelt moments, really ties the movie together. The CGI on Thanos captured his expressions, overwhelming power, and menace very well, he blended right in with the cast for me. One could almost say that Infinity War was really about the journey and development of Thanos as a character, and that The Avengers, Guardians of the Galaxy, and the Wakandan tribe are really just obstacles for him that he needs to get past, to accomplish a goal that while sounding insane and vicious, has justification from his point of view. The movie does a great job of taking a character who could so easily be a cardboard cut-out of a villain, evil and cruel just for the sake and fun of it, and makes him into a guy that, yes, while definitely all of that, has a reason for doing what he's doing. It doesn't have to make rational sense, but that his motivations are present and well-illustrated in a few scenes makes him dynamic. Despite how flawed and disgusting they are, even the worst despots from their point of view have some kind of reason for doing what they do, and delivering on that aspect was crucial, and makes Thanos a very engaging villain for us to watch. I now understand that the early movies set the stage for who you thought was going to be a madman of great strength but little character, and then surprised you with a bit more depth once he finally made his anticipated entrance. I can see why the Russo Brothers were chosen to direct this entry, Joss Whedon brought the team together skillfully in the first installment, but I think his peppy dialouge and lingering on petty conflicts, while perfect for the very first time the team has to work as one, wouldn't have worked for a conflict and story on this scale. The Russo Brothers balanced those inter-personal relationships with a huge, multi-faceted story in Civil War, and were brought back to do the same on a level 10 times bigger than before. (Side note: way to rep for Ohio, boys!!!)I won't talk a whole lot about what I thought of each individual character and actor's performance of them, or the action scenes, the powerful emotional moments, or affects, which are all more or less completely spectacular. Infinity War is long, and this only part 1, and there's just too much to address in this review about all of those topics, this would become a long, long essay. Just know that the huge multitude of relationships are handled well as long as you the viewer know these characters, understand how they fit together, and are able to keep track of what their importance to the overall plot is. I'd be interested in the take of a first-time viewer, who watched the end result of a decade of cinematic storytelling, and wonder if they thought it was worthwhile or not. I can certainly tell you that this experience is mainly for those who've invested the same time and energy into this saga that the creators themselves have, and are arriving at this journey after all this time. It's tough for me to view Infinity War as a stand-alone movie, to judge it completely on its own merits, because in my opinion I think that's wrong. I think that's unfair to the design of the story itself, and while I know that there are critics and people out there that will do this (which they're completely valid in doing), it's tough for me to, but I'll try. I do think that it bounces around a lot and the pace can be fast sometimes, but shouldn't it get a pass for this? It has to cram so much into its nearly 3 hour runtime, and even that was split from it being 6 hours with the second part (if anyone from the studio is watching, I would gladly, gladly watch a cinematic re-release of the full cut with intermissions peppered in like they did back in the day). The fast pace and character juggling in a standalone movie without context would be terrible if this were our first time getting to know these characters, but it's not, this movie is a collection of multiple threads that have been established for years, with its own over-arcing narrative thrown in as well. So while I'll take just a few points off for some scenes that I think could've breathed more, or times where I think it brushed past something a bit quickly, again, take that with a grain of salt, because those criticisms come from trying to look at I.F. as its own movie, when really it's a summary of what came before, and I would posit that looking at the movie that way would be the viewer simply digesting the material wrong. I give everyone at Marvel Studios a huge hand for making something for the fans.","9"
"fallencarpathia","Great film but...","9 August 2018","I really enjoyed this film, the acting was spot on, the CG effects were pretty good, but could have been better in places... The fact that Joss Whedon wasn't attached makes it all the better... But the story could have gone in a much different direction if the protagonists had used a little common sense.

SPOILERS BELOW! There's the point in the film where Iron man, Dr. Strange, Spiderman, Starlord, Draco, Mantis, etc... Have Thanos subdued and are attempting to pull his gauntlet off... Surely if Thanos was that big of a threat.... could they not have just killed him there and then? We know the Avengers, guardians of the Galaxy etc aren't above killing to save the world, so why would they not kill him to save the whole universe? Surely that should have been one of the 14,000,605 possible futures that Strange saw right? How did Thanos know the mind stone was in Wakanda? No one told him it was there, the place is hidden from the world, and he obviously doesn't have an innate ability to locate them otherwise he would have easily known where the soul stone was. And how is it that the magical gauntlet managed to kill all of the heroes EXCEPT those that were in the ORIGINAL Avengers movie?

Don't get me wrong, I really enjoyed the movie, but a lot of it seems awfully contrived just so they could make a sequel, when, in fact, it could have all been so easily resolved with just a bit of common sense.","7"
"trashgang","the whole Marvel world coming together","9 January 2019","It's getting difficult to know who is who if you aren't into the Marvel world. Years ago, every superhero had it's own flick so it was for outstanders easy to know what it was all about but once the Avengers franchise started it became another thing.

Not only that, you will need to see all movies to unerstand what is going on. There are no flashbacks to keep you on track. Is that bad, no because by doing so the story starts immediately. If you are not in the Marvel world forget it, you wont understand a thing what is going on.

Clocking in over 2 hours it of course have some moments that you think, really, but overall this is a flick full of action with topnotch effects. And every superhero does what he normally does, meaning, spiderman is funny, the guardians listening to those old cassettes.

This is really a Marvel world as it should be, but if you are not into that world you still van enjoy it but too understand it all it will be hard.

"zurich_leader","What has done been here is phenomenal","25 April 2018","I went into this film wondering if it would suffer from some of the problems of the last Avengers film, too many stories crammed into a very short period.

Fortunately this is not a problem here, despite bringing together 10 years of marvel films they have absolutely nailed how to stop you feeling like It's all being crammed down your throat.

Like a great magic trick Infinity War didn't start April 25th it started the first time we heard about Thanos and the infinity stones, by having his story already laid out there was no need to spend half the movie explaining then motivation of the villain and would you believe it actually mean we get to see a little character development for the big purple guy.

Similarly because we already are familiar with the majority of the characters in this film we are left the best of their interactions, without having to worry about fluff.

Pacing is high intensity here, I couldn't tell you what period of time we by through the film but it seems to be secondary to everything happening, its a minor gripe but there is a strange lack of story, this sh*t is going down you best get on board with it. Again though because the story has already been explained in so many other films you just down seem to notice.

Without spoiling anything then films ending is going to leave you with a billion and one questions which will probably mean an ungodly amount of fan theories while we wait for the follow up.

Bringing this many characters together in one movie without feeling like anyone is being left short on screen time is a feat we don't get to see in cinema on this scale, if anything this is special for that reason alone.","8"

To have the bad guy win and half of the heroes die (not to mention half of everyone else in the universe) was extremely disturbing. Now don't get me wrong, we are not weirdos who expect life to be perfect. But, this ending was very shocking, which others obviously enjoyed. Evidently there is another film coming out (hopefully with a better ending), but not for some time.

Jokes are so dull they make you cringe.","5"
"lovelywaz","7/10, Popcorn film as long as you keep your brain shut and watch the CGI spectacular!","25 April 2018","This review contains minor spoilers.

There are few things you will be doing right after you finish watching this movie. 1- You will most likely be completely silence or speechless. 2- You will want to watch the 2nd part ASAP! 3- You will search the Internet for ""What powers does Cap. Marvel has?"" or read her bio on wiki sites. 4- You will be wondering WHY did Dr. Strange not ONCE used his time reverse trick on Thanos?

Now to the quick review. The movie is GREAT spectacular fun with best CGI created sets and scenes out there. Typical Marvel trademarked one liner jokes are just there for laughs and they an ok job to make you either giggle or laugh out loud. Since it is the first part, you will feel like you were robbed off the full story but don't worry, 2nd part will finish it up.

Onto some ""keep your brain at home"" things. You will see Spiderman struggling to breathe when very high up in the air, which makes sense and all. BUT, later you see your super heroes move around in space on an alien planet / rock without even their masks. How are they even ""breathing"" up there? Where does the oxygen come from, if there's any in the atmosphere at all. I hope Honest Trailer guys will have the balls to point that out when they make one for this movie.

Since Dr. Strange has the time stone, WHY on earth would he NEVER uses it to his advantage during the multiple battles with Thanos? Why not use the same time loop trick, ""Thanos, I've come to bargain!"" or at any other point in time?

How does Thanos decide who will live and who will die? Is it just random after he snaps his finger or has he already chose those who will die? You just see some of the heroes and random people die while others live. WHY not kill ALL the superheroes in a snap if he has the power?

The way ""Time Reversing"" works (at least in MCU and in theory too if it ever does). You reverse EVERYTHING that happened back to a previous point. For some reason, Thanos very conveniently just reverse the shattering of Soul Stone ONLY while everything else that happened during and after that just stays as it is. Once again, I hope Honest Trailers can point out this glitch in the matrix too.

There will be plenty of MCU fans who will blindly rate this movie as 9 or 10 probably just like they watched the movie while keeping their brains at home but if you think even a little bit, this is FAR from perfect, the best MCU movie yet!, OMG this movie is EPIC, type of movies. It has it's flaws, you just need the courage of Captain America to see and admit it. :)

This is the first MCU movie that I don't have the desire to watch it again. I am however waiting for the part 2 just to see how the story ends.","8"
"lasttimeisaw","a farrago of state-of-the-art rescue-and-fighting rough-and-tumble in its most kaleidoscopic register","6 May 2018","To commemorate the tenth anniversary of MCU, spearheaded by IRON MAN (2008), the third Avengers assembly vehemently pushes the envelop of the superhero mishmash, now has a plethora of roll call at the creators' disposal, and bang!, it puts half of the entire universe's population at the risk of perdition if the mega-villain Thanos (Brolin under heavy CGI reconstruction) successfully collects all six Infinity Stones (Power, Space, Reality, Soul, Time, Mind) in his gauntlet.

Apparetly this chapter boasts a series of all-out pitched battles across the galaxy as the fans know it, and marshals stimulating pairing-ups (Iron Man, Spidey mingling with Doctor Strange, Thor saved by Guardians of the Galaxy quintet, and the rest are united in Wakanda) through its non-stop action escapades, whether it is on spaceships, Earth, or other forbidding-looking planets, with a teleporting Thanos always getting what he wants (and rubbing out several peripheral characters offhand), whereas the Avengers can only savor a triumphant tang by eliminating his quartet of minions, aka. Children of Thanos (including Carrie Coon's Proxima Midnight) together with innumerable and ferocious cannon fodders.

The stakes are extremely high, and what lends Thanos an upper-hand to lay his hands on the stones is his hellbent resolution, even if it means to sacrifice someone he loves, a crescendo reaches in the midpoint when the irony of Thanos' loveless temperament suddenly altered by his ostensible crocodile's tears, which reveals his most profound feelings under a villain's pedestrian merciless carapace, and believe it or not, it actually grants him legitimacy to attain the Soul Stone, at that point, one can sense the premonition that nothing can stop him. Yet, the writers offers one fat chance to subdue him in the epic battle executed by the pageantry of teamwork on the planet of Titan, only backfires in the hands of Star-Lord (Pratt), owing to his irrational rage of some very bad tidings, well, a one-stone-two-birds coincidence couldn't be more expeditious.

It is sensible to lay down the final battle on the tiny globe called Earth for earthlings' geocentric pride, and in Wakanda no less, riding on the coattail of BLACK PANTHER's phenomenal popularity. After another much-tarried sacrifice seemingly scuttles Thanos' plan in the Avengers' collective, last-ditch bravado, however, in possession of the Time Stone (Doctor Strange, this one is on your relented sentimentality), Thanos is able to revert to a previous moment and fulfills his feat with a plaintive cliff-hanger when a selected bunch of our favorite heroes morphs into dust and vanishes into thin air.

In the mean, INFINITY WAR is a farrago of state-of-the-art rescue-and-fighting rough-and-tumble in its most kaleidoscopic register, punctuated by amusing one-liners and japes notwithstanding (Drax the Destroyer should be re-coined as the Prankster), and astutely trades on audience's accumulative investment of its bloated dramatis personae, prepares us a bottoming-out scenario for the more rousing turnaround in its upcoming next installment. Most major characters are understandably shortchanged due to its enterprising scale, Thor (Hemsworth) arguably gets the most boost by a new eye-ball and a freshly wrought storm-breaker axe, and Gamora (Saldana), predicated on a closer relation with Thanos, is allowed a more heart-felt passage to finish her own precarious journey, elsewhere, INFINITY WAR doesn't outdo a common MCU audience's moderate expectation, but a solid job is something of a merit at this step, although one might detect a trace of too-big-to-fail conceit might stymie any further bold maneuver in this most lucrative cinematic universe that has been entertaining an overpopulated planet for a decade and now orbits right into its red-hot heyday.","8"

Thanos (Josh Brolin) finally arrives on Earth, willing to gather the Infinity Stones. To face it, the Avengers need to join forces with the Guardians of the Galaxy, while dealing with disagreements between some of its members.

Very good, despite not liking excessively action movies, and the film is necessarily based on action scenes, all very well done and almost hypnotic, very good...

This is just a film of a group of super-heroes that are very confusing, too many plot changes and stacking of hero characters, the storyline is mediocre and imposing to dramatic? The end of the film is forced enough to hang very strange and unclear? How can you be forced to ""wait"" for the continuation of an unclear story? One thing is certain, Avenger's will take revenge and win right in the next film? Think of it that way. But this Infinity Wars movie is really boring.

If I can compare it, then the LOGAN movie (another superhero movie) is more emotionally touching, human sentimental. But it not ever happen with this film. Only entertainment films, which are made with the aim of making a profit, with a messy plot.

Not recommended for connoisseurs of good movies, but please for super hero worshipers.

"SugarandIce","Far better than I could have imagined","21 May 2019","Even with the Russo brothers directing Infinity War, I was never certain a film could work on this scale. So many sci-fi elements, so many characters... it was so far from the grounded film the Russos made before and Marvel was going into even more bombastic territory than GOTG or the Thor films. What would decide if this film could work was going to be its villain and its usage of its characters. I'm happy to say that it succeeded in all fronts. The pacing in this film is quick and impeccable. Every character gets something to do, albeit some more than others. Its villain, Thanos, is likely the MCU's most compelling villain and the core of the film. He is not only intimidating and dread-inducing, but also sympathetic. This film is also incredibly dark with violent deaths, a grave tone, and writing that lacks much hope. This film has an emotional core, shocking themes, and amazing action. The CGI is fabulous, the score is masterful, and the visuals are eye-popping and wonderful. Infinity War is the best of the Avengers films, and will be remembered for decades as the masterful pinnacle of this cinematic universe, a decade in the making and well worth the wait.","6"
"mr_bickle_the_pickle","WOWZA! Have the heroes finally met their match?","28 April 2018","I've tried to keep this review as spoiler-free as possible as I really want everyone to go in and be surprised. Since there may be minor spoilers, I have tagged it as such.

First of all...WOW. It honestly blew me away. I truly don't think we've had a superhero film feel this epic yet. And it gave you a bit of everything too. It was dark, it was emotional, it was full of twists, but also knew when to make you laugh and smile. There was a nice balance. One of my big worries going into the movie was the sheer size of the cast and how that would be balanced. And I think it was pulled off well. Yes, there are some characters that get more screen time/lines and there were a few that werent in the movie at all. But, I felt it was all a decent amount of screentime (no one feels like a glorified cameo). And the thing with having such a big cast like this, is seeing all the various team ups. For the most part it seems to follow 3 different groups. One on Earth and 2 in space. But even when some of the characters do join another group, that was great as well. I smiled so much at the interaction between Winter Soldier and Rocket. Or Cap and Groot. And speaking more specifically about the characters there were a few that really stood out to me and were my favourites in this. First is Cap. Now, I've always liked Cap and his movies. Winter Soldier has been my favourite movie so far (although I honestly think that honestly might be replaced with this one). But in this one, he's just so especially baller. Like, I dont think people give him enough credit when it comes to the ""strong"" Avengers. But my god, he really holds his own against Thanos. Second standout is Thor. One of the biggest reasons is that he gets some more of the more emotional moments. There is a scene where he is talking about how he has nothing else to live for now (his family is gone, his friends are gone, his home is gone etc) and I legit was tearing up. It was such a great scene, well acted. Hit me in the gut. He also has another great scene earlier when he finds out that Gamora is Thano's daughter and everyone expects he's gonna start a fight, but instead he justs pats her on shoulder and tells her that it's ok. Family is complicated. Plus, of course he also just gets some really badass moments too. Gamora also is a standout. Again, there's lots of really great emotional scenes with her. Specifically scenes with her and Thanos. She despises him and wants to take him down and yet and the same time has this connection with him and it is hard for her. And Zoe as well just really does a great job. Thanos is also one of the HUGE standouts. There's been a couple of good villains so far in the MCU (mostly forgettable) and Thanos tops the cake. Like, he is honestly scary. And he's powerful. Like, our heroes definitely try their hardest but they just can't best him. And its honestly a bit refreshing to see. Plus, he also doesnt come across as a one note, mustache-twirling villain. This is a guy who honestly thinks what he is doing is for the greater good and to bring peace. And he does care for Gamora. And Josh Brolin also just does a great job. And the mo-cap is really good and can make you forget at times that you're watching a CG character and not a real person.

Story wise, also good. I had a small gripe that Thanos already has the power stone at the beginning, and so you never know if the characters that you meet in the first GOTG movie like Glenn Close and John C Reilly's characters are ok. But I also understand that it was likely due to time. I mean, you cant show everything unless you want this to be over 3 hours long. And they had a lot to get through, and I think it was balanced well. The reality stone was really cool and Im suprised he didnt use it more, cause I think it would have really effed up some people. I did like that there was a theme of sacrifice. More specifically sacrifice for the greater good. It pops up a number of times. With Gamora and Star Lord. With Gamora and Thanos. With Vision and Scarlet Witch. Even Doctor Strange does.

It does set up so many questions and possible theories for the next Avengers installment, but honestly I'm excited. I think the first Avengers film is going to play a big importance in it. That it will come full circle in a way.","9"
"AnishMisra","Avengers Infinity War Review","22 May 2018","Avengers Infinity War is a film directed by the Russo Brothers. This film was my most anticipated film for this year and I can definitely say the same for every MCU fan out there. I viewed the film very late and knew how much I had to wait. But the wait was worth it.

Plot: The Avengers team up with the Guardians of the Galaxy to stop Thanos from obtaining the 6 Infinity Stones.

Story and Direction: The Russo Brothers and the writers had a huge and daunting task of bringing all of the characters that we loved for all these years into one big movie. And I can just say that they did an excellent job. Never for a moment do you feel that the characters were not given space and time to do what they wanted. The character work for this film is just flawless and I think Thanos was just the best villain MCU ever had. Although he is strong and kind of undefeatable, he has emotions which provided a lot of weight to his character. The film is has a much darker tone compared to other MCU films. The stakes in this film are very real and never there is rest for the mind. You do feel the tension lingering around and feel for the safety of your characters. But the film does retain that Marvel brand of humour in places. And all of the jokes are very funny and do provide relief. Given the film was shot on IMAX cameras, the visuals are just awesome. I had goosebumps just looking at how beautiful this film looked. Also the action scenes were awesome. And the VFX was just jaw dropping. Action scenes were just awesome. Although there were some shaky cam scenes, but they were just perfectly handled. The score by Alan Silvestri was quiet good and complemented the scenes very well. Also the film doesn't end in a very peculiar way. It takes a very different route, which was very well appreciated. I did have one little issue but here I am being quite nit-picky. Some scenes in the trailers didn't make it to the film which was disappointing and also the Thor storyline didn't feel much important to the film.

Performances: The Avengers and The Guardians were just awesome with Thor being my favorite character in the entire film. His presence and his comic timing were just awesome. Idris Elba and Tom Hiddleston too deliver good performances. Josh Brolin was just excellent as Thanos. Every time you watch him on screen you do feel that he was just the correct choice. Also the Black Order was nice to watch. And finally, Peter Dinklage. He also delivered an earnest performance for his role.

Favorite Scene; It would be Thor's scene with the Guardians. That scene lightened the mopd for a bit and also gave that kind of entertainment you expect out of these characters.

Verdict: This film satisfied the Marvel fan in me. I walked out of this film with a lot of questions about what will happen next and I can't just wait for the next instalment arriving next year.

I am going with a 9/10.","10"

Bigger than you believe. The movie was near perfect. Probably ranked in my top 3 favorite comic book movies of all time. It was an emotional roller coaster, and it made me cry. And that's saying something since Logan didn't even make me cry. The visuals are amazing, The Black Order was amazing, one of the best part of the film. It's also crazy how much character development Thanos had in one film. The Russo brothers actually made me love him. And to conclude my review, I walked into the theater paying 20$ and walked out having to pay 300$ a week. If someone can send me Marvel's address and everything so I can bill them for my therapy sessions that would be great :) one more thing I would like everyone to stand 2 minutes in silence for our fallen cinematic universe; The DCEU, may they rest in peace.","10"
"zacharyconte","Marvel Did It.","13 October 2018","Infinity War. It felt like we have been waiting for it for years (or even since it was first announced). Josh Brolin does a fantastic job voicing Thanos. The Avengers team up with the Guardians Of The Galaxy to prevent him from getting the Infinity Stones. The movie had its funny moments. Not as funny as Thor: Ragnarok's jokes, but still can be found funny.

WARNING SPOILERS BELOW!!!!! --------------- So. About the funny line: Drax makes up this joke and here how it goes: Tony, Parker, and Strange meet the GOTG, Quill says ""where is gamora?"" then Tony says ""ill do you one better WHO is gamora?"" then drax says ""WHY IS GAMORA!!"" And about the whole preventing thanos from getting all 6 infinity stones, you would probably think: ""its marvel. the heroes always win"". But you guessed wrong because thanos ACTUALLY gets all 6 stones and he snaps his fingers. Causing half the universe to die. Here are the people who are known to die:

Bucky, Black Panther, Falcon, Spider-Man, Star-Lord, Drax, Mantis, Doctor Strange, Scarlet Witch, Nick Fury, Maria Hill. Those are the people who die from the snap. Now finally, here are the people who DONT die from the snap: Heidmall, Loki, Vision, and Gamora. THE END","4"

"The-Sarkologist","Thanos is Magnificent","27 April 2018","Well, this seems as if it was the first Avengers movie where Tony Stark didn't hog the centre of attention. In fact it seems to be pretty evenly spaced between all of the Marvel characters, and with the number that have now come into the franchise, I was wondering how they were going to handle the huge ensemble. Well, it turned out pretty well, though of course when you have so many super heroes all gathered together the bad guy is going to have to be pretty tough, and they outline they quite quickly where he takes down the Hulk. This is probably one of those movies that we don't need to say anything about the plot because it has been building up to it for the last ten years, and anyway it is actually based on a comic book series as it is. So, we have this Titan, Thanos (Titan as in an inhabitant of Titan as opposed to one of the old gods from Greek mythology, though Marvel hasn't shied away from borrowing from mythology as it is). He has this plan to depopulate the universe and to do that he needs these stones called Infinity Stones, and when he has all of them he will become invincible. Once again, the movies over the last ten years have been dropping hints as to these stones, and now we have basically come to the climax of that story arc. So, the question that is raised, is where to from here. Well, I'm sure the avid comic book readers do have a pretty good idea since there is quite a lot of material that can be borrowed from. However, we also need to remember that this is actually part one of a two part series, so the story isn't over yet. The problem is that with the ending as it is, there isn't all that much room to be able place any movies between the two Avengers movie. However, it seems that we will be seeing Captain Marvel and Ant Man and the Wasp before the grand finale to this Avengers movie. Okay, this may be a bit of a spoiler, but then again I have warned you, but characters do die, which is a bit of an oddity because if there is one thing with comic books and that is characters always seem to be able to come back. Well, that seems to be the case with the movies as well because Loki seems have have had some miraculous resurrections. However, I will leave it at that. Now Thanos, they certainly have put a lot of effort into creating a villain that works. There are a lot of shallow villains out there, and Thanos certainly isn't one of them. Sure, he has a motive, but it isn't one of those 'I want to conquer the universe' type of motives. In a way he seems to just want a bit of peace and quiet, and the problem is that overpopulation certainly doesn't allow room for that. Sure, he is pretty powerful, and when you are going up against pretty much every single Marvel hero that has appeared to date (with the exception of Ant-Man - he is mysteriously absent in the film), you certainly are going to have to be of a special calibre. As for the comedy, well, they certainly have toned it down a lot. It was starting to get to the point where the movies were simply turning into a collection of one liners, particularly with Thor: Ragnarok. However, this wasn't the case here, which did help quite a lot. I do hope they continue along that trend and continue to tone down with it. However, it was a shame that some of the really cool characters from Ragnarok went missing in action as well, but I think the opening scene pretty much explains that.","10"

"paulijcalderon","Spectacle and weight, perfectly balanced","25 April 2018","A culmination of the first 10 years of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. It's kind of insane of far they've gotten. There isn't any major development on previously established characters in this one. But that's OK since we have 18 other movies where you can get to know everything about them. Thanos is the man who's at the core. It's really good because now the villain isn't sidelined at all. Bold chances are taken, which actually makes you feel the important weight that this movie needed to bring. All in order for it to leave a greater impact and resonance compared to what the MCU has done before. It's a theme park ride, but with real care put into it. It's not merely action and special effects for the sake of it. There's a real humanity at the core of this extravaganza.

I'm the guy who doesn't read the Marvel comics. I've become a fan of these characters because of the MCU films. I knew nothing about Iron Man or Thor or Captain America. Now I have gotten to know them throughout the years thanks to this series and I feel a greater appreciation for them. The films haven't been fantastic masterpieces or anything, but they have given you what's necessary: An understanding of the hero. They have also brought some great fun and the adventure that you may want in a movie going experience. However, this time you are given something extra. There is a reward for having gone through 18 films. You can nitpick this because of tonal shifts and focusing on so many story-lines. I honestly think it's very impressive how it was put together in the end. Must have been a nightmare juggling what could have been a complete mess. Thankfully it isn't.

Try to stay away from spoilers since this is definitely ""Mic Drop: The Movie"". I will say one last thing before ending the review and please stay with me on this one. People say that there's going to be Marvel fatigue because there's been so many superhero movies coming out every year. And with some of them I understand. The Repetitiveness has been felt. But look back at the 50's or 60's when the grand epic super-scope films were based on mythological stories or historical figures or biblical tales. Movies like ""Jason and the Argonauts"", ""Ben-Hur"", ""The 300 Spartans"" etc. Those were often pure spectacle with a huge scale and the masses went to see them because they were events. The plots were adapted from very old stories. Archetypical stories with classic heroes and villains. All of those stories have been adapted by now. So the Marvel films are kind of acting like an equivalent of that for modern times. The superhero stories are from newer sources, but they feature similar archetypes. They have pretty much become replacements of the epic films from back then. The mythological stories are much older than the comic books and are naturally more respected and known. Superhero tales are more recent, but when you break it down to the core, they carry on that legacy. So take it easy with them and enjoy the experience.","10"

"Jeremy_Urquhart","The best the MCU has to offer","7 March 2021","(Contains some spoilers)

Avengers: Infinity War is a movie I've now seen three times. The first was at the cinema in 2018, where I was fairly up to date with the MCU, but hadn't seen all the movies in the series. It had an impact on me and I thought it was pretty great, but a second viewing in 2019 right before the release of Endgame (and after catching up on all the previous entries in the series) made me like it even more. Now, on a third viewing, after seeing how the saga essentially concluded with Endgame, I feel ready to call Infinity War easily the best of the series by far.

I know this is still broad, relatively straightforward entertainment, and I can understand why some viewers dismiss it, but for a number of reasons, I see a genuinely fantastic movie here. It's not without some nitpicks here and there (there is one fade used during a dramatic moment that I'm not 100% sure works), and you could argue the pace is just too fast. But for me at least, I love the pacing. This is one of the fastest movies I've ever seen, and it just never lets up (the closest it comes to slowing down is probably Thor's trip to the armoury, but even then that's a pretty small part of the film).

Thanos continually talks about ""balance"" as a reason for doing what he does in this film, and it's funny because the amount that the film itself balances is truly impressive. So many characters coming together (and all given at least one chance to shine), a variety of tones jumped between quite seamlessly, from comedy to dread to excitement to tension to tragedy, and everything in between, and so many different locations jumped between in a conflict that truly does feel universal, and all that in a movie that's still under two and a half hours (and like I said, it's one of the fastest two and a half hour runtimes in existence).

It would already be great without the way it ends, but the final few scenes are bold in a way that no other Marvel film has come close to matching. I can only imagine what kind of impact it would have had on me if I'd been 9 years old in that theatre back in 2018, rather than 23. Yes, it's not the end of the saga, and yes, there is another Avengers movie that is about undoing much of what happened, but ultimately, Infinity War does ultimately leave the viewer with a sense of uncompromising dread. There are no quips or moments of levity once what happens actually happens. There is no really indication about how any of what transpired can be undone. And there is a feeling that - for now at least - the good guys lost. And not only lost, but were crushed.

Thanos is a fantastic villain who is really the only ""new"" character in this film, or the one who goes through something of an arc. He's been seen before, briefly, but this is the film where we find out what he's all about, so while you get to check in with all the other characters who were introduced in previous movies, there's a strong argument to be made for this being Thanos' movie. While his actions aren't heroic, he is the film's protagonist, and his logic is explored and presented in a way that - while horrifying - is still somewhat understandable. You don't sympathise with him, but you can see where he's coming from, and that (plus his sheer strength and the impressive special effects used to depict him) make him an outstanding villain.

I don't know- there's no way to say everything that I want to about this movie. From a writing standpoint, with all its characters, all its different emotional beats, its unrelenting pace, and its pull-no-punches ending, I think it's truly masterful. The almost flawless special effects, immense spectacle, and all the huge action set pieces are really just icing on the cake.

This is easily the greatest movie in the MCU so far, and maybe the only one that deserves to be called truly ""great"". I'm not sure how the MCU series will be remembered overall in decades to come, but I'd like to think this one at least will be looked back on fondly. It might be one of the best blockbusters of all time, and in all honesty, for the reasons I've tried to explain, might be my favourite comic book movie I've ever seen.

For all the flaws of the MCU, I think this one is something genuinely special. After thinking about it for almost three years now, and revisiting it twice since its initial release, I see no reason to not give it a 10/10, in all honesty.","9"
"timothyalanwilliams","Thanos Rules in ""Infinity War""","29 April 2018","The anticipation has been building for years. The ultimate baddie, Thanos, who has remained in the shadows, is coming to earth the get the five Infinity Stones that would give him the power to destroy half of the universe with one snap of his fingers. With the current Avengers disbanded, after the events of ""Age of Ultron"" and ""Civil War"", they weren't exactly prepared for a foe like Thanos. To avoid any spoilers, I will leave the plot details at that. ""Avengers: Infinity War"" really packs a punch. It's relentless action and quick (and often witty) dialogue keep the two and half hour movie rolling without slowing down for you to relax or, at times, really process what just happened. To balance all the Marvel Cinematic Universe characters, and subplots, was a feat in and of itself. I applaud the Russo Brothers (who also directed ""Winter Soldier"" and ""Civil War"") for taking on such a daunting task and succeeding in keeping us engaged while giving the primary Avengers, as well as The Guardians of the Galaxy, their own moments to shine. But this movie isn't really their movie. It's all Thanos, played by Josh Brolin buried under CGI to make him look more monster than man. But he finds a way to emote and make his character more than just another big baddie without a soul. The movie isn't perfect. There are a few CGI moments, mostly of Thanos, that looked like they needed more time to finish. And it's cliffhanger ending (the untitled ""part two"" will release May of next year) left me feeling numb and somewhat unsatisfied. But be sure to stay for the post-credits scene. It's worth the wait.","10"

Avengers: Infitiy War is the 19th film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe and inspired by the 1991 storyline The Infinity Gauntlet by Jim Starlin for Marvel Comics. The intention had been from the beginning by Marvel Studios to lay the groundwork for a massive crossover wherein the characters of the MCU would fight Thanos and beginning with the character's first teased appearance at the end of the first Avengers film, there was a conscious effort to link several MacGuffins from various individual films as ""Infinity Stones"". Anthony and Joe Russo signed on to direct the two part Avengers Infinity War films following their success on the Captain America which along with writers Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely whom had shown their capability in handling and balancing large scale projects with an ensemble cast. With both films touching upon nearly every aspect of the MCU established up to this point, the $400 million production became a smash success making $2 billion worldwide becoming the highest grossing film of the year. The movie also received critical acclaim and rightly so as it's a film where it feels like your patience and attention has been rewarded with a threat that has heavy stakes and a memorable villain.

From the first moment where the movie begins that sees Thor, Loki and the surviving Asgardians casually taken down by Thanos, this is a story where nothing feels like it's safe or off limits. While the movie covers a large ensemble cast of almost every character (save for Ant-Man and Hawkeye), the movie's plot is kept pretty simple and straightforward with it basically boiling down to a race to get the stones and/or keep them from Thanos while the primary focus is on the characters and how they're handling this situation. The movie went through a lengthy development process in terms of writing and deciding which characters would be teamed up with others and the crossover element is well handled with some unique pairings of Rocket and Thor or Doctor Strange, Iron Man & Spider-Man leading to some great character friction both on a dramatic level and on a comedic level but not to the point where it feels like it undermines the drama. I rather liked Josh Brolin as Thanos and his performance gives a lot of weight to a character whose appearance is that of an 8 foot tall alien in golden armor. If I were to criticize the film I'd probably say Thanos' companions ""The Children of Thanos"" aren't all that well developed and to the best of my knowledge I don't think their names are spoken during the film.

Avengers: Infinity War feels like The Empire Strikes Back of the MCU with heightened stakes, a desperate situation and an ending that feels like it leaves the audience at their lowest point.","1"

"NarniaIsAwesome","Avengers: Infinity War is... Better Than the Usual Marvel Fare.","28 June 2018","Before I begin, I must warn you that I am not a Marvel fan, so my opinion may be a bit ""mediocre,"" while an avid fan would be thrilled with this film.

Firstly, I must say that the movie does deliver when it comes to excitement and well choreographed action; unlike the recent 'Spider-Man: Homecoming' and 'Thor: Ragnarok,' where the fighting went on and on and seemed boring and sloppy.

The humor is also slightly better than other Marvel films where comedy is ""attempted."" Also, the gags and one-liners were timed well and did not interfere with drama scenes, as they have before, taking the seriousness out if it.

And of course, the most anticipated element of the film was the rumored ""shocking"" finale. The end of the movie was indeed a surprise, which makes it exciting to look forward to the next installment. There are some superheroes that were either underused or did not appear at all, but I imagine that Marvel will work them in next time.

Most of the actors gave strong and not-too-hammy performances, and the plot actually made some sort of sense (aka they tried to explain it).

The only downsides were the completely unrealistic stunts (but of course we expect and enjoy those in a superhero movie), a few slightly cheesy lines, and a very brief moment of painfully bad CGI. And, I'm sorry, but I'm kinda tired of Stan Lee's inevitable cameos. It was funny the first 20 times, but now it's getting a little old. But that's just me.

So all in all, I was impressed with 'Avengers: Infinity War,' I will definitely see Part II, and that's really something coming from me!","10"
"CarpeDiem12","Thanos War","25 April 2018","It is a well balanced movie. Best Marvel movie in the whole franchise. It has a cohesive plot and flow. Thanos War is an apt title as this movie focuses on the villain more then the 20 or so superheroes enlisted to fight him. You get to see the world from thanos's eyes. A different perspective which is what makes it different and better. If you waited for an epic Thanos movie you have got it.

Thanos gets fully fleshed out and his motives and desires become clear. It shows what he is prepared to lose in order to gain his goals. He is the only decent villain to come from marvel and rightfully so as the stakes are never higher. There is plenty of action and it isn't just mindless fighting.

"matthewssilverhammer","A Big, Giant, Entertaining Mess...With One of the Boldest Superhero Endings Ever","6 May 2018","Pardon the cliché, but Infinity War is truly an emotional roller coaster. Unlike previous entries in this long-running behemoth of super-people, this ride's ascents and dives come faster and furious-er than Vin Diesel driving a sports car through a skyrise window. And (at the risk of really pushing the metaphor) this coaster's biggest drop comes seconds before you exit the ride, leaving audiences with a sense of ""Woah..."", unlike most other comic book films. To clarify, this isn't the best MCU film. For one thing, better entries in the series say something outside of themselves. Iron Man touches on the military-industrial complex. Spider-Man deals with modern-day class issues. All the Captain America entries wrestle brilliantly with government overreach. Infinity War is (for better or worse) focused on plot and character. In spots, it lands its punches (Thor's arc, Thanos' brutality, anything Guardians); in others, it misses (initial attack on NYC, Vision & Scarlet Witch love story, anything Cap). It's a gargantuan undertaking, and your investment in the story and forgiveness of its unwieldiness will only goes as far as your predetermined commitment. If you haven't been keeping up with the franchise (which is essentially a big-budget television show), this is not the episode to jump in on. A 10 years / 18 films / 50+ superheroes bottleneck whose ambition has only been matched by its success. By its very nature, there's only so much you can do to keep this thing from flying off the rails. However, if you're already committed, then the endless barrage of humor and excitement, which crescendos into an unexpected emotional gut-punch, will make for a haunting and bold (though not quite fantastic) Marvel outing.","7"
"stevendbeard","Bloodbath","28 April 2018","I saw ""Avengers:Infinity War"", starring Robert Downey Jr.-The Judge, The Shaggy Dog_2006; Chris Hemsworth-12 Strong, Vacation_2015; Benedict Cumberbatch-Zoolander 2, August:Osage County and Josh Brolin-Only the Brave, Sicario. This is the best super hero movie that I have ever seen. It is the first part of a two part story-the second part will come out next year, as they were both shot at the same time. This is the 10th anniversary of the Marvel cinematic universe-the first movie being Iron Man in 2008-and I think the 19th movie overall. This one has almost any character you can think of-I read that there is about 64 main characters that show up. Thanos is the villain here, portrayed by Josh in magnificent form. He is after the 6 Infinity stones, incredibly powerful gem stones that when combined, would make him unstoppable. Each gem is in a different location and each has a different power; Space, Mind, Power, Reality, Time and Soul. Benedict is in possession of one, as is the Vision, so you can guess who is coming to town on a hunting spree. Robert and Chris both have their shots at Josh, with little chance of slowing him down. Why does Thanos want these gems so badly? He simply believes the universe is overpopulated-resources, food, etc.-and just wants to cull the herd a bit to make it a better universe for everyone else. He travels across the galaxy destroying about half of a planets population and smiles while he does it. The heroes have to unite in their fight and that's when you see some pretty awesome fights. And there are casualties-you might even say it's a bloodbath. And I'm talking some of the A-listers here. There is the usual Stan Lee cameo-look for him driving a bus full of kids-and there is a scene after the end credits, so don't leave too early-there is another casualty. It's rated ""PG-13"" for intense sequences of sci-fi violence and action, language and crude references and has a running time of 2 hours & 29 minutes. I loved this movie and can hardly wait for part 2. I would buy it on Blu-Ray.","8"

This movie was absolutely overwhelming from start to finish, and it really brings a strong emotional aspect that we have never seen from Marvel before. No doubt this is in my top 5 movies of all time, and there is no reason why you should not see this movie. But, before you see it, if you are not familliar with the marvel universe, I recommend doing a little bit of research before going.","6"
"wycherleyp-960-470658","How can Marvel top this???","27 April 2018","This film is simply stunning, all the hype and antisipation do not do it justice.

From the start it's all go and the first 10mins of the film ensure you go through a few emotions, Thanos is here.

The story of how a group of superheros need to put differences aside to deal with the real end of world threat of Thanos is told to perfection, and how it all comes together is done in a way that now Marvel has a big problem!!

How can Marvel top this non stop rollercoaster of torn emotions??

I'm trying my best to not write a spoiler here so my review is short and sweet. People have said the run time is too long and these folk are stupid as there are so many questions coming out of this film and believe me when I tell you, As soon as the film starts time goes by and you will leave the cinema not realising you just spend over 2hrs in their.

This is the best film Marvel has done and will be impossible to top it","10"
"davidmvining","A miracle that it works at all","26 November 2019","With so many characters, the Russo brothers made an intelligent choice to center the emotional core of the film within a new character and the only one large enough within the narrative space to justify it: the antagonist. Outside of him, the movie's essentially the biggest episode of a serial ever. It does that quite well, but it ends up squeezing out Thanos a bit. He's good and enough to anchor a movie around, but everything else around him is pure spectacle and little else.

I say little else because all of our heroes get their moments. Thor talking about everything he's lost. Vision and Scarlet Witch's little romance taking shape. Peter Quill's grief at the loss of a loved one. It's all there, but it almost all depends on things outside this movie to work. Not that anyone would ever come into this movie without having at least some knowledge of the myriad of franchises that precedes it, but I think it deadens the impact of the moments since the emotional workload isn't held within this movie itself. This isn't like the final moments of a three-part movie like The Lord of the Rings, this is the culmination of more than twenty films, each with their own adventures and main characters, that end up tying together here.

So what you do have is a well-produced series of epic fights and events in the vein of a man on a mission type story, peppered with small character moments, revolving around the character of Thanos.

Thanos is the biggest threat the Avengers have faced (other than Dormmamu who was going to wipe out the entire universe in Doctor Strange, I guess), and he's one of the better antagonists. I don't think he's miles better than Hela, Loki, or Vulture, but he's definitely in that league. He's a titan driven by an ideal, and he's pure psychopath. Some people put forward the idea that Thanos could use the power of the Infinity Stones to double the universe's resources, but that misses the point of the character. He's a Malthusian through and through. He sees intelligent life as a cancer, infecting the universe, and that's what must be wiped out. He's so psychotic that to even dream of reasoning with him is asinine. He's committed, and he demonstrate that commitment to his vision by sacrificing his beloved adopted daughter to gain one of the stones (the Soul Stone).

Meanwhile, our heroes take on several different related goals. There's the attempt to remove and destroy the Mind Stone from Vision's forehead. There's Thor trying to replace Mjolnir. There's Iron Man leading Dr. Strange and Spider-Man (joined by most of the Guardians of the Galaxy) to fight Thanos before he gains full strength on the titan's destroyed home planet. The story is structured around these different tasks, each told with the Marvel brand of quippy humor, seasoned with just enough emotion borrowed from the franchise's history, and built to all crescendo at the same time.

That crescendo, which really takes up the last hour or so of the film, is something to admire. There are so many pieces moving and so many parts flying in so many different locations that the fact that it's easy to understand who is involved in what and why on a consistent basis is kind of remarkable. The Russo Brothers have evolved a lot in terms of action cinematography since The Winter Soldier. They still have a preference for shallow depth of field, handheld camera, and close up photography, but they edit it a bit less frantically and pull back more than enough to firmly establish geography.

One thing they haven't really grown on, though, is visuals in general. It's an interesting contrast to watch so many of these movies in a row. Just a few movies back was Guardians of the Galaxy: Vol. 2. In it, everything with brightly colored with array of beautiful things. When Thor shows up in the Guardian's ship, the same location that was so easily bathed in color in the previous movie has been dialed back to almost complete darkness. The movie as a whole isn't dark (the fight in Wakanda is very brightly lit), but it's fascinating to see some of the same locations and costumes that had been so colorful drained of it all in this. I think it's an incorrect visual choice for the franchise, especially as it embraces its cosmic side. It needs to be crazier visually instead of dark and ""grounded"".

Still, I find Thanos a good villain, the ride overall fun and engaging, and just wish that it didn't rely so much on the previous movies and looked brighter and more colorful. For a movie that I could not see as being anything other than an expensive mess, that's quite an accomplishment.","10"

"Reviews_of_the_Dead","All Roads Lead to this First Part and it Doesn't Disappoint","1 June 2022","This is a movie that I've been waiting to show to Jaime. It is on the Internet Movie Databased Top 100 movies poster we are working through. We've watched all the Marvel Cinematic Universe movies to this point. This is my second watch and I warned her coming in that this is rough. Not in a bad way but knowing her it would mess with her emotions.

We pick up where the last one left off. Thor (Chris Hemsworth) and the people of Asgard are attacked on their ship that was fleeing. Bruce Banner is there, unable to change back into the Hulk. Loki (Tom Hiddleston) is also there. Thanos (Josh Brolin) is there looking for the tesseract as it is an infinity stone. He needs to collect them all to wipe out half of the cosmos, as he feels it is overpopulated.

This causes the Avengers, the Guardians of the Galaxy and all other superheroes to assemble. There is limited time and they're on the defensive against this much more powerful force. Decisions must be made, lives sacrificed, but it all pales to what happens if Thanos' plan succeeds.

My first watch of this was in the theater, at the Gateway Film Center. I originally powered through to catch this on the big screen. Coming back to it, I love the time and care put into the MCU. There are so many moving parts that come together. There are strained relationships, there are stakes in this movie. This also feels like The Empire Strikes Back with the focus so much on Thanos and the failures of stopping him. I'm usually a fan of the villain, so that works for me.

It is crazy to think of the budget that went into this movie. Almost every character is here. This is also a CGI-fest, but the money they put in looks good. Jaime also brought up that this feels like the individual movies of the characters we seen, but it seamlessly works. I agree there. Seeing these characters interact makes it enjoyable. My goal is to seek out the comic run that had this to see how different they are as well. This is one of the best in the series and I think that the MCU did an excellent job getting here. There is also heart and I'll be honest; I get sad in the end as well. I give credit to be able to do that.

My Rating: 9 out of 10.","8"
"markphilo","A brave direction","1 June 2018","As opposed the the narrow minded bunch who can only screw off I rate this movie highly. Not the full ten - it would have to be perfect for that.

But in one movie, they've brought the whole bunch of characters together and a few of them get slain. Great! As normally there's a work around so it's all better in the morning, but not here where they could have whimsically done so when there's a time travel option knocking around. They actually stay dead!

And for me personally, they offloaded some of the characters I wasn't that keen on, so Quids-in! (Well - I'd like to have confirm Pepper Potts was on the list)

Plot is long but held attention of me and 2 teenagers. Some nice touches of teenage Groot and look out for the sign in Scotland ""We Deep Fry Kebabs"" - Ha ha nice touch!

It's got sad bits, comedy bits and action. It's a marvel movie.

How here's the question ... I was pondering if this movie therefore has the highest body count of any ever done? Think about it .... half the universe? That gotta be more than a 100 right? We can add those 1/10 reviewers to the list too!","1"

Some of you may think this is weird, for someone to want a movie franchise like MCU to end this way. But I don't want to ruin the amazing cinema experience this movie offered to me. I don't think any Marvel movie ever made have offered this much entertainment, action and emotion at the same time.

Finally someone who can really kick literally any superhero ass and walk away unscathed with élan. With every passing minute of the movie - you end up liking Thanos more and more. After the 'Civil war' - superheroes on earth are broken into pieces and scattered around earth - and the mightiest of all foes steps in to fight them in groups. The only superhero who really stands up to Thanos is Stark - and majestic as Thanos is , he respects Stark.

The movie - is a long but thoroughly enjoyable one. Guardians of galaxy step in and will have you chuckling every now and then - apart from the witty remarks of Stark and Spider-Man.

Highly recommended for the comic fans.

Most impressive superhero - Tony Stark. Least impressive superhero - Vision (he literally does nothing but lay around and lament)

"michaellaing71","Good film, better than I had expected","26 April 2018","I enjoyed Avengers: Infinity War much more than I had expected and was impressed that the film was as good as it was considering all the characters Marvel were including from all the other MCU films.

Generally the film is well paced and the story is ok. A lot of what happened in Civil War seems to have been ignored and whilst the story is pretty simple it works ok, though if you think about it for a few minutes the plot holes do start to show but for the most part the film doesn't give you a huge amount of time to dwindle on what happened 5 minutes before, so it isn't a big problem.

The film is quite dark but does have Marvels normal amount of humour, particularly in the first half of the film. The action is handled generally very well and but like most Marvel films, it does become a bit of a CGI fest at times.

The big thing with the film is getting the characterisation right. Thanos is given much more of an character arc than I expected, not just the normal evil villian we have grown used to with most of the MCU films. The other bad guys in the film feel much more throw away though and they don't really hold the threat that they really should.

As for the good guys, it is really very much the norm, with each character conforming to their normal stereo type, not that this is always a bad thing.

The score is pretty forgettable but does a decent job. The effects are very good and the cinematography looks pretty nice.

Overall I gave it a 7 but it is probably work a 7.5. I does everything pretty well and is well worth having a watch, particularly if you are a MCU fan.","4"

End Game was an easy 10/10 instant epic Classic & so is Infinity war, the special effects are fantastic as always & the action is incredible & the great characters all get some real time to shine with that hilarious banter & humour that the Avengers are known for but also the stakes are much higher here & the danger is even more deadlier for our heroes.

The evil Thanos is collecting up his Infinity stones & will destroy anyone in his path with his deadly army & he's here on earth causing mega destruction & all our heroes come together & join forces in an epic battle of good vs evil to save our world.

I loved this movie so much & it's a huge big budget blockbuster movie, a beautiful fantasy adventure that is ridiculously entertaining & fun. I love big popcorn movies & comic book movies & I've loved nearly all the MCU flicks that I've seen & Infinity War is probably my favourite of the Avengers films & one of the best Marvel has made. The cinematography is gorgeous & the music theatrical & exciting & i loved having the Guardians of the galaxy back here & of course the hilarious Thor steals the show alot with his hilarious attitude & kick-ass fighting, i love that dude but all the characters do get a great scene or more to do their stuff.

"amesmonde","Pulls out all the stops","2 May 2018","The evil powerful Thanos is on a mission to collect all six Infinity Stones, which will destroy 50 percent of the whole galaxys population, only a group of superheroes stand in his way.

With its ensemble cast (too many to mention) Avengers: Infinity War is almost wall to wall nonstop action with comic book quips throughout. Thanos is surprisingly likeable in parts and adds some emotional weight making the story more dynamic. Viewers to make sense of chaos on the backdrop of outstanding effects, fantastic sets and outlandish costumes may want to watch Civil War, Guardians of the Galaxy and Thor Ragnarok to name a few essentials to make sense of the sacrifice and devastation on display.

Directors Anthony and Joe Russo offer an enjoyable film with surprise deaths of beloved characters (Loki in the first few minutes) scattered over its well paced lengthy running time, which whizzes by. While older comic book readers may not be able to work out why these on screen character don't have that secret je ne sais quoi of their paper counterparts, ultra geeks and readers of more recent comic series will no doubt find it a movie Marvel blast. Unlikely characters are paired together, creating some enjoyable comedy, tension and action moments as the story gets bleaker and bleaker for our heroes.

With some sharp editing and writers Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely leave Infinity War on a cliffhanger not seen since The Empire Strikes Back*. Or for those who will never watch another Marvel instalment, behold the most nihilistic ending to a comic book film ever.

*There's the obligatory after credit scene where Nick Fury calls on Captain Marvel to help Marvel film fans sleep at night until the next installment.","8"

It felt like a film made by committee of management consultants.","10"
"raja-mishra7","This was THE MOVIE, and the fact that the movie even ended- was a huge disappointment!","28 April 2018","The major challenge for such a huge movie- was distributing screen time among the ""protagonists""! Marvel almost managed to make it work.

All the big guys of the MCU got their screen time. Some, a bit more than the others, but it didn't disappoint! What did was the fact that not everything gearing up to Infinity War was given enough reel!

I went with some unnatural expectations. I blame Thor: Ragnarok for it- that movie was a game changer- it set the bar real high! And, due to that, with the Infinity War, not all the expectations were met, really!

I felt the film moved a little too fast in the first half, leaving behind some details unexplored. In an ideal world, I would have loved to prolong and detail the scenes and juice up the experience! May be (120 minutes x 2) instead of 1 150 minutes film.

Pros:

The obvious one! Some interesting fight sequences and some inspiring plot movements helped the movie hold the attention. Fight sequences were well managed. Right characters were given extra screen time. justified Infinity War plot better! It brought everything Marvel had been making for last 10 years together!

Cons:

Too many events for one movie. Some second grade characters were given too much of screen time. Too much left unexplained to leave the movie on a cliff hanger. Some incredibly stupid scenes on which the plot directly depended makes one feel that the plot was forcibly pushed on a direction. I was expecting one big wild card entry and one special emotional moment- that didn't really happen! Last 15 minutes were somewhat disappointing. Among other things, the fact that the film ended was heart breaking. This one had only one post-credit scene, meaning, at least one more post-credits was cut out!","6"

A little long perhaps, but cramming all of the characters in here from avengers, guardians of the galaxy and so on, then it has to be.

It's a fun ride and worth a watch. Whilst a good stand alone movie, it does set you up for part two, even referring to ""End Game"". So despite its flaws I'll certainly watch Endgame.","7"

"Silver5963","Perfectly Balanced, As All Things Should Be!","24 February 2023","I reserve the 10/10 rating for that occasional, once or twice in a lifetime movie that exceeds every expectation, and Avengers: Infinity War is definitely worthy of this rating. Infinity War is easily one of the greatest movies of all time, perfectly structured and amazingly executed. Here's why!

Thanos has been looming in the distance since 2012's 'Avengers Assemble', and he's finally come for the Stones! Thanos is the perfect example of a villain who believes he's doing what's best, and will stop at nothing to achieve his goals. Thanos exudes power (and not just because of the Power Stone) and is such a large threat to the Universe that it takes all of the heroes the MCU has so far to combat him, and even then they failed! And the iconic finger snap was one of the most highly talked about movie events of it's time. Perfectly executed!

All of the different MCU heroes from Spider-Man to Iron-Man and Captain America to Black Panther all bring about their own strengths as characters and their interactions with each other are perfect. Take Thor and the Guardians of the Galaxy who fit together so perfectly. The way Thor and Star Lord try to out-manly each other was humorous, as Chris Pratt offers up an impression of Chris Hemsworth's God of Thunder. Additionally, Iron Man and Spider-Man already worked well together but adding Doctor Strange to the mix worked perfectly. Every character had a place in this movie.

The Infinity Stones took the typical trope of the villain trying to obtain an item but quintuples it as Thanos tries to find the five remaining Stones. Each Stone led to a conflict between Thanos and a group of heroes (Space - Asgard, Reality - Guradians, Soul - Gamora, Time - Strange, Spider-Man, Iron Man, Guardians, and Mind - everybody else!). Each stone often came with a tragic death, as Loki, Gamora, and Vision all bit the dust before everyone else became literal dust. The death toll was always going to be high, but as someone who didn't read the comic this movie was based on, I never expected Thanos would actually win and kill half of all life in the universe!

A quick note to say Alan Silvestri's compositions for this movie are amazing and always fit each scene so perfectly!

This movie brought together great chemistry between heroes, an awesome villain, and a perfect plot. Avengers: Infinity War is one of the most significant movies of the 21st century, and quite possibly one of the greatest movies in cinema history, if not purely for it's grand scale. A must-watch for everyone, MCU die-hards or not!","6"

I loved how this film could just as easily make me laugh with its very well-placed tension-breaking humour as well as make me feel sad or scared for the characters, it awed me a whole lot, I was just consistently entertained by it and I was so impressed by how a film with such ceaseless action and such a vast array of characters could work as well as this does without feeling cluttered or overwhelmingly bloated, but they pulled it off big time, this movie deserves all the success and praise it's getting. I loved how beautifully it brought together and combined the stories of the Avengers and the Guardians of the Galaxy without it for a second feeling off or jarring, or anyone compromising who the were as established characters, if anything seeing characters together that I really never thought I would like Rocket Raccoon and Thor sharing such great and easy chemistry, really opened up and broadened them as characters even more. And how they brought to life and expanded upon the long-teased menace of Thanos was just incredible, instead of being a one-note villain who you just hated, they made him like a troubled almost tragic figure who's twisted vision for a better universe had cost him his soul, you really got that it broke what was left of his heart to sacrifice Gamora. They made Thanos truly epic, he got out of that chair and he brought every bit of that galactic wrath down upon our heroes, I mean you kind of knew that they were completely screwed when the Hulk gets trounced in the opening scene! The cgi looked fantastic too, he had as much presence as anyone in the cast, looking all-but completely real. I loved this, Marvel did not stumble at this critical juncture with the movie house of cards they've been stacking for this past ten years, and this one was a fantastic gem that was well worth the wait, my mind was totally blown! Just one little thing though, what the heck happened to the ""and this puts a smile on my face"" line?! Absolutely brilliant, awesome job guys!","10"

Even though there is no Ant-Man, The Wasp and Hackeye (sorry if I'm forgeting someone else) this movie has pretty much everything! I have a feeling though the upcoming Avengers movie will be even bigger. I only have one questions to some critics mentioning the fact that the movie last 2 and a half hours, like it's something bad...well I didn't see you complaining about any Lord of the Ring films or any other movie that is more than 3 hours long... When the movie ended I felt like I didn't have enough, never felt bored! Thanos is badass! Couldn't and Shouldn't be anyone else in this movie. The end was unexpected since it's an unfinished chapter but you get to see what the 6 infinity stones are capable of! The post credits scenes was really good, I cannot wait to see first the Captain Marvel movie and then to see if she's gonna be in the 4th Avengers movie (I think she's confirmed) and then how can she change the whole situation.

Overall it was a breathtaking movie and definitely an experience when you to the theatre. I liked the development in many key characters like Iron Man, Captain America, Thor and also the new Iron Suit for Spider-Man.

This was a good film, it had strong points and it had disappointments as well. The fighting scenes and some touching moments were well done but at the same time the elements that have led Marvel produce some of the best superhero films were not there. Granted this was a more serious film but the humor was lacking. Captain America did not have his shield, the Avengers didn't fully unite but fought in different parts. Steve and Iron Man didn't even share a scene together. What might have been better could have been having those separate fights in other realms and later having the whole team fight together on Wakanda. To me the biggest issue was pace, Marvel films excel at having great space and making great use of their time. This film had a slow pace at the start and sadly a bit boring sometimes.

To me the film to beautifully tie their universe together was Civil War. This was a great film that devoted time to each hero, pitted them in a great match up and showed off their strengths. Don't get me wrong I enjoyed it but after all the hype I expected more. Pretty good but not great, other films such as Thor Rangarok, Spider Man and Ant Man hit it out of the park. Thanos was a great villain and Josh Brolin deserves praise. It was sad to see our heroes disappear but I am excited to see what's next. This was surely part 1 and part 2 will be the film that might live up and exceed expectations. It was realistic to have him win round 1 to make for an even great round 2.

And when basically every single character appears on-screen, the theater erupts into claps and screams of joy. I always love it when a studio or company can make people feel such excitement for their characters. It's just really cool.

This movie features lots of different locations that the characters travel to. I must admit, some of these locations are absolutely gorgeous and others, totally desolate, but still incredible. I love the shots in space and on different planets, especially the snowy planet that Thanos goes to at one point. In fact, the whole movie looks fantastic. Everything - from the costumes, the camera angles, the scale, the special effects - everything! I was so invested in the visuals the entire time.

Also, let's be honest, this is Marvel, we all expect this movie to be absolutely hilarious. And it is. No surprises there. I laughed so hard at Iron Man and Doctor Strange arguing, Star Lord being jealous of Thor and basically all of Spider Man and Drax's dialogue. Comedy always seems to be Marvel's greatest strength. The writing, in general, is fantastic. I love the interactions these characters have, even the dramatic moments. That's coming from someone who usually hates dramatic moments, because I hate being sad in movies.

This is a superhero movie, so obviously there are some pretty cool action scenes. And yeah, this movie has some awesome action scenes. Probably my favorite is the huge fight in Wakanda that is shown in the trailer. The fight is absolutely massive and straight up amazing. The shots and the way the characters work together are just glorious. I felt so immersed in all the action.

Since this movie is connected to the other Marvel movies in their Cinematic Universe, there is the possible question about whether you need to have seen all the other movies in order to understand this one. I would say, not all of them, but at least a few certain ones. I recommend that you brush up on your Marvel characters before you go, just to be ready.

I give this movie 5 out of 5 stars and recommend it for ages 12 to 18, as it gets pretty dark.

"richardgeuter","It's about as good as it had any chance to be","7 May 2018","If you consider yourself a fan of the Marvel universe, you can stop reading here and just go watch ""Infinity War"". Of course, your mileage out of it will vary depending on your investment with the MCU, so it should be stated that while I have seen all the other movies in the franchise save for ""Doctor Strange"" (just haven't gotten around to watching it yet) and even a couple of their TV series, I wouldn't consider myself a big fan. That is to say, I don't generally rewatch most of the films in the series, though I have enjoyed all of them, some more, some less.

I was not expecting to like this movie as much as I did. Bringing together all the characters from 18 different movies, most of which I have half forgotten since their respective release dates, in a two-and-a-half-hour superhero science fiction action epic that inevitably is going to act as a jumping-of-point for another couple of sequels and also has to throw in fan service for people who have been following this franchise for ten years much more obsessively than I did, that sounds like a movie that could make my brain hurt a lot. Thankfully, ""Infinity War"" is about as good as a movie like that could realistically be. If it were any better, I would seriously have to call it a masterpiece.

Especially in its first half, ""Avengers 3"" is incredibly entertaining. The various meet-ups of Marvel characters seems fairly fluent (though there are a few convenient coincidences that drive the characters together), and the superhero banter rarely gets in the way of the story. Thanos is a good villain, and the script goes a long way in making him out as an intimidating and interesting threat.

The Russo brothers have also staged their action scenes quite well: Though there are a few moments where the camera movements were too quick for me to make out what part of the carnage I was seeing, most of the fight scenes are a lot of fun to watch, thanks to great cinematography (when it was filmed in an appropriate tempo) and choreography. For the kind of movie it is, there is even some restraint in those scenes, as the final battle doesn't outstay its welcome and most of the action scenes feature a rather small amount of villains - though fans of gigantic battle scenes obviously need not worry, there's enough of that, too.

Emotionally, the film is - as advertised - much darker than the rest of the franchise, though Team Feige is too smart to turn their flagship movie into a depressing, joyless melodrama. As in their own movies, the Guardians of the Galaxy sometimes even ruin emotional scenes for me with some ill-placed punchlines. But there's still many moments in which even amidst all the effects-heavy destruction you can see how good the actors in this movie are.

There are a couple of missteps that the movie takes, most of them all but inevitable. Not all of the 30+ main characters of the story would have needed to be in the film, and occasionally their presences are a bit distracting, if only for the fact that I found myself thinking ""What is --- doing right now?"" when a scene doesn't give them much to do and instead focuses on the bigger players. Furthermore, as was hard to avoid, making the Avengers split up into several sub-groups on their own individual quests means dividing the main story into many subplots, and, not all of them are equally interesting. Particularly frustrating is the part of the film in which a number of action scenes happen simultaneously in different places, yet as if that wasn't enough they also had to throw in a slower scene that runs concurrently (and would have fit much better into an earlier section of the film).

This film is far from perfect, but the fact that I enjoyed it at all is a minor miracle to me. If you've enjoyed (most of) the Marvel movies up to this point, it almost goes without saying that ""Avengers: Infinity War"" is a must-watch. I would not go as far with my praise as others have, but I did have a great time watching it.","7"
"ersbel","Valuable","13 May 2019","For me this movie is good because it makes a good example why a eschatology is basically a stupid idea. The plan ""for the end of times"" falls and any two pieces won't fit together, leaving the story in need of a very dynamic part to simply jump from one aspect to another. And in this case, the script does deliver: they have to jump far and to jump often and with enough FX so audience won't stop to think WHY? In a way the audience becomes a junkie saying ""gimme more"".

I was quite disappointed of the end, but thanks to Wikipedia now I know that was actually Part 1, and there is a Part 2, pretty much like the final part in the Harry Potter money machine.","10"
"WeAreLive","Avengers Infinity War (Part 1)","6 May 2018","This review is for English reports for college so do bare, with me if there are any SPaG errors or if I am missing any details.

So I finally got round to seeing Avengers Infinity Wars yesterday, and I have to say I am completely mind blown. This is probably the best movie of 2018 heck even best of the whole Marvel Cinematic Universe.

Over the past decade or so MCU has been doing very well with their movies and so far I have enjoyed if not all but majority of their movies (Iron Man 3 not so much). Ever since 2008, there have been over 18 movies stating with the first Iron Man movie.

If you haven't caught up with the movies or if you are missing any I would recommend you watch them first before you buy tickets to watch this movie or continue reading my review because there will be spoilers as I go along.

As usual the acting, special effects, camera angel and plot of movie was all good. All though the only problem I found with this movie was that too many things were going on at once. But luckily that never put the actual down.

There is a lot of Easter eggs which may surprise for example when Thanos is about to claim an infinity stone there is a similar figure that resembles the Red Skull and towards the post credits before Nick Fury turns into dust you see the symbol for Captain Marvel on Nick's phone which may foreshadow Captain Marvels appearance. But I am very surprised that Nick Fury never contacted her for the first or the second movie but he contacted her for this.

Towards the beginning of the movie I wish we got to see how the Asgardians got knockout by Thanos which was still puzzling to me and where Hawkeye and Ant-Man was during the movie and did they disappear like the other few people or are they still there. Also I am not really sure if I am comfortable with the fact that has a cyborg eye and the Stormbreaker (which is owned by Beta Ray Bill in the comics) hammer because he lost both in the previous movie, Black Widow having blonde hair or even Captain America having facial hair and regular shield instead of Wakanda making him the same since they have metal as previous one he lost in Captain America Civil War and I wonder why The Hulk was resentencing Bruce Banner to transform.

The best scenes are all of the fight scenes with Thanos and the black order, the bit where Teenage Groot gives Peter and Rocket attitude, the chemistry between Rocket and The White Wolf and when Ned does a distraction for Peter. The scene when Spider-Man is about to disappear and he is crying for his life to Tony saying ""I don't wanna go"" I nearly cried at that scene and when nearly all of New York is about to disappear. There is a few deaths which you might cry over in film but I won't say who because I think I have spoiled plenty.

I am glad this movie had the Hulkbuster and the Spider-Suit.

All and all Stan Lee and the rest of the crew did an amazing job. If you haven't seen Avengers Infinity Wars yet I would recommend you go watch it. 10/10 I could even give it 50 or 100 if I could. Can't wait for Part 2 next year and the upcoming Ant-Man and the Wasp movie coming out in a few months' time.","9"
"Charltonium","Mind... Blown... FOREVER!","27 April 2018","This top part is spoiler-free

I'm not sure where to start with this movie. I've seen other reviews for this movie that had titles like ""better than the hype"" and ""I need a therapist""; I can honestly say the same things after watching it for myself.

The action was almost nonstop, but still fun and engaging nonetheless (although I still appreciated the few slow moments it had). The plot was straightforward and spot-on, predictable in many places but mind-blowingly unpredictable in others. There was a small amount of character development, which is still impressive considering how this movie has way too many characters (but the writers and directors were able to pull it off somehow). There was a lot more humor than I expected, which not only made the movie even more entertaining, but it also exemplified the wonderful chemistry between all the crucial characters.

Thanos made a fantastic villain, easily the best one since Loki. And something that impressed me about this movie is that even Thanos' top-ranking henchmen were insanely powerful, even when compared to the other major villains throughout the franchise. Even the thousands of mindless soldiers Thanos sent on everyone (more particularly during the battle of Wakanda) seemed to pack their punch. It was because of these aspects that we actually had real concern for our heroes, because they were all banding together to face off an enemy, and an army, that was seemingly invincible (especially considering how much power Thanos has with his Infinity Stones).

One thing I will forewarn, however, is that if you're trying to figure out the plot and uncover the spoilers just by watching the previews, you might be on the right track, but the trailers are also fairly misleading.



SPOILERS BELOW. Do not read unless you've already seen it or just simply don't care about seeing it.



Out of the cameos that happened in the movie, Stan Lee's was funny as always (although more brief than usual), Peter Dinklage's appearance was somewhat strange considering how he's a little guy portraying a giant (in my mind, he's still just Miles Finch from Elf), but the one that permanently blew my mind was the Red Skull's appearance on that planet with the Soul Stone (I was disappointed to find out later that he wasn't played by Hugo Weaving again, but at least this answers the epic question as to what happened to him at the end of Captain America: The First Avenger).

The Russos had previously denied the theory of this movie having a serious cliffhanger ending that will be resolved in the next movie (like Harry Potter, Twilight, Hunger Games, Hobbit). I'm not sure whether to call them liars, because this movie's ending can either be seen as a tragic end or the worst heartbreaking cliffhanger in history - Thanos wins by snapping his fingers with the completed gauntlet which disintegrates half of all living souls in the universe into ash.

However, here's the ultimate kicker: Earlier, Doctor Strange mentioned that, out of the approximate three million possible endings for the infinity war (forgive me, I forgot the exact number he stated), there was only one way for Thanos to lose. After Thanos successfully obtained all six stones and obliterated half of all life, Strange mentioned that it is going according to plan. In that case, I would expect Doctor Strange to be the most crucial player in the next movie alongside Captain Marvel, who was teased in the post-credits scene.

Out of all the character deaths that happened in this movie, I can expect only a few of them to be permanent. Those who were killed prior to the end (Heimdall, Loki, Gamora, Vision(?)) I can expect to be permanently dead, but those who were disintegrated after Thanos' finger-snapping (Bucky, Black Panther, all the Guardians except Rocket and Nebula, Spider-Man, Nick Fury) I can expect will return for the sequel somehow, according to the plan Doctor Strange had in mind (but the sequel might have even more permanent deaths). Besides, Marvel has already planned sequels for Guardians of the Galaxy, Spider-Man, and Black Panther.","9"
"Cinema-reviewer321","Fight for Infinity Stones","25 June 2022","Avengers: Infinity War (2018) is a fantastic part 1 to the Infinity Saga finale the MCU has built up for several years.

Every single actor playing every single superhero is fantastic. Since we know these characters throughout all the movies, we can get behind all of them and tell how hard they are trying to stop the worst possible thing that can happen to all living things.

The big villain Thanos played by Josh Brolin was fantastic. The villain that has been teased throughout the MCU made a grand entrance and you can understand why he is looking for the Infinity Stones, also he is immensely powerful when going up against the Avengers.

The action scenes are awesome, the effects look great, and the way he uses the Infinity Stones is cool. The 3rd act ultimate battle is great and visually pleasing to watch.

The movie has a surprising ending that will leave MCU fans speechless. Avengers: Infinity War (2018) is an epic part 1 to the finale of the Infinity Saga.","8"
"buih-47731","Impossible to forget","1 January 2019","I gave this movie 8/10 to Begin with. Now i have given it a few Months to really sink in and i simply have to give it 9/10 simply due to the fact that i still vividly remember it.

The pacing is slow and it takes it's time to show All the different plot lines slowly merch together as the film comes to an end. Yet, it does not feel slow. It moves along constanly and not a minute is wasted. You are never bored and your mind is constantly racing trying to piece everything together.

Thanos is both charismatic and yet very frightening. The acting from Josh Brolin is phenomenal and the motion-capture is actually flawless.

The battles are engaging and large, yet they still feel small and down to earth, which gives the film a very nice feel and style.

The cinematography is absolutely astonishing, and the set design, costume work and overall look alone, is enough to Sell this movie.

Avengers Infinity War can both be watched as a thoughtful and emotional film, and fun movienight entertainment.

"peterp-450-298716","I'm not a superheroes-flick fanboy. But this was fun to watch.","14 August 2018","Smile. For even in death, you have become Children of Thanos.

Me and superheroes. We have a kind of love-hate relationship. One moment I'm really enjoying the character or the story. At that time jealousy bubbles up and I wished I had those specific powers in my daily life. And sometimes I have absolutely no feelings about the superhero or I find the story not so fascinating. I surely can enjoy a Hulk movie because of the devastating power this superhero possesses. From ""Spiderman"", I like that youthful enthusiasm that Peter Parker radiates when discovering his new power. And in ""The Guardians of the Galaxy"", I appreciated the humor. Finally, ""Deadpool"" and ""Ant-man"" were refreshing. But when I watched ""Thor: Ragnarok"", I simply fell asleep. ""Avengers: Age of Ultron"" I found so terribly confusing. After 20 minutes I no longer understood what it was about. And the whole ""X-men"" universe left me indifferent because of the lack of affinity I have with this club. It will be due to my not so great interest in superheroism. And every time, I come to the conclusion that all those superheroes are connected in one way or another, which makes it look like a web of facts and events.

But ""Avengers: Infinity war"" was entertaining. First of all, because a large part of the Marvel clan appears in it. It's like a grand finale of all Marvel heroes. Together they try to join forces to prevent Thanos (Josh Brolin) from grabbing the six Infinity stones, so he can destroy half of the population in the universe with the snap of a finger. A simplistic idea of this super-villain to make life more pleasant on overcrowded planets. A purple environmental activist. He quickly gets hold of the first stones. However, the other two remaining stones are on Earth and require a little more effort from Thanos because they are surrounded by the remaining superheroes. What follows are sometimes hallucinating-looking battles and superhuman confrontations. As we are used to from the Marvel clan.

I have to admit it. I was able to follow the story without difficulties (and that might have something to do with my age). Usually, the story isn't so clear for someone without much knowledge about this world of superheroes. You could even call the film exciting. That's no self-evident fact when it concerns unbeatable superheroes with unprecedented forces who seldom fear to be defeated. And you know they are going to use the well-known trick of resurrecting the seemingly defeated hero. Even though the situation seems hopeless, you can be sure that one of the heroes will put his butt on an intergalactic toilet where, after the necessary superhero-pushing, he'll produce some super weapon with which they shrink the bad guy to the size of a smurf, such that the universe is again saved from a catastrophe.

To keep things simple, they've split the whole into a number of different storylines in different locations where a group of heroes each has their own fish to fry. This ensures a pleasant change and amusing interactions. Personally, I thought the conversations between Dr. Strange (Benedict Cumberbatch) and Ironman (Robert Downey Jr.) at times quite hilarious. Even the inner battle of Bruce Banner (Mark Ruffalo) with his character Hulk caused me to chuckle. Only occasionally the coincidence is really laughable. But isn't this characteristic of such a superhero flick? For example, Hulk is catapulted from an Asgardian spaceship and flies several light years through the universe, after which he lands with an immense smack on earth. And where? Through the roof of Dr. Strange's house. What a coincidence.

When you think there's an oversupply of movies with superheroes in a latex suit and that the point of saturation had already been reached, then you can call this film an orgasmic highlight. And hats off to the makers for transforming this heterogeneous mixture of characters into a colorful whole. Certainly not a simple task. And even though I'm not a big supporter of sequels and I'm allergic to anything that smells like serials, I still look forward to the second part of this epic story. I wonder what one has to come up with in order to exceed this. That will be an impossible task. Even for superheroes.","9"
"truemythmedia","An Achievement","15 May 2019","Whether or not you are a fan of the MCU, you have to admit that this film will be a part of cinematic history. The MCU is a massively successful franchise, a franchise that has made more money than any other franchise in history (true, there are more films in this franchise, but that's still an accomplishment). Not all of the films in this franchise are good, but almost all of them are watchable (at least once). This film was really good, but, like I said above, you really have to put in the work if you want to reap the rewards. If you like the MCU, you already know you're going to see this movie anyways, and you're probably willing to forgive it for most of its flaws. This movie is absolutely worth seeing. It won't win any large awards at the Oscars next year, but it's certainly a very well done and extremely entertaining comic book movie; in the end, that's why we came to the theatre.","5"
"CitizenKaneAAAAA","Captain America: Civil War made a better Avengers honestly","28 April 2018","The film opened at 25th April and i have watched it 3 times already. not because it's a good film, but because it's one of the coolest film ever. i mean... we got twenty something superhero that we've followed since the first Iron Man from 2008, and we got to see Thanos that has appeared in the first Avengers. But my worries has come true. would it be enough to put twenty something superheroes including bring together some of them for the first time, telling a lot of jokes (some of them REALLY unfunny and appeared at a bad timing), intorducing the three dimesional character that Thanos possess, some great battle sequence, and then finding the stones, and actually a lot more. well, somehow they managed to push them into 2 and a half hours film, but it felt rushed. the relationship between Thanos and his daughter Gamora felt so plastic even though that is one of the tools for the audience to get to know Thanos better. and a lot more issues. but it;s still a cool and very risky film to make, dozens of stars, more than 3 complex plots filled with different characters that contrast to each others, i still have to give it a props. and the ending is worth waiting btw, really breathtaking.","6"

"Holt344","Entertaining, epic and extraordinary, a masterpiece in the superhero genre","19 April 2019","A huge production that became one of the most expensive movies of all time and with that huge budget they created something big, something superb. The movie is simply astonishing and epic, having a crew and cast filled with people that is extraordinary at their job. It's my second time watching this as I'm getting ready to see the anticipating sequel, Endgame which I believe will be better than this one. The Russo Brothers created a masterpiece in the superhero genre and will hopefully be remembered for years to come in the film industry. The visual effects are astonishing, probably the best Marvel have ever done after the Guardians of the Galaxy movies. At first I thought it didn't deserve 10/10 but after re-watching it I've to say it really does as it's incredible and the writing are actually perfect, one of the best Marvel stories to date as it's unpredictable and unique.

The ensemble cast is superb, simply beyond great. Their chemistry is what makes the characters work as they show how good they work together in the fight sequences and overall at anytime. The fight sequences are perfect, giving us well choreographed fights with the characters working in ways that wouldn't be possible if there wouldn't have been a bunch of movies of them teaming up together and getting to know each other personally. Josh Brolin is the true star as the villain Thanos, a character so evil but he manages to make him a character with emotion and human, mostly for the writing but his acting and performance is special and goes down to the best villain of the Marvel movies.","5"
"sonnygoten","Overstuffed; should've cut out Team Cap","19 May 2018","It had its funny moments and its emotional moment, but it also had that same sense of being overstuffed that I felt in Age of Ultron. Especially during that battle in Wakanda, I felt like falling asleep, because the action just got boring. Another big battle with 20+ heroes being given a 3-second-long one-scene-wonder against a huge army of CGI-generated mooks. Honestly, I felt that the entire Team Cap storyline was the weakest part of this movie. They should've ditched Captain America, Bucky, Black Widow, Falcon and Rhodey like they did Hawkeye and Antman; their absence would've made little difference, and the time wasted on these one-note characters could've instead been used to better flesh out the background that led Thanos to come to his conclusion to wipe out half the universe and also Thanos and Nebula's relationship. Like, why is she treated so differently compared to Gamora?

Most enjoyable moments were Bruce returning and giving Tony a hug, quips between Dr. Strange and Iron Man, and the interaction between Iron Man and Spiderman. Scenes of the Guardians meeting the Avengers was also great to see.","9"
"jadepietro","If It's Action You Want","2 May 2018","GRADE: B

THIS FILM IS RECOMMENDED.

IN BRIEF: A superhero movie with a puny and weak plot and non-stop action.

JIM'S REVIEW: Superheroes. They come in all shapes and sizes, with varying super powers and enough attitude and skill to fight against evil and protect mankind. More importantly, they rake in millions at the box office. The DC Comics and Marvel universe have taken over the movie business and offer critic-proof blockbuster after blockbuster for the insatiable moviegoing public.

But perhaps my favorite crusader comes from neither source. He's a little big man by the name of Buzz Lightyear whose famous catch phrase and mantra was...""To infinity and beyond"". That classic line may be over two decades old, but this toy oracle saw the future of cinema back in the mid-nineties. Which leads us to the 18th film from the Marvel Studios series, Avengers: Infinity War, the latest pop entertainment from one of the most successful and profitable franchise in cinema history.

In this installment, we discover that there has been a rift among superheroes. There is Team Ironman and his loyal crew of major and minor characters (Thor, Spiderman, The Hulk, Doctor Strange) versus Team Captain America and his colorful line-up of rogue groupies (Black Widow, Vision, Scarlet Witch, War Machine, White Wolf, Winter Soldier, Black Panther, Falcon), plus the Guardians of the Galaxy crew. Lots and lots of superheroes with little time to spare for deeper character development but lots of time for CGI and action stunts. Yet what will unite them all?

Why, of course, a truly bad villain, namely Thanos, who wants all six of the magical infinity stones in his possession in order to dominate the world! (Maybe, collecting trading cards of all of the assembled superheroes might have been a more challenging goal for our conflicted outlaw.) Yes, the plot is puny and weak, but the consequences to stop this megalomaniac are of the life and death variety. So all you need to know is that the battle lines have been drawn over the prized McGuffin, with one battle scene leading to the next for maximum enjoyment. ACTION is in not in short supply, even if logic and high drama take a backseat to the frequent combat sequences.

Anthony and Joe Russo ably direct and keep the pace at warp speed lest they disappoint their youthful target audience. A screenplay by Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely juggles the misadventures on the different planetary destinations with varied results, some are simply more interesting than others. To its credit, it establishes many likable quirky characters and their camaraderie is infectious due to the actors' personal stamps on their recognizable roles. Yet the movie has a hard time spreading its narrative with a balance of equal screen time and does little to advance the development of some central characters and their interrelationships. Too often the numerous sub-plots and mini-expeditions with such a large ensemble wears thin. Dialog has some clever humorous retorts but rarely aspires to any real poignancy or gravitas.

The gangs all here, with an all-star ensemble that includes Robert Downey Jr., Chris Hemsworth, Mark Ruffalo, Chris Evans, Scarlett Johansson, Benedict Cumberbatch, Don Cheadle, Tom Holland, Chadwick Bossman, and in lesser roles: Paul Bettany, Elizabeth Olsen, Tom Hiddleston, Anthony Mackie, Sebastian Stan, Chris Pratt, Zoe Saldana, Benicio del Toro, and others too numerous to name. Josh Brolin effectively plays the evil Thanos and creates a strong adversary who allows power to corrupt his soul.

The CGI is impressive throughout. Less effective is the editing and handling of transitions. At times, the well staged combat scenes intercut some of the action. Too much planet hopping interrupts the overall flow and gives the film an episodic vibe...the sum of the parts never making a very cohesive whole. Yes, there is much to hold one spellbound with its big budget cast of thousands approach and the film's fine production values, but all the rigmarole and commotion almost exhausts the moviegoer rather than enthralls.

One eagerly awaits for the fractured teams of heroes to meld into an unstoppable force, but it never truly materializes and the cliffhanger ending is far from satisfying. This long and epic film literally comes to a stop with no clear denouncement, taking Mr. Lightyear's phrase and deciding not to settle anything soon, just looking beyond...to the next installment, with no end in sight.

In Avengers: Infinity War, the war rages on and on...and the Marvel franchise lives long and prospers...to infinity.","8"
"oscar-williamson","A lesson learned - don't take movie database scores/reviews on faith!","29 August 2018","Warning, this review contains a rant with lots of exclamation marks!

Okay, so yesterday evening, my youngest daughter and I had some pizza, and were looking for something to watch on television. I couldn't find anything, so I looked to purchase a movie from one of the digital movie streaming websites. I looked on on THIS movie database (because I used to trust it), and with a score of 8.6 and so many initial 10/10 reviews, I went against my better judgement and purchased the digital copy of Avengers: Infinity War for £13.99. That's the last time I trust THIS movie database!

I felt hoodwinked, and most definitely conned. This morning I had another look at the reviews, and observed that after the initial 10/10s, the rest of the reviews were 1/10. In retrospect, whilst this website perpetuates itself as having integrity in its reviews/ratings, it is my opinion that it is little more than a mechanism for generating sales for movies that under normal word-of-mouth conditions would tank. I feel so angry with myself.

The movie itself is a mish-mash of many different themes, and tries way too hard to be serious. I don't watch these movies for that - if I want serious, I'll watch Heat, Goodfellas or any other number of good thrillers. Why oh why would Marvel screw with the feel good formula of 'Guardians of the Galaxy'?

To sum up, it is my opinion that Avengers: Infinity War should have failed, but didn't - largely due to the manipulation of reviews and information. And I doubt very much if this interference of information was made for free!

If you believe the Avengers are a real, you might actually like this movie - everyone else will likely feel a little low. And to be honest, who needs that in this day and age? If you want to watch some misery, save your money and watch the news instead!","7"

"littleging12","Avengers: Vanishers","9 June 2018","""Avengers: Infinity War"" does what no movie has done before: incorporate 40+ superhero characters into one epic showdown against a god-like villain. This idea may have seemed too daunting 10 years ago, but with the talent present and the previous success of the MCU to at least make a decent movie, ""Avengers: Infinity War"" delivers, and stands as one of the best MCU movies to date.

The Russo Brothers prove to be the best directing force the MCU has to offer. They made Captain America good with ""Captain America: The Winter Soldier"" and brought the franchise to its high point with ""Captain America: Civil War."" They don't disappoint here and do a great job of integrating all three phases of the MCU. They deftly balance screen time allowing a lot of the characters time to shine. Though they definitely could've trimmed time with the more boring characters like Vision, Scarlett Witch, Gamora and Nebula. The Russo Brothers forte is with the character interplay. The superhero interactions are the highlight of the movie as their banter is very comical, eliciting nerdgasms galore. The Guardians are the funniest and arguable the best characters in the MCU. The cartoonish action takes a back seat to the abundant humor and witty interplay. The action scenes are mostly enjoyable and inventive especially with Doctor Strange's wizard portals. It's very exciting to see the Avengers use pop-culture references to solve their problems (i.e. Aliens). The problem is that there is still some cheesiness with the action (characters having small talk during huge fights, characters smashing into each other mindlessly). The aesthetic of the characters' costumes and the CGI battle scenes give off a cartoonish vibe. One would have to let their inner nerd carry them away for maximum enjoyment of the action.

*Spoilers* ""Avengers: Infinity War"" finally introduces the storyline of Thanos as a power player. Thanos isn't your typical I-want-to-rule-the-world bad guy. He presents himself as a reluctant father-figure willing to make the tough choice: to kill half of existence so the other half can live with their dwindling resources. Thanos does not see himself as a bad guy but as a liberator willing to make sacrifices for the greater good. Of course the Avengers don't see it that way. What results from the Avengers' and Thanos' showdown is something Marvel has not done before, nor anyone would think they had the balls to do.

Many of the common complaints regarding MCU is that the heroes are impenetrable and no matter how cool they make the action sequences look, there is still that lingering stigma that no one will die. This leaves the action to be without real stakes or compelling drama. But ""Infinity War"" changes it up here and has Thanos succeed in killing half the Avengers team off (a microcosm for humanity). This resulted in a shocking and totally unexpected move. But.... one problem. Some of the character deaths are probably gonna be permanent like Loki and Vision but people who died from vanishing are likely to come back in the next film after the Avengers figure out how to undo everything Thanos did. Even if certain characters stay dead, it's not like a whole lot of them will be missed (only Drax and the Guardians would be missed if they died). MCU has more films planned like another Spider-Man, Guardians of the Galaxy, and Doctor Strange sequels (all of said characters died in ""Infinity War""). This all means MCU doesn't have the balls to kill off characters that will churn out more money. They may have fooled us for a little while but we know their tricks. Hopefully they prove me wrong in Part II.

""Avengers: Infinity War"" is the best Avengers movie and one of the best MCU movies to date. It's thoroughly watchable, funny, entertaining, and even has a few tricks up its sleeve. It's a movie too big to miss. To have this many iconic superheroes, big time stars, and outlandish cast of characters in one movie is a cinematic experience you cannot miss. Be sure to keep your expectations in check because this movie is still a Marvel movie at the end of the day. It is not as good as the IMDb rating of 8.7, which makes it a top 20 movie of all time. No way!","10"

"Movie-ManDan","One of the Best Superhero Films EVER!","17 February 2019","The Marvel Cinematic Universe has been going strong for a full decade now. The superhero film genre has never been bigger as it is right now. Sure superhero films have existed for decades (even way back in the 1960s with Batman), but only one would come out once every few years. In the first half of 2018 alone, we have had Black Panther, Deadpool 2, and Avengers: Infinity War. With all of these films from this specific genre, fatigue has started to set in.

Superhero films follow this archetype: average person falls victim to a mystical force that gives them superpowers; hubris of someone they know causes them to get similar powers of their own so they become a villain that the good guy could easily beat; forced deadpan jokes and an extensive use of CGI plague the rest of the film for well over two hours. Ensemble superhero films (i.e. The Avengers) follow this formula: a mega-villain tries to destroy the world so the assembled good guys team up and fight back with a tremendous amount of CGI and forced humour. Seeing these traits again and again will sooner than later leave audiences wanting a refreshing change. Predictability is all-too present now. Luckily, the third instalment of The Avengers breaks this monotonous motion. It seemed as though it wanted to start a new trend in the superhero genre. The tenth anniversary of the cinematic universe seems like the perfect time to do so.

Right away, the film opens up with the villain--Thanos (played exceptionally by Josh Brolin)--laying a beating on Thor, Hulk and Loki after getting an Infinity Gem and ready to get more. This opening has some heroes in trouble and the villain easily getting the upper hand on them. While most of the MCU villains has attitude and are cool to see, not many of them pose a real threat toward the villain. We know that the good guys need to remember something crucial or use a little extra force to destroy the villain. Judging from how easy Thanos had his romp, one question will cloud the minds of those that watch the film: ""how are the Avengers able to defeat that thing?"" This baffling question remains throughout the film. The wonderment will keep the viewer entranced.

New Marvel superheroes joining the Avengers are Dr. Strange (Benedict Cumberbatch) and Spiderman (now portrayed by Tom Holland), as well as the Guardians of the Galaxy. The combination both teams works quite well. The teamwork and friction between the factions increase doubt to how Thanos will be overtaken. But at the same time, the writing between the teams is so well done, we want to see them working together and their journeys to victory. The minor flaw in this would be that there are too many characters and too many backstories to follow. So this may require multiple viewings. Anything wrong with that? Not at all.

Avenger: Infinity War also takes itself more seriously which is something I am personally very happy for. The jokes and punchlines are forced way too much and the deadpan nature makes it worse. That is almost completely gone here. Then there is how deep all the characters are. All of them face doubt, but they know they must save the day. And Thanos actually has justifiable motives. While we want the good guys to win, we hope nothing too bad will happen to Thanos. When was this last time a villain in a superhero movie was developed this well?

As usual, the action and special effects are amazing. But since the amount of humanity is at an unusual high this time around, the violent scenes seem more intense because there is so much stuff on the line.

This darker sequel to the 2012 blockbuster is a true sight to behold. The darkness is a nice change of pace that is needed to spice things up. And the use of depth and humanity are two things every great movie in history needs. Infinity War certainly has them. Everything in this are just in calling Infinity War a masterpiece as well as one of the best superhero films ever.

"justin-fencsak","Best movie of the summer so far...","23 May 2018","Despite some slow pacing and a confusing storyline, Avengers Infinity War is the culmination of years of MCU movies and their interlocking storylines, resulting in a movie that features the main villian Thanos killing half of the MCU heroes that have driven the franchise to record heights. Among them, Black Panther, Spiderman, Gamora, and in a post credits sequence, Nick Fury and Maria Hill, calling for Captain Marvel, who will make her screen debut next year in an origin story before she joins the team in Avengers 4, also slated for next year. The way the film was shot made the characters a bit bigger, and the music and sound is amazing. You will cry when the movie is over, so bring some tissues. It is the darkest of the MCU movies, even darker than Thor the Dark World and Captain America Civil War combined. Update: The home media release lacks the imax ratio seen in theatres and is the more common scope version. I Hope disney replaces the digital release with the imax release just in time for endgame although it's more of an imax issue than disney. BTW, if you have netflix, then this movie is one of two marvel movies that will be the last ever to stream there, as disney+ will have captain marvel as the first marvel movie to stream there.","9"

"Horror_Flick_Fanatic","Must watch for MCU fans. One sitting isn't enough to see everything.","1 May 2018","I can best describe this film as the ""SW Empire Strikes Back"" of the Marvel Comic Universe. Tons and tons of battle scenes on multiple fronts. Large military clashes on Wakanda, the city of the Black Panther. Other cities on earth are not spared either as the fights happens all over the globe and beyond. Yep, we get Superhero and Supervillian fist fights, sword fights and special powers fights on other worlds across the universe simultaneously. Even epic space battles. So much goes on the screen at once, you really must watch this film more than once to absorb it all. I cannot see the audience, especially those who are not well versed in the MCU narratives to pick up everything in just one sitting. For die heart comic book fan this movie is a must see.

The downside to it, in my opinion, the jokes weren't as funny as those in Thor Ragnarok or Deadpool . But this film as so much going for it, I did not mind that much.

The movie ends in a disastrous cliffhanger which will have audiences biting their nails for the next installment to this MCU franchise. If you go out to see it, stick around for the end credits because another scene for those patient enough to stay in their seats will be rewarded.","1"

"soulpianist","Can't watch again!","3 May 2019","Despite the grandeur and stunning effects and production of this movie, I am sad to report that I can't bear to watch this movie again, unlike the other movies in the MCU which I enjoy watching again and again. Simply because the direction of the franchise was to make the Avengers lose at this point.

I just can't shake the feeling of frustration in the way they made Thanos and his henchmen so powerful and nearly invincible, and the Avengers (namely Scarlet Witch, Dr Strange, Vision) helpless against them. Of course, the producers, director and writers had to do this because that's the direction they wanted it to go - and I just can't stand to see it again.

I can't stop myself from thinking of all those other possible ways of how each Avenger could have easily defeated the villains in the different scenes. But, of course, if the writers or producers allowed that, then the Avengers would have easily won the infinity war and Thanos wouldn't look so formidable and inevitable. But that is the direction they chose for the franchise - to make Thanos inevitable. When, in fact, there are so many ways Thanos did NOT have to be inevitable.

So this is where this movie just loses me as a fan. Watching it once was enough. The plot was to make the Avengers lose and weaker. It's pretty much how I feel when I first saw the first X-Men movie - they made the heroes so weak and helpless against the villains. Plot manipulated and utterly frustrating! Sorry!

Nevertheless, it is still a truly stunning production!","9"

The way the characters we know and love we re-introduced was brilliantly done and just thrilling to see on the big screen.

It was hard to mourn these characters when it was clearly obvious they'd be coming back somehow because of all the future film announcements. You can't have Guardians of the Galaxy 3 with just Rocket.

Other than that. Go see this in theatres if you get a chance to. The film is action packed and hilarious because of the connection between the characters. This really is what DC is missing out on in their films.","5"
"shakercoola","A visual sensation with action occasionally lacking pulse","5 August 2018","An American action thriller; The Avengers assemble for a third time and the result is an astonishing and sensate extravaganza, ambitious in scale, imaginative in backdrops and attractive settings thanks to some wonderful CGI rendering. The movie's biggest accolade should be reserved for the writers who had to satisfy avid followers of the film series by featuring and distilling so many outlandish characters from previous sagas and still make it entertaining. The result was a success - the heroes' egos jam up alongside each other beautifully. Robert Downey Jr is on top form once more, and the Guardians of the Galaxy troop provide welcome comedic relief. Also, Thanos, is the most meaningful and personal antagonist of the series. All in all it is an exciting epic, but with the dizzying array of heroes came a steady succession of overlong fighting sequences which occasionally lack a pulse and will become desensitising for some viewers who will say there's only so many times you can watch someone being kicked and punched through a wall.","8"
"sme_no_densetsu","The Beginning of the End(game)","6 August 2019","Unless you've been living under a rock for the past decade or so you might have heard of a little production company by the name of Marvel Studios. Creating motion picture adaptations of Marvel Comics properties, they've had a surprisingly consistent track record for delivering satisfying big budget superhero entertainment. The fact that they also managed to tie everything together into a cohesive shared universe is something that frankly hadn't been seen to that extent in movies before. All of the care that went into these productions culminated in 2018's ""Avengers: Infinity War"" and its direct sequel, 2019's ""Avengers: Endgame"". Together they proved to be a fitting capper to Marvel's journey that began with ""Iron Man"" in 2008.

First of all, it's important to recognize that this movie is part one of a two part story. I didn't realize this when I originally watched the movie, so I was somewhat disappointed that the story wasn't brought to a resolution. Later on, when rewatching the movie ahead of the concluding chapter, I got a better appreciation of what the movie was meant to be.

As had been hinted at for years, ""Infinity War"" finally marked the entrance of Thanos into the Marvel universe as a major villain. He seeks to acquire the six Infinity Stones, which will make him powerful enough to restore balance to the universe... by laying half of it to waste. Naturally, our heroes the Avengers aren't about to just let that happen. However, Thanos's power increases with the acquisition of each new stone, so stopping him becomes a race against time.

For a movie that's the culmination of 19 previous films, a memorable villain was a must. Luckily, Josh Brolin's portrayal of Thanos is one of the most memorable in the Marvel canon. No doubt much of the credit goes to the original creator of the character (Jim Starlin) but the fact is that Thanos gives the impression that he's someone who could give the Avengers a run for their money. In fact, he's such a formidable foe that the threat of defeat is more palpable than in any previous Marvel movie. That his motivations are also interesting from a philosophical point of view is another point in the movie's favour.

Having a compelling villain is of course a crucial element in any superhero movie but in this case the sheer scale of the undertaking is impressive in and of itself. Featuring a star-studded cast of Marvel veterans in the various heroic roles, it's amazing that the producers managed to keep the shared universe alive this long just to be able to put this movie together in the first place. That they managed to keep the movie from collapsing under the weight of its stars is another testament to their commitment to quality. Despite a fairly hefty two and a half hour runtime, the movie is nicely paced and gives a reasonable amount of screentime to all involved. My only real complaint is that the final act's impact is somewhat muted by the utter improbability that certain characters will be gone for good since they already had sequels in the pipeline. Surely they could have stuck to characters whose fate was less certain?

""Infinity War"" may not be the type of movie I'd watch for awards-worthy work on either side of the camera but as a feat of production I think that it and its (superior) sequel are nearly unparalleled. It makes me wonder if ""Endgame"" might be shown some love at the next Oscars ceremony. I mean, ""Black Panther"" was nominated for Best PIcture and that was arguably more about cultural impact than the actual merits of the production (though I wouldn't have argued if Michael B. Jordan was nominated). In any case, Marvel fans don't need any convincing to watch this movie. For others, this probably isn't the best starting point.","8"

"SockBox_Studios","One of Marvels Worst","21 December 2018","I don't understand how this movie got so much hype, it's completely ridiculous. The time Thanos took to gather all the infinity stones (six years) he could've went to the planets and killed half of the people. He didn't even complete his mission which was to and I quote ""destroy half of ALL lif in the universe"" which was later change to creatures because they noticed he didn't do that. Their were a bunch of unnecessary scenes and scenes that didn't even make sense. This movie was all over the place and was very hard to follow. Spoiler right here---> A example of this was when he through Gamora off the cliff he shed one tear and was like whatever I now have the last soul stone, and Gamora was the only person Thanos loved and he didn't seem like he cared. The other complete ridiculous thing about this movie is the spiderman bus scene in Homecoming it didn't show he had spidey sense, and finally it was aid in the movie the stones were scatter across the universe that should've taken Thanos longer to find them. My final review 2/10 would not recommend this movie to any superhero fan. The whole movie was just a way for marvel to get money. If you want to see this method done right go to Justice League or Legends of Tomorrow.","8"

Continuing the blockbuster series: a massive gang of comic book super-heroes attempt to stop the evil Thanos (Josh Brolin) from obtaining all six of the all-powerful Infinity Stones which would give him ultimate power to dominate the entire universe.

Like many big-budget blockbusters (BBBs), this one falls into the usual trap of too much happening and too many people to try to remember. Adding to this problem are too many corny jokes and some really bad attempts at humour. Also like other BBBs, ""Infinity War"" has superb special effects, action scenes, and other aspects of technical superiority. The pluses mostly outweigh the minuses though not always.

Still, there are moving scenes in the second half that raise the film to a higher level. Credit must be given for a very bold ending which is a welcome contradiction to traditional narratives.

So, despite some obvious flaws, ""Infinity War"" is still entertaining.","10"

"Benjamin-M-Weilert","An ambitious project that deftly delivers on its many promises.","8 March 2019","It's difficult to codify something like Avengers: Infinity War (2018) without including everything that led up to it. In reality, it's probably more along the lines of the 19th episode of a television series that's taken ten years to realize fully. Because of the interconnected nature of these previous movies, it's difficult to view it alone without the backstory tied to it. However, there are enough brief moments of exposition to help most people fill in the gaps as to what is happening. Still, as is the case with many finales for television shows, the epic nature of Infinity War is at a level all its own.

The scale of such an endeavor is daunting, but with as little backstory as possible holding it back, Infinity War moves at a pretty good pace, jumping between a couple of groups of Avengers. Of course, we can't just directly jump to fighting the main villain, so the ""lesser"" bad guys stand in the way for a moment, but mostly fill time until the penultimate battles. At least during this waiting period, we get to learn the motivations of the heretofore mostly mysterious Thanos (Josh Brolin), which ends up humanizing this terrifying villain who thinks he's doing the right thing.

While the action is probably a little too shaky at times, the team-ups are what sell this movie. No longer are there coy little cameos and winking nods to references from other Marvel films (although, there is a somewhat shocking cameo about half-way through), but instead full-blown connections that expertly ties up the disparate parts of the 18 previous films. With an ending as shocking as this one, I'm a little curious where Marvel goes from here, but I have my hunches about what the future will bring.

An ambitious project that deftly delivers on its many promises, I give Avengers: Infinity War 4.5 stars out of 5.","7"

My movie journey started 3 months ago and this will be my 100th unique review. Not a bad movie to pick. Also, I recently purchased a Vizio Soundbar and Surround Sound Speaker System, so I wanted to test out the audio quality of my new setup. It did not disappoint. I felt like I was in a Dolby theater while laying in my own bed.

Man is this movie elite. Prior to this, Marvel had done an insane amount of groundwork to make this film have so much meaning and connectivity to previous projects such as Guardians of the Galaxy, the Winter Soldier, and Black Panther. But, despite this being a Super Hero movie, Marvel made a bold choice in making it so that the villain came out victorious, obviously setting up Avengers: Endgame. The humor was top tier, the action sequences were spectacular, and the sheer amount of important characters in one movie was something that only Marvel could pull off. I've seen this movie a bunch of times so I really didn't pick up much new, but I had an absolute blast experiencing this with my new Sound System.","8"
"PCC0921","Chris Evans was born on June 13th, 1981","21 May 2022","The namesake movie of the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU), arrived in 2018. Being the 19th entry in the Infinity War saga of the MCU, It is mostly a transitional film, which helps set-up the events that happen in Antman and the Wasp (2018), Captain Marvel (2019) and Avengers: Endgame (2019). It is a pivotal film for the MCU, because the Infinity War had to happen, in order to get to the Endgame. Coming off the success of their first MCU attempts, Captain America: The Winter Soldier (2014) and Captain America: Civil War (2016), the Russo brothers direct this film like it was ancient mythology. By utilizing the great stories from the comic books, they are able to give the audience a spectacular representation of an epic comic book adventure. They give to the characters in the film a super positive vibe, that tells the audience these are heroes. They are heroes to remember. Yes, it's still a fantasy, science fiction, comic book story but the Russo's give these Marvel characters the meat needed to bring them as close to reality as today's current cinema can.

The current roster of the Avengers has broken up. After the events of Civil War broke up Tony Stark (Robert Downey JR.) and Steve Rogers (Chris Evans), the team is splintered in half. Falcon (Anthony Mackie) and Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson) are off grid and Wanda Maximoff (Elizabeth Olsen) and Vision (Paul Bettany), have run off to work on their romance. If you saw the events in Thor: Ragnarok (2017), Thor (Chris Hemsworth) and Banner (Mark Ruffalo), are together on an Asgard space ark. The main evil bad guy, who has been part of the backstory of the whole Infinity Saga, Thanos (Josh Brolin), is searching for the six Infinity stones and has caught up with the Asgardians, knowing that Thor's brother Loki (Tom Hiddleston), has one of them.

What makes this film so huge is the fact that, the Russo's had to jack up the energy they started in the Marvel ensemble film Captain America: Civil War (2016), with an even bigger ensemble cast of superheroes for this film. Everyone knew it was coming, from all the hype that was generated for the film initially. It would combine the Avengers with the Guardians of the Galaxy, along with Doctor Strange (Benedict Cumberbatch) and Spider-Man (Tom Holland). Throw in all of their super-friends, that came from all of their respective movies and you have an event of epic, block-buster entertainment. Thanos is coming and he can't be stopped. It's up to the Earth's mightiest heroes to stop him. Witness this universe shattering display of MCU might. It is not a disappointment and audiences from all varieties can enjoy this film.

"athirn","Sorry, but what's to like so much?","24 August 2018","Just like with Star Wars Episode VIII the latest Avengers are all about meaningless fussing around. A lot of familiar characters, a lot of action, a ton of CGI, a bunch of drama and tragedy... But nobody had any specific plan, they just tried to stop Thanos, period. Planning is not for superheroes, come on, right? And instead of analysing forces posture and making at least an imitation of plan, they acted impulsively like a dispersed group of amateurs or even kids. Above all that they didn't even have a clue about what was gonna happen very soon.

The only meaningful move was Dr. Strange's decision to back off and let Thanos to win the battle - and that wasn't a result of long thinking through! Doctor just sat on his ass, spent a couple of seconds just to count possible outcomes and saying nothing waited until the very end. Coooooool!!! It's like they never heard of Thanos before and had no idea who he is and what he's capable of.

Again and again, I catch myself thinking that Disney doesn't count on adults - they make movies for youngsters who aren't supposed to think on what they see. The more special effects, running, riding, fighting, shooting and meaningless death of favorite characters (hoping that they're gonna revive in the next movie, of course), the better box office results are.

I'm disappointed with this comic circus. The first Avengers were almost a masterpiece (my respect to Joss Whedon). But this one is a total mess.","9"

There is a bit of drama with relationship or relationship problems (as in any movie you've ever seen). I rescue a couple of interesting sequences that make this waste of money worth a six. If it were for the lack of creativity, artistic laziness and lack of interest generated, I would give it a three.","7"
"neener3707","MUCH Better Than The Usually Average MCU Schlock","27 April 2018","I was afraid at first, the MCU movies are often not as great as they were in past times, but boy was I satisfied. I found little of the things I dislike in super hero movies, instead I found (finally) interesting dialog and action sequences more unique than others. This was not your typical boring ""city destroyed by someone"", it was more unique and differently choreographed and I definitely enjoy the action sequences. Don't get me wrong, I personally disliked some things, but over all I was pleasantly surprised by a fun movie going experience instead of another predictable super hero movies. I am normally disappointing by super hero movies, but this one held me more than most, and its definitely well above average as far as MCU is concerned. The humor was also really ood and not corny like previous MCU movies, but I'll explain why later.

So I said what I liked and I will say more, but lets talk about what I didn't like. First of all, I wasn't a fan of Captain America's beard, especially since he's my favorite, but thats my personal opinion. Without giving to much away, I didn't like the alterations to Spiderman's suit. Also I didn't like how they re-wrote The Hulk's condition. In canon, it happens when he gets angry, but now suddenly The Hulk side decides whether or not he shows up, as if choosing what type of angry will trigger him. I LOVED the additions of the Guardians of the Galaxy to the Avengers movies, the truly brought their specific type of humor to the film and I thoroughly enjoyed it, they fit in so perfectly and added a new style to the series. All in all it was much better than the average MCU film, and I would recommend it to people who now dislike super hero movies.","9"

"MuviFan73","Well justified with unpredictable plot, keeping you on your toes!","28 April 2018","Lately I have lost my interest in superhero stuff. It is so much that I would not spend my well earned bucks on them. However this experience was different. I went to see the movie with the number of positive reviews coming up. I however dint saw any trailers but came to knew few spoilers. I am happy that still it went positively for me.

Tone, Script & Story: The story runs around Thanos who maintains balance of universe and kills in the process - going against Avengers (superheroes of Marvel universe). It was nice to see story constructed around Doctor Strange with his powers and now further development. It would be nice to see what magical world of Dr. Strange will mean to Tony(the man with knowledge) in coming sequel . I was however disappointed in construction of story around Bruce, he is no more winning and now he even can't get his other side out which is totally opposite to what we saw in last movie. To add further, the humor that goes on during various scenes in all such movies is a treat in itself. The end that we see in this movie, I don't know if it make sense to comic readers. For me it is a brain work that I think will get enlightened in the sequel.

Direction, Screenplay, Cinematography: Special effects come with a disadvantage in cinematography. For me contrast was not up to the mark. The constructed characters and scenes were however best in that genre.

Final Verdict: Well justified with unpredictable plot, keeping you on your toes. Worth your penny.","10"

The villian is cool, but too shallow. No character conflicts, no real depth there. The story sorta suggests that he kinda intends it for the good of the overall. Yet all he seems to do is to intend to kill half of the population even when he has all them stones and does not spend a second to wonder if their power could be used for some contructive purposes that does not involve random killings. Even the villians in mission impossible movies have much more depth.

On the plus side... Thor had pretty funny dialogues and otherwise I would have given a lower score..Clearly, excellent CGI.

I still can't gasp what I just saw...it was effectively moving & superbly action-packed that comes with a jaw dropping ending which may going to disappoint some moviegoers but I'm sure it'd really make sense to the true comicbook fans. Kudos to the MCU team for making it so bold & masterfully crafted. Some may find lack of concentration or character development for some of their favorite characters but as a whole it didn't bother me much, cause you can't expect each & every character of MCU to shine in their own way of glory in one single movie. Moreover, there's the sequel coming next year and that's where many possibilities lies, even changing the course of its reality! Btw, THANOS RULES!!! Awesome character building & surely going to be one of the best superhero movie villains of all time.","1"
"hanalisss","Another win for the saga","19 November 2023","Avengers: Infinity War is a monumental cinematic achievement that defies expectations and sets a new standard for superhero storytelling. Directed by the Russo brothers, this Marvel masterpiece is a grand, intergalactic opera that seamlessly weaves together a vast ensemble of characters and narratives into a tapestry of epic proportions.

At its core, the film is a testament to the meticulous world-building and character development that the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) has undergone over the years. The Russo brothers skillfully navigate the intricate web of storylines, giving each hero their moment while maintaining a cohesive and engaging narrative. The result is a symphony of action, emotion, and stakes that have never been higher.

The villain, Thanos, portrayed with gravitas by Josh Brolin, stands out as one of the most compelling antagonists in cinematic history. His quest to obtain the all-powerful Infinity Stones is not just a plot device but a character-driven journey that adds depth to the overarching narrative. Thanos is more than a conventional villain; he's a force of nature, a tragic figure with a twisted sense of purpose that challenges the very essence of heroism.

The film's visual spectacle is awe-inspiring. From the bustling streets of Wakanda to the distant reaches of outer space, the cinematography by Trent Opaloch captures the grandiosity and scale of the Marvel universe. The action sequences are breathtaking, with each hero bringing their unique powers to the forefront in a dazzling display of choreography and special effects.

Infinity War is not just about spectacle; it's about emotional resonance. The film doesn't shy away from exploring themes of sacrifice, loss, and the weight of responsibility. It's a rollercoaster of emotions, defying the notion that superhero films are devoid of genuine human drama.

Alan Silvestri's score enhances the emotional beats of the film, punctuating key moments with a musicality that elevates the storytelling. The soundtrack becomes a character in itself, guiding the audience through the highs and lows of the narrative.

The film's ending is a bold narrative choice that subverts traditional expectations. It leaves audiences in shock, eagerly anticipating the next installment while pondering the consequences of the Avengers' greatest challenge. Infinity War is not just a film; it's an event that has left an indelible mark on popular culture, setting the stage for a cinematic experience that transcends the boundaries of the superhero genre.

In summary, this is a cinematic triumph that seamlessly blends action, emotion, and character development on an unprecedented scale. It's a testament to the storytelling prowess of the MCU and a thrilling ride that leaves audiences on the edge of their seats, eagerly anticipating the epic conclusion in Avengers: Endgame.","9"

I can sum up this movie in a few lines:

2)CGI mess

3)No twist, nothing special. Very linear.

4)Every one of your heros just suck not using their main strengths

5)Make every hero stupid and fail.

6)Over dramatized for not caring about the heros because they are that dumb.

Pretty much just hand over the stones and die. Thanks for the multi billion dollars for this poor developed story and movie.

Anyone that tells you, ""it's good"" is for sure lying and just hyping it just what the business wants. Seriously, not good. I've seen all the Marvel movies and this one is just action follow by drama garbage. Can you guys just make another 'Winter solider' movie?

I gave it a one because I just felt like I saw nothingness and stupidity at it's finest.

"one9eighty","Fast-paced, action-packed, cliff-hanging.... the epic comic film of 2018","2 July 2018","Well, well, well... there's no messing around in the eagerly anticipated Avengers 4 movie is there. Straight into the action, picking up where we left off in other Marvel films including ""Thor (3) - Ragnorak"", ""Black Panther"" (Cpt America Civil War"" and even ""Guardians of the Galaxy 2"". The Mad Titan, Thanos (Josh Brolin), and his minions are hunting down infinity stones - mystic gems which were formed at the beginning of the universe and which, when combined give their owner God-like powers. Thanos wants to reshape the universe. The only obstacles to him getting the stones and the power are Earth mightiest heroes, The Avengers (and friends).

PRO With 31 Marvel movie's before this - Infinity War turned out to be an epic come together of (nearly) all the established Marvel characters. This throws up some interesting cross-over combinations and situations and with it some fun humour.

PRO Sorry, this is a spoiler - but as I've left writing this review until the film was out of cinemas I'm sure you have heard far worse by now... it's nice to see the bad guys triumph. It gave me the same goose bumps that ""Star Wars: Empire strikes back"" did when I first saw that, many, many years ago. You can't get bored - it's too quick and jam-packed to get bored. In this approach it was very comic book paced, it flitted from one scenario to another and then back again. Every frame is packed with something - from the opening to the close there is something to see or learn. By the same token this was also a negative. I'm not sure that the constant hopping around worked as well as it could have done in cinematic format, but I don't want to mark the film down on this because it was actually a bit unique in the way it handled this -with so many characters it was bound to do this to get everybody in but I have to ask, did it develop as much as it could do before moving on?. If the follow up film delivers on the situations which have been set up, then it may yet turn out to be a massive triumph.

CON It wasn't like the comic version of Infinity Wars - motivations are different, and characters involved are different. Despite this I have to be realistic with myself - Lady Death would probably be hard to create without looking too CGI'd, as would the cosmic entity's that battle Thanos - they would probably look stupid floating through space.

CON Occasionally felt a bit CGI - not on the level of DC films such as ""Justice League"", but for Marvel this felt a little less than excellent which they've predominantly done so well.

After reading a lot of other reviews people seem to be reacting negatively to the characters that die only to potentially be coming back - I didn't get this point of view I'm afraid. Doesn't that happen regularly in comic books? Don't characters face their doom countless times only to be resurrected? How many times has Captain America died in comic books for god sake?! How many times have Wolverine or Deadpool suffered wounds that would destroy them regardless of their healing powers? How many times has Tony Stark been captured and assumed dead, only for the shareholders trying to take over his business been disappointed that he was alive and well. It happens all the time. The way I see it is this, there's the Marvel multiverse - what happens in films isn't the same universe as the comics or the films aren't accurate in their portrayal. When somebody dies but the next episode or film they are back and there's no real explanation - it's probably just another reality or universe where everything is OK or never actually happened. If it isn't the case then all the normal humans populating earth are dumb as fudge ants that deserve to be stamped on by a might God-like entity. Anyway - I digress! Sorry.

The film was epic, fast paced, good fun and action packed. I would definitely watch it again, and probably will before I go the next installment at the cinema. I enjoyed this and haven't met anyone that didn't take some enjoyment out of it. The only people that seemingly didn't enjoy it are the keyboard warriors who like to give 0's and 1 star reviews on here rather than look for something positive.

I'm giving this 8 out of 10 - but I'm hanging on to a spare star till after the follow up. I solemnly promise that if all arcs are resolved and everything is placated then I will return and award that additional star, if this review says anything other than 8 - then I either haven't seen the next film yet, it's not been released yet, or it stunk!

EDIT: I came back to upgrade this to a 9/10. Well done.","8"
"Scarefish","Marvel doesn't fail to deliver","2 May 2018","Of all Marvel films, this is the one where I really expected them to drop the ball. There seems to simply be too many main characters in the universe to make a coherent and satisfying film out of, however I would say they accomplished it.

Not a moment is wasted, but the film doesn't feel like it's rushing all the same. It feels like just enough time is given for each scene to develop each character, and though more could have been done and perhaps 3 hours or more would be more appropriate, it's a very clean and satisfying film that defies expectations. Perhaps the second part will fill out what remains to be explored, and that would bring it to a more reasonable 5 hours, and this film was more just half a story anyways.

This is one of the most dramatic Marvel films to date with the typical humor toned down a bit as to not interfere with the darker aspects, which surely sets it above Doctor Strange in terms of consistency, though the Guardians of the Galaxy are as goofy as ever, which is also neat since all the characters still feel as they did in previous films, which could have easily been muddled with how many directors have brought this universe to this point.

Thanos is probably my favorite MCU villain to date, as he has strong, logical motivations, which is admittedly uncommon among most superhero villains. Though he is definitively a villain, one can see things from his perspective, and can sympathize with him. He may be a bad guy, but his ideologies are not contrived but rather fleshed out in a believable way and shown clearly. It's quite interesting to me how Marvel has now seemed to shift to having the superior villains as opposed to DC.

One of the worst things about this film is actually the trailer, which spoils the climax of the film. This isn't the first time either. Civil War's trailer spoiled two critical plot points in the film, which can be a huge problem when it takes all of the tension out of a scene since you've seen the outcome before the movie even started.

I'd strongly recommend this film, though I'd highly recommend watching as many of the previous films as possible to make this film a bit more consumable. It is a bit dizzying, but that's surely not a deal-breaker given that it's so competently executed.","7"

"aenaristevin","2.5 hours of film with no content and no ending, amazing!","25 August 2018","Hollywood achieved a new high in quantity over quality: even more actors, even longer duration, even more special effects, even more chaos (incl. chaos on the script itself, in the sense of entropy vs order), and in the end it felt like a TV episode that suddenly ended just before you see what you were waiting for in the whole duration, to be continued next week, except that in this case it won't. Like 2.5 hours weren't enough to include an ending, so you have to wait for the movie industry's next release, obviously next year (as usual) to see what you were supposed to see on this movie.

Watch the movie if you want to watch for 2.5 hours a completely uninspired, unintelligent and boring plot, been written by a group of writers who obviously were bored themselves in their personal lives, with all usual cliche and banal lines, a film that has nothing to say, and doesn't worth a dime either as fantasy, as science fiction as drama, or comedy. If you add them all, the sum is zero.

Of course, you get a parade of popular actors that participate and serve that worth-less movie, and a series of computer effects. But a film is much more than actors and effects, it is supposed to have essence, inspired messages and stories that worth the time you spend watching, otherwise it's just an effects demo. You can watch many special effects demos on YouTube, on the cinema you are supposed to see a movie, not a demo. So if you want to go to the cinema, or rent a movie, better look for a real movie, one that honors the art of cinematography and you'll come out smarter, not dumber.","10"

Infinity War is 1 of my favorite movies. I love the 1st Avengers & I really love AoU for some reason but as much as I love this franchise (3rd favorite franchise behind LotR & Star Wars) this was a massive letdown. There's no intuitive story like the 1st 2. There's way too many jokes but Infinity War is hilarious it's just full of jokes that totally whiff like Starlord asking if his grenades are gonna blow off his crotch and Thor calling Rocket a rabbit not once, twice, but three times. Why is Thor such a dick? Why is Gamora such an idiot she runs right out into Thanos' trap and goes straight into his grasps so he can use her to sacrifice her to get the soul stone? Why is Starlord such an assface he punches Thanos right in the face just when their about to get the gauntlet off? Why is Hulk Bruce Banner???????? Why is Iron Man so strung out? Why is Spiderman such a doucheregal? Why is Dr. Strange so cynical? Why isn't Captain America and Black Panther and Black Widow in it more? Why are ALL the side villains computerized a couple of them should of been real persons?? Why are War Machine, Nebula, Falcon, Okoye, Wong, Winter Soldier and Shuri so badass in this movie 'cuz they are? Why aren't Groot and Rocket doing much together? Why is Loki in it? Why are Vision and Scarlet Witch the only Avengers that are acting in a manner that make sense????? Why is Thanos so big and in it soooo much???

I love when Drax is acting like he's invisible and Mantis is like ""Hi, Drax."" hahaha this movie really is hilarious Drax and Mantis are the best there's just way too many jokes and the action is beast but it's not very plot driven like the first movies were and THE AVENGERS NEVER REALLY ALL GET TOGETHER TO COME UP WITH A PLAN AGAINST THANOS. I don't like that. That's really stupid. As much as I love this movie it was a huge letdown, God nobody cares about Thanos he's evil as ish. Just stop him. I care about the Avengers. And DC.","9"
"noahlenzi","A Great Film Hiding in a Tonal Mess","3 May 2018","Just got out of Infinity War Part 1 (don't argue, it's true). As someone who doesn't like the MCU... It was ok. It's a movie where each 3rd progressively gets better. The first 3rd (besides the amazing opening) is the worst. It is an utter tonal mess. Anytime the film tried to do anything of meaning or impact they throw in a stupid joke right after it to break the tension. If the whole movie was this way that would be fine but even in the beginning some REALLY dark stuff happens. The second 3rd is a little better as the story picks up speed but if you asked me how the movie was halfway through I'd tell you it's terrible. The final act is where things finally get real and I'm not talking about action. Some really screwed up stuff happens and the tension actually rises. It honestly makes the earlier parts feel pathetic. This film is in dire need of a fan edit. Edit out the jokes and you'd actually have a good film. Some of the characters feel underutilized but that was bound to happen. It honestly doesn't matter though, Thanos is the main character and he is my favorite character from this franchise so far. He's intimidating yet emotional. He's the most morally complex character in the series and he won't be a let down for fans. Infinity War Part 1 is ultimately a hot mess and needs to be edited down to be more serious in the beginning. Luckily the final act grows a pair to save the movie. I'd give it a 7 but the score is too high so I made it a 6 for now.

P.S. If you thought Civil War would have any influence on this one's story guess again. Alter a few lines and it never even happened.","8"

"kuarinofu","Good action and visuals","19 May 2018","This is a well made Marvel superhero comic book movie.

You may stumble upon many reviews saying that this movie is Marvel's magnum opus, a comic book movie masterpiece that asks questions, brings up new and interesting ideas and stuff, but it's not.

It is written much better than most of Marvel's stuff, yet this type of movie has its limits, mostly because it is made to appeal to the widest possible audience. This means that some of the core elements have to be dumbed-down to be more understandable and simple. Thus all the drama parts are very simplistic in order to be easier to process by younger audiences. I hoped that this movie would have been a little heavier but it's not.

This fact also affects the dialogue, most of which is either a failed attempt at humor (yet the ""target"" audience, younger kids, seemed to be enjoying every joke in the theater), or an attempt to overexplain the simplistic plot, or some really weird pop culture reference younger audiences won't be able to understand anyway. Thus, most of the talking parts were a pain to sit through with rare exceptions. There was one good joke set up by War Machine in Wakanda though.

The action was great, even though at times it was hard to understand what was going on. From time to time the superheroes even use their abilities in a clever way. CGI was mostly good too and some of the environments they created were pleasing to the eye, especially the Vormir part, neat art direction. Kudos to all 3000 of CGI artists and studios that made this movie. One of the weakest technical parts was the soundtrack, the tracks were forgettable and not fitting at times.

Plotwise the movie was extremely predictable, furthermore, the events of the second part are also easy to predict. I don't want to spoil anything, but a change of heart is what we are going to see.

A well made movie that, while being probably the most emotion-packed of Marvel movies, is still unable to provide you with that feel or emotion when you leave the theater changed at heart.","4"
"sbweightman","An epic undertaking on a massive scale that definitely pays off","28 September 2018","An epic undertaking on a massive scale that definitely pays off - it successfully combines each of the characters (and their franchises) together well, weaving them into a new story which they can all (almost equally) partake in. Visually it is superb with excellent special effects and settings throughout, and there is the right amount of humour spread across the characters. The plot transitions from the different group of heroes well, and manages to balance the story with the action - the slower, emotional scenes often have the same impact as the large scale and explosive actions scenes. However, the same criticisms of the Marvel series of movies are still there - the heroes are thrown about seemingly to no consequence, the plot just trundles along at times with little respite, and some of the fight scenes are so quick so you can't see the action.","9"

"neobateman","A perfect Blockbuster.","28 April 2018","Avengers: Infinity War is not only the 3rd Avengers film or 19th installment in the Marvel Cinematic Universe but also marks the 10 year anniversary since the start of everything MCU with the first Iron Man film. A lot of expectations are put onto this film, this is the film that unites the Avengers with the Guardians of the Galaxy to take down the greatest threat yet, Thanos (Josh Brolin). I will not go too much in depth with the story, only referring to what we saw in the trailers. The cast in this film is absolutely ridiculous, Robert Downey jr, Chris Hemsworth, Mark Ruffalo, Chris Evans, Scarlett Johansson, Don Cheadle, Benedict Cumberbatch, Tom Holland, Chadwick Boseman, Zoe Saldana, Karen Gillan, Tom Hiddleston, Paul Bettany, Elizabeth Olsen, Anthony Mackie, Sebastian Stan, Idris Elba, Peter Dinklage, Dave Bautista, Vin Diesel, Bradley Cooper, Gwyneth Paltrow, Benicio Del Toro, Josh Brolin and Chris Pratt. With such a huge cast it will be naturally difficult for the writers and directors to successfully balance all of these characters, giving them enough to do. In most cases it works, in others however I felt that more development was required. A good choice by the filmmakers was the idea to split up these characters all over the universe. They were paired up in smaller groups, this gives the opportunity to bring in some of the classic dynamics that we have come to love and also set up some new conflicts. However what was done with one relatively small group in the first Avengers is done here with multiple groups. This causes some characters to lose their strength in development that made them so interesting in their previous films. This is why I recommend to have seen some of the Marvel films beforehand, otherwise this film won't emotionally move you as you aren't familiar with most of the storylines and characters. One of my biggest worries about Infinity War was Thanos, most other villains in the MCU were boring uninteresting entities that the heroes simply had to face and punch their way out. They were never interesting and there was never a sense where the audience could understand them. Luckily Thanos breaks that tradition, Josh Brolin gives a very conflicted performance of a creature that wants balance in the universe, which is why he wants to collect the infinity stones. The audience receives a motivation, (which I will not spoil) that makes this character understandable and to a degree even relatable. You never root for Thanos but you understand him at the same time. Brolin easily gives us the best MCU villain and one of the strongest comic book villains in years, easily exceeding Tom Hiddleston and Michael B. Jordan. The same thing can unfortunately not be said about the hero characters. Some receive extra material that allows them to shine as the great actors they are, notably Robert Downey jr, who adds the typical eccentric charisma of Tony Stark but there also seems to be sense of terror and panic within his portrayal. Downey jr has now played the genius, playboy, philanthropist for 10 years, it's still awesome to see that this Academy Award nominee puts this amount of effort into a role he has now played for a decade. Zoe Saldana also has some key scenes to really shine, especially when she comes to realize who the attacker is. Gamora has never been my favorite Guardian of the Galaxy. However this is the first time where I find her character interesting. Overall Infinity War is a popcorn spectacle with a great villain and some terrific performances, however the different tones can be jarring sometimes and most other hero characters receive very little development.","8"
"intermedx","Finally a Marvel film I can actually Marvel at.","28 April 2018","Okay, misanthrope alert! In the case of Avengers: Infinity War, I found myself actually rooting for Thanos more than the Avengers. It seems Thanos is the only one who realizes that there are too many people and is actually doing something about it. No that I have that off my chest, what about the movie? As with the rest of the Marvel Universe films, there is no shortage of action and all your favorite characters are there. In that respect it feels like Pasta Puttanesca: You throw in whatever you have in the cupboard. And, for those of us who have not been totally sucked into the storyline, CNN has produced a good summary and timeline to help decipher the nuanced hints of what was to come in Infinity Wars. The writers have done a good job of interweaving the various storylines together, no mean feat, to keep those who, such as myself, have not followed the story arc over the pat 10 years. Visuals, as yo would expect are stunning, and the hand-held photography is kept to a minimum so as not to induce vertigo! Infinity Wars certainly raises some major questions about what is to come. I mean how can you eliminate that many key figures and keep the franchise alive? But then, Thanos does have the time infinity stone, so who is to say that time won't be reversed. After all this is fantasy. The Marvel franchise is getting long in the tooth and personally, I lost much of the wide-eyed anticipation long ago. But Avengers: Infinity Wars does a lot to bring back the enjoyment of the franchise and left me with a ""Say what?"" at the end.","9"
"markthomassintek","Possibly the most anticipated film of the year finally hits the big screen but is it really that big?","26 April 2018","REVIEW - AVENGERS INFINITY WAR

Possibly the most anticipated film of the year finally hits the big screen but is it really that big?

Big cast Big special effects Big action Big villain Big silence

The problem with the marvel universe is that they announce films far too early.

Let me try to explain.

Imagine that a hero gets killed off but you already know their sequel is being made and is due out next year. Would their death have as much of an impact?

Yes if you don't know their sequel was being made but confusing if you did.

I can't and as usual won't give too much away but all I will say is there are 2 scenes that are pivotal to the part 2.

One involving Dr Strange and the 14 million and 6 possible outcomes and the party involving Starlord slipping Thanos.

I would guess that these 2 scenes set up part 2 out next year.

Story easy to follow.

Can be confusing figuring out who all of the characters are especially as Captain America is now not in his Red White and Blue uniform / costume.

There is a lot to see and it is worth doing so on the large screen but I didn't leave feeling blown away and I honestly can't figure out why?

Rating 8 out of 10","8"
"leqesai","Disappointing but not terrible","28 September 2021","Avengers: Infinity War is not a terrible movie. Let me make this very clear. It is shot well, it has some very interesting set pieces and plot direction and it continues the Avengers storyline in a fairly compelling way. So why is it disappointing? Why am I dropping a 6/10 on this thing? Overload.

Avengers: Infinity War simply has too much going on. There is a persistent element of urgency to everything happening in the film but there are so many characters, plot pieces to connect, settings and motivations that it just gets to be a mess. You're never really given enough time to make emotional connections to any of the characters in the film (except a few but this is spoiler free) so the plot feels superficial even though the stakes are supposedly very high.

If you haven't kept up on all of the Marvel movies prior to watching Avengers: Infinity War you're going to end up sitting through a film constantly wondering why various characters aren't given any characterization whatsoever. There really is very little growth or development of any character in this film despite major events happening to quite a few of them. If this sounds paradoxical its because it is. You've got characters experiencing personal quests/journeys separate from everyone else, for which the outcomes are generally predictable. You've got major plot elements that are also predictable but designed to pull the emotional strings even though they're thrown at you rapid-fire.

It isn't a terrible movie. But it certainly isn't a great movie. Avengers: Infinity War is a solid 6/10. I enjoyed watching it but only really because, like many, I am very invested in the Marvel stories at this point and I want to see how it ends. I've seen it twice and I likely won't go out of my way to see it a third time.","10"

"peteypiper","A 10 Year Wait For A 2 Part Film That Will Set Up The Future Of The MCU","30 April 2018","What an absolute masterpiece of a film. After ten years of waiting, this delivered exactly what the audience were hoping for.

To start with, I LOVED how Thanos, the villain, is the main part of the film. It is basically a ""heist"" movie where Thanos is on a mission to get the Infinity Stones and The Avengers are the obstacles that he has to face. I thought that was a fantastic way of handling the movie. Hats off to you, Russo Brothers!

As the film goes on, you begin to understand Thanos' way of thinking when it comes to balancing the universe. His method, as villainous as it sounds, makes perfect sense! However, you know that it needs to be stopped. Yet, once you combine that with the number of years worth of support that you've given to The Avengers, you then begin to side with them more. The film is brilliant for making you know that the villain needs to be stopped but also for making you understand the villain's plan and why he's doing it.

The film is very fast paced so you need to keep up. However, it doesn't leave you hanging. If it leaves a scene open ended then don't worry because that scene will be concluded later on. That said, you begin to have a clear understanding of what each group of Avengers are doing when it comes to their own plans. It's sort of like sending three parties out to handle the situation differently. You have Captain America, Black Widow and Falcon etc defending the stone against Thanos. You then have Thor, Rocket Raccoon and Groot making a weapon to defeat Thanos. Finally, you have Iron Man, Doctor Strange and Spider-Man etc bringing the fight to Thanos himself. Again, I LOVED how even though they were handling the situation differently, each plan was countered by Thanos and The Black Order. You finally get to see what you as an audience want to see (even though you admit you don't), which is The Avengers being conquered and going up against something way beyond them.

The fight scenes were awesome and the character interactions and development was gripping, comical and interesting. I don't really have much more to say until I see it again as I'm still recovering from it! Marvel has excelled itself with this ballsy, funny, emotional and tense masterpiece. Infinity War will gain new audiences, satisfy big fans of the comic books and entertain every person who chooses to watch it.

Also, I'm so excited for the 4th film and the nod to Captain Marvel was a brilliant post-credit scene. Well done, Marvel! I have NO idea what is going to happen next!

I'm scared and also very excited!","1"
"belacane","Probably too ambitious","30 April 2018","We saw the movie today, discussed it for about 10 minutes afterwards, and now have moved on. Overall, because of the ""scenes in space,"" this movie felt more like a Guardians movie with a little extra Avengers, not an Avengers movie with a little bit of Guardians. None of the Avengers had enough screen time to satisfy any of us, but all the Guardians had quite a lot of screen time.

Because there were ""scenes on Earth"" and ""scenes in space,"" the story felt chopped up; it was as if Thanos' minions were fighting one war and he himself was off fighting a different one.

Disappointing in its inability to grab and hold our interest - but nice to see the old gang on the screen again. This is the first movie in the MCU that we probably won't bother buying on disc. Also, I was really hoping Bucky and Dr. Strange would share some interactions, but they didn't :-)","10"
"namob-43673","Great movie, great entertainment","28 April 2018","Infinity War was very predictable for us who read the comics, that is a small critic. Dinklage was out of place, Black Widow felt unnecessary, and Hulk was mistreated horribly. A lot of things was missing as well, and a few decisions did not really work.

With that said though it was fantastic entertainment, great movie experience, and top 5 marvel movie.

Also if you are a green party member and you want to kill humans because in your psychotic world there are too many people, you will love this movie beyond compare.

One of the most entertaining movies ever made and a fantastic superhero movie, but as a movie (in general) it had too many problems to get top grade.","9"
"mannuskyhigh","Packs a Solid Punch before the ultimate finale","1 September 2018","This movie is beyond awesome, and I call it awesome not just because I have to, as so many people have liked and given crazy 10 ratings. I genuinely feel it is. I think the Russo brothers have done a commendable job in bringing so many superheroes in one film and Indeed it must have been crazy. One wrong move and it could just go wrong. Remember how Spiderman 3 and The Amazing Spiderman 2 went wrong in the similar manner. The directors just couldn't work with the idea of using multiple villians in the script. Thankfully that does not happen here. There are many superheroes and many supervillians and works just fine. Credit should go to screenwriters because the main job is always handled by them.

The biggest strength of this film is that you don't have to watch the previous MCU movies to understand the storyline. urrmm..ok you must watch some movies but not entirely because I haven't seen myself. And it was one of the reasons why I was a bit doubtful whether I would like the film or not as I am having the lack of knowledge. But the makers have pulled off a superb job. The film is so gripping from start to finale you won't even care what happened previously. Every character is well defined and moves you. Heck! didn't even watch the two galaxy movies before this film but still could understand everything. That's the magic this film got.

People hating on the ending especially on Quill's part is childish and annoying. Quill loved Gamora to the extent that he could not lose her. His action was understandable and inevitable. Ditto for the part of Thanos, He had to be victorious, and its fine considering the next movie is coming next year (fingers crossed)

Coming to performances, everyone has given their best foot forward. But I have my favourites. Josh Brolin as Thanos dominates the show with a commanding presence and engaging act while the best performance comes from Zoe Saldana as Gamora, She moves you completely and takes this film to an time high, kudos to the makers who thought of giving her such a strong arc this time. The next day I watched Both guardian movies and her performance in those films were nothing to write home about. So yeah ! Gamora rules

Next comes Okoye, she was simply fantastic as the General of The Wakanda Army. Her role is quite short but she manages to make a mark ditto for Nebula who is striking in a small role. Emotionally distraught, she is ready to take on her evil step father even if it means her death. Last Comes Black Widow who sadly didn't get much to do not even proper fight scenes she is known for. But her presence is enough to ensure light. Rest all were great. I wouldn't call this one a masterpiece but its certainly a great piece of cinema. Go Watch it !","8"

"DylanMcChillin","Decent, but overlong","7 January 2019","The movie can be described as ""decent"" at its best. The movie fails in its length and use of CGI. I don't think there was a single camera shot that didn't include some kind of CGI. The acting was okay, but the humor was misplaced. It's time for the avenger movies to end.","9"

Some things about this film were overdramatised And it felt at times there was too much going on.

"bgar-80932","Good end","1 August 2019","I've decided to go ahead and finish up with End Game and then probably call it quits with Marvel. Marvel's decent but nothing ever blows me away because it always has to be a mix with serious/funny. Problem is it's not actually funny and just ruins the moment 9 times out of 10. Yes I get that in real life people use humor to deal with tragic situations such as at a funeral but I don't need a ""witty quip"" in the middle of a fight to the death. It takes you out of it and makes it seem like the moment isn't as significant. The last fight at Wakanda was dope though I have to give it credit there. It also had a pretty intriguing end that made me want to throw on the next one so it did something good there for sure. The enormity of the situation was actually felt there and I'm intrigued to see it end. I guess Spiderman is part of phase 3 but whatever I'm watching Ant-Man and the Wasp then Endgame then probably being done with Marvel forever and not spending my time on movies I only find average. That's a really dumb use of my time and I'm not blaming anyone for liking the movies as they are well done but don't resonate enough with me.","9"
"chera_khalid","It was good","26 September 2023","""Avengers: Infinity War"" assembles the Marvel universe with my 7/10 rating, and I must say, I liked it. The acting, bolstered by a star-studded cast, shines as each hero grapples with the impending threat of Thanos. The film editing skillfully juggles multiple storylines, creating a relentless pace of action and emotion. Its strength lies in its portrayal of the cost of heroism and the weight of sacrifice, delivering a message that heroes are defined by their choices. The music, with Alan Silvestri's iconic theme, elevates the grandeur of the battles, and the cinematography captures the vastness of the Marvel cosmos. ""Infinity War"" is an epic culmination of a decade of storytelling, an emotional rollercoaster that left us eagerly awaiting the endgame.","10"

"DarthVoorhees","If you've followed it up to this point you are going to have a ball","20 May 2018","I suppose now is as good a time as any to give my impressions of 'Avengers Infinity War'. I've never been a huge fan of the MCU but that isn't to say I hate it. The MCU definitely has made some films that rank among the best of the comic book genre and then they've made movies like 'Iron Man 2' and 'Thor The Dark World' where I'd rather watch an all day Zach Snyder film fest. And so I am kind of in the audience that wants something from this and yet won't go too easy on it.

I liked it. This was a huge gamble as it has been hinted at for a decade but for the most part the movie delivers on it's promises. The stipulation being that the movie will only work if you have seen the entire Marvel catalogue good, bad and downright ugly and have had some level of appreciation. If you are on board the movie immediately becomes a giant set piece that really stretches the confines of what has been done before.

Josh Brolin makes the film. He gives in my opinion arguably the best performance in a MCU film. So much depends on Thanos and for a film that doesn't really have enough room for any extraneous sequences Brolin is able to develop an intriguing character who makes this cartoony McGuffin based evil plan have just a bit more nuance and weight. The scenes with Brolin and Zoe Saldana have an intimacy and tragedy that you really don't expect in a film with this breakneck speed.

I don't want to spoil this but the shocks have to be reevaluated next year when the sequel comes out. I'm willing to do that however as the setup here warrants interest and belief in the possibilities of the next episode. In a way 'Infinity War' is kind of a victim of the MCU being an undying franchise. We all know the reset button is going to be pressed and it's just a matter of the pressing being as interesting as the thrills here.","10"

"FKDZ","Avengers: Infinity War","8 May 2023","Avengers: Infinity War is action filled blockbuster with great pacing and a memorable ending. Stakes and strong performances make this a enjoyable experience. I'm a bit late to the party. But I've liked GoTG enough to watch both volumes and now wanting to see the third, I found out I needed to catch up on some stuff. Most notably Infinity War and Endgame.

Directing and visuals are great. CGI is fantastic. This really is a spectacle, I get it how you'd want to watch this in the theaters. Action sequences can become quite tiring in their chaos though. Sometimes it just moves around too much. It's rare though, most scenes are easy to follow. Generally though just really solid. To be expected.

Story and writing, overall the story is great and in my opinion a good way to cut the bloat. If anything the acquirement of the first infinity stone was a bit lazy. As it happend entirely offscreen. Especially coming from GotG it's jarring. We just needed one scene to show how ''presumably'' simple it was. Even though that would be Thanos's first stone therefore he wouldn't be that strong yet, he still did without a challenge which makes his power seem a bit unbalanced. Overall story is great like I said. There is one goal, combined through multiple storylines. Most of the characters had some objective. Comedy writing, to my surprise Infinity War's tone is a bit more serious than what I expected. The one liners are still there, but not to the point where I had to roll my eyes.

Music, the main theme is really effective. But in general the music felt underwhelming for some reason. It was never really present nor did it elevate some moments as much as it should've, like in Wakanda. When watching, you can't not compare it to similar scenes like LoTR. But one is much more effective than the other. The buildup is lacking here, mainly due to the lack of fear. Which has always been a sticking point in Marvel movies, genuine fear.

That said, it was well paced, the 2,5 hours did not feel long at all. I enjoyed it.","8"

"Alexander_Blanchett","One of the best MCU films","26 April 2018","A fantastic sequel and one of the finest of the MCU. It was not perfect but it was hell of a fun film with more twists than all those films combined. I think it was a very challenging task to bring all these characters together but it worked. I really loved the new combinations and relationships of the different characters which were incredibly dynamic. Also the portray of Thanos was fantastic. Sure they could have worked a little more on the effects but he way the character was written was excellent and extremely unexpected because it was not the kind of one dimensional and boring villain I would have expected. They really gave him a lot of soul and possibly more than any of the other characters with the exception of Zoe Saldana's Gamora, which marks Saldana's best turn with that character. Robert Downey Jr. was his usual self but more fun than in this latest Tony Stark appearances. Chris Evans was rather boring. Chris Hemsworth was pretty fine. Chris Pratt (jeez too many Chris's) was funny and self ironic. Scarlett Johansson was a bit wasted. I am not really fond on the direction they develope Bruce Banner/Hulk and Ruffalo can do better. Nice to see Chadwick Boseman so short after his own adventure again. Tom Holland really developed into the best Spider-Man. Really liked his performance here again. The visuality was great. Most of the action scenes just brilliantly executed. The score was great. I had many shivers down my spine. The ending was shocking , but I somehow can imagine how they will continue and in which direction the last sequels goes. Great entertainment with a lot of tense, heart, soul and surprisingly moving moments.","9"

A Few Complaints:

1. Thor's subplot is incredibly BOOORING! Think how cool it would have been to shoot lightning like in Ragnarock, but they take a step back and give him another hammer.

It wasn't terrible (but alas not close to the awesomeness of the comic). Lately Marvel movies have been rather meh, this one was much better, maybe because it didn't focus on any on character for very long, had enough humor and action to keep the pace going.

I am coming to the realization that these movies are really geared towards kids, and made entertaining enough so the parents won't be put off by watching. When I think about it like that 12 year old me would have been giving this a 10 and I would have wanted more more more.

"corozin","Actually pretty dreadful.","27 April 2018","I know this is going to go against the grain of a lot of the early reviews here, but frankly I thought this was a pretty dreadful movie.

This one stacks so many superheros into the same film that very few of them actually get more than a few minutes of screen time each. Superheros which are all dedicated to protecting the people of earth, who barely feature at all except for a few frames.

A number of well established characters are bumped off almost at random, and the now almost mandatory overlong, over noisy, confused Transformers-esque action sequences are weirdly punctuated by an approximately 30 minute segment in the middle where absolutely no plot advance occurs at all and which could have usefully have just been cut with no impact save to reduce the boredom.

Coming so soon after the Black Panther movie it seems Marvel are now intent on creating some kind of endless production line of ""blockbuster"" titles 2 or 3 times every year. I am completely weary of this, as the story quality is frankly going through the floor like a bad soap opera.

Just about the best thing I can say for this movie is that it is better that Justice League, but frankly that movie didn't set the bar high at all.","8"

Because all in all, compared to the first two parts, there is simply more action, more superheroes and even more aggravation towards the unforeseeable end. But it's great to see the Avengers getting more and more involved in the story from part to part. In this third part it gets serious. Because the villain is attacking the earth. Here too, new heroes are added, such as Spiderman and Doctor Strange. The technical effects in this part are extremely overwhelming and well done. Camera, sound and music result in a uniform dance. The film captivates you and sprints from one action sequence to the next. Only the final remains, and with it the last part of the Avengers.","10"
"atrevino90","I understand why people love it, but...","11 May 2018","First of I'd like to say I did liked the movie, it was better than I expected it to be, and for the amount of characters they were very well handled for the most part. The problem is Marvel in general, they have managed to do a giant TV series, some episodes are good, some are straight up bad, but they keep you hooked and basically force you to watch all the movies to enjoy this one, you see, this movie will not age well, simply because as a stand alone, it is not a good movie, people defending it has a plot, no it does not, the plot is the entire marvel universe, but the movie has very little and at times inconsistent plot, as an example how come Vision was probably THE most powerful avenger in Civil War having the mind stone and all and in this movie is a complete rookie who needs saving by a simply enhanced human, but I wont get into much detail on the inconsistencies, the movie works because its fan base are blind to what a good movie should be when it comes to marvel, granted Marvel is not meant to be a Dark Knight Trilogy, its made to entertain more simple minded audience and as I said it is enjoyable to watch, but only if you watched everything else and you shut your brain a little bit to not get annoyed by the inconsistencies and lack of plot or good script.

The other thing I wish would have impacted me more (SPOILER) are the deaths, I felt nothing from anyone dying in this movie, and before you say Im just stone cold hearted it's not because of that, Marley and me did made me cry for example, the problem was that none of the deaths feel permanent, not even Gamora which was the saddest death anyway, but I believe she is simply trapped in the soulstone and they can still get her back somehow for guardians of the galaxy 3, thats the other thing, you see all these movies planned with characters that are supposedly dead it's hard to believe they are really gone for good, Marvel has become famous for never actually killing its characters or rarely and only when they dont serve any purpose, compare any of them to the death of Rachel on TDK, that death alone had more impact than all these deaths combined

With all that said, it was certainly an enjoyable movie, just not as much as people claim it is, this movie deserves an 8 at most but probably a 7.5 would be a better fit, 5 being an okay movie you did not hate but forgot you even saw, 10 being masterpiece 7.5 is good and memorable but no close to a masterpiece","10"

"lotekguy-1","Big budget, big cast, big bang for the buck - lives up to its hype","26 April 2018","Since everyone likely to watch this has already seen plenty of Marvel Comics' superhero movies, let's keep this one simple, with a good news-bad news format:

Good - More superheroes appear in this one than you could shake Thor's hammer at. Bad - It's occasionally hard to keep track of who is using which power against which enemy or henchperson thereof.

Bad - It runs 2 ½ hours. Good - The action is so (dare I say?) fast and furious that it sure seems a lot shorter.

Bad - After all that time, the movie ends with a lousy situation, including some surprising deaths, just to set up a sequel. Good - Since the power to control time is one of the themes, maybe the sequel will undo some of the losses we witnessed in this one.

Good - Stan Lee's cameo comes early, allowing focus to remain on the main story. Bad - What could possibly be bad about a Stan Lee cameo? They're always nothing but degrees of good.

Good - Josh Brolin looks and sounds suitably menacing in the role of archvillain Thanos, while also showing more emotional layers than usual for the genre. Bad - The handsome Brolin, in full regalia, bears a shocking resemblance to Ron Perlman, which would be a serious loss of points on the old 1-10 scale if carried over to his real life.

Good - Wonderful comic touches from Robert Downey Jr.'s Iron Man/Tony Stark and the crew from Guardians of the Galaxy. Bad - Much of the action occurs in such dark, ominous settings, creating the impression of DC Comics having invaded this universe. Even Darth Vader would have wanted to redecorate Thanos' spacecraft and environs top cheer the place up.

Bad - Dave Bautista's endearingly dense Drax is getting even dumber. Good - At least his form of stupidity is funny, unlike the same trend in the US Congress.

Good - Thanos' evil plot is to save all the planets in the universe that have become overpopulated by wiping out half of their populations in a single stroke. Since he offs them randomly, he thinks it's fair, making him the ultimate eco-warrior. Bad - See previous comment about US Congress, whose collective thinking is no better.

Good - Scarlett Johansson appears as Black Widow. Bad - She doesn't get enough screen time to display her lithe and lethal skill set to full advantage. Actually, the same pairing applies to lovable tree-creature Groot, but for very different reasons

Bad - The credits are really, really long. Good - The standard teaser after they finally roll past is worth the wait.

Good - Franchise fans (who, unlike me at the time, already know this isn't a one-and-done story line) should be delighted by the script and the overall quality of the production, including all the CGI vistas and mayhem. Go to the biggest screen and most enveloping sound system in driving range, since there's plenty of action worthy of those enhancements. Bad - If you've not already seen a fair share of the zillion movies or read a bunch of the decades of comics featuring Thor, Spiderman, Iron Man and all the other characters converging to defeat this epic threat to the universe, don't start here. You'll be a stranger in a strange land.

"Mike_Devine","A Marvel film that hits all the emotions","22 January 2019","After 10 years of the current era of the Marvel universe, 'Avengers: Infinity War' marks the beginning of the end for the stories of many of the characters we've grown attached to throughout multiple film entries. What else can you expect but a gargantuan cast that brings together nearly every single major superhero and supporting character?

It's difficult to keep track of everyone in 'Infinity,' as different factions team up with each other, whether it's the 'Guardians of the Galaxy' crew splitting up with the likes of Thor and Doctor Strange or members of the original Avengers crew heading to Wakanda for a last stand of sorts to protect an infinity stone, everything is all over the map. But regardless of where our heroes are physically in the universe, they are united in their mission to defeat big bad guy Thanos before he can wipe out 50% of all living things in the universe.

Despite the obvious bloating that 'Infinity' experiences, the film works very well. It feels as grand as it's billed, and lives up to the hype. There's plenty of material here, from the stylized action sequences we come to expect from Marvel fare to humorous banter between the old friends - and some new ones - when everyone crosses paths. In this sense, 'Infinity' feels more like a space opera than it does your typical superhero blockbuster. There's also an ominous tone that 'Infinity' takes on as it becomes clear that the situation is dire, and it's a hard pill to swallow when events transpire, including the final moments of the film that leave many breathless. One of the few criticisms of the film is that it moves too quickly - the story could have unfolded much better as a Netflix series, but of course the filmmakers did what was necessary to get it to an appropriate runtime.

The Russo brothers deserve much credit for being able to tame this beast of a movie, and it's likely that 'Avengers: Endgame' will be a must see when it hits theaters in April.","6"

"greenwhich","Thank You","8 August 2018","I absolutely liked it. Superheroes especially Marvel I can only take in smaller doses, but when we get all those superheros in this film it is so Epic. On their own they can often drag out. DC Batman/Superman/Dredd however I am more inclined until they don't combine well, because they are stand alone, and any justice league seemingly only really stole from Marvel.

I admit this film is gonna be marmite to some, love/hate possibly due to continuity. But it's worth it unless they predictably Disney next. There should be a price. Look at our World. Otherwise I might stew. As far as the current trilogy so far, it's very hard for me too pick a winner between the first and the 3rd? The first started it and was a great film, the 3rd however you must watch and make that marmite opinion. Forget the second I didn't like it, many reasons, but that's a separate review. Infinity War certainly lives up too its hype, it is so fresh and enjoyable, they didn't look stupid like all stand around jacking each other off in those other superhero movies where they all do a line dance, singing like a bad music video. It had enough clever one-liners, comedy not too impact its telling, but enough humor for it to also be a hoot. And its visuals, choreography, and story are masterful.

"capaldimark","A breath of fresh air for the MCU","29 April 2018","Over the last 10 years, Marvel Studios has built their own cinematic universe through various movies, each one getting bigger and bigger and leading up to this very movie, ""Avengers: Infinity War"". It's a movie that was essentially 10 years in the making, and with all the buildup and hype through the years, the question remains: Does it live up to the hype and meet expectations? Not only does Infinity War do both, it also manages to be a breath of fresh air into the Marvel Cinematic Universe.

What Marvel has done with their cinematic universe over the past decade is nothing short of astounding. To be able to produce as many movies as they have and still keep the attention of the fans is a true example of good storytelling. The culmination of this good storytelling comes in the form of Infinity War, directed by Anthony and Joe Russo, which takes place after the events of 2016's ""Captain America: Civil War"", also directed by the Russo's. After their big fight with each other in that movie, the Avengers became a fractured, divided group. Some have even gone into hiding. However, they must put their differences aside for the sake of the universe when they learn of Thanos (Josh Brolin), who is seeking to collect the six infinity stones to have the power to wipe out half the universe, which he claims will bring balance to the universe. On the surface it seems like the typical Marvel superhero story, but there's something different here. This is darker and more bleak than pretty much any other Marvel movie. It goes places you wouldn't expect a Marvel movie to go to, and by doing so it feels unlike any other Marvel story before it. It also does a good job with keeping the viewer guessing what's coming next, and there are some twists and turns that leave the viewer always anticipating the next turn of events. In short, it's unpredictable, even all the way to its shocking ending. It's certainly a breath of fresh air when compared to the more traditional and predictable stories they have done recently. Kudos to Marvel for pulling all of this off.

What's interesting about Infinity War is that while it is the biggest Marvel movie ever in terms of the amount of characters and its sheer scale, its story is a more personal one that also has its fair share of emotional moments. Many of the more personal and emotional moments involve the villain, Thanos, which was a smart move because it gives the viewer insight on why he does what he does and the sacrifices he has to make to accomplish what he sets out to do. It establishes him as more of a complex, fleshed-out character instead of just some big, dumb bad guy that's in it to cause havoc. It's what makes Thanos easily the best MCU villain yet. The writing team of Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely deserve major props for this.

Although the story is dark, the movie has its fair share of humor that helps lighten the mood. While it's good to have humor, it can be a bad thing when there's too much of it at the wrong times, which tends to happen in Infinity War. There are a good amount of scenes, especially in the first half of the movie, where the humor would get in the way of the drama, which ended up getting a bit annoying because it would take away from the dramatic tension. The comedic scenes also tended to last a bit too long and drag on, especially during one scene involving the Guardians of the Galaxy and Thor. It was an issue early on, but fortunately got better as the movie went on.

As usual, the cast is great, with basically everyone returning from the previous movies. Whether it's Evans, Downey, Johansson, Hemsworth, Ruffalo, etc., it's always a joy to see these actors having fun with one another, and it helps that they have great chemistry with each other. Josh Brolin is also very good as Thanos through motion capture and voice over, and he helps make Thanos not only an intimidating villain, but just an all around good villain.

In short, Avengers: Infinity War is a thrilling and unpredictable journey that not only adds to Marvel's continuing success at the movies, but also raises the bar for the Marvel Cinematic Universe. If Infinity War is any sign of what's to come from Marvel in the future, then I can't wait to see what they have in store for us. Bring it on!","10"
"andrewroy-04316","Infinity War somehow lives up to the crazy hype train and delivers a bold hit","30 April 2018","I love that Marvel said this would be the movie event that everything led to, and then didn't shy from the moment and made a great movie. It's extremely difficult to tie the enormous number of characters in together without having the movie just be exposition, so they did a great job of focusing on Thanos and how he affects the Avengers and using the previous movies as crucial backstory. They did a great job of clearly explaining Thanos' mindset and justification, and I found his character arc intriguing and very believable. The visuals and performances, especially from Saldana, were great as always, and I thought the pacing of the movie was great. Certainly an emotional ending, and it didn't quite feel like it had that amount of weight as it seems certain that half of people who died will be brought back, but regardless of the implications, it was a good ending for the movie. I thought Thor's journey for his hammer and the explanation of why he needed it after seeming to not need it in Ragnarok, how he made that one attached to him, and why the dwarf was so necessary were all not well explained, but in the grand scheme of the movie it doesn't really detract and was just a lesser section. Downey was excellent, and I loved their focus on him and Cumberbatch. Infinity War was the most excited I've ever been for a movie release, and it absolutely delivered.","10"
"eagandersongil","A great movie","27 April 2018","A gigantic, monumental film in every aspect, with epic battles, absurd development and spectacular villains, ""Avengers - Endless War"" is not only characterized as the best film of Marvel, the film also presages to be one of the best hero movies already made, and the only reason for not being such, is that in the end, we little believe what we see, because we know, that the situation will be reversed in the second, after all, it's a hero movie. The script that tells the story of Thanos, a kind of man who intends to give mercy to the world killing half of its population, thus ending, with the shortage, Thanos is a hero of absurd development, and beats head-on with Nolan's joker, as being the best villain in the movie of heroes, putting different universes and countless heroes in the same universe, the directors are successful in embedding several stories, not always with a perfect rhythm or the perfect excuse for, but, it does not get boring, nor gets to leave one or the other too much to corner, which is a merit grade. The cruelest thing about the film is that we understand that Thanos wants to end half of the universe, the character does not think of it as genocide, but an act of mercy to the suffering of people, and we can not support it, but we understand its actions, Thanos is not a sovereign and robotic villain, he is human, perhaps and strangely, the most human of the film, and watching coldly, perhaps the hero of the film, this characterization of Thanos and the development of it, is simply brilliant and magnificent. Technically the film is a show of special effects, and directing action scenes, great choreographies and frames, and cleverly putting battles in separate areas, not creating a big mess in a single center with all the heroes, even so, sometimes it seems that something came out in the editing, the transition in many moments is completely inorganic, just like your photo revesa and changes according to the core on screen, although this is not necessarily bad, it's just a touch of visual marking, well adjusted soundtrack, jokes in the right moments and well-balanced drama, Avengers infinite war is a well directed and finished film. The cast is fine, nothing too spectacular, even because no one has a lot of screen space, but they all play their role well, with a small highlight for Robert Downey Jr and Tom Holland, in isolation, """" Avengers - Infinite War ""is a spectacular movie , with small problems, it's true, but still spectacular, which does not give him a soul of genius and unique, is that we know that his story will continue, and everything shown so far will change, intrinsically, this disrupts our experience with this but nevertheless, contemplate the best film of Marvel.","9"

Vision and Scarlet Romance, Bruce Banner talking to Hulk, Guardians meeting Thor and finally Captain and Black Widow, these pairs are a treat to watch. But this isn't all about the avengers, it's more about Thanos and his journey on hunting all 6 Infinity Stones to keep the universe in balance so that he can re-create all of creation in his monstrous image. We get a brief of his past, his lovely Gamora and what he will do to complete his destiny. Let's just say Thanos ""Throws"" away this relationship which has left Gamora feeling ""flat"" hehehehe.

I love how he starts off with armour then every time he collects a stone, a piece is fallen off. I even like the different abilities the gunlet has, it's nothing like you have ever seen before.

Review: This movie is the darkest entry in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU), and the most epic in terms of scope and the threat that harms the world. This movie is not only a great movie, but a monumnental achievement and testament to Marvel's ability to realize its incredible vision. After 10 years and 19 movies Marvel has clearly shown that they know how to bring in hardcore and casual fans to the movies to see heroes dressed up in tights and saving the world. If you have been following this series and have watched most to all of the previous 18 MCU, this is a very satisfying payoff movie as it follows most of the heroes in the MCU. The Russos really outdid themselves, and through incredible editing and story telling they managed to tell a cohesive story that juggled numerous characters.

Though there were so many characters in this movie, the movie gave most of the characters great moments. The standouts were probably Zoe Saldana as Gamora, and Josh Brolin as Thanos. You believed their relationship as daughter and father respectively and you felt the emotional consequences of their relationship and what that relationship entailed. This was also Thanos' movie. He is without a doubt, my favorite villain in the MCU now and he is up there with Jordan's Killmonger, Hiddleston's Loki, and Keaton's Vulture. Brolin exudes such confidence, ferocity, and charisma in his performance that he sells the fact that he really believes what he is doing is right no matter how evil he seemed. I actually found myself agreeing with some of Thanos' reasonings at some points of the movie.

This was an unconventional narrative driven movie. It truly stands as a monument to Marvel's ability to deliver a different and unconventional comic book movie experience, and many studios will come to look at this as a paragon of how to do a payoff movie in a series. Many may even compare this to ""Lord of the Rings: Two Towers"" (2002), or ""Star Wars: Empire Strikes Back"" (1980) in its structure, but I believe this movie even stands apart from those movies. The only drawbacks that I saw was the fact that if this was your first MCU movie you will have no idea who the characters were and will be lost when watching this movie. Also, because there are so many characters in the movie some major characters don't get a chance to show up and get more moments, but I expected this going in. Truly, not only a great comic book movie, but an incredible movie watching experience.","8"

"kane_1371-117-231060","A really good surprise by Marvel.","30 July 2018","It has been a couple of years since I watched a Marvel movie and didn't get disappointed about shortcomings. Infinity War rides off the back of Thor Ragnarok (one of my lowest rated Marvel films) and Black Panther (a decent film, but flawed) both very successful and both very different in tone to each other. Infinity War as the third Avengers film does something that you don't always see happen, normally the third movies are not that good, in some cases are even catastrophic but here Russos bring their directorial power back for a bigger film than CW and thanks to a much more compact and well planned script a much much better film than CW too.

Infinity Was doesn't waste any time and goes straight for the jugular from the very beginning. There is no warmup, no normal life sequences that drag on, there is only real tangible threat and the powerless (compared to the villain) heroes that put everything on the line. The film goes on to shock (well depends on what the audience expects form the film) the audience from the very beginning and paints the picture as clearly as possible, the real strength of this film comes in the fact that the story is very much straight to the point, some might even say rushed but the fact is that this ""rushed"" feeling helps in creating those whiplash like moments where the audience is suddenly thrown off course by big moments that are supposed to get emotional responses of all kind from the audience. The sound design is nice and there isn't anything to complain about in that category really and I personally enjoyed the soundtrack too, the character themes come in at perfect places and they are tweaked a little bit to reflect the changes these characters have gone through. Acting is also very well done in most parts and that should be give considering the names in the movie, however this is the first time that most of these people get to shine in a Marvel movie because normally the scripts are not really on par with the quality of the casts. Here as I have mentioned before script shines bright and in turn helps the cast members to be more than what they normally are. What makes Infinity War really good is that it knows how to balance the tone, the humor is there but kept in check and the closer to the finale we get the fewer out of place jokes there are (altogether there are not many jokes that fall flat and out of place) and that is something that I believe any serious movie watcher would most probably appreciate.

I have to say, Marvel and the Russo's did impress me a lot specially after the taste Thor Ragnarok left in my mouth.","7"
"jackson-regurge","To Infinity and beyond!","13 June 2018","Avengers: Infinity War is a very well-made film. Every piece is combined brilliantly to create a stunning spectacle. Throughout the film I was glued to the screen and frozen in my seat. There are so many shocking, intense and even humorous moments. It is truly amazing to see 10 years of hard work all combine to achieve a tremendous result.

A film of this size and grandeur always had a huge task in terms of assembly, but the editing and pacing of the film is highly commendable. The film had so much to live up to and as a devoted Marvel fan I can tell you that it does not disappoint. A big reason behind the film's success is down to the Russo brothers who have now cemented their careers as cinema legends. The special effects in Infinity War are some of the best I have ever seen: the character Thanos looks positively menacing! To describe the film as a visual spectacle is an understatement. It is clear that a lot of hard work went into every frame of the film and it really pays off.

There are so many larger than life characters in the film and seeing all of them united is a dream come true. I must admit I was sceptical when I first heard that all the characters were appearing together, but after viewing the finished product I can only salute the makers of the film. The acting in the film is compelling and I really liked the storylines of all the heroes. However, I was not expecting to appreciate the storyline of Thanos as must as I did. Thanos is an awesome villain and I think that this is down to the filmmakers taking the time to carefully craft an interesting history and aura to the character which is brought to life by Josh Brolin who does a fantastic job.

Overall, I would highly recommend Avengers: Infinity War. It is a great instalment to the Marvel franchise and I am excited to see how the film series concludes.","10"

"kaustavmajumdar","The Marvel you must watch. More of the same sometimes, A thousand times better all the time","29 April 2018","I will never give a Marvel movie a 10 out of 10 rating, no matter how much I like or love or enjoy it because that would go against the whole premise of perfectness that a complete a 100% approval ratings signify. Marvel movies are not perfect and even more so they have a lot of help and leeway in terms of their history, background and casting that not a lot of other franchises can boast of. Nonetheless, Infinity War the movie is perhaps the best movie of Marvel I and in consensus, most of the other people have ever seen.

What sets M's IW apart from any of it's predecessors and relatives of the same family tree? Nobody has had the opportunity to learn from 18 previous releases, for one, which is major identifier to the causality of the successful destiny that has arrived for it unlike DC's Justice League movie from last year, which wanted to do too much ala Marvel in too less time non-ala Marvel. The worse part of it all was that it was that even failed to put forward a coherent movie that made some trails about making you feel you didn't waste you money and/or time. Anyways departing from the tragedies of Snyder and quickfixes of Whedon, let's talk about a darker MCEU which is second reason of what set IW apart and primary reason why I hated the generic Marvel humor (Read effing Bruce Banner all over the movie) so unnecessary. I mean people die here. Well, people die everywhere almost and especially in these movie franchises when the cameras are zoomed out and thousands, if not millions, are at risk from the catastrophic proportions of devastation that is brought about encounters between supernatural entities again and again, much to the bother of the people who keep tabs on the Sokovian Accords. So, characters in the movies you actually might care about die (you can count them as the number of fingers on one of your hands but for Marvels, that is a lot) and then there is the matter of Infinity Debacle. This movie is made shock and awe you at every turn of the frame and passing of minute. And judging by my personal elation when I watched it on 28th April and that of the theater audience, I am quite sure Kevin Feige and his identical bro-balls named the Russo brothers succeeded.

I admire this movie a lot for one particular reason and it is that despite how predictable how it was to be and how much you could extrapolate from the general arcs, you really still pretty much get invested and surprised by what it has to offer. 1) You know the stakes are high and people may die. But the emotional investment and disbelief of the actual scenarios still would actually silence whole crowds because of their nature and what Marvel has come to be. Which is all the more the Feige and lot should tried to keep the humor in check with the grim colors and darkness involved in mind. 2)The visual effects, power-ups and battles that happen all across the board are so great and good and exciting that do actually eclipse everything that came before. That in itself may not have been all that surprising because time and sequels have a way of doing that, but let's not betterment as a granted for it is often known that might not be the case. 3)Thanos. THANOS. THANAPTOSIS IS HIS WAY FOR NIHILISM IS EXISTENCE. Okay, caps-ing of the letters may have been a bit much but my praise of the supervillain isn't. He is everything Infinity War is all about and to him everything in MCEU has been leasing upto. He is power, pain, emotions and guilt, Idealism and Rationality pumped into one battle hardened super-bod that can and does tame in the stones of power, legend and cosmos just long enough to fulfill his promise and when that all is accomplished, he sits lonely in an unknown sense of pride etched on a guilt riddled face. It was all for him and despite how this franchise is, if he were not good as he turns out to be (Hats off to Brolin and the VFX teams) it could damaged the legacy of ten freaking years and nineteen whopping movies. And as he does promise, when he gets done, half of humanity does remain but whether it is perfect balance and mercy in addition remains to be seen as there is a certain call made by a certain person before a certain cosmic catastrophe happens which will lead to three more Marvel movies in-between and then, the most awaited Avengers movie of 2019. The fact that Brie Larson has been roped in Captain Marvel just makes it all the more better (The sheer volume of people involved and the awards and accolades in between all the cast members involved just speaks to the lengths of success this franchise boasts of).

The rest of cast is bloody brilliant too in their own small ways. It makes so much worth your precious money that you will shout ""TAKE MY MONEY, already!"" when the next installment does roll around. Special mentions to Tom Holland (the dude is bit of a prodigy in almost anything he does), Elizabeth Olsen (She acts even better than how beautiful she is in moment of her existence), Zoe Saldana (She is frequent occurrence in fictional and emotional lore(s) like these and for good reason; I can finally say she was the best part of the GoTG group) and RDJ & Chris Hemsworth (The franchise oldies are golden in their portrayals and the shine they have; I will miss them if and when they do leave the franchise behind).

All in all, that is my take on it. I had expected the half and half thing to happen in 2019 edition of this tale seeing as there was no clue as to where the Soul was, but now I and most people not privileged enough to be part of Feige's integral team are absolute bewilderment of what is to come. So good luck for the wait.","10"
"Offworld_Colony","A thoroughly enjoyable, quality action piece with a nerve raw heart...","14 February 2020","...a great mashup of genres, some hilarious moments, creative action, a fantastic arc for the mad Titan Thanos, and a brilliant concoction of bringing together all the disparate threads generated over however many filmmakers and agendas over however many years. It's certainly a film that requires previous knowledge and it's certainly the first of two films but on a second watch the film breathes and its juggling of tones and steady hand under the Russo's is very clear. It's an event film and is in a class amongst the best we have these days. I was overly critical the first time but this time I enjoyed it for exactly what it was and appreciated its flow and clarity and quality. It's clever and fun and certainly a benchmark.","10"
"dreameable","Waiting for next Avernger","26 June 2018","The Avenger and their allies must use all the power they have got in an attempt to defeat the powerful Thanos who tries to wipe out half of the life in the galaxy.

This is a long-awaited movie to be released by Marvel after they released many movies to introduce many characters associated with the film. Avenger Infinity War has over 20 main characters in total. They can do this because the background of each character has been described in their own movie, so when the movie starts, they can suddenly jump into the conflict without an introduction of the characters.

The production of this movie is absolutely fantastic, all stunts, actions, audios, and computer graphics are the best. There are a lot of things going on during 2 and a half hours period, the screen time distribution probably the most difficult part to deal with in my opinion. It came out OK but can be improved.

Moreover, this is one of the hero movies that the storyline is very hard to predict, making it recognizable and hard to forget. Although the movie answered the main question, it also makes up more questions at the end, make the audience demand for the next Avenger movie.","4"

"cybersecurity36665","One of the best avengers movie","28 April 2021","Not only does this film reach our expectations as a film, it surpasses them. There are quite a few things I like about this film so this review may take a while to read.

Firstly, the Russo brothers obviously show deep appreciation for the MCU and the effort they put in for this film is clearly visible with so many awesomely-handled pivotal moments in the film's plot. It seems that many of the MCU's best films are directed by Anthony and Joe Russo and that doesn't surprise me one bit.","10"
"AngryChainsaw","No, no, no, with that kind of epilog...","7 August 2018","This the end of that kind type of action-science fiction movie is the simplest thing: that doesn't fit into the whole! No!!! Otherwise, the whole movie, was made in accordance with previous extensions, tense, with good and fast personnel and for the first time with all Marvel's heroes, who had never met together before, and the series, needlessly, would receive a total unserious tone in the entire series and the end. Not even the biggest a layman would be acting-indicating more episodes of over-2h with Josh Brolin in the main negative role. Only because of the diverse players of the Pleiades who have agreed to this scenario, perfectly fit visual effects, large personnel, photos and editing, I give high grade 7, as a fan of the serial, regardless of the end, because I have seen many times last sequence to Composed the whole thing and that during the first glacier I was stunned after the last shot * There is more - after everything else...","8"

"kumar-jayanth","Thanos' Movie with the Avengers just starring in it.","1 May 2018","Weaving together such a big star cast is impossible, but somehow the Russos have pulled off a stunning movie that weaves together what seems like multiple movies in one.The visuals, scripting and execution are excellent.

They do not seem tedious for such a long movie, as there is sufficient change between scenes to impart a quality of its own to each moment. Like when Dr. Strange and Iron man team up - to when Thanos arrives on Wakanda - each scene lives and breathes completely on its own.

Ultimately - this is Thanos' movie. They have done such a spectacular job with the villain in this one, you just have to gasp at multiple points. Thanos is successfully portrayed as the epitome of evil - which at its worst, is also seductive, and impossible to resist.

A 10/10 from me. A thorough entertainer inspite of the dark tone.","10"
