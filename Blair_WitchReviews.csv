"TechnicallyTwisted","A testament to no-budget film-making","12 September 1999","This film has maybe been one of the most hated 100 million dollar grosses in history. Before seeing this movie one should know absolutely nothing about it. Not even what the critics have said. It is a very creepy film. I for one loved it. I love the fact that it had virtually no-budget and it has made tons of money. It deserves it. It provides more atmosphere and creepiness than any horror film released this decade. The way it is presented, as the footage taken by 3 missing film-makers, is so simple yet pure genius. I've heard people complain that anyone with a video camera could have made this. This is true, but those people didn't and these people did. They had the idea and those who criticize it are just displaying their jealousy that they didn't think of it first. An instant classic whether you like it or not.","8"
"Lloyd-23","Tense, unsettling, original, intelligent, short, cheap.","3 November 1999","This film is not a feature film. For a start, it is not feature length, also, it is not shot on film. More importantly, it does not have what feature films have these days: star actors, special effects, exotic locations, explosions. Instead, seeing B.W.P. is seeing something else that a cinema can be: a place where people can share an intimate experience created by a few people on a tight budget. I would be glad of its success if only for that reason.

The first section of the film appears at first to be amateurish and slow. In fact, it is very deft, and very efficient at what it does. It tells the audience everything it needs to know about the characters and situation, and nothing more. Also, it gets the audience into the habit of viewing the film's format: alternating between black and white (very grainy and poorly focussed) film, and the washed out colours of shaky pixilated video. The film makers managed to set up a rationale for why the film is so cheaply made. Three people hike into the woods for a few days to shoot a documentary, with borrowed equipment, and are in the habit of videoing everything for the hell of it. They cannot carry tripods, steadicams, dollies, large lighting rigs, or the like, so everything we see is lit either by raw daylight, or by a single light fixed to the camera, which illuminates just what is within a few feet of the lens. The film creates its own excuse to be cheap. This is intelligent.

The acting and script are both excellent. The well-cast actors are presumably playing pretty-much themselves, and are convincingly naturalistic, and neither too likeable or too dislikeable. The slow route into hysteria is well documented. Rather than simply having a character say ""We're lost!"", we see many scenes which show the trio getting more and more hopelessly lost, and more annoyed with each other for this. By the time they are thoroughly lost, the audience shares the despair.

My friend and I, after seeing it, both felt a little sick. I put this down to my having been tense for a hour, he put it down more to motion sickness. The jerky, badly-framed camerawork is hard on the eye and stomach, but I applaud the director for its uncompromising use. Similarly, no compromise is made with the dialogue. Some of it is very quiet and must be listened for, some is technical jargon, which is left realisticly unexplained.

One of the great strengths and weaknesses of the film is the editing. It is good in that it does much to heighten the tension, with many key moments lasting just a little too long for comfort. Each time the characters find something nasty, the viewer is made to want the editor to cut soon to the next scene, and the fact that he doesn't adds to the sense of being trapped, as the characters are. The problem with this, though, is that one is left wondering about the motives of the fictional editor. In truth, of course, the film is edited to create these effects, and to entertain, but the film's rationale is that these are the rushes of a documentary put together posthumously by someone other than the film's original creator. Why, then, would an editor piecing together such footage, edit for dramatic effect rather than for clarity? Why would he keep cutting back and forth from the video footage to the film footage, when neither shows any more information than the other?

The film is stark. After one simple caption at the start, all that follows is the ""rushes"". I wonder if the film might not have been improved with an introductory section which documented how the rushes were found and edited. A programme was made for television which did this. Perhaps a portion of this might have been added to the film, making it more complete, and more believable (and proper feature length).

While I applaud the fact that young original film-makers have managed to create a mainstream hit out of a simple idea, well-handled. I dread the possible avalanche of inferior copies which may come.

Most horror films these days are created not for the audience, but for the makers. The departments of special effects, make-up, model-making, animation and so forth all try hard to show potential future employers what they can do. The result is that nothing is left for the audience to do, since everything can be seen and heard, and the viewer's imagination can be switched off. Today, it is possible to see pigs fly on the screen, and so film-makers show off and show us a formation of Tamworths, which is something which will look impressive in the trailer. To show us less is to make our minds fill in the gaps. This way, we create our own terrors, perfectly fitted to ourselves. The ghastly face I see in my head, is the ghastly head which I find scary. The ghastly face I am shown may be one I can cope with quite easily. If I see a believable character screaming in hysterical fear at something I cannot see, my own brain creates demons for my night's dreams, demons far more mighty than anything CGI graphics or a latex mask could portray.

This film will stay in your thoughts for some while.",NA
"parkerposeytso","You had to see when it came out","4 December 2021","If you were not able to go see this movie in 1999 in the theaters when it first came out you cannot understand the HYPE for this movie, they had released ""documentaries"" about this prior to everyone seeing this film, so when I went and saw this for the first time it was made to believe this was actually found film footage, I know now it's fake now but back then when the internet was young people believed this was found footage, I could not get anyone back then to go with me (too scared) so I went by myself, I will never forget how scared I was and still makes me love this film because of that fact.","10"
"Leofwine_draca","A film that turned me into a nervous wreck","21 December 2015","On a Sunday morning in 1999 I made a rare venture to a multiplex cinema, which is 17 or so miles away from my house. I don't usually make a habit of travelling that sort of distance to see a mere film, but I felt that this one in particular was special. I mean, nobody on the face of this planet can fail to have heard of THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT, a low budget independent production which took Hollywood by storm and became the most profitable film of all time. My expectations were high, based on the hype. Then it began...

I remembered hearing that the dizzying camera work could induce nausea, but happily I was not afflicted in this way. The shaky hand-held camera didn't annoy me in the least, and in fact within just a few minutes I was settled into the film, engrossed. As time went on, my nerves began to fray along with those of the guys on screen, and my heart beat faster. By the end of the film I might have well as been a nervous wreck. Because, more than any other film I've seen in my life, this film scared me. Yes, it was creepy and extremely disturbing too, but mainly it was just scary.

Now I've read all the negative comments about the film simply not being scary. I can understand this, because for one to be truly affected by the film then you have to make an effort to engross yourself in the events, to believe that they are real, to not get distracted by the person sitting next to you. It's easy to sit back and laugh, but it's hard to actually get into a film and be there with the characters. Thankfully I did this and I had one of the scariest experiences of my life, an experience which left me scared to go to sleep that night in case I dreamt about it (I didn't, though, thankfully).

The inventive use of the hand-held cameras really makes the viewer feel as if he/she is there in the film. Well, not totally perhaps, but halfway between reality and the celluloid strip. While the film may not be totally original (take, for example, the previous year's THE LAST BROADCAST), in the light of contemporary dull 'post-modern' horror films like SCREAM 2, HALLOWEEN H20 and THE FACULTY, this is a breath of fresh air. I've heard people moan and complain that nothing happens and you don't get to see anything. Well, that's the point...it's left up to your imagination, and I suppose that if you don't have one, then the film just won't scare you. It's the viewer who's lacking, not the film.

The acting is surprisingly brilliant and realistic. You really get to feel for the actors by the end of the film, and each of the three is a solid, well-drawn person who could be a neighbour. Michael Williams is the most likable of the three, he loses his cool first but then regains it at the end. Joshua Leonard is the most tragic of the three as he sits and cries, and you really feel sorry for his character. Many people have said they didn't like Heather Donahue, but I thought she was amazing. The best bit has to be when she holds the camera up to her face and apologises to the trio's parents. Heather is believable, sympathetic, and her performance really tugs at the heart. The film may have a high level of swearing, but then again I'm sure if I was in that situation I wouldn't mind my language. The trio are simply superb and their acting creates believable characters to sympathise with and understand throughout.

The woods are a perfect setting to conjure up fear (see THE EVIL DEAD and many others) and this film makes full use of them. Behind every tree lurks an unseen menace. I've been in the woods myself at night, and the atmosphere is just right. I don't know if I'll be able to venture into them again in the dark, though. There are also some surprisingly intense moments when the students fight amongst each other, some say that these are funny but they actually brought tears to my eyes...not because I was sad, but just because of the ferocity and violence and because I felt so sorry for the three.

The actual horror elements in the film are outstanding, subtle and all the more effective for it. The piles of stones and stick men hanging in the trees are very disturbing, as is the slime covering the backpack. The worst of all has to be the teeth and things wrapped in the cloth, a moment which is hard to watch. The night time scenes are the most chilling, with the unknown noises and even the - shudder - sound of cackling and a baby crying. So creepy, and so frightening. The bit where the tent is violently attacked from the outside comes out of nowhere, and made me jump out of my seat in terror, it's that horrible. And of course the finale in the ruined house is just totally eerie with the laughing and the jolting, disorientating cameras spinning around in a last desperate rush. The final frames of the film are the most inexplicable and unnatural and leave the viewer pondering events well after the film is over to draw their own conclusions.

As you might just be able to tell, I loved THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT which easily lived up to the hype in my opinion. I'll be sure to buy the video when it comes out. Unmissable, a classic, I can't praise this film enough. The scariest thing I have ever seen!","10"
"deadkerouac","Generation Xers head into woods; we view excellent results","17 July 2000","I saw this film last night, LONG after all the hype and reviews were made about it. I settled in with the right mood for any film: no expectations. If you expect too much, you may be let down (take note for any Kubrick film). I watched the entire film without interruption and came out with a great feeling. ""The Blair Witch Project"" is one darn good movie.

Many critics and moviegoers complained about the film for its length, its amateurish photography/editing, and its lack of adequate acting. I feel these things MADE THE MOVIE. First, the film has to be at most ninety minutes long: any more, and it would be too long and boring. Second, the amateur video take gives the audience the feel that they are actually in the woods, listening to the rippling water of the creek, snapping branches under their boots, and hearing things go bump in the night. I greatly admire the use of two video cameras (one black-and-white, the other color) to denote which character is shooting the film. Lastly, the incessant screaming of whiny Heather, the constant complaining of average-joe Mike, and the Dudley-Do-Rightness of Josh make for great acting. Yes, these are regular people and up-and-coming actors from your local community theater, but YOU KNOW THEM. You've met people like them.

The biggest complaint, however, comes from the film's supposed ""lack"" of scary moments. This film reminds me of the classic horror film ""The Texas Chain Saw Massacre,"" and though not as gory and as shocking as that film, ""The Blair Witch Project"" shows just enough fright in the group's search for a way out of the woods, stalked by people and/or things they may never understand. In the older film, the long interval between opening credits and first gory act of violence is about thirty minutes long; it is even longer here, but the suspense/fright (just as in the older film) begins right from the opening credits: you just don't see it until the film's over. These are three people out to make a documentary in the woods with handheld camcorders--these are REAL PEOPLE. And GREAT ACTORS. Heather whines a lot and screams and reminds you of the girl you hate so much you fall in love with her. Her screams sound real, her cries are genuine, and she is DEEPLY DEEPLY sorry for bringing the others into the woods in order to film her documentary.

I really dig the beginning. It seems so real to me I may delve into my old home movies for nostalgia. Heather and Josh pick up Mike, then go to the store for supplies. This opening sequence really packs a punch. These are three Generation Xers out for a camping trip. We all know what happens to them, but we're glued to the screen, intent to know what actually happens.

The interviews give us some detail into the Blair Witch legend, but most of the audience is too busy thinking about the actual trek into the woods that they don't listen. This is wrong. Listening is good. The interviews, which also sound real and not rehearsed in any way, are like movie reviews: the critics tell you what they saw, but mostly they don't want to ruin it for you...unless they hated it.

And that's what I'll do. I won't ruin it for you. 8/10.","8"
"great_sphinx_42","An Experiment In Fear","1 May 2001","Hmm. Wow. What is there left to say? I've waited for most of the hype to die down to even add my comments for this movie to IMDB, and here they are:

This is really a movie that has polarized a lot of people. Many love it and consider it the best thing since sliced bread, and plenty more absolutely hate it and call it tripe, drivel, awful, wretched, the worst ever, etc. (NOTE: as far as I'm concerned, the opinions of anyone calling any movie the best- or even more especially, the worst- movie ever are to be immediately disregarded.) Highly innovative in its way, it spawned many parodies and an interesting but inferior sort-of sequel. In the summer of Star Wars: Episode 1, this was the movie that originated several cultural symbols.

I saw this movie shortly after it opened in wide release. Sitting in a theater surrounded by my friends with popcorn in my lap and watching Mike and Heather run around some creepy old house, I felt for the first and last time in my adult life *real, creeping fear* when I myself was not in danger.

Many have complained about the shaky-cam, the cussing, how nothing 'really happens', and that it's not scary. By and large, the camera is not *that* shaky, at least to the point where you can't understand why- they're tromping through the woods and they're scared half to death. I must not get queasy very easily, as I had no problem with it. As for the cussing- the lines were ad-libbed, the actors are college-age, and all three sound exactly like every American college student I've ever known. So maybe people have a problem with young peoples' language, but what else is new? That's not a flaw of the movie- it's realism and part of why so many more young people found TBWP scary.

I think at least some of the dissention in opinions is caused by generational and cultural differences. My mother's friends told me it wasn't scary, but that 'Psycho' terrified them. 'Psycho', while interesting and a classic, is not the least bit scary to me. 'The Excorcist' has only a couple scenes that I find frightening, but my mom breaks out in goosebumps at the mere mention of it. The scariest thing I ever saw until I watched this movie was a reel in a collection of horror shorts: a woman walks into her house carrying groceries, drops her keys down her heating vent, bends down to try to get them, and something grabs her scarf. She struggles, but within a minute or two, she's drug down and strangled. The scarf goes slack, the woman is lying dead on her floor, and that's it.

TBWP is about what you *can't see*, about how your fear of the unknown is so much worse than what the unknown could probably ever be. The characters were not even necessarily likable, but they were *familiar*- Heather is the girl I sit next to in film class who thinks she has all the answers. Their mundane existence, captured in the beginning of the film, roots them in reality. What happens to them is terrifying because they are so every day, so interchangable with millions of other college kids. And, finally, you never know whether the Witch exists or not. Everything that happens can be explained away by coincidence, pranksters, bats, hunger, exhaustion and imaginations run wild with fear- or you can choose not to explain them away.

Young Americans are not scared of much- school shootings can roll off us like water, the evil human beings inflict on each other is run-of-the-mill 6 o'clock news, we are raised in a culture that claims to worship a vengeful, elitist god while almost everyone is hypocritical and uses the power of spirituality as a way to abuse others. We are in information overload from birth. What we fear is not knowing. And in the Black Hills Woods of Maryland, just beyond the flashlight's reach, something is making strange and terrible noises- but we don't know what it is.","9"
"Xophianic","Not ""scary as hell"", but still good","6 February 2000","I've never seen the tide turn on movie reviews before like I did in THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT. First, I heard this movie was the scariest movie since THE EXORCIST, then I heard it was the worst movie of the year. When people thought it might be real, they loved it. Then, when everyone found out it was fake, I heard all sorts of bad things about it.

THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT is about three young filmmakers, Heather Donahue, Michael Williams and Josh Leonard (actors with same names as their characters), go out into the woods of Burkittesville, Maryland to do a documentary on the mythical Blair Witch. They are never found, but a year later their footage is discovered, and it seems to indicate that there really was a witch and it was stalking these three filmmakers.

I did not find THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT especially scary, although it was rather spooky. I did think it was good, with an excellent and very original plot. The acting in this movie by the three young kids was very good, especially if the rumors about how they improvised most of it were true. The character development was well done, and you will often find yourself waiting for daylight along with the characters.

Was this movie overhyped? A little, but I think if it wasn't that it wouldn't have been as successful, since the actors, writers and directors are relatively unknown. They did a very good job and I hope to see more works from them in the near future.

Sure, some of the realism could've been better. Even I knew that they should've followed the stream out of the woods instead of going deeper into the forest. And if this was happening to me, I doubt I'd pick up the video camera and tape it all instead of running like hell. But it still worked. I think the scariest part is how you don't see as much as you hear, because often the sound is 10 times worse than the thing making the sound.

This movie isn't too scary, but if you watch it in the middle of the night with all your lights off and alone, it will successfully freak you out. It's worth a rent or a buy, judge for yourself.","9"
"filipemanuelneto","One of the smartest and most excellently shot horror movies where what we don't see is what really makes us afraid.","20 April 2022","I was too young to be able to see this movie when it first hit theaters, but I saw it a few days ago at home, although it's obviously not the same thing. Even so, I was really pleased with what I found. It's not an absolutely perfect film, there are some things there that I would change, if I were the director, but they are issues of such little importance that I feel that they do not detract from any merit or quality from the finished work.

The film was a quasi-experimental production, with a very low budget, with young and unknown actors. However, the quality is evident and is intelligently associated with the advertising campaign that was put together to sell it and make it profitable. In fact, this film is perhaps one of the best examples to show the importance and weight of publicity for the receptivity and commercial success of a film: even today there are people who believe that the story told in the film is real, that the Witch really existed, that those young people really disappeared...

The actors' work is impeccable. After reading a bit, I discovered the importance of the way the film was shot for the final result, with the actors alone, isolated in the woods, firmly believing in what they were doing and permanently in the characters. They lived the experience, and they believed in it. They weren't acting for us, they were acting for themselves and believing in their acting, giving the characters a real personality, worthy of our compassion and sympathy. This turns out to be something that holds and seduces us to a certain extent, leading us to wish that everything is true, although we do not wish any harm to any of the actors, of course. They are also responsible for all the shooting work, and their poor ability to shoot in 16 mm explains why the film has such shaky and amateurish cinematography, even though this is intentional and something that makes it more genuine in our eyes.

Stripped of expensive effects, great technical apparatus or other resources, the film bets everything on extremely basic but functional resources, and on an almost military discipline that prevailed throughout the eight days of shooting, in which the actors maintained minimal contact with a production that acted like a ""big brother"", attentive and watchful but invisible. Children's voices over loudspeakers, the strategic waving of the tent at the right moment, sticks that break without anyone seeing... simple but scary resources when you're alone, in the middle of a dark place, where anything can happen and no one will know. What is frightening about this film is not what we see, but the anticipation, the skillfully constructed tension, the almost certain prospect of a disaster that we don't know when it will happen. It is our imagination and our mind that frightens us, suggested by the film. And I don't see how terror can work more subtly and intelligently.","10"
"AlsExGal","Much better than its reputation","19 December 2009","It seems many people dislike this film because they think the entirety of its reputation lay in the confusion/publicity campaign generated at the time of its release as to whether it was a real film found in the woods of Maryland that documented the disappearance of three college students or whether it was just a movie. What made this film scary in 1999 and scary now is what you don't see and what you think you hear as well as the growing paranoia and fright of the college kids lost in the woods over a period of days that find - as they run out of food and supplies - that they are just wandering in circles.

The very last scene is particularly chilling, and if you already know how it ends it will kill some of the fright factor for you. However, this film just proved in 1999, as it still does, that you don't have to fill a horror film with wall-to-wall state-of-the-art CGI visual effects and shocking violence in order to be scary. I personally think the horror genre has been much worse off since Jason and his ilk first invaded the movies back in 1980 with graphic violence that is predictable and, quite frankly, boring. Although I like this movie, the sequel, ""Book of Shadows"", is just awful. Its makers Hollywoodized the original concept and thus made it completely incoherent and unwatchable. Avoid it at all costs.","7"
"mattysharpe-50266","Still to this day... DISTURBING & TERRIFYING","29 June 2022","Okay so I've watched this movie over and over and over again over the past 23 years, everytime it gives me the chill factor and no other 'found footage' movie has beaten it. The sequel 'book of shadows' was absolutely mortifyingly bad, 'Blair witch' meh, better but nowhere near as good. This is literally one of the best horror movies of all time in my opinion.

"blackheart","Sorry we couldn't supply the eye candy most of you are so used to.....","1 December 1999","I think I know why Blair Witch has generated as much negative as positive responses. It FORCES YOU TO BECOME INVOLVED IN THE MOVIE GOING EXPERIENCE!

Wow. What a concept. Instead of sitting there like the passive sponges most of us become when going to the movies we are actually expected be become involved. Take a leap of faith/belief or whatever and delve into this movie. Without the overpowering F/X and music score most movies rely on to 'scare' you, if you still have an imagination left what is implied becomes a hundred times scarier than anything offered up by Hollywood in the last 30 years. The hardest thing in movies is to scare you. Not make you jump out of your seat with 5000 watts of sound blasting at 400 decibels (ever seen the 1999 version of the Haunting? Event Horizon? - every potentially tense scene is preceeded by dead silence then the Blast). Wake up people! Blair Witch is the horror movies we have been needing for a long time and I'm glad someone finally had the guts to make it.","10"
"tedg","In the Corner","10 January 2002","Spoilers herein.

I was very impressed with this little film. I had stayed away because of the kiddie audience, but I found it intelligently conceived.

The first thing in film is to decide who the camera is. The gutsy thing is to make it a character, and the most straightforward way to do that is by POV shots from someone in the story. `Strange Days' has the best POV sequence I've seen. But these are hard to manage, and almost always used sparingly.

Horror, real horror should rely on something deeper than shock or disgust. Most strategies depend on creating a character (sometimes a situation) that is threatening. In this case, the scares in the theater are due to direct encounters with this character. But even then, that bugaboo is threatening the people on screen, not you.

In this gutsy move, the strategy is all focused on placing the viewer within the film. Every shot is POV, from either a 16mm camera or B/W video, often shooting each other. Rather brilliant conception, but from there one has a few big problems to solve.

The big one is how to handle the exposition. It may not be obvious in most films, but there are two completely independent jobs of the storyteller. The filmmaker is a clockmaker, creating a world, characters and situations within that world. Some collection of devices must be managed to tell or show us the viewers what this is all about. The other job is the real work: allowing the clock to work: the characters and situations developing in some engaging way.

The first part is no small matter in horror or its sibling, science fiction. Most clever approaches use visual shortcuts to refer to previous movies, but that's another story. Another approach is to adopt a world that we all know: from Potter or Ring books, or old TeeVee shows or comic books. What these folks do is a radical departure: they did all their exposition outside of the film, primarily on the web, but also with a TeeVee documentary on the documentary.

(If you like this notion of a created metadocumentary, check out the the mind-blowing `The Falls.')

Then, all the film has to do is reference that `myth' in a few, very well engineered `townspeople' interviews. We have one visual motif, the stick figures. One environmental reference, the stacked stones (and the `coffin' stone). And we have just one narrative device, and this is where the intelligence of the filmmakers impressed.

For all the time in the woods, essentially nothing happens. There's incidental friction; they encounter sticks and stones; one member vanishes; a puzzling `message' is delivered. But there's no narrative advance. Until the very, very, very end, when Heather goes in the basement and sees her friend in the corner. By this time, we have been groping to tie the `myth' to what we see. We are given this one touchstone to the myth, about one child being put in the corner while another is killed in presumably some gruesome way. That connection sears for only a second, then our eye goes blank. (That this was the video, not the film, is especially well conceived.) The whole narrative is collapsed into that one second that we see with our own eyes. Right there. We explain it, not anyone in the film. Scarey as all getout. Clever. Self-referential.",NA
"Goreripper","Not your average horror film","21 June 2000","A film which fell foul of its own publicity machine, `The Blair Witch Project' was abhorred and derided by the mainstream film-going public which it became unfortunately directed at due to its extraordinary and outlandish marketing campaign. `The Blair Witch Project' is not a typical film that the typical cinema-going public would normally be exposed to. The camera-work is jerky, the dialogue repetitive and inane and the action virtually non-existent. At times confusing, annoying, irritating and tedious, this film is nonetheless a brilliant piece of arthouse experimental film-making. This movie is virtually all style-there's hardly any plot, no real action, no semblance of a real script-and one that works on a deeper psychological level than the standard mainstream horror film. Indeed, only the very last image in the film is truly frightening, and only if it can be correlated to an incident at the very beginning. The rest of it only becomes scary afterwards, when the audience has had time to consider what they've seen. It is groundbreaking, manipulative cinema made without a script, with an amateur cast and with little or no post-production values. This is a remarkable film which can only really be appreciated, if the accompanying hype is overlooked, as a unique, avant-garde art film and not the regular Hollywood stock it was presented as to the public.",NA
"Don-102","Cinema Verite Fright...","25 October 1999","Is THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT a masterful ghost film or a gimmick to create a multi-media event? It is both. The picture, shot on super 8 video and 16mm film displayed in a squared, documentary-like frame, is quirky, annoying, and spectacularly scary. The scenes at night quite frankly scared the hell out of me. The gimmick that THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT is created confusion and wonder over whether or not the footage shot was real life. Now, we all know the truth, but the French term 'cinema verite' is defined by this grisly film.

A guaranteed cult classic, BLAIR WITCH has ""Heather, Mike, and Josh"" heading off into the allegedly hexed woods of Maryland looking for the Blair Witch or whatever else may exist up in those hills. For most of the film, it is very unclear. The beginning excerpts ingeniously set up the three participants to believe they are a) experiencing the supernatural, b) being played like a fiddle by the suspicious townspeople or c) just completely out of their minds. Its up to the viewer to decide but my money is on option A.

Most filmgoers know that the filmmakers Sanchez and Myrick used their MAC cards and cookie jars to put this phenom together and I commend them. This is a tour-de-force thriller that does indeed seem real. Its all improvised and 'verite' like and the best part about the movie's many chills are based on the basic premise that scares most of us: We are generally frightened by what we cannot see. Many times throughout the film, the screen is completely dark with sudden bursts of screams and grainy scenery. For the sake of the suspense, the film may have been better if we did not know the gimmick. The realism is sometimes smothering.

True, the hand-held camera can make you achy in the head, but the way the actors play off each other is magic and not for the faint of heart. I viewed the film on DVD with someone who was not feeling too well because of the dizzying camera, but somehow the black and white and color and rain blend together and allow Myrick and Sanchez to do what they were attempting to do. Spooking an audience with unseen forces is so effective and I was reminded of Robert Wise's original THE HAUNTING from 1963 with the groans and the cries and the shrieks. A baby's giggle can be heard during one spellbinding scene when the tent the 3 students sleep in takes on a life of its own.

Much has been made about a similar film made in similar fashion by some other young auteurs well before THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT was released. I never saw it and if it was as good as this film we would've seen it. Nonetheless, this past summer shocked and surprised me with the amount of good horror pictures around. In the woods, no one can hear you scream either.

"StanleyStrangelove","Blair Witch Scam Project - One of the worst films ever made","22 August 2005","*** This comment contains spoilers ***

As a fan of movies and horror films for 45 years, I've seen a lot, and I have to say that BWP is a totally amateurish piece of junk.

To call this a ""film"" is laughable. It has no plot, no ending, no story. It is the 90 minute rambling of some dunderhead carrying around a hand held camera filming everything he sees. This movie was made by loading some film, getting some nobodies together, going to the woods and shooting enough film to make up 90 minutes. No film was left on the cutting room floor. Every worthless scrap was included. The ineptitude and total lack of film-making skills is astounding. I used to think Robot Monster was the pits; BWP is worse.

Here is what happens in the ""film"". Three dimwits find a tape made by three nitwits who supposedly uncovered the Blair witch and were never seen again. The three dimwits head into the forest to investigate. Along the way they hear weird noises at night, find some sticks hanging from trees, get lost in the forest, start to cry because they are so scared. In the end one of the dimwits wanders into an abandoned shack and the last scene shows him trying to look scared into the camera. THE END. That's all folks. I'm not kidding. That's the movie.

In these times when anyone has access to equipment to make a movie, BWP proves the theory that any talent less person can make a ""film."" BWP was the biggest movie marketing SCAM in history. It proves P. T. Barnum's ""There's a sucker born every minute."" By using the internet to lie and hype the film, the cynical lug heads who made this suckered people in. As they say in the used car business, ""For every seat, there's an ass."" I was one of the asses who got suckered. Using the same ""based on a true story"" technique as The Amityville Horror, BWP lured well-intentioned moviegoers into the theater. If BWP were a car then it would be subject to a ""lemon law"" and you could get your money back. Unfortunately, the movie business doesn't work that way. Those of us who lost our $$ on this scam have no recourse. The only recourse I have is to slam this piece of trash in this review, which I hope I have done. Why I detest BWP so much is because it was such a shameless scam that showed utter contempt for movie goers. This was not a film; it was just a mechanism to cheat people out of their money.

I would rather watch Robot Monster ten times than ever see BWP again.","1"
"kylopod","That was it?","26 October 2005","One time as I entered a theater the usher was handing out 3D glasses for a short demonstration before the main film. After the previews finished and we were instructed to put the glasses on, there was a brief shot of a virtual theater in 3D, then it ended! Several members of the audience, including me, said in unison, ""That was it?""

That more or less describes my feelings about ""The Blair Witch Project."" When it first came out in the summer of '99, a fellow told me that it was the scariest film he'd ever seen. That's what many critics had indicated as well. Since I love being scared, I eagerly went to the theater, thinking I was in for the experience of a lifetime.

The movie tells the story of three college kids who do a research assignment, go on a long camping trip into the woods, and ultimately lose their way. As I watched the kids grow increasingly panicky and finally get separated, my interest began to perk...and then the movie just ended! I sat there in confusion. That was it? Where was the fear that everyone spoke about?

My complaint is not that the film lacked violence. On the contrary, I'm genuinely tired of the sort of horror film where explicit gore substitutes for true terror. I believe that the most effective horror movies leave a lot to the imagination. Shortly after seeing ""The Blair Witch Project,"" I saw ""The Sixth Sense,"" which scared the pants off me without containing much explicit violence. A movie does not need violence in order to be scary, and, indeed, too much violence can detract from a movie's suspense. But one thing a good horror movie absolutely must do is establish a real threat, something that ""The Blair Witch Project"" does not do.

In the early scenes, I was unable to make sense out of the local legends the kids were investigating. The stories that the residents tell are unconvincing and contradictory. One resident talks about seeing a ""white misty thing,"" another describes what he saw as ""an old woman whose feet never touched the ground."" This is the kind of naiveté associated with popular folklore like the Loch Ness Monster, and I could not connect any of it with the movie's later events.

While we are told that the kids were never found, the footage presents no clear-cut evidence that anything actually happens in the woods, other than that the kids get lost. In one scene, Heather begins screaming frantically at something she finds in a pile of leaves. I later found out that she was supposed to have seen severed human parts, but that was far from clear to me. Fans somehow piece together the various sections of the film and concoct a coherent story of supernatural murder, but to me it looked more like a case of hysteria than an encounter with a Blair Witch.

Despite my criticisms, this isn't a bad film. As a fake documentary, it is well-made. The kids look, talk, and act like real college students. While not scary, the film is far from boring. I enjoyed watching the story progress while giving the appearance of being something spontaneous.

Curiously, the Razzie awards nominated both this film and Heather Donahue's performance as the worst of 1999, one of the few times I've disagreed with their selections. We tend to overlook how hard it is for actors to act like they're not acting. People who argue that Donahue's performance was over-the-top have never, I suspect, seen someone panic. There was not a moment in the film that felt wrong or fake to me. Perhaps the reason I didn't get scared is that I felt smarter than these characters, who behave in ways that I do not think I would have behaved in the same situation. But I still found their reactions plausible.

If I was disappointed, it was only because the hype surrounding this film gave me a certain set of expectations, which failed to solidify. This movie was an early demonstration of the power of the Internet, a cheap $20,000 production that never would have attained so much popularity if not for a website that helped propagate the legend to the public as something real. It was more than just a film: it was an act of showmanship. This all amounted to an interesting demonstration, but not the sort of film I expect will endure.","6"
"rrichr","War of the Woods","3 February 2003","CONTAINS SPOILERS In Berkeley, The Blair Witch Project generated a lot of a certain type of buzz that will often make me wary and I avoided seeing it during its first run, suspecting that I'd feel the rip of an eight-dollar ticket. After having screened a VHS copy acquired at Yard Sale Videos, I still feel that way a little but not because I didn't like it. Seeing it in a theater would have precluded being able to really watch a film like this the way I prefer to do.

I had to stretch a bit to get past some aspects of the film's setup. The self-filmed documentary approach can't quite carry the movie's weight through its entire length. Some sequences could not have been filmed by any of the protagonists, as was the implication, yet there they were. No one among the three `film makers' could have managed the presence of mind, in the midst deep panic, to have filmed Heather running screaming through the dark woods. It was all too far out of pre-established character, although the image is certainly indelible. But even a Dodge Dart with a brown door will get you there if it keeps running and once past my initial hesitations, I was forced to admit that The Blair Witch Project is.very effective.

There are moments when Blair Witch has the dankness of Silence of The Lambs and the raw, twilit scariness of the opening few minutes of Night of the Living Dead, in my opinion one of the great horror sequences. I became a true believer at the point where Josh and Mike began to realize that something was very wrong in the crackling Burkittsville woods, that they really had to get out, and were ramping up to full freak while Heather simply refused to stop filming although there was really nothing to film. This sequence nailed perfectly the deep frustration one can feel under the sway of a relentless know-it-all, especially when said person is female and, thereby, largely immune to the more primordial forms of conversation reserved for males. Josh and Mike, aggravated and frightened as they were, still could not abandon Heather, who had become more of a liability at that point than an asset. Both had begun to succumb to the stress of walking the razor edge between being scared squat-less and being unable to admit it.

The Blair Witch Project has an unassuming, almost sneaky way of getting to you. First off, the main characters are not at all likeable, which in itself is fatiguing. Josh and Mike are types that might be found at loose ends on any Saturday night, marooned in a mall or mini-mart parking lot. Heather is an almost-cute, soon-to-be-overweight, classic candidate for domestic violence at the hands of a future husband or boyfriend equipped with no sense of humor, or of the ironic. A few minutes with them and you are more than ready to burn out from slogging the monotonous autumn woods where night, freed from the shackles of Daylight Savings Time, comes too soon and remains too long. When the exhausted trio takes to its sleeping bags, you're right with them. Then, you're suddenly wide awake for all the wrong reasons. The sound of fracturing wood, out past a wall of darkness on which strong flashlight beams pile up like pizza dough, are not just twigs being snapped. They're branches, big ones. But this conclusion is never verbalized by any of the trio. One of the three refers to the sound as `footsteps' but only if the feet are size-72 American. It's left up to us to fully grasp the implications.

The three principal actors are, essentially, playing themselves and all perfectly manifest the giddy hubris reserved for those who may be able to come fifteen times a day but possess just enough knowledge and experience to be dangerous. But playing one's self may be harder than it looks and they do so with conviction, most notably the tough-minded, endlessly irritating Heather. Her character may be packing the only real cojones in the bunch and when she finally begins to unglue near the end, you know the doo-doo has gotten very deep. It's not mere post-adolescent, cheeseburger-craving discomfort any longer. That trifle has been left far behind; somewhere back under the decaying leaves. Heather's runny-nosed, video self-portrait, made upon realizing that she and her companions are in far, far over their heads, is truly poignant. We may enjoy seeing vain, clueless teens get theirs in slasher movies but the Blair Witch trio; three somewhat loosely-wrapped goofballs trying to pull off a film-making project, are really not clueless in the classic sense nor are they stupid. They've just intrepidly placed themselves in a very wrong place for which there may be no possible right time.

And finally the ending, which is really what this film is all about. Almost everything you ever feared in your youth, both in the light of day and dark of night, is compressed perfectly into the film's last few seconds. When the evil suggested throughout finally thunders down like stagnant water through a breached dam, the result is possibly the most viscerally disturbing horror sequence ever produced. All exploding skulls, bursting rib cages, and dangling intestines ever filmed are mere confetti alongside its simple, implicit power. Only the discovery of the maternal corpse in the basement, in Psycho, even comes close. Keep the little ones away from this one, Mom and Dad. A child's mind will have no defense, nowhere to run, and most disturbing, nothing tangible to run from; only an invisible, meticulously goal-oriented malevolence that comes from nowhere, and everywhere, at once.",NA
"concrndone","Masterclass in horror","23 June 2021","Surprised by the 6.5 score. Saw this twice at the cinema when it came out. First time absolutely terrified me.

Watching it in 2021, I'm surprised to report I find it just as chilling. It's the primal screams. The not knowing what's going on. Being persecuted for no good reason. The pleasure gained by some from the pain of others. The slow descent into despair and near lunacy. The verisimilitude that the cheapness of the production lends to it.

It's good old-fashioned psychological horror with not a jump scare in sight and only the merest use of gore. Low budget always suits horror better when done well.","10"
"pooch-8","Don't close your eyes -- Elly Kedward will get you.","27 July 1999","It is to the ""Blair Witch"" filmmakers' (and I am talking about Myrick and Sanchez, not Donahue, Leonard, and Williams) great credit that for the most part, they get away with the central conceit that three tired, hungry, lost, and above all, frightened-out-of-their-minds documentarians would still keep rolling footage under the dire circumstances in which they find themselves -- for that is one of the movie's only shortcomings (even though the majority of the audience won't notice or won't mind). The Project's plus column, however, is far longer than the minus one, as the very fabric of the improvisational techniques employed holds together an authenticity virtually guaranteed to send shivers down the backs of all but the most road-hardened horror vets. The interplay among Donahue, Leonard, and Williams is refreshingly funny in the early stages, which only ratchets up the intensity when doom seems to be knocking (or howling or scratching or leaving creepy tokens outside the campers' tent). The Blair Witch Project has all of the necessary sequences to assure its cult status (I love the stick figures) and the mysterious, dread-filled ending will most certainly set fans arguing -- once they catch their breath.",NA
"zombie65","Inventive and terrifying. Will spawn many imitations.","19 July 1999","With all the hype surrounding this new independent horror film, you might think it would be hard for it to live up to expectations. The Blair Witch Project is probably as scary as it's reputation. Feel free to read on, I do not intend to give away any of the film's secrets or surprises. The less you know about this creepy little chiller, the better.

Filmed on video and 16mm black & white, this film is exactly what the horror genre needs in a time reminiscent of the early 1980s slasher onslaught. The Blair Witch Project has no knife wielding maniacs, no DNA altered monsters, and no real bloodshed onscreen. We see what the three film makers see as they make their way through the deep, dank woods in search of a legendary witch. There are times when there is nothing but a black screen, and all we can do is listen to their scared voices and the unexplained noises going on around them. The true horror behind this film is the unknown, and those dark places where you know something is lurking.

If you are a seasoned veteran of the horror cinema, The Blair Witch Project may be less frightening than for someone who has not seen many scary movies. You will have to respect it's originality, and it's manipulation of our deepest fears. At times the film really makes you feel the sense of dread the film makers are experiencing. One thing I did notice about the audience in the theater is that everyone was very quiet. Except for an occasional gasp, the moviegoers were absorbed in this film. That's unusual for a modern horror movie. Most are full of fake scare tactics and multiple twist endings that keep the audience shouting and screaming at the screen. One thing for sure, you can expect many imitations of The Blair Witch Project in the future. Isn't that how it usually goes?","10"
"BA_Harrison","Please excuse my incoherent ramblings: I was up late last night watching an over-rated horror film.","2 August 2010","I had always thought that arachnophobia—the fear of spiders—was the most common of phobias, but thanks to The Blair Witch Project, I now know better: the irrational fear of small twigs and pebbles is far more prevalent. It's the only explanation I have for the phenomenal worldwide success of a horror film in which stick figures and tiny piles of stones are considered to be the stuff of nightmares?

Whilst I am, of course, fully aware that big sticks and stones can break your bones (as the childhood saying goes), inanimate small pieces of rock and the lesser of branches hold no real fear for me. As a result, I didn't find The Blair Witch Project anywhere near as frightening as the millions who are afflicted by Stickstonophobia (surprisingly, I could find no official scientific term for this widespread condition, so I coined this one myself!).

Admittedly, I did find some of the strange noises that occurred during the night fairly creepy (after all, they might have been made by big spiders), and the way that the film-makers were unable to find their way back to their car was unsettling (I've lost my bearings in the woods myself, and this brought back bad memories), but the ending—when Heather and Mike enter the dilapidated old house at the end of the film—was simply frustrating: surely everyone knows that derelict houses are deathtraps.

Sure enough, both characters lose their footing on the obviously rotten floors and die. Or something like that.","5"
"Hitchcoc","I really wanted to enjoy it!!!!","24 January 2000","Well, here we are in this woods (which doesn't seem to have a lot of trees; it looks more like a city park). But we have wandered in far enough to get ourselves turned around. That's cool. We are already spooked by the legends and our minds are playing games with us. One of our problems is that we are all so self centered (nineties kinds of people) that we don't listen. We whine, we complain, we don't think. We film everything creatively but we also have a really stupid streak. I thought the actors were very good. It's what they portrayed that bothered me. Wouldn't it be good to have a look at what was going on outside the tent at night. It could have been a fringe group of the Girl Scouts. Why was it categorically accepted that a fire should not be set. If the witch is out there, then wouldn't you want to see it, or at least let it get itself singed. Hey, you're in a tent. What could be more unprotected (we all know the stories about grizzley bears that treat small tents as doggy bags). Hey, maybe we could put someone at the door and let the others sleep!!! Why do we start running? Where are we going? There's nothing chasing us. The power of suggestion takes over a little quickly here. Why go into that house? Why try to find that guy? I mean, your first order of business is to find a way back. I felt for them and I thought the frantic camera work was interesting. I just couldn't get past the stupidity of the people and their lack of survival instincts and self protectiveness. I agree that experimental cinema is wonderful and I'm glad that this has done well. Hollywood gets pretty tiresome. But this movie didn't click with me.","6"

Anyone who thinks this movie is scary has lived a sheltered life, indeed.

Those who gave this dreck anything higher than a ""5"" probably bought pet rocks when they were on the market.

This flick will go down in history as another ""Billy Jack."" (Remember it was getting high ratings for the first few years.)

"pmtelefon","Often imitated, never equaled","9 August 2020","I didn't see ""The Blair Witch Project"" in the theater. It's one of my movie regrets. I can only imagine how scary it must have been in the theater with an audience on the edge on their seats. It's scary enough in the living room. Somehow, with no budget to speak of, writers/directors/editors Daniel Myrick and Eduardo Sanchez and company created a horror masterpiece. I don't want to sound like a movie snob but I do think that the more you know about filmmaking the more you appreciate what was accomplished with in this movie. No matter how many times I see this movie it still takes me a couple of days to shake off the last ten minutes. ""The Blair Witch Project"" is a horror classic. (I remember one of my brothers complaining that he never got to see the witch. I told me that he just didn't get it and he should go watch the first three quarters of ""Jaws"" and learn something.)","10"
"strong-122-478885","These 3 Film Students Were The Ultimate Flunkies","14 June 2014","I'd confidently say that this film has got to be one of the biggest movie-swindles ever perpetrated on a completely unsuspecting audience.

With a devilishly clever publicity campaign to fuel its release, The Blair Witch Project (TBWP, for short) became the 2nd most successful ""indie"" film of all time, grossing nearly $250 million. Its success was surpassed in 2002 by My Big Fat Greek Wedding.

Directed by Eduardo Sanchez, TBWP is presented as a documentary pieced together from amateur footage and filmed in real time. TBWP was shot in a matter of just 8 days and all of the dialogue was, pretty much, improvised.

TBWP tells the tale of 3 young Film Students who hike out into the Black Hills near Burkittsville, Maryland to film a documentary about a local legend known as The Blair Witch.

The viewer is told that these 3 students were never found, although their video and sound equipment (along with the footage they shot) was discovered a year later.

In my opinion, TBWP completely fails to deliver on all counts.

*Trivia Note* - Throughout the course of the story the word ""Fukk"" was spoken 154 times. With this film having a running time of 87 minutes, that averages out to about one ""Fukk"" every 45 seconds.","2"
"Zac_La_Porte","Cheap, but Terrifying","19 June 2021","This ""found-footage"" horror film is what pure terror truly is, which doesn't rely on cheap gore for scares and increases tension as the film plays. It's also based on the performances of the excellent cast, who each personate realistic fear within their characters and are frequently panicking in the terrifying circumstances.

The biggest thing about The Blair Witch Project is there's no violence at all. Unlike most horror movies today, there's absolutely no violence, and the film still manages you leave you frightened. It's way too scary to even view it without any company. Due to the level of terror, which is promoted by the remarkable acting, it's hard to avoid saying that this film is one of the best horror movies of all time.

The filming techniques are also brilliant! The stylish footage-quality used within the full 80 minute duration adds to the petrifying effect, along with an original storyline produced into a quick and entertaining runtime. The Blair Witch Project is a suspenseful horror sensation for teens and up, even more unsettling watching in silent darkness, but can be too scary for anyone.

"TheFinalAlias","If only negative ratings were possible.....","20 April 2009","As anyone who has read my reviews for any length of time knows, I don't kiss ass when it comes to independent films. If it's a good film; I rate it accordingly, if it's a bad film; I do likewise.

However....

It's become one of my pet peeves that indie film fans demand that EVERY independent film be called nothing short of a masterpiece no matter how mundane it is, no compromise. It's this mentality that has resulted in my extreme dislike of indie films and their fans and filmmakers. Honestly; just because something was made without studio assistance and/or interference DOES NOT automatically make it a masterpiece, any more than having the hot new centerfold of-the-month makes the next Michael Bay film an Oscar contender. Yet, still the indie zombies insist that it does, supposedly this mentality comes from resenting Hollywood's excesses, such as taking away artistic control, bloated budgets, inattention to casting appropriate actors in favor of popular ones, and worst of all; annoying marketing campaigns. What BS.

Indie films are guilty of many hypocrisies; but attacking marketing campaigns is their biggest; as endless marketing hype(along with pure stupidity)is the only reason anyone would have seen this clunker I'm currently reviewing.

I can recall, quite vividly; the endless pop-up ads, the fan sites; official and(supposedly)unofficial, magazine articles, TV. specials, the merchandise, the relentless TV. commercials. Whew. The people who complain about the 'Dark Knight's marketing campaign just plain weren't ALIVE to not know the extent of this films marketing(which makes sense; since 99.9% of all the negative TDK reviews I've seen couldn't have been written by someone older than 5 or 8). TDK had NOTHING on this film's relentless marketing campaign.

Trashing Hollywood for over hyping their products, then doing the same: that's the definition of hypocrisy. That alone would be justification enough to dislike TBWP and it's indie film moron cult and to call them hypocritical and give the film a 1 rating, even if it was a good movie, even if I had liked it.

The fact that it also sucked as a film anyway just justifies my rating.

The common defense is that this is some brilliant 'art-film' which introduced the concept of not showing the monster and leaving it to the imagination. BS. Val Lewton did the same thing a thousand times better during the '40's, with films which are classics of the genre: 'Cat People', 'The Seventh Victim'. etc. and in 1963; probably the best of all 'unseen' horror films; Robert Wise(a disciple of Lewton)'s 'The Haunting' was released; to borrow an indie film fan phrase: it PWNED 'Blair Witch'. All classics, all achieving their suspense without showing the monster. All before this film.

But indie fans ignore all this; they claim those movies don't count because they are old and in black & white. Typical response from them, no respect for older film.

As for the 'story' of this film and it's qualities; I wouldn't even give it a D if it was a student film. The device of not showing the monster comes off less as an artistic choice and more an excuse to film nothing but a couple of dumb-asses running around and passing it off as a film. I'll admit it's clever, heck, even Lewton originally adopted the device out of necessity, but he did it mostly because he recognized it's dramatic potential in the face of several alternatives. For the record, it is also a complete and utter rip-off of a much better film called 'The Last Broadcast', the difference being that there is a survivor. Really, otherwise it's the same damn thing, and it's the indie film fans who call Hollywood unoriginal(If only I could use the eye-roll emoticon).

The story also sucks, 'Cannibal Holocaust' did the 'found footage' thing much better. The 'acting' is also awful; it's so forced you wonder if the witch is a legitimate legend even in the context of the story. The praise for characterization is true, though. I definitely felt something about the characters: I wanted all 3 of them dead within a minute. And even if, pray tell, the device of not showing the monster WAS original, or had been used well; does it REALLY matter if it's an awful film otherwise? Nope. At best, it just revives a long-dead gimmick.

And for all the people who say it must be good because so many people thought it was real, let me ask you something: Have you ever heard the phrase 'Idiots will believe anything'? Grow up and watch some atmospheric, 'unseen' horror films that are actually good. This is no different than your usual incredibly stupid, vapid Hollywood slasher flick with annoying teenage victims, only without a slasher and not made by Hollywood, but still incredibly stupid , vapid and filled with annoying teenage victims.~","1"

"pperot1-386-365016","One of the GREATEST horror movies, EVER.","6 August 2021","Maybe one of the greatest movies period, BWP is a cinematic masterpiece, easily in my top 10. If you have even the slightest bit of imagination, ignore the haters. 90 percent of those people were looking for your conventional horror movie: bs jump scares, gratuitous gore, and everything spelled out for them so they don't get the brain pain. I don't think that every indie film is great (far from it really). And I don't think a movie should get kudos just because it is original. But THIS indie film, and THIS original idea is just about perfect.

I would consider myself a huge horror movie fan, and I've seen A LOT. But few movies, if any, have legitimately terrified me like this one. I'm a grown man and I get chills when I think of Josh's agonizing cries distantly in the forest, the bundle of sticks with his teeth in them, and most of all Mike standing in the corner. Hell, even the piles of rocks surrounding their tent when they wake up is creepy. And THAT'S one of the reasons why this movie is so great. All the people saying ""where the hell was the witch?????"" are missing the point of this psychological gem. A witch and concrete answers would have ruined this; the beauty is in the ambiguity. YOU decide what happened. The movie gives you exactly the right amount of tools to do so.

If you still think this movie is lame, at least try your hardest to put yourself in their shoes. Just imagine being lost for days in alleged haunted woods. If that happened to you, that alone would be scary as hell. But then increasingly weird and unexplainable stuff keeps happening as you decend deeper and deeper into madness. The acting is actually terrific! Ok, I can see people getting annoyed at the high pitched irritating girl, and the up-nose crying shot is easily parodied. But everything they did was GENUINE. Hell, I'm not even that big of a fan of found footage movies, but this one actually almost makes you forget it's a movie.

Screw the marketing campaign and faux documentaries. Screw the legacy and impact on horror movies BWP has had, starting a new sub-genre. Having such an impact makes it imprortant, but not necessarily good. What makes it good is itself, alone, as just one movie that is 81 minutes of genius.

The ""actors"" seem to be talking off the cuff, the script- if there was one, lacked any imagination or anything clever to say. Movies that have parodied this crappy movie do a better job of conveying fear. I understand the premise, of course. Make the movie appear like a home movie where some young people encounter some weird and horrific experiences. The problem is, most vacation home movies are more compelling and clever. Whenever there was a hint of tension, the actor would swear or scream, for lack of anything better they could think of. This film experience was memorable to me and those who watched it with me, for one reason. It is easily the worst I have ever seen. It makes ""Freddie Got Fingered"" look like ""Gone With The Wind""- which is where ""Blair Witch project"" should go.","1"
"Chasuk","Most Over-hyped Movie I've Ever Seen","16 February 2001","I've seen worse movies, but not many. Yes, I like horror films. Yes, I can distinguish cheap, sensationalistic splatter-horror from from the more chilling, show-less-and-frighten-more variety (and I prefer the latter to the former).

I still hated Blair Witch. I don't lack imagination, but this movie certainly did. I've seen Tampax commercials that filled me with greater fear. The film lacked wit, style, story, plot, suspense, or verve. I don't need expensive cinematography or stellar acting, but a film does need something to redeem itself (other than a sophomoric, if marginally clever, idea), and this film did not have it.

It is unfortunate that a bad movie has come to represent to many the epitome of independent cinema. For a real horror masterpiece, see Ringu (The Ring), which, though it was probably filmed on a larger budget, worked because of talented direction and great storyline.",NA
"kate-911-98899","Amazing & creative","27 October 2015","Saw this when I was 14 when it came out and it literally scarred me for life. I remember it haunted me for the whole night after I saw it, and it took a LOT of maturity to be able to enjoy our family cabin again, especially at night.

I just watched it again as a31 year old woman, and it is still terrifying. It was weirdly nostalgic for me to see some of the scenes at the end-the bloody tongue, the kids running through the night, etc. heather's screams at the very end are absolutely bone chilling.

I think it's wonderfully creative. The gradual build up from the documentary intro was brilliant. Also, just remember with all the ""found footage"" horror now coming out, THIS was the first one. No one had ever seen anything like it. The ONLY thing that could've made it slightly better, and I really hate to say that bc I honestly loved it, is if they made the characters a little more sympathetic. Everything else was completely legit.

I think a lot of times people think they sound cool and smart bc they don't like something, and those people kinda suck.","10"

**** (out of 4)

The story is known by everyone as three filmmakers go into the wood to tell the story of the Blair Witch and soon they find themselves lost with something apparently coming for them. I remember the hype surrounding this film quite well and I remember my two viewings in the theater when the film originally opened. It's been about six years or more since I last watched the film so I was very curious going in as to how the film would hold up. After viewing the film I think it still holds up remarkably well and even though the hype has died down and much hates has been thrown upon the film, it still remains a rather chilling and all too realistic venture into basic fears. I think these basic fears can be the dark, being lost or hearing something when you shouldn't be hearing anything. These are three elements that make this film so effective because there isn't any blood, no monster, no killer and whatever is out there is something we never see. I think the greatness of the film, and something very important, is that the viewer is put into the action to where you can feel everything that the three filmmakers are going through. If you can imagine yourself lost in the woods then you should be able to know the fears going on with the filmmakers here. The movie does a marvelous job at various things but one is the start of the thing when we learn the history of the curse through the documentary set up. A perfect move. We hear from locals, various myths and then we slowly get put into the action. The set up wasn't original as the ""lost video footage"" was used in CANNIBAL HOLOCAUST nearly twenty years earlier but the effectiveness of this film is that it takes that lost footage and uses it again the viewer to assault their fears. The performances are all very raw but that makes them effective in terms of everything going on. The direction and use of two cameras is also very effective but the most chilling aspect of the film is without a doubt its ending. I won't spoil anything but the final shot before the hit still send chills down my spine no matter how many times I've seen the film. Over the years this film has found many critics to hate on it but this is something that happens with countless popular horror films, which is a real shame. In a day and age where we can see anything, it's refreshing to watch a movie like this that shows us absolutely nothing yet works on every level.",NA
"trumpman30","Waste of time..","17 April 2002","I spent about an hour and a half sitting around in my living room on halloween waiting for something...anything to happen. Just when I thought it was coming to the big climax at the end in the house, nothing happens....big surprise.

This movie is a complete waste of time..there is nothing scary about it unless you find filming shots of the woods, watching swearing teens, listening to a high pitched annoying girl voice (that was pretty scary), watching film from inside a tent with cheap sound effects playing outside, or watching a wobbly camera run through the woods at night (cant see anything), then you should skip this movie. If I was out in the middle of the woods, I too would decide to throw away my only way of finding my way around..my map. This movie had a weak, if any plot. This movie was one of the biggest let downs I have ever seen, and I've seen ""Batman and Robin.""

"jprice-38253","The Godfather of Found Footage Horror","26 November 2021","People gotta understand that you don't always have to see the thing or that creature or whatever it is that has to be seen on camera JUST to be scary. Those are literally most of the bad reviews lol. What people don't understand these days unfortunately, is that it's scarier when you can only feel or hear the presence of something, rather than seeing it. It completely leaves a viewer's imagination open into letting them envision something for themselves. And this is something The Blair Witch Project did very correctly. They didn't rush it. They didn't show the supposed ""witch"" on camera. They gave us a very chilling aspect to where us as an audience can only hear the terror of what is going on, hear the screams, hear what is happening, and our brain senses something obviously but we CAN'T see it. Only hear it. THAT is why this is so freaking creepy. It's kind of a shame many people bash and put this down so much. This film was literally what started the spread and the rise of the Found Footage Horror sub genre. And there's been a quite a few good found footage films that have been made the past decade or so. But for The Blair Witch Project, it'll always be in its very highest spot above all found footage movies. An eerie piece that doesn't make you look or see the horror, but only hear it....freaky....","10"
"preppy-3","Over-hyped","1 November 1999","This is a VERY low-budget horror film that was WAY over-hyped! It's about three college students who go into the woods for a weekend to see if the legend of the Blair Witch is real. They film themselves all weekend long. Then they get lost, run low on food and water and some REAL spooky things happen...

The moments when they're hearing noises and voices in the dark are VERY scary (especially somebody calling them from a distance). But that's it. There's nothing inventive plot wise, the characters are REAL annoying (Heather was particularly annoying--she never shut up!) and the camera-work made me seasick. Also all the horror in this is implied and never shown. There's nothing wrong with that but add that with the above ingredients and you got a very exasperating film. Basically I was never scared once...but I was bored a LOT!

Also what's all this hype about the ""incredible"" ending? The ending was telegraphed at least a half hour before it happened! I really don't like this film, but I think it's because of the nonstop hype on it. You might like it, but set your expectation on low.","1"
"SnoopyStyle","Birth of a sub-genre","4 October 2014","In October 1994, three film students Heather Donahue, Josh Leonard and Mike Williams (their real names) disappeared in the woods near Burkittsville, Maryland. A year later, their cameras are found. There is a local legend of The Blair Witch and missing children. They were there to do a documentary.

This is the granddaddy of the found footage movies. This could be scary if the audience buys into the film as real. I didn't and it's not scary for me. It's a little too shaky and rambling. I am reminded of Michael Moore talking about what a revelation the tripod is. Also the start is excruciatingly slow. It's an interesting idea that birthed a whole new genre. That's no easy task. However, it achieves very little more than that for me. It is more dizzying than frightening.","6"
"Nightman85","Its all about what you don't see....","10 January 2008","Smash-hit independent horror film made quite an impression on the audiences of 1999 for good reason.

Three student film makers go into the Maryland woods to make a documentary about a legendary witch. When they suddenly find themselves lost, they end-up becoming part of the legend themselves!

Clever film is played out as a 'real' occurrence from beginning to end and frankly many viewers at the time thought it was indeed real footage shot by real missing students! Of course, it isn't, but it still went down as a landmark film of the decade. Although many people have mixed feelings about this movie, it's a unique film that pays off chillingly well for horror fans.

This movie is all about mystery, atmosphere, and the unknown - all of which are themes that pay off well as the increasingly dark story unfolds. There's plenty of memorable moments to be had (the scene that pays homage to The Devil and Tom Walker is especially horrific) and it all builds to an intense climax that is truly eerie. The young stars (Donahue, Leonard, and Williams) are likable and sympathetic characters, even as their desperation drives them to anger and fear. The setting of the autumn wilderness is effectively unsettling, the old house used for the finale being particularly creepy.

While some people laugh it off, which is a shame, this fan enjoys this film for it's sheer simplistic brilliance. After all it's not only one of the biggest independent films ever but quite possibly the smartest horror film of the 90's. A solid winner that deserves more respect.

"basilisksamuk","Fear of twigs and string","3 March 2013","1 THE SCAM Apparently there is a very scary film called ""The Blair Witch Project"". It is famous for the fact that, although it was made very cheaply using hand held video cameras and the like, it is really, really scary. In fact so scary that it is best to make sure you are wearing your brown trousers before entering the cinema. I thought I was going to see this film but my local cinema tricked me by showing a crap film of the same name which was so badly made that no one else would have been fooled by it. Also it was clearly a fake version as it had zero scares in it. In fact it wasn't a horror film at all but a very bad film made by art students mistaking noise for art who couldn't scare my cat, Xena, who is frightened of anything containing atoms.

2 MY THEORY Urban youth in western countries no longer have any initiation rites or rites of passage. Very few of them even go camping anymore and most of them have little experience with things found in the natural world e.g. trees, leaves. Therefore the very idea of spending a night out in the woods fills them with existential dread and they find it easy to identify with the very unpleasant and very whiney stars of this film. Like the characters in the film they are terrified by the sight of a few twigs held together with bits of string or small mounds of rocks. It's sad I know but what other explanation could there be for fear engendered in some viewers of this film? For anyone who has ever spent a night out in the woods it will forever be a mystery why anyone should be prone to fear of twigs and rocks. All we can hope to do is reach out our hearts to those poor young folk living in daily dread of post traumatic twig disorder after seeing this film.

3 THE ART OF THE UNSEEN I've always thought that The Haunting (original B&W Robert Wise version) to be the scariest film of all time and will brook no argument. In the proper version of The Haunting the viewer never sees what the horrible thing(s) are that hang out in Hill House but nevertheless the lack of gore and the feverish workings of the viewer's imagination supplied all that was necessary to scare the s**t out of said viewer. Presumably the makers of Blair Witch had the same idea. They failed. Miserably.

4 THE ART OF NOISE Another superb feature of The Haunting was the dramatic use of sound to create a feeling of overwhelming terror. Had the Blair Witch makers attempted to engineer the soundtrack and sound effects more professionally I believe they could have turned a deeply s**t movie into one that was at least acceptably a bit prone to cause viewers to worry, a little. They didn't. Instead they opted for making the potentially scary noises inaudible and cranked up the sound of twigs rubbing together until they overpowered everything else on the soundtrack.

5 HOW TO COPE WITH SEEING THIS FILM You may or may not be familiar with my dictum that all modern films would benefit from having half an hour cut from their running length. In the case of Blair Witch the film would benefit from having about 75 minutes cut out of its approximately 90 minute running time. In fact, if you are unwise enough to see the entire film you will come out of the cinema convinced that the film ran for at least 17 or 18 hours. In the interests of sanity I advise you to watch until you get to the end of the vox pop scenes and then head smartly for the nearest bar. Have a few good stiff drinks and return to the auditorium to see the last five minutes of the film. This features scenes inside an old house which are accidentally quite good. Then go home and hug a twig.","1"
"andrewjerome","Bland Witch project","5 May 2011","After seeing the Bland Witch Project, now I can understand why so many people ran from the cinemas screaming...they wasted $10 for nothing! This fictional documentary within a pseudo-documentary form may be the most overrated, under-financed piece of film to come down the pike in a long time. Where is the suspense? Where is the involvement? Where is the identification? The spectacle of three film-student types traipsing off cluelessly into an unfamiliar forest with a reported history of gruesome violence is just plain stupid.

Why, because this film is so realistic, it looks like this is actually the footage found in Maryland. But no, it isn't, and that is what makes Eduardo Sanchez and Dan Myrick such good directors. They just give the cameras to the cast and let them run rampant. This film shows what happens when 3 student film-makers (Heather Donahue is excellent in the best female lead of the year, Michael Williams is convincing as a scarred and insane sound man, and Joshua Leonard is exceptional as a mad cameraman) who get lost in the woods of Burkittsville, Maryland.

"manalone923","The biggest marketing scam in movie history. Only people who get scared by OTHER people being scared will like this crap.","1 December 2003","This was a marketing scam that worked... plain and simple. And if you allow me the lengthy explanation, I hope you'll see legitamite reasons why I think it is an utter waste of time. If you don't want to read and either love BWP or instead want something that doesn't suck, go watch ""The Last Broadcast"". It's similar, came first, is better acted, and has an actual ending that makes sense.

The BWP began with a huge ad campaign, in the form of allegedly ""true"" documents and paranoia propaganda that took major advantage of the internet community. It got people out in droves to see what this thing really was. And what it was was an hour and a half of kids with a camera, walking in circles through the woods, working themselves into a paranoid frenzy while building to a climax (spoiler next) that literally delivers nothing.

(Spoiler end.) The premise, and what the online campaign hinted as being true, is this: A small town legend, the Blair Witch, is terrorizing a town and abducting children. Three stupid teens go into the woods armed with a camera and try to film / find evidence of this, and are never heard from again. Their videotape surfaces, and what is on it is mysterious.

Now here's the literal truth of what happened: The two creators of this ""film"" built a long, slow consumer awareness program by leaking supposedly legitamite details of the Blair Witch incidents, like fictitous police reports and interviews. Over several months, people were hearing about the Blair Witch case with the overwhelming sense that it was all real. Then the ""film"" was released in theaters and included what was supposedly the non-fiction video documentary of three kids who disappeared while looking in those woods. The lines of fantasy and reality had been effectively blurred, and people came out in droves to see what was really going on.

Seeing as how the actors in the ""film"" were on Jay Leno that very weekend, I was readily aware that it wasn't real. But I went anyway, out of curiosity. I thoroughly, thoroughly despised what I saw. I didn't have high hopes, since I hadn't yet read the much more entertaining web site stuff. But I was so angry that at the end of the ""film"", I loudly said ""Bulls***! I want my 7 bucks back!"" And was met with rousing applause, and yes, a few boos.

I'm a patient man, and very tolerant. I've seen subtitled, three hour long black and white foreign films. Ever heard of the 50 hour ""Three Kingdoms"" chinese hitorical series? Yeah, I sat through that. I liked Titanic. And I've seen horror movies including Dawn of the Dead, House of 1000 Corpses, the Sixth Sense, Nosferatu, the black and white Frankenstein and Draculas, and even comparably modern junk like the Scream trilogy. And aside from Scream 3, I loved all of it. But with the Blair Witch Project, I was simply offended. I fell victim to a marketing scam, and the fact that some people still call it genius burns me to this day.

This is why. The ""movie"", viewed as itself, is utter garbage. For the fans out there, what are you gauging the movie by? The acting? The plot? The PACING!? Three kids whine, nitpick, argue, and cry throughout the vast majority of it all. There's a scene when the most annoying character, the woman (she's that hideous nose / eye creature you see on the box and probably think is the Blair Witch) breaks down in hysterical, overacted tears simply because the team has made a circle and is crossing the same log they've already crossed. And if you don't mind, here's a spoiler so be prepared: There is no Blair Witch. You see nothing on camera. You hear some noises, see strange clues like wooden sticks. And at the end, during a scene that should have been halfway through the ""movie"", you see a creepy house with some blood on it. Then the movie ends. Period. I do not exagerrate. And I don't HAVE to see something to enjoy it. Jeez, 1997's ""Contact"" was great, for example. But when you build up a movie like this, can you not put SOMETHING up there to qualify my time?

(spoiler done) But you see, we're supposed to buy all that because it's a masterful example of anticipation, suspense, and power of suggestion over visuals, harkening back to the old days when stuff didn't have to be flashy and obvious to be frightening. Well, no, sorry. There is nothing frightening about kids in a tent, crying and shivering, and saying they've heard things. (Poss. Spoiler:) It's a ghost story with no payoff. They, and we, see and hear nothing to suggest anything more horrible than common woodland noises at night. (Spoiler end) The kids work themselves up like schoolchildren and start freaking out so badly that they frighten themselves beyond belief, at nothing. That isn't scary, suspenseful, or playing on my natural fears. If I got afraid just because I saw other people terrified of whatever it was that they were imagining, I would have been a basket case in grade school. And even if scared people WERE enough to scare me, it's still a wash because the majority of the ""movie"" takes place in the daytime, where nothing of importance happens. I go on vacations to other countries and tape less daytime commonalities than these idiots. And Yeah, if a ten minute argument over someone losing the map is scary, then I guess I've just been spoiled by GOOD films like Psycho and The Thing.

And these kids are just horrible to begin with. They're the most annoying bunch I've ever heard, and I was hoping halfway through that the girl would just die to move the plot. But instead, we get lots of arguing, lots of wandering, lots of hysteria, and a few hints of plot like finding an unidentified bloody cloth one morning.

Here, in its simplicity, is why this ""movie"" does not deliver. 1: If it's viewed on its own, without external knowledge of promotional material, the movie is baseless, without support, and with no closure or explanation. Without background information it's a pointless mess, so we must judge it by the material that got us interested in the first place- and that material was far more interesting. 2: If viewed as REAL, one must ignore the fact that it's well known as one of the most fiercely debated and famous films ever. But since the hook was that it might BE real, it's a waste. 3: If one watches it as a MOVIE to be entertained by, it's a dud due to horrible and annoying performances, no pacing or twists, and worst of all, no payoff. It winds up being an amateur film without music, lighting, or a good script.

All I can say is that the fake case history that the creators came up with to sell this crap WAS intruiging, and was more interesting than the ""film"" by leaps and bounds. My cousin struggled to defend his like of the ""movie"" until finally deciding on a reason that satisfied him, and became the only explanation I could possibly buy: That Blair Witch was worth watching simply as a side bonus to the crafted material that he was more interested in. I don't want to insult the people who did like the ""film"", but if you did, that must mean it scared you. Well once you get over the fear, I ask you to watch it again a few times. WHAT scared you? What mood were you in, to where you were actually frightened? Was it simply not knowing what the kids would find? (Spoiler alert) Well now that you know you never see the supposed Witch or anything that is NOT possibly manmade, is it still scary? (Spoiler over). I wasn't scared at all because I knew it was fictitous, and went anyway just to see what was supposedly so good. I was bitterly disappointed to see Blair Witch for what it was: Two guys who took advantage of the gullibility of the public, tempted them, played to their fear, and failed to deliver on a mental, intellectual, or even visual level. The only ""genius"" of the Blair Witch Project is, simply, how well it was used to scam the public. And I truly believe that the only people scared by this ""film"" are people like the kids IN it: People who are scared because it seems like they should be, without even any evidence to support the fear. Sure, you may watch the BWP thinking it'll be scary, and nervous in anticipation of what you might see. But by the end, what did you ACTUALLY see? Don't you feel cheated?

Well if not, what scared you is called mass hysteria, and it worked decades ago with War of the Worlds...Which wasn't even an intentional scam. Oh yeah, it was free too.","1"
"Dale65","if it looks like S%#t, and it sounds like S%#t, then it must be S%#t!","5 August 1999","If you thought that ""Star Wars Episode 1"" was the most over-hyped letdown of the year, get ready. ""The Blair Witch Project"" is so shockingly bad it could have been made by your ninth grade brother's friends on their first camping trip this summer. Shot primarily with a poor quality video (which appears to pre-date steadyshot), ""Blair Witch"" should have had a hard time getting into student film and video festivals based on the poor visual and sound quality alone. Instead, it has won prizes and accolades at both Cannes and Sundance, and has become the new indie darling of film critics most everywhere. But, ""Blair Witch"" is far scarier than many of the critics have even begun to hint at. It's basically 80 minutes of watching amateurs stuck in flat woods, running in circles, with no concept of shot composition, no script, no performance talent, and absolutely no idea of what the hell they are doing. This is the movie that puts the 'horror' in horrible.

""Blair Witch"" is supposed to be about the making of a documentary. Is this supposed to represent a documentary film crew? A girl who is a complete bitch, and two dweebs who act like whiny versions of Beavis and Butt-head. The interminable fits of yelling and screaming will have you bored stiff. Do stick figures made of wood, and the sounds of nearby ""filmmakers"" making funny noises in the woods give you the creeps?...if so, you might actually find this frightening.

Well, as audiences everywhere are finding out (as Cinemascore is indicating), ""The Blair Witch Project"" is not a good film, and certainly not what they were told it would be. Shame on critics making comparisons to horror classics like ""The Exorcist"" and ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre"". Those were bold masterpieces of terror in which the scripts were solid before production began. Jeez, even ""I Still Know What You Did Last Summer"" was scarier than ""Blair Witch"" (if Jennifer Love's breasts get any bigger...) Any dolt can do what the makers of ""Blair Witch"" have done, just look at the worst home videos your neighbor Larry has in his collection (but Larry knows how to use that tripod his wife bought him last Xmas).

"The_Void","The worst movie of all time","21 November 2003","This film is horrific. It's horrific that it came fifth in Channel 4's scary moment poll; it's horrific that it got good reviews, and it's even more horrific that people actually like this trash. Quite simply, The Blair Witch Project is the worst film of all time. ...and yet somehow, while this film is on the same level of crappyness as films like Freddy got fingered and The Fast and the furious (except Blair Witch isn't as good as those two), I still get the feeling that someone is going to disagree with me.

For the first part of this review, I will be doing things a little differently than usual. Usually I would write out my views of the film in paragraphs, however, this time, to highlight the misinterpretations that people have of this film, I'm going to show you what my TV guide's say:

Named and Shamed 1: 'What's on TV' (The UK's best selling TV magazine)

""Three student film makers get lost in the woods while investigating a legend. Forsaking special effects, this low budget documentary-style fright fest is a return to the basics of what screen horror should be all about - sheer terror""

****/****

Errrr...what? Excuse me, 'Sheer terror', pardon me if I'm wrong, but when I think of sheer terror, getting lost in the woods isn't the first thing that springs to mind. And where the hell did they get 'fright fest' from? I spent most of the movie waiting for something to happen, not being scared out of my wits. sheesh.

Named and Shamed 2: 'Weekend' (The TV magazine that comes free with 'The Daily Mail' on a Saturday)

""How does a film with a tiny budget, no stars and no effects become one of the scariest movies ever? Simple, by making the audience believe that what they are seeing is real. That's the ingenious mind game carried off by this 1999 horror hit, which pretended to be the video diary of three film students lost in a Maryland wood""

****/*****

Well, first off, credit where credit's due, at least they didn't give it full marks. I'll talk more about the mind game thing later but I don't how that makes the film scary, so what something that's not scary but real is somehow scary now? When I was about 10 my grandfather videoed me playing football, that was real, but was it terrifying? No.

I have a more simple answer for their question though: It doesn't.

Named and Shamed 3: Sky TV's information button

""This terrifying film follows three student film makers who went in search if the Blair Witch only to discover the meaning of true horror""

I think this is my favourite of the three comments. 'the meaning of true horror', oh what? So the meaning of true horror is walking around the woods with a camera? sheesh, its ok guys, none of us have anything to worry about ever if that's as bad as it gets.

People seem to think that no gore, no special effects and no big shocks are a good thing. And they can be, if done correctly. Take Rosemary's Baby for example, there is a film that has no gore, no effects and no big jumpy moments, and it worked, know why? It has an idea behind it. The idea that a woman could be carrying the child of the devil is a genuinely frightening idea, it probes into the unknown, and that is a terrifying thing to do. Getting lost in the woods, not only doesn't probe into the unknown (people have been lost in the woods before); it's just genuinely not scary. Maybe getting lost in the woods with a man eating bear might be a scary thought, but just getting lost in the woods isn't. Ok, if you really did get lost in the woods it might be frightening, but for a film, I think we need a bit more plot than that.

For a film to be good, we're not talking Oscar winner here, just merely good, it needs to have several things, including:

a plot a decent script Direction Acting Watchability

Blair Witch doesn't have any of these. Look:

a plot - Plot? What plot? Ok, so we have a reason why they go in the woods, but once they get there, then what? Nothing happens except for them finding a few twigs and stuff hanging from trees. Lame. a decent script - I realise that they were trying to make things look real, which gives the effect that there isn't a script but whereas in most other films the script is used to move the story along, in this film all the script is a bunch of shouting and moaning. I mean, ok, fine you're lost in the woods but surely you wouldn't just sit there shouting at each other all day. Direction - I think it's hard to judge whether or not this was directed. It just looked to me like a bunch of bad camera angles loosely strewn together.

Acting - Wasn't any. Watchability - I can't see any reason to watch this film. I mean watch the film again. It just isn't watchable, the way the camera(s) move is annoying, and it's hard to tell what's going on most of the time. Well, really nothing goes on. The movie's more boring than Streetcar.

The producers of Blair Witch however realised that to sell a film, you don't need those five things, you just need one thing: marketing. And sadly, they were right.

I remember back in 1999 when this crap....err...film was released. Out of nowhere came great reviews, spouting crap like 'it's terrifying'. I didn't go to see it as soon as it came out, but some of my friends and family did, and every single one of them came back saying that it sucked. However, I thought 'uneducated fools, what do they know?' and then guess what? I went to see it and they were right. It's a good job the film wasn't much longer, I reckon I'd have left if it were.

Then we've got this mind game thing. About it being real footage. When I first went to see it this rumour was still ripe and I thought it was really real. Well, actually I was under the impression that this was a film based on actual footage, not the actual footage itself, but anyway, same difference. So how come I still wasn't in the least frightened? And how come even now, now that everyone knows that the rumours aren't true, why do people like the writers of my TV guides say it's scary? why why why? It's too boring to be scary.

I suppose they do deserve some credit for pulling that off though, even I was fooled. But that's credit for the producers, not for the film itself. It's a shame actually that this rumour was done with this film, if it were done for a good film, movie history could have been made. What a waste.

Then we come to the 'utterly horrifying' ending. Well actually, last time I checked, a man stood in the corner while a girl drops a camera isn't scary, but it looks like I'm wrong again. It's horrifying. I realise that at the start someone said that's what happened to a kid or something, but so what? It's still not scary.

One of the (many) main reasons why this film isn't scary is that non of the characters are engaging, or even likable, the audience has no reason at all to like them, so why would we care if one of them has to stand in the corner? Even if it was frightening, who cares? For a good example of something horrifying happening to someone, see The Wicker Man. The Wicker Man did a good job of making itself scary because the character of Sgt Howie was portrayed as being likable so the audience could identify with him, and so when his time came, we felt empathy towards the guy, but what did we feel here? Absolutely nothing.

In conclusion, The Blair Witch can be summed up in 5 no's.

No effects No gore No shocks No stars Nothing

I give this trash 0/10. What? What do you mean I can't? Oh ok, fine, 1/10, but I'm being VERY generous. I even feel like upgrading every film I ever gave a 1/10 to a 2/10, just to emphasize how bad this was, but I can't be bothered.","1"
"jayjaycee","Minimalistic found footage masterpiece","2 October 2020","""The Blair Witch Project"" is a 1999 mystery horror film directed by Daniel Myrick and Eduardo Sanchez starring Heather Donahue and Joshua Leonard. ⚪ All in all, this famous found footage film bewitches with its minimalistic yet extremely effective nature, as it turns a low budget production into a groundbreaking genre entry that creates a unique atmosphere of spine-crawling suspense and psychological terror out of almost nothing and makes you want to stay out of forests for a really long time. ⚪ It feels like as if it was only yesterday that I have finished the project, but as it turns out, a whole year has already passed and Spooktober has begun once again. As every year, the next few weeks will be dedicated to the watching of horror films as part of the celebration of probably the best month in the year, the month before Halloween. This time I thought that I would kick of this phenomenal event by watching a gem that I have already seen two years ago and that gave me nightmares already back then. I am aware that many heavily dislike this film and I can see why it would annoy rather than entertain them, but to me this is probably one of the most original and, most importantly, dreadful films I have ever seen (in terms of how scary it is!). With a runtime of merely eighty minutes it still manages to take me on an adventure that kept me awake a long time after the credits rolled. But what is it that makes it so popular and effective? Undoubtedly, how the film was originally promoted is one portion of its huge popularity, as it was famously advertised as a real incident of which only the cursed footage was found afterwards (hence the term ""found footage""). The people back in the day thought that those three film students were in fact lost in the woods and killed by some supernatural force of the forest. It was all over the news and a huge sensation for a long time, until the directors confirmed it was all publicity for their work of fiction, but considering that it was received this way only proves how realistic this film is. And I think it still holds up to this reputation, more than twenty years after the whole éclat. It didn't lose any of its eerie atmosphere and general creepy nature. There are so many seemingly insignificant details that contribute to this effect. The whole narration is influenced by minimal aspects, the different stories about the local lore, including the believe that a witch roams the forest or that a child murderer lives in a cabin in the woods, make the viewer think of what they are going to expect and already there terrorises them at this point. Regardless of what you believe in, the story unfolds in a simple and realistic manner. When the three protagonists are talking about seemingly irrelevant stuff and kid around, it adds so much to the effect that it was all filmed by a bunch of infantile and adolescent kids. Many might find them annoying, especially when they start to yell at each other and fight constantly, but I think that is what makes them so relatable in the first place. They are nothing like everyday people, and this only shows it. As their madness grows, the suspension curve rises perfectly and offers increasingly more scenes that haunt you. It is anything but graphic, but I think that is what makes it so wonderfully scary. I don't need jump scares to be haunted, sounds of something breaking twigs in the middle of the night, noises of children who then shake the tent, screams of the one who mysteriously vanishes, stick totems and brick stacks, as well as a bloody gift are enough for me to be totally freaked out. Minor spoiler: thanks to a mistake made by the camera man in a key scene, the witch is never shown on screen, it only takes place in the viewer's head. I don't know what others think, but I had the feeling that the three main characters were constantly watched by something that is more powerful than anyone can imagine. Even as I write these sentences, I feel how the simple thought of it gives me severe goosebumps. This feeling didn't leave me until the horrifying and breathtakingly mysterious ending that still confuses me in a fascinating way. What happened there? Was it the witch or was it something else? Many fan theories about this ambiguous ending are plausible to me. Some say that the whole incident was staged by Josh and Mike whose only goal was to kill Heather, some say that it was the house of the child murder who couldn't take others staring at him when he kills his victim (that's why Mike is looking into the corner), others think that it was the Blair witch herself and I think that every option is possible, as there are hints for every of those theories. Not knowing what happened there is what makes me think that it is such an incredibly hair-raising experience. It is not everybody's darling, but to me it is a minimalistic masterpiece that shows that creativity enables you to do things that will be remembered. This is the definition of an unnerving found footage gem.","8"
"flicklover","I have seen it 3 times!!! Still terrifying!!!!","7 August 1999","I have seen this movie 3 times and i still believe that it is excellent. I have read most of the reviews of the film here, and most are positive, but the some of the negative ones bother me. I truly believe that they are missing the point! I have to agree that the film has been hyped too much, but at least the movie is worthy.( remember GODZILLA?). I saw the movie before the hype so I can't be accussed of being influenced by the hype. The average American moviegoer is lazy, unwilling to be challenged by a film. People today want to be wowed by special effects they dont want to use their imagination. That is what Blair Witch does, it chllenges the viewer to use his/her imagination. I love a good hollywood blockbuster as much as anyone, but they have become so commonplace that they are not as good as they used to be. The Blair Witch Project proves that at times, less is more. What the audience doesnt see is scarier than what they do see. I can give a perfect example: in Jaws the movie was more effective whaen youm couldnt see the shark, right? The same has been implemented here.

I went to see The Haunting the other day, I hated it, good production values and thats it! No sense of real fear! After the movier ended i listened to people's reaction to it, most liked it! Im amzed, the movie had a stupid story, terrible acting, nothing memorable, but the people only talked about the effects! True some of the effects were good but cmon, The Haunting doesnt hold a candle to BW! People now seem to rate a movie solely on the SFX, that is sad.The point is The Blair Witch is an example of good planning and genuine desire to scare. The performances are incredibly real, especially Heather's. Her scene alone late in the film should earn her an Oscar nod! But Im sure that the snobs in the Academy won't recognize that it is a great performance considering the kind of film The Blair Witch is. Like any movie TBW may not be everyone's cup of tea, but some of the comments im reading are just ridiculous!

YES! The website was a clever way to raise interest in the film! YES! THe marketing for the film is aggressive! But the movie lives up to the hype if you go with an open mind, if you expect to see a movie like Scream( which I do like by the way) you will be disappointed. IF YOU WANT TO HAVE A DIFFERENT KIND OF EXPERIENCE IN A MOVIE, LEAVE YOUR HOLLYWOOD BLOCKBUSTER EXPECTATIONS BEHIND. The Blair Witch Project is a fresh departure from the normal moviegoing experience!","9"

"adamscastlevania2","Didn't do a thing for me, and I hate what it spawned","13 February 2015","(8%) First drawn to mass attention when stories started to spread of cinema goers passing out at early cinema screenings through nothing more than sheer terror. And when certain critics spoke of its new, unique style I was even more intrigued. Well as a matter of fact the style wasn't new to anyone familiar with a particularly nasty 70's movie called ""Cannibal holocaust"", (only here thankfully no animals were hacked to tiny pieces by the immoral crew) and the movie itself is as scary as, well it's just not scary. It is in-fact very, very dull, I zoned out every five or so mins through total boredom. Toward the end it got a little interesting, then the end credits rolled, and that was that. I'll never understand this movie's appeal, and I'll never forgive it for popularising the found- footage fad that spawned from it.","1"
"OneAnjel","Annoyingly goes nowhere","30 October 2023","I was in my thirties when this film came out and my kids were in their teens. My kids thought this is one of the funniest movies they've ever seen. So before you tell me that I was too old to appreciate the horror, I'm here to tell you that my kids also didn't think it was scary - high schoolers were calling it a mockumentary because they didn't understand what that actually meant and just thought it was mocking people who were scared easily. But what Blair witch did for that time was give kids something to make fun of and copy. So it also made a new genre of found footage. This isn't the only film that used found footage, it's the only film that made an entire film out of found footage.

As Halloween approaches in 2023 and I'm trying to find this one super creepy movie about teenagers lost in the woods from the 1980s the only thing that keeps coming up is the Blair Witch Project and I keep seeing all these critic reviews about what a mind-boggling amazing film it was and so groundbreaking. So I'm here specifically to say that none of that is true. If people were scared by this film then they scare easily. I can admit that it had some creepy moments, but for me it just really very frustratingly lacked in any kind of authentic delivery. I mean I can appreciate that, in the greatest sense, it's one of those ghost stories you tell around the campfire at summer camp to scare each other. I mean those were the original horror films- all your friends sitting around biting their nails screaming inside because back then we were really good storytellers. And now I guess we're really good film watchers and reviewers. But if you're that kind of person who loves a good around the campfire scary story that gets you even though you know nothing's really going to happen, then here's a film you might like on some levels. I found it to be very very trite, silly, with a very low IQ expectation for the audience. It was frustratingly slow without any reward of any kind. But if you're one of those people who watches paranormal shows about ghost hunters and things like that you might have thought this was pretty cool in its day. But clearly no one has copied this style and you know why? Because it's no good. This is a lousy film that was talked about because it had never done been done before and for no other reason.","3"
"MissCzarChasm","An Extremely Innovative Horror Flick but a bit of a Let Down","24 October 2000","The Blair Witch project is the 3rd film i'll be reviewing for my october/halloween special. This movie took the horror genre to a whole new level. I remember when this first came out the internet turned a small movie into a world wide sensation. A lot of people thought these events actually took place and who could blame them. They made news specials about the missing teens and even T.V. specials that made us believe that sometihng actually happened to these kids, Of course it turned out to be a brillant stunt by the filmmakers to make the movie seem more real. The film was shot entirely with a hand held camera and the acting was almost 100% improvised. When i first saw this movie i was impressed by its creativity but the final product kinda disappointed me.

As you know the plot of the movie is about 3 people who venture into the woods to do a documentary on the blair witch and strange events occur and they a re never heard from again. one year later their footage is found and we get to see what led up to their mysterious disappearance. Pretty good plot that works really well. so far so good.

The atmosphere really works. to me the woods is one of the scariest places to be and it really works for this film. Also being shot entirely on a hand held camera we get to experience first hand what the characters or doing or feeling. Blackouts and shaky camera movements add to the already great suspenseful tension.

The acting is superb. Frist we get 3 funny and carefree young people who are very full of life but as the film progresses we see how fear is tearing them apart and we get to witness this first hand. Since the actors were newcomers at the time i was very impressed with their acting talent.

Another good thing was the last 15 or 20 minutes which are the films highlight and its most scariest moments. i was really hooked by this point at what was happening.

That was the good. Here is the bad.

The film is too short. at 87 minutes it isn't nearly long enough. I felt there should've been so much more included. it's such a quick finish that i couldn't really take it all in.

now, even though the film is pretty short it also tends to be pretty slow. like i said the last 15 or 20 minutes are its best but before this it seems like it takes forever to get started and sometimes it tends to drag and be a little boring

I liked the acting but listening to 3 people yell and curse through almost the entire movie got a little annoying and at some moments that seemed to be the films only conflict. i liked how they showed that fear was consuming them but i wish they would've concentrated more on the legend.

Now this is kinda my own personal gripe about the film. i lied the last 15 minutes but the actual ending itself was such a letdown. for that 20 minutes it created such a good intense build-up and all of a sudden it's over and you go ""that's it"". i know they were trying to be creative and make us wonder what happened to them without actually telling us but it just ends up being a letdown.

another thing that hurt this film but also helped it was the hype that surrounded it. the hype made this film gross 140 million dollars but since there was such a demand that this film be the scariest thing we've ever seen and to some it simply wasn't and i think over-hyping a film can really hurt it sometimes and this is the case with this film.

All and all it's creativity saves it from being a total disappointed and i do give it credit making a uge impact on the horror genre but i just wish it could've been better. 7/10",NA
"afrodome","The Best Film Experiment of All Time.","3 May 2018","I can remember being 10 years old with my eyes glues to the TV on a Saturday night, brownie in hand, glass of milk on the table, and a drawing pad for when advertisements came on between breaks (commercials have always given me headaches).. I can remember the teaser trailer for BWP and remember thinking ""WHAT..WAS THAT"".. I was mortified. Later I learned that there were debates on whether it was actually real or not.. How f'ing scary is that? Even public news stations were conflicted in identifying it's authenticity. The buzz was because of the pre-meditated campaign that the creators easter egged around the internet, local TV stations, and faux-documentaries to really push the boundaries of a film that would freak out theatergoers around the world.

The result? Panic attacks, people fleeing the theaters, afterglows of intense guilt for what they thought was a supernatural snuff film. People were in complete shock. This is also a result of the methodically torturous stress that was put on the cast. They were made to stay up without sleep, going into the woods at night blind and not exactly knowing just what to expect in the pitch dark woods. The fear and panic on the screen was certainly real, and that's why it's so effective: it's not the ""goul"" making howling badger noises. It's the faint sound of a crying baby, going in circles, time warping dizziness coming to life on screen before our eyes, forcing the viewer to fall into the pit of madness with the characters on screen.

I can only recommend this movie to fans of the genre that don't get thrilled by body parts flying in the Saw series but rather the crowd that gets goosebumps from the like of The Babadook, The Changeling and Pulse. The Blair Witch Project is a work of art.","10"
"nitzanhavoc","It hasn't aged well, and it didn't have to. You don't have to love it in order to appreciate the genius.","21 November 2020","Not being that in touch with Horror hype I haven't heard about the third Blair Witch installment until rather recently, so I've decided to watch the first films again (it has literally been over a decade). So after watching this title again I checked some of the trivia details and some web articles, a process which has lead me to the unfortunate conclusion that I can't recommend TBWP to any new spectators.

The story is quite simple (which is part of why it works). Three film students travel to an old city surrounded by woodlands in pursuit of information about ""The Blair Witch"", something between local folklore, an urban legend and a myth. The videotape some sites, interview some locals, and head for the woods for a night of camping before heading back to civilization. That's when things start to get wrong, as the trio gets hopelessly lost, tensions become high and someone (or something) obviously tries to make them feel unwelcome.

I know, thinking of that setting almost makes you able to visualize some of the scenes, and most chances are you wouldn't be far from what's actually shown in the film. That's because most Horror fans (and even certain fans of mainstream cinema) have by now seen titles exemplifying how the ""Found Footage"" sub-genre has improved and matured over the years (and I'd say it has become boring and tedious, but that's just my own thoughts and isn't relevant). No, in order to appreciate the Blair Witch you had to have been there, way back at the turning point of the millennium, when there still hadn't been a ""Found Footage"" sub-genre and perhaps two films (UFO Abduction of 1989 and its remake Alien Abduction of 1998) have ever used the ""documentary"" shooting style in a thriller or Horror film. I was too young to take part in the hype, but from I've collected - a website came up telling of a videotape found in a deserted camera in the woods near what used to be the town of ""Blair"". With no reason not to - people believed it. With no information to contradict this intuitive conclusion - people thought they were actually going to watch an authentic found footage. The producers handed out ""Missing"" flyers of the students (actually a cast of two actors and an actress) during the debut screening in the festival, the cast itself was forbidden by contract to make any public appearances, and most spectators simply didn't know any better.

Think about it. The web page. The characters' names being identical to the cast's names. Missing person flyers. A footage which in all standards looks precisely like a real documentary. Who could have known? Who would have guessed but the cynics and nay-sayers (who have an annoying habit of being right)? Watching the film under the impression the events were real would indeed justify the film being unofficially dubbed ""the scariest movie of all times"". And as much as it might today seem average at best both as a Horror title in general and as a ""Found Footage"" film specifically - numbers don't lie: 40k budget, near 300m earnings. That is how you make a legend.

If any of the anecdotes (true as far as I've been able to track) mentioned here have made you curious and you wish to experience the thrill over two decades after - go right ahead and watch this, just don't expect to have your mind blown. Remember, this is the film which officially gave birth to the Found Footage sub-genre, it was a cinematic and creative breakthrough, but s was the light bulb (and you're reading this on a computer or portable device). If you'd rather enjoy the legacy - go watch any other Found Footage Horror out there (any Paranormal Activity title comes to mind, of course) and know that it wouldn't be here without the pioneering genius of the Blair Witch Project.","8"

"HotHamlet","I simply cannot enjoy this movie.","12 July 2023","The Blair Witch Project is one of the pioneers of found footage that much is true. That being said this review is an honest review of a very young man who simply dislikes the movie. The reason I stress 'young man' is I understand (to an extent) that people back in 1999 felt very differently to this movie. I've heard it was taken as if it was real by many and there wasn't much like it. However I can only review it from my own personal experience and perspective.

Now that all of that clarification is out of the way I must say i find this movie utterly abysmal. The first 25 minutes of the movie are simply boring. The interviews with the locals at the beginning add nothing and you forget about them by the time the credits roll. The other part of the first 25 minutes is the main three cast members walking through a forest with very little interesting dialogue and nothing of note in the visual department. After this point it doesn't get much better, but it at least picks up the pace slightly (if only barely).

The movie lack absolutely anything remotely scary or creepy and unless I am ever in a forest at night would never illicit a horrifying memory. Less is not always more and this movie is a perfect example of that. Even considering it's low budget (that I do not believe was used well), it's still an utterly boring experience.

The best part of this movie is easily the acting although I would not go as far to suggest the acting is good let alone brilliant. It's easily passable however and dare I say average. This is considering they're not A-List actors and the extremely low budget they had to work with (comparatively speaking).

The ending of the movie is not at all satisfying, but considering how awful the movie is it has no affect on the end rating I would give the movie. Compared to the vast majority of found footage movies I have seen (most being long after this but not all) I must say it is easily one of the worst with no place for wiggle room in my eyes.

I weirdly still recommend watching the movie simply because people always talk about it when it comes to horror let alone found footage. So I believe you should probably get this off your radar as soon as possible if it's on it. But I believe most of the hype around this movie is due to nostalgia rather than It genuinely being any good. But this review is only my opinion and please feel free to heavily disagree.

"hurlcode","I am STILL waiting to get my money back...","22 September 1999","Somebody actually compared this to Hitchcock? I felt ill when I saw that. I actually tried very hard to go to sleep during this movie just because I thought it might seem to be over a little faster. I absolutely did not buy in to the characters. I rooted for the witch, which to her credit never showed up in the film. Good move on her part. I wish I hadn't been there either.

When they got to the map sequence, I actually wanted them all to die. I had absolutely no sympathy for these jerks. Yes, I know we are supposed to believe the ""witch"" caused all these things - loosing the map, walking in circles, etc. I just didn't buy it. What I did buy was a bunch of idiots went wandering around in the woods. There was no witch - these people were just too stupid to be allowed to live, and thankfully Darwinism kicked in before they polluted the gene pool further. I hope... I am absolutely serious when I say I was rooting for the witch, by the way, but she took too long.

I was not scared at any point during this film. I was extremely irritated. I would have killed them myself. The only good thing about this movie is that it IS only 80 minutes long - which reduces the amount of time you have to endure. I have a good imagination, and like it when a talented director lets the action happen in my head as much as on the screen. This film had no such director.

This film should have been left buried under the foundation of the 'Blair witch house.' I would not ever see this again, even if offered a large sum of money, for fear that it might encourage these people further.","1"

"azeemnavarro","More than just marketing","14 August 2019","We know how this movie came to theaters: with (maybe) the best marketing campaign of all time. An internet website, the directors listing the actors as missing, create a local legend... that's some of the tactics used to make viewers think that this movie was real. Because that, some people thought that what they saw on Blair Witch was real (sorry, I love the marketing for this, but that's not really intelligent). And that's also thanks to the found footage technique they implemented to make the film. This type of filmmaking wasn't really new, we have films like Cannibal Holocaust, Guinea Pig, The Last Broadcast...and though some of them made some noise, Blair Witch was the one that, for better or for worse, popularized the 'sub-genre'. Now, what is Blair Witch about? Is about three not-so-likable student filmmakers that go on to woods to make a documentary about a legend know as the Blair Witch. And that, is the perfect setting for a movie of this type. With a budget so low, what we get is just scenes of mad people lost in the forest, trying to get out of there. And because of that, the movie has some pacing issues, and audiences that like to consume the McDonald's equivalent of horror movies, will hate this. Our three main guys do a excelent job conducting the story, more if you consider some of the reactions are real or are improv. The way the movies was made, with the actors throwed in the woods with some provisions and directions of what to do and filmed, is very clever, the night scenes are amazing because of that, the actors were actually frightened, and you can tell that. And that ending, is very powerful, it's one of my favorites from any horror film. Yes, Blair Witch is an example of how you shold promote your film, but if you actually look at the film, you will realize this is a masterful take on the mockumentary genre. Recommended for anyone that has pacience and can appreciate a slow burn.","9"
"steves97","Loved it, but you might hate it","21 June 2000","Like most movies, whether or not someone likes TBWP will usually depend on what they're looking for. Many people enjoy horror movies because of the special effects, gore, shocks, and, in some cases, the high production value. Since TBWP came from a small independent film company that cost less than a hundred grand to make, can a moviegoer really expect all that and have a good time? I honestly don't think so.

Myrick and Sanchez had a terrific idea for a film: make a frightening mock documentary that was supposed to look like it was done by some amateur college students. Some people seem to be under the impression that the movie was about the witch, when what it really was about the mental and emotional breakdown of the three film students. I feel that once viewers could accept the low production values and the improvised script, only then could they deal with Heather, Josh, and Mike. Until they do that, the film would never work for them.

I just put myself in their position: I'm lost in the woods, I'm tired, I'm hungry, and I've got the added stress of returning borrowed equipment. The weather is getting colder, it rains just enough to make life miserable, and something is waking me up each and every night. Now, I'm exhausted, grouchy, scared, and I having troubles thinking clearly.

People might have hated Heather because they she was bitchy and annoying, but all three of them had their moments, good and bad. Many people might have also hated the fact that not everything was explained to them, and that they never got to see the Blair Witch. Many other people may have resented Artisan Entertainment's marketing campaign, although they can't deny just how effective it was. All the filmmakers and actors asked was that filmgoers understand the spirit that was intended; without it, they knew the film couldn't work for anybody.

As you might already tell, I thoroughly enjoyed this film. What Haxan Films managed to do with what they had is not only revolutionary, but is also inspirational to independent filmmakers everywhere. I found the backstory interesting, the plotline well thought out, and the characters extremely developed, considering the lack of structure and guidelines within the film. If you do decide to see this film, I think you'll enjoy it if you see it for what it simply is, nothing more; it might even scare the hell out of you!","8"
"robert-121","Gripping, stunning film, the absolute thriller!!","3 July 1999","Privileged to see a preview of this fantastically terrifying film, I found myself actually feeling the pain and mind-numbing anguish of the characters. At times in the movie, I would find myself trying to peer through the darkness with them, fully realizing that there was absolutely no chance of knowing what was out there. I think that is the most effective aspect of this, the fear of the unknown. I really can't think of anything more frightening than something that has no identity, and so you don't know how to relate or react, and you are forced to suffer through the unknown. A key component also included in this film was the steady decline of human spirit that you witness first-hand. You watch as the characters are broken down to small, scared, hunted animals, and you find yourself shaking your head at how pitiful and helpless they have become, yet you don't feel sorry for them, only agonizing hope that they will escape the fear with at least their lives. Wonderfully created film that, at least for me, an outdoor enthusiast who used to enjoy wandering alone through familiar woods, will always haunt me to the core of my soul when I look around and see nothing but endless woods, unknown sounds, and things that are never seen.","10"

Hard to believe it's been practically a decade since ""The Blair Witch Project"" was all the buzz, revolting some with how it would not give in allowing us to see what is terrorizing these three unfortunate would-be documentarian filmmakers, causing some audience-goers to almost up-chuck at the dizzying, skakey camera work(..but, if you think about it, this only gives this piece merit, these are amateur filmmakers who have yet to truly master the right form of precise camera-movement), and leaving many furiously duped at how producers claimed it was real, that footage of vanished film students had been found and pieced together for our benefit. Watching it for the first time since, hell, 2000 I guess, I was surprised at how this gave me the creeps. It was as if I were with them, deep into the woods lost, the sinister trappings of wilderness imprisoning me. I envisioned just what it would be like, there in that tent hearing noises out in the distance, even those giggly sounds of children brought chills up and down my spine..particularly when you see and hear the slight pounding on the exterior of the tent. I mean, snapping twigs and sticks out in the darkness actually gave me the willies. At first, I could understand how three film students, Heather, Josh, & Michael would find their little adventure such a thrill..it was like a vacation with the goal of capturing a documentary for an extra grade in school lifting their average of say B- to possibly a B+. This documentary, as seen early on, seems to be little more than to photograph and convey the legend of some Witch who supposedly haunts the woods. It's treated with rolled eyes as locals share what they know second-hand about it, providing our students with fuel for later laughter. I enjoyed how, as this continues, the camaraderie deteriorates eventually leading to shouting matches and ridicule. I found this actually rather believable and realistic, it worked for me. I could see a couple of people I either barely know, or know just from reputation, getting lost with yours truly as the guide with these sort of reactionary emotions and situations happening. These are just people with everyday jobs hoping for brighter futures facing unforeseen horrors which spiral out of their control despite the fact that getting lost in the woods in our modern age shouldn't happen. Is it some mythical witch behind the spooky noises and unusually shaped rocks and stick-men? The film sure paints a picture of this in the final moments as Heather and Michael enter an eerie dilapidated house with children's hand-prints and ritualistic symbols inscribed on the walls as Josh cries for their help. The basement with a person standing with their face to the wall as a camera falls helpless to the ground after a hard thud sure opens up the scary idea that something truly disturbing was happening away from the camera. I like not knowing because I could just imagine the horrors taking place as if it were me being treated to a rude awakening that far from the civilization I know lies in the heart of the wilderness evil has freedom over those unlucky enough to enter it's domain. I know that a lot of f-king people hate this with an absolute passion, but this sure worked for me..I mean just think about it for a minute:lost in the woods, sounds and voices in the distance, you have heard about a supposed witch haunting the woods, one amongst your party is kidnapped with his agony just out of reach echoing the wilderness, and rocks(..not to mention something bloody wrapped in a napkin, neatly intertwined within sticks, cloth & string)formed in a specific manner warning you that you are not alone. It sure would have me peeing in my pants.","10"
"mrxavia","Boring, slow and not scary in the slightest","17 May 2011","If you are looking for something to scare you, look somewhere else, this is the worst excuse I have seen for a horror film. The style of shooting was as expected, shaky hand held camera, which fitted the premise of the film, but you felt like you were watching an amateur film by school kids rather than actual footage of a real event which it was supposed to depict.

Normally I expect a horror to get my heart racing a few times, and have some surprises, but the plot was too obvious, there were no surprises, nothing that would make you jump.

I would not recommend this to any film buff, ignore the hype and skip this film.","1"
"richard-mason","It's a B****","28 August 2002","Absolutely, positively one of the worst films I have ever seen in my life. The greatest example of hype over substance ever.

I saw this film quite late in its initial cinema release, and was a bit surprised to discover that I was the ONLY person in the theatre. At first I was a bit alarmed at being by myself in a dark theatre with a supposedly scary movie. I know realise the place was empty because word of mouth had already got around about what a dog this film is.

Far from being scared, I was BORED, BORED, BORED. Three extremely annoying people walking around and around in circles getting nowhere for what seemed like an ETERNITY. At one stage I even shouted at the screen ""For God's sake, get on with it."" (It's amazing how brave being the only patron makes you.)

And what about those three. They were so APPALLING I couldn't wait for whatever it was out there to start knocking them off. Especially that whiney woman.

The final sequence redeemed things SLIGHTLY be being genuinely creepy, and it earns the 1 point I have awarded it.

The makers traded so much on their independence and originality, but being independent is not a virtue in itself. You still have to present the audience with something to engage their minds, emotions, fears, whatever. I know it was meant to be a ""faux"" documentary, but that doesn't mean you don't need characters. And a plot.","1"
"jaysilentbob37","Unsettling, and devastatingly creepy.","9 February 2006","Every time I tell someone my age (15) that I thought this movie was truly scary, they laugh at me, and they tell me how boring they thought it was. they never fail to mention how awful it was that it had NO violence, and showed NOTHING scary or sexual. Just try to put yourself in the character's situation. You'd panic and lose your mind too.

The movie consists of the ""real"" footage that was ""found"" in the woods, that involved three college students, Heather, Mike, and Josh, filming a documentary about a local legend known as the Blair Witch. First they interviewed several people. Then they headed out into the woods. When they got there, they lost the map, started freaking out, and everything went downhill from there. They found, and heard a lot of evidence that the Blair Witch might be out there. Soon, they realized they were being stalked by something, but they already became hopelessly lost, and scared. Soon, the camera fell over, and they disappeared.

This movie is actually truly scary. Not because it shows jump-out surprises, or shocks, but the behavior of the characters is what's scary. ""How can you be scared by people being scared?"" said one comment. The answer is that it's not them being scared that scares us. It's the thought of what they're scared of. You never know what could be out there, and there's no way of finding out (the sequel ruined this). The movie was set up as a publicity stunt, and became an internet phenomenon. This movie cheesed off many film goers who were expecting to see a horror movie in the style of the ""Scream"" movies. I praise everyone who understands the greatness of this movie.

By the way, the movie is very, very scary. When I saw it, I knew I would be disturbed, but this movie shattered my spirits for many months because it was so scary to me. The fact that the movie is COMPLETELY FICTIONAL, wasn't enough to cheer me up. Showing it to a friend was the only thing that could help me feel even a little better. What's weird is that I've almost never been scared by a movie before.

No special effects, no gore, just shocking realism. If you don't appreciate that, I pity you. Go watch ""Scream"" (Good movie). That's REALLY scary. I give this movie 8/10.

It is rated R for Language. Sex: 1/10 Violence: 3/10 Swearing: 10/10 Drugs: 3/10","10"
"dbdumonteil","Tom Thumb has a picnic at hanging rock.","14 January 2002","This movie,along with ""the sixth sense"" and some recent other ones ,is the volte-face of the fantasy and horror genre.The disappearance of these special effects which has been defacing the ""scary movies"" since ,say,""the exorcist"".A return to pure psychological suspense.Like Don Siegel 's ""invasion of the body snatchers""(1956),there are here no stars,and a shoestring budget.The form is unique,for it is an amateur camera work,almost a draft,giving the terrible feeling the heroes have really been through it all.

The fears we feel in this work recall childhood terrors:the forest,when you are small may be beguiling ,but it's also an unknown world.Who has never been afraid of getting lost in this maze of trees and bushes?That's Tom Thumb syndrome:in the movie,the heroine's map is an equivalent of Tom Thumb's stones.These stones which the three lads find in front of the tent might be a nod in the direction of Charles Perrault;as the (witch's?) house might be a hint at Grimm's ""Hansel and Gretel"".

Most of the terror happens in the midday sun:a fantasy and horror movie does not necessarily mean darkness.I would go as far as saying that the scenes in the daylight are the scariest:Peter Weir opened up the way in 1977 with his classic ""picnic at hanging rock"".The three characters 'roaming round this quiet place , waiting for SOMETHING to happen,all this is extremely disturbing.There's an impending menace,but we do not know exactly what it is,and our fears are increased tenfold.Strange signs along the way ,a gruesome treasure hunt. At night,the screen becomes sometimes completely black:in all,about five minutes(!),enough to put the spectator in a cold sweat.

"VikiLauda","The birth of ""Found Footage""","12 March 2021","It hardly needs saying that ""The Blair Witch Project"" sparked a flurry of ""found footage"" movies in the first part of the 2000's, some were good, some just ok & others were appallingly bad. TBW project itself is not a brilliant film but it should be called the pioneer of the genre which then became a household name.

Set in October 1994, it tells the story of a small team of three young investigators who are making a documentary on ""The Blair Witch"" legend in the woods of Maryland. On entering the woods they chat to two fishermen who tell the story of ""Coffin Rock"" where alleged human sacrifices were made which they film & chat about as they start to make camp for the night. The next day they continue into the woods, but tempers get freyed as they start to realise they are in fact lost...

This film actually works if you consider it to be an experimentle art house movie, because it is certainly not a mainstream horror movie. In fact horror fans like me will be appalled at the lack of horror in BWP as almost all the suspence is suggestive. Also be prepared for a film that is non scripted & contains annoying repeated phrase words, very bad camera work (pehaps this goes with the type of film this is) & unproffessional acting. This movie is unpolished, because it is supposed to be, as it's amature in it's conception. The main character, Heather is really annoying, as well as being loud, brash & bossy which makes her unrelatable & left me feeling sorry for the other two guys, who are both nastily hen-pecked. So much so I think they scarpered just to get away from Heathers whining!

Well for a movie that spawned a whole new genre in horror/suspence, you would be expecting it to be rated higher, but I think a 6 is fair. If you understand the genre, it is watchable, but mainstream horror fans should avoid this, as they will find it without substance & shallow. There are no special effects, no sound track & no visable antagonist. The BWP is simply a raw, bare bones movie making expierence, with s creepy romp in the woods as a back drop. It is also a short movie which I feel will keep people from being bored. It has minimal bad language, no nudity, no gore (beyond a blob of something) & no agenda, which I think is suitable for age 14 plus.","6"
"waterman_harry","The Perfect Film","26 April 2015","The Blair Witch Project borrows from horror classics like F.W Murnau's Nosferatu and Michael Powell's Peeping Tom in rendering us helpless victims to an almost faceless entity and combines this sensation with the viscerality of Roman Polanski's Repulsion - but this time we have left the apartment and ventured into the woods with nothing but a map, a compass and a few bad words. Undoubtedly inspiring to all, but sincerely not for everyone, the film is more than a horror film as it is barren of all gimmick and a real trail-blazer of the ""found-footage"" genre, the characters are so raw and believable that the audience almost feels unified with them in fleeing from something so frightening that it can't be felt or conquered, just simply acknowledged. I will always love this film.","10"
"paul2001sw-1","If you go down to the woods today...","28 October 2003","A real horror film is always primarily about the psychology of fear, which leaves the movie maker with one key decision: how much to show, and how much to leave only in the mind. 'The Blair Witch Project' exists as the video diaries of some self-obsessed film-makers, making a film about themselves investigating the legend of a local witch. As well as being an interesting experiment in narrative legitimacy, it also provides a novel solution to the aforementioned dilemma: we see exactly what the characters see for themselves. It's convincingly done, and truly spine-chilling. The ""heroes"" are annoying American brats, but as their plight deepens, one is taken with the sense that they're going to die. The result is harrowing, and more resembles the BBC's story of nuclear winter, 'Threads', than any conventional horror film. Not exactly light entertainment, but genuinely good nonetheless.","10"

"ironhorse_iv","Blair Witch Project indeed swept me off my feet, but it also flew off the handle of the broom. It was kinda nausea inducing at times.","12 December 2016","Shot entirely in the style of a documentary gone horribly wrong, this movie was indeed groundbreaking for the time, as it re-popularized 'the found footage' horror subgenre marketing style that was somewhat lost in the late 1980s, after the minor success of 1980's 'Cannibal Holocaust'. Using internet-based viral marketing, directors Eduardo Sanchez and Daniel Myrick was able to promote the idea that 'The Blair Witch Project' was truly the recovered footage of real documentarians that went missing in the woods of Maryland, in order to cover the local ghost stories, using fake online documents, footage, published dossiers, interviews, and even a couple of professional-looking television documentaries blurred the line between truth and fiction. The only problem with this, is that the movie doesn't know, what type of horror story, it wants to tell. For a movie titled 'Blair Witch', it doesn't really talk much about 16th-century witchcraft that much. Instead, it look like they wanted to talk about the fictional account of a 1940s child murder named Rustin Purr. Despite that, people were subtly convinced that these two legends were real, as opposed to something the film-makers made up themselves. Many were also convinced that the movie was based on a true story, or even consisted of actual footage. Because of this, the real-life actors, Heather Donahue, Joshua Leonard & Michael C. Williams had to play the part of the fictionalized version of themselves as demise, even after the credits start rolling. They did this, by not appearing in any type of media, motion pictures, or commercials for one year following the film's release. It really did seem, like they walk off the face of the earth to the point that a police investigation was order to expose the facade. For the most part, this verisimilitude marketing kinda works, as it got people interested in seeing this low-budget horror movie that has nothing much happening, including me. However, the marketing did leave some very jarring questions, like if this was a real movie, how was the film footage even recovered, if the woods was really that haunted. Another, is how was any upstart studio got the rights of the footage, from the families of the demise, and able to make a profit off their family members 'supposedly' deaths. Doesn't that seem, a bit odd!? Also, it's really hard to believe that this footage is indeed 'raw', when it look like it been edited to follow a narration path. After all, doesn't it seem a bit odd for these film students to film a lot of footage of them, arguing, cursing, & bickering with each other over a map, that they can't use on their documentary, rather than saving that footage for documenting the events. Still, I guess, they gave a good reason, with Heather's insistence upon filming everything, is suggested by Josh to be her way of coping with the fact that she's lost in the woods. Mad props to Heather's apology scene. She acted so hard that you could practically see the bite marks in the camera. She sobs, screams, and shakes so realistically that her acting was so convinced, making people forget that, she accidentally zoom the camera, too far on her face. However, I did think the directors went a little too far to promote discord between the actors, by deliberately ruining their sleep, and starving them. From what I heard, they were really butting heads toward the end. Still, it does seem, a bit out of character for one of them, to throw away the map for no good reason!? It doesn't make sense, unless, one of the students was really trying to kill the other filmmaker, but that's just a film theory. Despite that, I did enjoy the actors genuinely upset reactions, even if it was somewhat annoying at times. Still, it doesn't explain, why their film footage look like crap even in the beginning, if they supposedly go to film school. Yes, it can be said, the footage was made to look like it has degraded since it's been in the open woods for nearly a year, but it doesn't explain, why these 'student filmmakers' have so many badly shots. All these low grade blurry poorly focus shots make the movie, nearly unwatchable. Also the cringe-worthy shaking cam is really annoying, as it known to makes people vomit. Although, this movie show nearly nothing that was really scary. Like some sort of cinematic Rorschach test, there was enough suspense to keep me, looking for at least something that would get a reaction from me. I give the movie credit that, it didn't relies much on outright special effects of blood, gore, and violence to get people to watch; just the psychological horror and tension of unseen forces and sounds that is slowly ratcheted up with each passing day and night of the characters' descent into madness. It left everything to the audience's grisly imagination. While, this movie had a 2000 & 2016 sequel, 'Book of Shadows: Blair Witch 2' & 'Blair Witch'. They didn't live up the hype of the first movie. Overall: I have to say, there is a strong reason why this movie lead a new age of 'found-footage' horror films. It was unique at the time, however rewatching it, now. It's a bit date. Nevertheless, it's not worthless, so no need to kick it in the creek. It's more like a nostalgia watch, these days. So check it out, if you want to.","6"
"ronakkotian","Genuinely creeped me out","22 November 2020","I'm a huge fan of horror films and I've always been fascinated with found footage movies even though the ones I saw were pretty bad. The Blair Witch Project, on the other hand, is one of the best found footage films I've seen.

The Blair Witch Project tells the story of three teenagers who disappear in the woods whilst making a documentary on the urban legend known as the Blair Witch.

I really wish I saw this film when it came out. It was such a huge deal in 1999 and so many people believed everything that happened in the film was real and I can see why. Unlike a lot of modern found footage flicks, The Blair Witch Project stand out to me by how much thought and care went into its presentation to make it seem as authentic as possible. The low quality footage from the camera, casting non actors and the overall low budget of the film made it incredibly convincing that these three teens actually went missing. The three actors in the movie were fantastic especially considering this was their first film. Heather Donahue, Michael Williams and Joshua Leonard were very believable in their roles and most of their conversations being improvised helped sell the fact what I was watching was real.

A major complaint about this film was how it wasn't scary at all or nothing really happened which I totally understand but personally, I felt this growing tension building as the film went on. I loved the way everything started to slowly spiral and the actors got more and more agitated with one another. Despite nothing much happening, all the strange stuff that does happen kept me feeling tense and worried for the characters and, with every night, things got progressively creepier which led to an unsettling climax that genuinely freaked me out due to the brilliant camerawork and performances.

I have to give praise to Daniel Myrick and Eduardo Sánchez. They came up with such a simple idea that required a really low budget and managed to inspire and popularise the found footage genre. Each element was carefully thought out to make it seem as real as possible and, in my eyes, I believe they succeeded.","8"
"tchitouniaram","One and only!","11 September 2020","Considering,that there are almost no horrors,that I didn't watch)))the Blair witch remains the favorite,timeless and respected film ever!The minimalist style,with tiny budget,but enormous talent,makes it a wonder movie,for me!The creators masterfully play on basic human fears:unknown,getting lost,darkness and night forest.Without any special effects,gore and jump scares,it still remains one of the scariest horrors ever made.Just absolutely love it!","10"
"Anonymous_Maxine","Whether you love it or you hate it, you have to respect The Blair Witch Project for its uniqueness and its originality.","3 September 2000","One of the many unique things about the Blair Witch Project is that no one liked it. Everyone who saw it either absolutely loved it or absolutely hated it, there was unusually little in between. It should be noted that no one has ever made a professional film like this before. People often joke about a movie being so bad that a student filmmaker could make a better one. Well, a student filmmaker really COULD make a movie like the Blair Witch Project, but the point is that no one has ever made a film this deliberately crude and yet attained such stunning success.

The makers of the Blair Witch Project cleverly avoid the inevitable comparisons to student films by making the actual premise of the film as a student documentary. That's what makes the movie so good! The tagline is about a bunch of kids who went into the woods, got lost, and whose video footage was found a year later. That makes the film itself realistic beyond all other horror films. The methods of production enabled the actors to present an even more convincing portrayal of a bunch of kids lost in the woods and desperate to get out. A lot of times they didn't even know what was going on with the picture, they really WERE lost and confused. Another notable element of this movie is the way that they were able to create such a tense atmosphere with a virtual absence of gore. This is proof that you do not need buckets of blood in order to make a good scary movie.

So many people complained about the shaky camera work in the Blair Witch Project. They say that it was terrible filmmaking because the camera is always bouncing around, but that was done on purpose! Don't these people realize that the home video look was the primary goal for the finished product here? These kids didn't go out into the woods to shoot this documentary with a full-on film crew complete with caterers and everything else, they went ALONE. However, there was a little bit of botched editing in this film. It is meant to be presented as though they found their video cameras, and what you see on the screen is simply what they recorded on their cameras, with little, if any, editing. Obviously the two cameras they used needed to be edited together so that they show the same material, but there was at least one scene where Heather was seen on the opposite side of a stream crossing the log (the one that they had come back to), but her voice is heard as though it is her holding the camera.

Overall, the Blair Witch Project is a very original and satisfying horror movie, but you have to have an open mind. You have to be able to accept something that was made different than your traditional movie is made, and try to really understand what is different about it and what makes it good. I think that one of the best things about the story is that it leaves so much to the imagination. You never see what is actually tormenting them from out in the woods, all you see is the dark, and that makes every individual audience member imagine whatever it is that they fear the most out there in those woods. In this sense, the film is almost interactive. No other horror film has ever come close to doing anything like that, and the Blair Witch Project should be recognized for it. This is an original, entertaining, and ultimately terrifying film, and you see something new every time you see it.","10"
"dee.reid","Into The Woods...","26 December 2022","Sam Raimi (1982's ""The Evil Dead""), eat your heart out.

Here it is, ""The Blair Witch Project,"" the 1999 ""found-footage"" shocker that terrified audiences and subsequently launched an entire sub-genre of horror that would quickly wear out its novelty over the next two decades.

Although ""The Blair Witch Project"" was not the first so-called ""found-footage"" picture - feature films that typically use unknown or inexperienced or unprofessional actors and purport to be real footage and are filmed in amateurish documentary-film-style to support that notion - that honor actually goes to the Italian-made ""Cannibal Holocaust"" (1980).

Despite polarizing audiences and critics at the time of its release, ""The Blair Witch Project"" nonetheless became a bona-fide pop culture phenomenon and international box office sensation - grossing $248.6 million and becoming the most commercially successful independent feature of all time (until it was beaten by Mel Gibson's ""The Passion of the Christ"" in 2004) - because it took a huge creative leap not seen in ""Cannibal Holocaust,"" and that was by successfully convincing viewers that what they were seeing was indeed real, complete with an ahead-of-its-time viral marketing campaign on the nascent Internet, radio and television and in print sources; keep in mind, this was BEFORE the advent of social media giants like Facebook, MySpace, Twitter, and Instagram. (I should know, I was 14 at the time of the film's release back in 1999 and fell for it myself, and remember being convinced that everything had actually happened. The more cynical and jaded of us out there would call this a ""snuff"" film if that was actually the case.)

It's an ingenious (the late film critic Roger Ebert described it as ""insidious"" in his four-star review of the film) tactic that works, by tricking the audience into believing that the events of the film are real and having the faux documentary film style to back it up - complete with the requisite bare-bones production budget ($60,000) - the formula for a horror movie cultural phenomenon was set.

Another reason for its success was the fact that ""The Blair Witch Project"" was riding the wave of the big horror revival of the late 1990s - initiated three years earlier by ""Scream"" (1996). And by capitalizing on the then-novel ""found-footage"" caveat as a means of distinguishing itself from the other big-budgeted horror films of the time, co-directors/co-writers/co-editors Daniel Myrick and Eduardo Sanchez almost single-handedly gave rise to a new sub-genre of modern horror.

Like ""Jaws"" (1975), ""The Blair Witch Project"" has a deceptively simple premise that gets by because of its novel if flawed execution that early on seems at least partially inspired by ""Deliverance"" (1972) and ""The Texas Chain Saw Massacre"" (1974). By now, we all surely know the story: In October of 1994, three film students by the names of Heather Donahue, Joshua Leonard and Michael Williams went into the woods outside of Burkittsville, Maryland, to make a documentary about the local legend of the ""Blair Witch,"" and are never seen again. One year later, their footage was found. That +found footage+ is what forms the basis of the film that we, as the viewer, sees.

That's it. But what follows, is a descent into pure terror. Myrick and Sanchez wrote a 35-page screenplay in 1993 that forms the narrative backbone of the picture, and the actors were forced into improvising most of their scenes with minimal direction and instruction from the filmmakers. Supported by the shaky hand-held camerawork (which quite frankly has never been an issue for me in any of these sorts of pictures - though I get the frustration that some people have with this particular style of filmmaking), we, as audience members, get the impression that we are watching a real-world documentary, since the entire movie was actually filmed using two hand-held cameras. I have always commented that when it comes to ""found-footage"" features, the one thing that we can always count on are natural performances from the actors. That is no truer here in ""The Blair Witch Project"" than it is in any of its similar-themed followers over the years. Because of the minimal direction and improvisation on the part of the performers - combined with the natural, hand-held camera visual aesthetic - many (if not all) of their reactions to the (unseen) seemingly supernatural forces that menace them in the film's second half are in fact real; a lot of these ""unseen"" forces were just the film crew spooking the hell out of the three leads since the budget did not allow for elaborate special effects. Also like ""Jaws"" in its initial stages, that fear of the unknown is what makes it so scary.

That sort of immersive realism cannot be replicated by your standard-fare feature film. The characters are terrified and we're terrified along with them, but we also have to remind ourselves that Donahue, Leonard, and Williams were never at any time in any real danger. But still, their camera captures the oppressive and ominous backwoods of Maryland quite well. And despite the lack of any special effects, the viewer still gets a nice taste of horror imagery; simple objects in the forest like a bundle of sticks, a pile of rocks, bizarre stick figures hanging from the trees, a huge log fallen across a river, a decrepit old house in the middle of nowhere - these images are all quite unsettling and have a unique way of eliciting pure primal terror and lodging themselves into the viewer's memory because of their un-pretentious, unassuming simplicity.

In a nutshell, ""The Blair Witch Project"" launched a craze and was a terrifying cinematic horror-movie moment that cannot ever happen again. The viral marketing and the brilliantly-sculpted illusion that the film's events are all true were the key to the success of the picture. If it were to come out now, in the digital media age of 2022, there's no question that the illusion would not work and people wouldn't fall for it like they did back in 1999.

It was a brilliant flame that could only ever burn this bright, this one time. And like ""The Evil Dead,"" it also convinced people not to go into woods ever again...

9/10

P. S.: Although no music is heard in the film (except for a quick cut on a car radio early on), ""The Blair Witch Project"" does have an accompanying soundtrack called ""Josh's Blair Witch Mix"" that like the film, also presents itself as a ""found"" mix tape of music that Joshua Leonard was hip to and was found by investigators in his car along with the camera equipment the three were traveling with to shoot the picture. It's a dark, ominous, doomy, gloomy collection of Goth, industrial, and vintage sounds by Lydia Lunch, Public Image Ltd., Skinny Puppy, The Creatures, Type O Negative, Meat Beat Manifesto, and even the dirge-y composition played over the end credits of the film called ""The Cellar"" by the film's composer Antonio Cora. I highly recommend picking that up if you can find it somewhere since it perfectly matches the grim and foreboding mood of the film.","9"

Forget it, if I was in 1999 or found these recordings on some obscure internet site I would believe in the veracity of the recordings.

All the propaganda and marketing behind the idea is what makes it so memorable and unique, something that couldn't be done these days without anyone discovering the scam in a week or two, even the Blair Witch Project website (Which remains active) is remarkably amateurish, which gives more veracity to the story of the lost young people who planned to make a documentary.

Although the genre found footage is spent today, this film still remains well because most of the films that came later did not understand the basic principle of the genre, amateur recordings can not have quality, it is strange when we see a movie that uses the concept of amateur footage, but the quality of the camera is great, or the person who is filming seems a professional manipulating a Arriflex 535 , does not pass realism, taking away the immersion of the audience.

In Blair Witch The Found Footage works because from the beginning it is already established that our protagonists are amateur filmmakers, thus showing that they already have a certain skill with the camera, besides the quality of the footage is very bad even for the time when the film was recorded (1994) either because their equipment was not the best or because the ""tapes found"" were deteriorated by the time. The performances are perfect for the film, since none of the actors followed a script, but rather improvised their lines and actions, passing a real feeling that that recording really happened.

But what's so scary about the movie? The fact that it could all be something real, the city is real, the citizens are real, the legend really exists in the city and the actors really entered that seemingly haunted forest, as much as it is a movie, anyone could have those ideas in real life (and in fact they had since the city turned into a baderna with a huge number of tourists visiting , whether to meet her, hunt the witch or look for those three lost young men). Moreover at no time does the film explicitly show supernatural things happening, everything we see on screen could easily be effected by evil people, at the beginning of the project the citizens of the city themselves talk about some criminal cases that had occurred there a few years ago, including cases that correspond directly with the last minutes of the film. Also, the actions of the protagonists are very real, how many times have we seen characters acting in the stupidest and most irrational way possible in horror movies? In this film, they act in a way that anyone could act on, especially in the state of madness, tiredness and fear that they were.

This was one of the very few films that made me cover my face with fear, because as I had said earlier, everything we see on screen even though it is not real, is so well done that it would not be strange if it really was.","10"
"Backlash007","""Have you ever heard of the Blair Witch?""","24 February 2003","""In October of 1994, three student filmmakers disappeared in the woods near Burkittsville, Maryland, while shooting a documentary. A year later their footage was found.""

That is the making of a scary, intense, and sometimes even funny film. The Blair Witch Project's notorious reputation precedes it and makes it quite possibly the most infamous movie ever produced. It's also one of the most cheaply made, highest grossing, most parodied films of all time. Most of those statements are made because of pure marketing genius. The concept isn't quite as original as you'd like to believe. It has been done before, but I don't think it has worked before. Blair Witch ""borrows"" the mockumentary concept of The Last Broadcast and improves upon it three-fold. It's a great story with real characters in a real situation and how they deal with it. It's all about realism. To this very day, some people believe this actually happened. I think that's where the hatred comes from; people don't like to be tricked. Love it or hate it, you can't forget it. The Blair Witch Project IS a landmark horror film.",NA
"baunacholi-86159","Disruptive and original","19 September 2021","Hands down, probably one of the most disruptive and terrifying mystery thriller / horror movies of the last decades. It's simplicity (found footage) is highly original and influenced countless spin offs. The Blair witch project manages to create a tense and frightening atmosphere not due to effects and complexity in storytelling, instead the shear lack of it. This could happen to me too - might be one of the thoughts u might have after watching this cinematic milestone - and that's actually the true Horror.","9"
"lareval","Still effective after all these years","27 August 2021","This is a genuinely creepy movie. What you can´t see or the things you can only imagine in your head usually are the best, and this movie works wonderfully with that. Totally deserves its myth (kudos to the mythology worked out just for the movie: genius).","10"
"Sandcooler","Work of genius","1 November 2009","In one way this is a bunch of people filming random trees with a video camera, in another it's one of the creepiest movies ever made. Most of the time you don't know what's happening, and that's its major strength. The mystery in this movie gets unbearable once you're into it, and for the most part you don't get any wiser as the time progresses, just more intrigued. You know it's not going to end well, but how will it end? What is all this footage leading up to? People walking around in the woods has never been this fascinating, and probably never will be again. And then you finally get the ending, and it pisses some people of, but to me it is extremely fitting. What was the audience really expecting, I wonder. It's a brilliant ending, and this is a brilliant movie.","10"
"The_Core","Unimaginably boring, dull and imbecilic...","29 January 2001","Let me make myself perfectly clear from the start: I went into this movie with *NO* expectations whatsoever. I had no exposure at all to the hype. My younger brother told me how terrible this movie was, but I thought it must have *some* redeeming value -- in fact, it sounded interesting. After seeing it, I realized that it had no redeeming value. It was bad, bad, bad. Dull. The fact that I made it all the way through without turning it off is a minor miracle.

Another thing -- I'm not at all lacking in imagination. I love atmospheric films. I've felt a creepy sensation being in the woods before (although I usually just feel peaceful) and was terrified of the dark as a child (I got over it!) But the fact is, this movie had no atmosphere. It had no acting (though plenty of ridiculous overacting). It had no plot. It had no cinematography. No directing.

In fact, this wasn't a movie at all. I don't know what it was... I don't...

I know... it had to be a farce! I get it now... someone posted several hundred positive reviews using different names on the IMDB, trying to get people to watch it. Must have been whoever released the film. The production company must have been in on it.

Honest... how else to explain why ANYONE would consider this dull, meaningless piece of junk? I feel very cheated that I wasted the money to rent this on DVD. I would feel cheated if someone offered (and paid) me fifty dollars to see it again.

The only film of ANY genre I've seen that was worse was ""The Telephone"" (Whoopi Goldberg). This film goes down as #2 on the bottom 10 films I've ever seen.

Long after the release of this piece of trash, I remain utterly baffled that anyone with an IQ over 25 (or under 25, for that matter) would see any redeeming value in this film. And I will probably always be baffled.

"thinker1691","Where's The Witch?","20 October 2006","If ever there was a film which had the ability to promise so much and deliver so little, this would be it. This was a film which did better promoting itself than it did delivering its supposed frightening contents. The culprits for this film fiasco are listed as Heather Donahue, Joshua Leonard and Michael C. Williams. From the prospective of a common boy scout these supposedly ""College"" students made every mistake as could be made by even the most stupid junior cub-scouts. Their purpose was to travel, via outdoors backpacking to the legendary ghost site of the famous Blair Witch and to ascertain her possible authenticity. As the viewer travels along with them, one wonders if they left their brains in neutral or just back in their dorms. Even Gilligan would not have been that dumb to carry out their own demise, not from the confrontation of the Witch, but with their own ignorance. The police should have bagged this one as death by stupidity. If there was ever a film which audiences should be warned about not seeing, this is the best candidate for that job. It does not even rate one star.","1"
"mark.waltz","The wait in watching this wasn't worth it.","14 October 2021","A good half hour or more shows the three principals of this phony horror documentary discussing human gas, chest hair and the skipper and Gilligan. The film is only 81 minutes and the obnoxious Heather Donahue seems to drop the f bomb once a minute. Then there's the other assorted curse words she interject, verbally abusing the two young men with her as they search for evidence to prove the existence of the Blair Witch. Eventually they are all snapping at each other to the point where you begin to hope that this was real and that the Blair Witch did get them.

The first five minutes interviewing ""locals"" is much more interesting than what happens when the three are alone, and the shaky camera after a while becomes annoying and waiting for anything supernatural to occur becomes interminable. This was a big smash which proves the old P. T. Barnum slogan that there is a sucker born every minute. I support independent filmmaking and new ideas, but this is a wreck in every way that gave me a headache after half an hour.","2"
"nickenchuggets","""I'm afraid to close my eyes""","11 October 2021","It's often been said (especially by me) that the creepiest horror movies are the ones which depict realistic scenarios, and this is certainly the case with this one. This movie is so tense and panic-inducing it's a little nauseating. What Blair Witch does exceptionally well is introduce a new (at the time) style of film making to mainstream audiences. The entire movie consists of camera footage taken by a group of three friends named Heather, Josh and Mike during October 1994. It gives the movie a kind of documentary feel and makes it appear less polished than other films, almost like a home movie. This makes it more relatable, and thus more disturbing. As mentioned earlier, the movie is about 3 friends who are venturing to an allegedly haunted forested area in Maryland in order to determine whether or not a local legend called the ""Blair Witch"" is real. On the way there, a man fishing in a creek tells them about a serial killer who lives out in the woods who would abduct people and kill them in his house in the 1940s. While doing this, he would kill two at a time and have one stand upright in a corner while the other was murdered. The people making the documentary don't really think much of this theory and dismiss it as a tall tale, after which they enter the woods. At first, things are slow moving and uneventful, but upon waking up the day after, they find man made piles of rocks stacked around their campsite. More creepy incidents at night occur, and there appear to be strange noises coming from outside the tent, one of which sounds like a small infant. Soon, the group's map is missing, meaning they have no surefire way to exit the woods or even tell where they are. Mike, obviously starting to lose his mind from being stuck in this nightmare of a situation, tells his friends he threw the map into a river because it wasn't any help. Josh and Heather immediately call him a traitor to the group and scream hysterically at him, convinced that if anything bad happens to them now, it's his fault. That night turns out to be the worst of them all. Some mysterious force attacks the tent in the early hours of the morning and sends the characters running for their lives. When daylight arrives, they try one more time to escape the woods, and discover they have walked in a circle because they come across a stream they recognize from earlier. Unable to make any progress at all, they are once again forced to spend another night in this place being stalked by something that doesn't want them there. Josh disappears soon after, and his voice is heard when night falls again. Heather and Mike are convinced it's just a ghost mimicking his voice, so they stay put. Now convinced they will never get out of here, Mike and Heather desperately try to locate Josh and eventually come across a seemingly abandoned and dilapidated house. When they go inside, they find satanic markings on the walls and still hear Josh's voice. Mike's camera suddenly drops and is laying on its side. Heather finds Mike standing motionless in a corner, and before she can react something hits her from behind. We can assume they were both killed by the murderer we were told about early in the movie. While I thought the ending was a little disappointing, this movie has it where it counts. It's very unnerving to witness the character's slow descent into insanity as they eventually realize they're not going to make it out of the woods. All they want to do is go home, but they can't. I really can't imagine being in a similar situation knowing that some mysterious force is chasing me through the virtually endless forest. When it's quiet, you'd be the most afraid. Like most movies with endings similar to this one's, Blair Witch Project is something you will probably only watch once. It's pretty disturbing the first time around, but after that, it doesn't hold up as well. It doesn't help that the movie itself puts a disclaimer at the end saying how the whole thing is fictional, because of course it is. Another mildly weird thing not really related to this movie is how a guy in a store is interviewed at one point, and there's bags of Utz chips behind him. Coincidentally, that's what I was eating while watching this. Overall, Blair Witch Project is a downright creepy movie, but only on the first viewing. Most of its scares come from the setting: being completely alone in a forest where nobody can hear or help you. Another perfect example of a movie that is scary because it could happen.","8"
"cLoNe","Boriiing!","14 January 2001","I was horrified when I watched this movie. Horrified that such a boring, stale movie could be so popular. The idea of not showing the horror and letting the audience imagine it was not done well. There was just not enough to work up my imagination. What I did see was unbelievable and silly. I sticked around with the horrible ""artistic"" shots, hoping that the climax will be better, but there's no climax. The movie just ends... At least it ends...","1"
"cinephile-27690","My 2nd favorite Horror Movie.","12 July 2018","After Salo, or The 120 Days of Sodom, this is the scariest movie I have seen, and I have seen this 5 times! At the beginning of Roger Ebert's 4/4 star review, he writes:

""We're instinctively afraid of natural things (snakes, barking dogs, the dark) but have to be taught to fear walking into traffic or touching an electrical wire. Horror films that tap into our hard-wired instinctive fears probe a deeper place than movies with more sophisticated threats. A villain is only an actor, but a shark is more than a shark.""

And that is what make The Blair Witch Project so effective. It depends on the sounds of nature that would scare you at night. It is what should really scare you in life. It does not use scary Psycho music(I mean, that's a good movie, but you know when she will die in the shower!), or other warnings. it just let's it happen.

And the the most scariest thing is how many times they say the F word!

If you want a truly scary movie, look no further than this!","10"
"sloopydrew","The scariest thing about this film was how badly the critics overrated it","24 June 2000","When Daniel Myrick and Eduardo Sanchez came up with the idea to create a mock documentary made solely to creep people out, they were definitely playing around with a good idea. The movie could be made on an extremely tight budget. The shaky camera work and poor film quality would actually do the film a service, by making it seem all the more genuine. And, finally, the movie could rake in a fortune because, when you think about it, who doesn't like to hear a good ghost story, every so often? Too bad this one doesn't chill you to the bone, like the directors had intended.

The long, arduous filler scenes used between the scares also made Witch a less-than-perfect ""project."" We have the 2 minute horror scene, during the night, then the 10 minute filler, during the day. After 2 or 3 times, this cycle becomes an exercise in tedium. Not to mention, despite what everyone is saying, the horror scenes weren't really that terrifying . . . with exception to one.

It is this scene, the last 5 minutes of the film, where The Blair Witch Project succeeds amazingly well. What is revealed during the last 5 minutes of Witch (don't worry, I'm not going to tell you what it is), will have the hairs on the back of your neck standing on end. This isn't something you'll forget easily. Once you've seen it, it's gonna be ingrained inside of your brain for a long time. You could come down with Alzheimer's, be hit by a truck, fall off of a bridge, and be thrown into a coma, and you still wouldn't forget the finale of this film. It's that creepy. That horrifyingly memorable. That intense. It's what The Blair Witch Project, in its entirety, reached for, but never quite grasped.","4"
"ozymandiaskingofkings","Badly made, badly acted and about as scary as a boy scout camping trip.","20 October 2009","It's not often I say this, but i hate this film. It's a boring, badly written, badly made piece of crap posing as an arty verite style film, and has it's status purely due to hype and clever marketing gimmickry. Most of the action is plot less, just some morons bumbling round some woods. I mean, I used to go camping in woods with my dad all the time, it's not an especially scary environment for me. Plus: it's some damn woods, not the Amazon jungle. There's bound to be other people there and it's not exactly going to be hard to find your way out. It's just not believable. And most of the film is just them lost in some woods, it's not exciting, it's just something that happens thats inconvenient. It's like making a horror film about missing a bus, or something.

Unlike films such as Deliverance or Eden Lake, I never actually felt the protagonists were in any actual danger. Sure the odd creepy thing happens, but apart from the end (which I admit was great) scary stuff is few and far between and as for the documentary aspect, surely the point of a documentary is you shoot the interesting/relevant stuff. Their rationale for continuing to film was nowhere near as persuasive as the one in REC.

I guess the main reason I didn't like the film was that I really didn't care about any of the characters. Heather just spent all her time whining/crying, whereas the two guys had almost no personality at all. I really wasn't bothered what happened to them. And there just wasn't enough to hold my interest, the ideas ran out as soon as they entered the woods. Not enough happened to sustain my interest and given the film was only 80 minutes long, thats really saying something. It felt to me like a film school short that had been expanded to me, rather than a fully rounded film.

A good comparison is The Evil Dead where the direction and camera work served to create tension. In Blair Witch is looks in parts like they just ran aimlessly round some woods with a camera, while in Raimi's film the camera also prowls around and snakes along the ground, but it serves a purpose in doing so, offering a perspective of the entity that haunts the woods. In Blair Witch, the trouble isn't subtlety, it's that we don't see ANYTHING remotely frightening, not even glimpsed.

It isn't like Rosemary's Baby where the questions of what is supernatural and what is just coincidence/imagination pervade throughout the film but are finally resolved, there is a frustrating lack of closure. Sure, you could say it's just being left open to interpretation, but there are so few clues/pieces of information in the film with which the audience can gain any understanding, I just see it as sloppy writing. It started brilliantly, the interviews with the townspeople seemingly foreshadowing a much better film which ultimately never materialises, but doesn't build on that. I don't want to see a lot of hokey special effects of anything, but I did expect to see more horrific things happening than just three irritating people walking round a wood for what felt like forever.

I don't expect people to go watch clichéd slashers and remakes. I hate those movies too. But there are a great many better horror films out there than this one and it mystifies me why this one was singled out for so much acclaim. OK, so the 90s being a rubbish overall decade for horror probably helped Blair Witch and the verite style is cool to begin with, but the whole thing is underplotted and thinks it's much smarter than it is. It substitutes incoherence for a plot and screaming/bickering for intelligent dialogue and effective character development. This film is sort of like the emperor with no clothes. Everyone is told of it's brilliance, and people follow suit without really stepping back and looking how it works as a film, as a narrative work or a genre piece. The truth is, it doesn't work well as either.","1"
"Filmdokter","So simple yet so effective","5 May 2022","The Blair Witch Project is the definition of a sleeper hit. Made for peanuts in '99 it was a global box office hit and kick started the subgenre of found footage horror. The film is so effective as a horror film although we never really see anything. And that is the strength of the film: the home video style, the setting, the shake camera...it gets underneath your skin. It is a prime example of the rule that NOT showing something is much more frightening than actually showing it. A stone cold classic horror film. And rightfully so.","8"

There are thousands of Found Footage movies nowadays like Chronicle, Cloverfield, REC and so many others that wouldn't exist without the Blair Witch Project.

Despite the hundreds of movies that have used this technique only a handful have been any good.The Blair Witch Project succeeds more on what you can't see than what you can. The human terror of darkness is used to full effect here and the actors do such a stellar job of being immersed in the fear of the unknown that it swoops you right along with them. The Blair Witch Project stands as a classic that is still unsettling but also stretched the rules of a genre and how films were made and seen.","10"

For the people that think this is better than the second is something wrong with you. The Sequel should of been the original. This is just to me the worst movie to date and release of it.

I left the theater saying what the h*ll was that crap. Then after I hear it was the most watched movie, and I was like WTF! How stupid is that? Very, very, very stupid as you can get. Sorry, for all this that I am saying about this movie. NOT! I feel sad for people that thought this would be something to enjoy. For being rated R. What would be considered R?

More of a funniest home video. What was that girl doing in the tent filming her nostrils with snot hanging out. LOL! That was stupid as heck. I laughed at that more than be scared. It was trying to be what it was not. That is not a horror it was a comedy.

It is a film that focuses on physical and mental dislocation, and mood. Unfortunately, despite its best efforts to unnerve the viewer, it is boring, and an endurance test to watch because of its chaotic camera-work. The producers of the film created a brilliant, effective internet campaign that convinced easily satisfied non-horror loving audiences that they were about to see something really scary.

People who've actually just watched this for the first time (I find this crazy, have you been living on Mars?) have to realise that this is TWENTY THREE years old! If you've seen the likes of the Paranormal Activity franchise, Cloverfield, End Of Watch (3 different genre's there) then you have to thank the Blair Witch crew. If you've seen others but find this a bit lame then remember, those movies you're comparing this to, thank the Blair Witch crew. If you've ever enjoyed ANY Found Footage movies, thank the Blair Witch crew. It's simple in its premise, it blew the horror genre right up to peoples faces and ended what was a pretty lean decade for horror (90's) and kicked the 2000s into horror overdrive. If you weren't old enough to get totally hyped up because this ""major story"", which was all over the tv and the internet and was realistic enough for IMDb to have the 3 main characters listed that their whereabouts were ""unknown"" then you'll see it was a pretty huge stunt which pissed a good few people off. Even Roger Ebert has it down as 10/10 and he was always pretty damning on horror movies in general. This movie changed an entire industry and created thousands upon thousands of people's perception about making a story they'd written be brought to a cinema, vod and direct to sale.

Then I decide to watch it once again and I surprised by the way it amuse me. Refreshing, thrilling and innovating as well. The actors really natural on their roles, the plot is thicken, and the dark atmosphere is awakening. I almost believe that this is a documentary feature.

BWP is fit all my expectations about a decent horror movies, things that really rare in the post-Scream horror movies. The documentary style is adding the plus point of the movie. In general, BWP is an alternative horror movie that guarantees to entertain you.

As anyone, the first time I set foot in the ocean after seeing JAWS for the first time, I was nervous. Let me tell you in order to get from the movie theater to my house, I have to drive through the woods.

Let me just add that even the disagreeable elements, like Heather's annoying as hell character, came through as utterly real. Too bad that nothing good followed this because the BWP was as devastating a masterwork as you're ever gonna get for about 30K. Or a lot more. PS What was fun was asking cynical friends who trashed it, Well, what would YOU have done? One guy told me he would've simply started running. Nobody else had any suggestions at all. I've often wondered about fire - it was damp but was there no way to kindle as big a blaze as they could?","10"
"soranno","This is supposed to be a horror film?!","30 October 2002","The trailers for this mega disappointment of a horror film inaccurately made it seem like it was going to be the scariest film ever made. When I finally got my long awaited chance to see the film, I kept looking at the nearest clock waiting for something really scary to happen and at other times just wondering when the truly annoying adventures of its three leading characters would end. I think Jabba The Hutt in ""Star Wars"" scared me more than this film. It's basically just a tireless exercise in testing the viewer's patience in which a certain word that begins with the letter ""f"" takes up about half of the inept dialogue and many things go by unexplained thus confusing the viewer. It all has to do with some legend about some being called the ""Blair Witch"" that may or may not exist but long before the time this film ends the viewer probably won't care anymore anyway if it exists. I know I certainly didn't. The shaky camera movements throughout the documentary filmed style mess are especially tedious. One of the poorest excuses for a horror film ever.",NA

WAS extremely over-hyped. but I enjoyed the hype! my friends and I had been having dinner out when we just looked at each other, said we HAVE TO go right now and see this-and bolted.

I really think the hype was part of the fun. If you see it expecting a certain type of movie you will be disappointed. There are parts that are not so scary and parts that even drag a little.

However-that said-this IS one creepy movie-not a masterpiece and maybe not as horrifying as it was supposed to be but definitely a creepy movie, eerie in the psychological sense and well acted. Worth seeing just for the sheer uniqueness of the concept though people with motion sickness may want to think about taking something for that beforehand.

"Michael Kenmore","An idiotic exercise in independent filmmaking","23 October 1999","Man...this is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. I have never seen the movie as bad as the 80s Z-grade movies I watched on USA Up All Night. I'd rather sit through Guccione's integrated version of Calibula than endure this nauseatingly mindless trash again.

The Blair Witch Project is the epitome of the independent filmmaking method that gleefully indulges in the four-letter word to cover up the fact that whenever the dialogues and ideas fizzle out, there always come the obligatory obscene and vulgar language in practically every line of dialogue to make up for the lack of substance and quality. Don't get me wrong, I have no problem with the level of profanity as long as the movie is interesting and balanced. But this movie went so far as to get on my nerves and made me so angry I wanted to unleash the fury on the videotape as soon as it ejects from the VCR after the movie ends.

The reason why BWP was made is simple: two amateur filmmakers kicked around the idea, recruited the young people and loaned them with the cameras to go into the woods to make a psychologically scary movie. The result is a mind-numbingly tedious exercise in self-indulgence and bad attitude all the way. This is the reason why I found the movie less scary and more irritating. Heather was so gratingly annoying I wanted to kill her onscreen. I literally had to beg for Joshua and Michael to die quickly and painlessly because they holler and scream and cuss at each other ALL THE TIME after the first half hour. At least they deserve the fateful death in the movie, but the fact that never cease to amaze me is that the so-called actors who relies on improvision comprising mostly of ""J***s C****t! F**k! S**t!"" are still alive and kicking.

What astounds me is that this overblown, overhyped and overrated film made big bucks at the B.O. and the filmmakers are laughing all the way to the bank. I hope and pray that they (and the filmmaking duo and the Artisan execs) will never work in Hollywood again because of this travesty that undermines the importance of reasonable quality and instills the repetitive use of the F-word and the abuse of the Lord's (whoever the Lord is, depending on your view and belief) name legitimate to make the product even more compelling.

This week-end, my girlfriend and I saw ""The Blair Witch"" project on French TV. I was very impatient to see it after all the hype and rave reviews it got when it was released. Dammit, it sucked. It really did. All you have in this movie is three idiots lost in the woods, screaming at each other. And that's it ! Only this. Nothing happens at all. Most of the time, the screen is just pitch-dark, or so obscure that you can't see anything. The plot, which relies on so-called realism is plain stupid. For instance, how come these guys didn't hire a guide to help them find their way in the forest ? And why the hell does one of the characters just throw away the map ? How come their camera's battery never runs out ? And when a person is about to die, does he/she really keep filming himself/herself without doing anything else ? The list could go on and on. Not only is this movie stupid and ridiculous but above all, it is boring, terribly boring. I mean it : don't expect this to frighten you. In my opinion, absolutely nothing can redeem this thing. And I can't possibly understand why some people acclaimed it and made it such a huge success. The original concept may have been good but the actual result is a complete failure. One of the worst films I've ever seen.

"mattwillandis","Time to set the record straight","18 November 2020","Let's be honest, anybody who likes horror and didn't watch this film within its first two weeks in theaters likely has heard hype about this movie in some sense. I was no exception to this rule, and as I watched this film for the first time yesterday, and hadn't even existed when it was released, this film had twenty years of hype and expectations to meet for me. And while it is 100% true that hype will destroy a movie if too excessive, I must admit I can't say this film was hit by it too much. There are two problems that can befall upon older classic movies. One: either they become culturally irrelevant or made obsolete newer films (or to a lesser extent politically incorrect, like with ""gone with the wind"")(though I digress I still like that film), in story(for instance, a superhero movie from the forties will doubtfully get picked over a modern superhero film by someone) . Or two, the film becomes so old it is almost a foreign experience to watch (the technology, language, etc). To my knowledge, this film is very good at avoiding both problems. It is a very simple story, about kids lost in the woods, and possibly getting stalked by a witch, so it cleverly avoids problem one by by not having any added baggage to it's story and making what it DOES have in the story very good. And two, since the film is almost all in the woods, it's hard to find much technology to be confused by and the language is simple so it's not confusing either. Now admittedly it is ""filmed"" on old school cameras, which is admittedly a pretty big part of the movie, that being, the ""found footage"" aesthetic. But it would take two seconds to explain the cameras to someone else, so I don't find it a huge problem. Now that that's out of the way, let's get on to the actual movie. It's simplicity is it's biggest strength, and the camera grain adds another layer of fright to the movie. It has fantastic performances all around, and while a second viewing will not be nearly as frightening, it makes a very effective one-time horror film. One thing I must admit though, is that we never actually see the Blair witch. Now originally there was supposed to be a silhouette of her present in one of the scenes, but the camera angle didn't show her, and for reasons unknown to me, they never reshot the scene. While in some cases seeing the monster can be a downer or would lessen the film, with something like ""the Blair witch project"", I think it would've benefited from seeing her in some way. I don't mean like a full reveal, but a shadow, or a silhouette or a hand, just something to give the characters fears some legitimacy, would've been beneficial to the movie. Other than that, it's a good movie, and while not exactly enjoyable to watch because of how depressing and mean spirited it is, it's well made and was deserving of its praise. Give it a view :)","8"

Although the movie isn't very good and it just seems to have gotten a cult following because they went in a realistic direction. Where it seems like the incident with the students and the Blair Witch really happened, but besides that there is nothing really good about this. I am sure the creators of this film is really happy to receive other people's hard earned money for a below mediocre movie such as this. Maybe they thought the incident really happened and was entertained by that one factor. And since the creators made this with a shoestring budget, and ended up getting back way more than they invested on it. I think my favorite part of the movie though is when all three students end up getting killed by the witch cause I hated everyone in this and leading some viewers to really overrate this, there just isn't anything that will make the audience feel threatened. And I ain't saying that cause the film hardly has any violence in it, most of this movie's run time is taken up with three idiots running around screaming over half the time. I give it some props for leading some viewers as if this is something real with it's marketing. I remember when this movie first came out, it was when I was in elementary and just about everyone was making a big deal out of it. Maybe because it's the first found footage movie that I know that came out.

"Lucabrasisleeps","Frustrating Horror Film","2 February 2015","I don't want to give this a low rating. It is an original film. Yes Cannibal holocaust did this before, but that was a campy fun horror movie. It didn't really seem real in the way this one seems to be. When I watch this movie, I clearly see the characteristics of all its imitators (The Last exorcism, Paranormal activity). But somehow this misses the mark.

One of the major issues are the characters. For me, a slow burn horror movie can never work without enjoyable characters. Here what I saw was a bunch of immature people who do the worst things at the worst possible moments (kicking the flag?). Not that it matters though since maybe it was an Evil Dead sort of a situation anyway. But still these are things that maybe not many people would do in that situation. The constant bickering and the arguments drove me nuts. It spoils whatever atmosphere they want to create.

Again, the same criticisms of found footage movies apply here as well. While in a movie like Paranormal activity, the cameras can be explained, here it is incomprehensible why such hysterical people would still be able to hold on to cameras even in the worst moments. That doesn't make that much sense. Still I am willing to ignore these things if the movie isn't boring.

That is the biggest problem. Apart from the constant shaky cam and arguments, there really isn't much happening in the whole movie. And even when it happens, you can't see much anyway. No, it isn't the old style arty horror movie style, it is a shaky cam style where the camera shakes so much, you can't really see much. The ending is typical of the style. Nothing is visible and everybody dies. I was left unsatisfied by this style. It is funny, I do like other Eduardo Sanchez movies like Lovely molly and Altered.

Anyway I am disappointed very much. I can't rate it lower than 4 since it is clearly a unique horror movie but I can't say I enjoyed it.","4"

One word of warning though: you MUST see this film on the big screen, it just will not work if you see it on video. I guess that is the reason why a relatively high percentage of people gave this film 1 / 10 points. And you have to be prepared for a cinematic experience apart from the Hollywood mainstream.

"bob the moo","Over-hyped but fresh and scary","27 July 2002","In the woods outside of Burkittesville, Maryland a legend exists about the Blair Witch who supposedly killed many children in the 1940's. A trio of film makers decide to go into the woods for their student project to document what they find in comparison with the legend itself. They go missing. A year later their footage is discovered and pit together to reveal what they went through when they became lost in the woods. This film is the footage they recorded.

There is no doubting that hype was both the making and breaking of this film. The hype got this small, no-budget film into multiplexes world wide where otherwise it wouldn't have got in the front door. However the hype also raised expectation so that people were expecting the horrors to end all horrors etc. Viewed without any hype this would have been so much better  but on a wave on such expectation few things can avoid coming down a bit.

Outside of this the set up is very good  put forward as true. The way the film starts by mixing interviews with recollections of the legend etc gives us enough information to join the trio on their journey. The film then begins to journey into the woods and the tension build nicely as we share some of the group's fear.

A lot of this comes down to the cast  they all start cheerful and young but as they go on they do seem genuinely tired and scared  this helps us believe. The hand held cameras add to the realism but also put us right there with the group (if also means we don't see things but the fear comes from what's outside of eye line).

Now the film is very basic but in many ways that helps it. There is no hidden subtext, no baggage  just things going downhill. The film ends in the most basic way and is good for it. While it may not be the most scary thing ever seen, it is refreshing to se a horror film that isn't another cliché ridden slasher flick.

Overall it may be overhyped and be suffering from a certain amount of backlash, but this is a very sharp, tight, clever and scary little film. It is best viewed as a great independent and not a multiplex filler that it was hyped to be.",NA

When I first saw this movie, I actually thought that this whole thing was real. And I believed this for quite some time (almost a year), until I saw something at the end of the movie that said that it was all fiction and after I saw the sequel, BOOK OF SHADOWS: BLAIR WITCH 2, I was positive that this was all fake. But there still are some people that believe this is real. The entire film is shot on a home video camcorder that is to document the final days of a three-person documentary film crew, going into the Black Hills Forest of Maryland to make a movie about the legendary Blair Witch. The creators of this film were very smart. They thought their plan out very well. Although many residents of the town itself were very angry with this, I find that it is great that they could create such a phenomenon with such a simple project idea. But that might be just because I myself don't actually live in Burkittsville (but that is what I said for my location anyhow). I am happy that Marilyn Manson and Korn finally did a song about the Blair Witch. Maybe it will be in the third film. The end credits even made it look like this was real. If you are a fan of movies where you never really see the evil that lurks in the ominous shadows of the movie, then this one is for you. But you are just a person who is thinking of seeing this because it sounds different, then stay away. You be just another person who will moan and groan about how bad it was and then I will just have to slap you in the face, too....5/5.","10"

"JamesHitchcock","Is This Some Sort of Bad Joke?","27 May 2005","Is this some sort of bad joke? The film starts with the statement: ""In October of 1994, three student film makers disappeared in the woods near Burkittesville, Maryland. One year later, their footage was found."" Everything that follows is supposed to be the footage shot by the vanished students before they disappeared while making a documentary about a local witchcraft legend. I understand that , although the film is a work of fiction, it was originally marketed as a true story. A similar marketing technique was used to sell the film ""Fargo"", but the dubious ethics of the procedure do not affect the quality of that film, which was excellent. ""The Blair Witch Project"" is anything but.

The film has a sort of faux-naif quality about it. It was shot on hand-held cameras in a deliberate attempt to mimic an amateur style of film-making, although the results are so poor that they would shame even the average home movie, let alone a project made by a group of student film makers, who would presumably have received some sort of training in basic film technique. Only a few minutes of the supposed ""footage"", in fact, consists of material which might conceivably have formed part of the projected documentary. Most of the rest consists of scenes of the three students wandering about after getting lost in the forest, endlessly quarrelling with and screaming at each other in a torrent of foul language. Why the supposed students would have wasted their film on these scenes is not explained. It appears, from a series of unexplained occurrences, that someone, or something, is pursuing the students, although it is never clear exactly who or what is involved. No explanation for their disappearance is ever given.

The film has sometimes been praised for reinventing the horror genre for the late nineties, but this strikes me as an impossible ambition. The genre seems to have become stuck in a cul-de-sac, able to inspire little beyond cynically self-mocking parodies along the lines of the ""Scream"" and ""Scary Movies"" series. ""The Blair Witch Project"" never succeeds in breaking out of this cul-de-sac for the reason that its approach is a quite uninteresting one; lengthy, badly-shot scenes of people running through the woods and shouting at one another do not make for entertaining viewing. I was never able to feel either sympathy for such an unsympathetic bunch or terror on their behalf. There was only one frightening thing about the film: that such a badly-made, badly-acted, over-hyped film could manage to generate such media attention and to achieve such success at the box office. 2/10","2"
"ShadeGrenade","If You Go Down To The Woods Today...","14 September 2006","Daniel Myrick and Eduardo Sanchez's 'The Blair Witch Project' caused a sensation when released in 1999. It was the first movie to become a hit as the result of the internet, and deservedly so. The low budget horror movie is the perfect antidote to those formulaic Hollywood shockers in which nubile co-eds get chased by some knife-wielding idiot in a mask.

A group of students - Heather Donahue, Joshua Leonard, and Michael C.Williams - venture into woods in Maryland to make a documentary about the notorious 'Blair Witch', a sorceress believed to have actually existed and been responsible for many deaths. At first, the assignment is fun, but then things go wrong; the map goes missing, they argue amongst themselves as to whose fault it was, and they cannot find their way back to Burdittville. Strange noises can be heard at night. Worst of all, peculiar stick figures are found. Something is out in the forest with them, watching their every move, but what?

As noted earlier, 'Project' was made on a very small budget. But for once this was an asset rather than a liability. So convincingly realistic did it turn out that cinema-goers thought they were watching a real video diary. The principal cast members give natural performances, particularly Donahue. For me, it brought back uncomfortable memories of camping with friends in the woods and being kept awake all night by owls and other nocturnal beasts! It owes a great debt to those eerie 'Ghost Stories For Christmas' made by the B.B.C. in the '70's, such as 'The Signalman'. It works as much on the imagination as on the senses. The film starts slowly, then ratchets up the tension so fast that by the end you're absolutely terrified. The ending is deliberately ambiguous. All we know is that the students were never found, and the film footage provides the only clue to their fate.

For a short time, it looked as though there was to be a major shift towards a more natural style of horror movie, but it does not seem to have happened. Many movies have copied the look of 'Project' - the quick-fire editing, the shaky camera-work - but alas not the feel.

There was a sequel - 'Blair Witch 2: Book Of Shadows' - made the following year, which was everything the first was not - uninspired and silly. If you're planning on going camping in woods, whatever you do, don't watch 'Project' the night before.","10"

"Nick_Milligan","A chilling, original, clever piece of film-making","3 May 2000","The Blair Witch Project is a film that was slaughtered by hype and propaganda. When the previews came out it, the film was described as being the scariest movie ever made and it was compared to films such as The Exorcist. As a result, people went to see the movie expecting to be frightened out of their mind. In a lot of cases, the film had trouble living up to these expectations. I feel this film has been treated incredibly unfairly by the public because it is a very scary movie. You find a lot of people didn't like it because you never actually see the witch. Other people say there wasn't enough violence. I think this movie is very tastefully made and uses the art of subtlety to scare its audience. The scariest thing about the film is its intense realism and credibility. It seems so realistic. You can imagine it happening to you. If you haven't seen this movie, then go and see it for yourself. The acting is brilliant and the atmosphere is chilling. Don't compare it to any other movie until you see it. It brilliant. 5 stars","10"
"squeezebox","Superb, one of the best horror movies of the 90's","16 June 2003","THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT wound up the unfortunate victim of self-canibalization. Artisan relentlessly marketed and merchandised what should have remained a creepy little curiosity destined for cult obscurity. While it made the company millions of dollars, the non-stop BLAIR WITCH hubbub destroyed the movie's staying power, at least with a wide audience.

But maybe this movie should never have been seen by a wide audience. Maybe the movie's advertising should have been word-of-mouth driven ONLY. Maybe this movie should have never been released theatrically, at least not on a large scale. Trying to appeal to a generation whose idea of horror is SCREAM, when the product you are selling is more along the lines of grittier horrors such as CANNIBAL HOLOCAUST or THE TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE, is destined to ultimately fail. Artisan may have made a killing, but they killed the movie in the process.

BLAIR WITCH is one of the few movies I can think of that works better on the small screen. When watching a grainy underground movie on TV, one feels they are seeing something subversive and taboo. Seeing the very same thing on the big screen comes off as overly stylized, cinema-verite gone wild. This is largely due to the overuse of hand-held photography in commercials and on MTV--the very audience of which is whom BLAIR WITCH was directed toward.

Now, mention THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT and you'll hear, ""It sucked,"" ""It wasn't scary,"" ""Heather Donohue is an annoying bitch,"" ""The camera work was terrible,"" ""It was boring,"" ""I'm sick of it.""

The last comment is the only one with any degree of validity.

Anyone who did not find this movie even the least bit intense or eerie went into it determined to not let it affect them. As far as the ridiculous criticism of Donohue's performance, her CHARACTER was indeed an annoying bitch. She was obnoxious, loud, pushy and irritating. In other words, her performance was perfect.

Perhaps the dumbest of all the backlash against this movie were complaints about the shaky camerawork. You see, it's really hard to sprint through the woods over uneven ground and retain a steady frame--especially when you may have forgotten you were even carrying a camera! Found documentary footage is rarely very steady or polished, especially when it comes from the cameras of people being pursued by ghosts in the woods.

In my personal opinion, THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT is a solid, creepy, intense, suspensful, entertaining thriller. It moves along at a swift pace and manages a sense of anxiety rarely captured in American cinema, even during the early humorous scenes. It's terror works much in the same way as David Lynch's TWIN PEAKS FIRE WALK WITH ME or Gasper Noe's IRREVERSIBLE--we know, to some extent, the protagonists fate at the beginning of the movie, so the entire story has a sense of dread and doom about it.

I loved this movie. Loved it. There's nothing to read into it, nothing to figure out, nothing to ponder over. It is what it is. A good, scary shriek show. They're a dying breed these days.",NA

"freakfire-1","Bambi Woods loves the Blair Witch","9 March 2008","Let me start by saying that this is not a documentary nor does it really hide the fact that its not. The obvious switching between one camera to another without breaking audio leads one easily to conclude that. Not only that, but where was the extra juice for all the video they took? Going into the woods and being followed by someone or something. That is not scary. Sometimes the people argue with one another and improv, which was funny at one point. But that and the house scene, were the only moments that were even remotely interesting.

I just wasn't impressed. Maybe adding Bambi Woods to the cast would have made things more interesting. Because there is no other reason to watch it again. ""F""","1"

"TheMovieDiorama","The Blair Witch Project will have you become lost in your own boredom.","2 October 2018","The horror that popularised the ""found footage"" sub-genre (some would even say pioneer), gave way to future ultra low-budgeted features and proved that you don't need elaborate production values to make a film. You just need trees, rocks and a map. Now everybody go out and make a film! Unfortunately I'm not reviewing the excellently innovative marketing campaign that the film bolstered. I'm critiquing this snoozefest instead. A group of film students are filming a documentary about the ""Blair Witch"" legend and set off out into the woods to find evidence. Where they soon encounter frightening piles of rocks, spooky dangling sticks and a terrifying lack of basic orienteering skills. Oh yes, the scare factor is at an all-time high! Sit back, relax and prepare yourself to watch absolutely nothing. Nothing! Just three ridiculously unlikeable characters shouting and screaming at each other for 78 minutes whilst aimlessly wandering around a woodland area. ""Where's the map!?""! Someone give me a camera and find me some friends, I'll do the exact same thing and make a incalculable amount of money. On a serious note, I appreciate the stripped-back concept. It's not what you see that induces fear, but your other senses perceiving the unknown. A surround sound system works most efficiently as footsteps and faint screams are heard in every direction, creating an eerie environment. But when the poorly developed characters, story and pace are used to substitute onscreen scares, it doesn't work. You don't care. You just want the ""Blair Witch"" to savagely destroy them immediately. 78 minutes felt like 2 hours, honestly it is that poorly paced and boring. It's clear that The Blair Witch Project is divisive, and I suspect my opinion would be different if I watched it back in '99 with all the ""is it real?"" hype. Alas, it's aged badly. So much so that it just isn't scary, remotely interesting or captivating. Don't even get me started on that ending...","3"
"alexcomputerkid","We know we are going to get good horror films in the years to come but The Blair Witch Project will always be beside those at the top","4 November 2013","""In October 1994, three film student filmmakers disappeared in the woods near Burkittsville, Maryland while shooting a documentary...."" ""A year later their footage was found"" This great quote in short tells the details of the Blair Witch plot. It is a plot that like most horror films can be questioned. How can the woods be the only setting? What is the purpose to this? Could it really work with only three cast members? Taking this all together, still The Blair Witch Project is something we could never have experienced or predicted what it was going to be.

By using a small budget of only $20,000 to $25,000 aside from the opening shots, The Blair Witch Project is set only in the woods. The setting of the woods helps this film break the norm for horror movies. The woods here have a strange eerie feel, and is very original. You have the feeling along with characters of never getting out and no doubt it will you make at wilderness quite differently.

With the small budget, the film only needs three cast members. Heather (Heather Donahue) is the only girl of the group and really emerges as the leader as they try to get out of the woods. Mike (Michael Williams) is a character who becomes very creepy once the harmful effects in the woods prey on him. Josh (Joshua Leonard) is the quiet member of the group in this bad situation. The cast really works due to the good acting by actors who are unknowns who we don't recognize making it realistic.

After a plot and story that seems like it can't get much better, the ending is one that REALLY can't much better. The ending comes out of nowhere as again it is in the woods and in a place that seems like it's in the middle of nowhere. It is a heart-pounding and very scary ending. The final shot is very clever as there are different possible theories raised about what just happened. This is one of the best endings in movie history, no doubt.

The Blair Witch Project is not normal horror. It is horror that goes way above the normal common ground and makes it's own mark on the movie world. We know we are going to get good horror films in the years to come but The Blair Witch Project will always be beside those at the top.","10"

One of my all time favorites for sure.","19 May 2021","The Blair Witch Project (1999) is a DVD I own and had to rewatch after recently following the footsteps of the film team. The movie focuses around 3 film students who want to capture the story of the small town of Burkittsville, Maryland who has a large number of children that have disappeared. The rumors are that the Blair Witch resides in the woods just outside of town called Black Hills forest and follows the filmmakers as they search for signs of the witch in that very forest. This movie was directed by Daniel Myrick and Eduardo Sanchez in their directorial debuts and stars Heather Donahue (Taken), Joshua Leonard (Depraved) and Michael C. Williams (Altered). I was living in New York when a documentary aired on television that told the story of 3 kids who disappeared in the woods and went into great detail on the legend of the Blair Witch and at the end of the documentary the preview for this movie aired. I was living in Far Rockaway, Queens at the time and got so excited to see this movie. Opening weekend we went to Virgin Megastore in Time Square and saw this masterpieces that changed my life forever.

Ever been in a car on the way to your parent's house on Thanksgiving and everyone in the car just bickers, bickers, and bickers? Put that in front of a Parkinson's Patient using a handheld video camera and you have the Blair Witch Project.

I'll keep this real short, because most of the negatives have already been discussed. But explain this; these three kids get lost in the woods, and even after they're terrified and at the point when survival is the number one priority, why did they continue to film the whole thing? (Even when they indulged into a few physical fights? Wouldn't they at least set the camera down?) This is amateur filmmaking at best, so shoestring and holed that it probably didn't even take a full day to square it out. You don't need a huge budget to make a good film, but if you extend your time, efforts will prove to be more thought out and worthwhile. That wasn't the case here. The premise was extremely mundane (Anyone who hasn't seen The Vanishing, Cannibal Holocaust or 84 Charlie Mopic, first, would understand), the delivery was ill-concieved and overbaked, and the characters were no less annoying than those in the common Hollywood teen horror flick.

"trashgang","love or hate it, it started a new genre","19 September 2016","Love or hate it, it's the film that started a new era in the horror genre, the found footage. It's true, Cannibal Holocaust (1980) started it all but this flick came out in the beginning of the internet. The Web was something that everybody started to know and this flick was well promoted on that way. Not everybody was comfortable with the web and giving nothing away except the title did the thing. I was in the US when it was promoted and yes, you did believe what you saw.

Cannibal Holocaust surely was a found footage but it was all about cannibalism. And it's there that Holocaust fitted in. The Blair Witch was controversial because love or hate, no in between was possible. Some were afraid seeing it others fell asleep. But it do has a few creep moments especially the night scenes.

Is it all that great, that's the big issue because the only effects used are done with branches and stones. And that's just why it all looked real.

The remake is now a few days before release so I will surely go watch it. Therefor I recommend to see the original one which also spawned a sequel that was terrible. But without the Blair we would never had the Paranormal Activity franchise and so many other found footage flicks.

"Spleen","Dull incompetence wrapped up in false advertising","19 May 2000","It's either a documentary or a work of fiction. If it's a documentary it's a fraudulent one. (It's not even a clever fraud. I wouldn't have thought that such grotesquely inept camera-jiggling could have fooled anyone; but apparently it did.) If it's a documentary then it's none of MY business to condemn it - I should simply report the scam to the police, the broadcasting tribunal, etc. and hope that someone will have the nerve to prosecute.

Taken as a work of fiction `The Blair Witch Project' is possibly the most wretched that has ever come to my attention. I'm serious. I can think of works of fiction that are worse in some positive way - books by Edgar Rice Burroughs, for instance - and I can't be expected to keep every single forgettable old book or television show lodged in my memory - still, I know of no other work so thoroughly lacklustre. We don't even get the bare minimum of competent camera work we demand as a matter of course in other lame, incompetent endeavours. The camera wobbles stupidly and does NOTHING else. It doesn't even give us information. The characters TELL us everything that's going on, in their long-winded way; they then offer us the camera footage as a kind of proof that they're not lying. What's true of the images is true of the sound, too. Heather and crew hear some `scary' noises at night; but do WE get a chance to listen to them properly, to decide for ourselves if they're scary or not? Nope: instead we get an earfull of everyone panicking and DESCRIBING the sounds that I'm surprised they can still hear over the gabble of their own voices.

How could something so bad as `The Blair Witch Project' turn a profit? How could it show, not just a profit, but the greatest return on investment of any film in history; how could it, despite all the people who walked out of the cinema or wished that they had, produce a few testimonials from people who said that they were duly scared - even that they LIKED it? I think I have an answer. The film disguised itself as a documentary. The dullest footage of the most banal murder has its attractions, provided it's genuine. Fictional murders have to work, so to speak, to be interesting: real murders automatically are. A simple lie can transform eighty minutes of utter rubbish into box office gold.

But you wouldn't want to tell an open lie too blatantly or too consistently. The law still has SOME teeth. A better tactic is to persuade people to pretend - not imagine, but PRETEND - that they're watching a documentary. If we can't really believe that this is a documentary, they'd like us to come as close to really believing as possible. Fiction is all about `suspending disbelief', right?

Well, no, it isn't. A good work of fiction can frighten us, thrill us, fill us with aching longing and/or keen interest, etc. without asking us to be so feeble-witted as to suspend disbelief. `The Blair Witch Project' can't.

P.S.: Some say we should be merciful because the film only cost $30 000 to make. But what does this have to do with us? It's not as if they reduced admission prices in consequence.","1"
"Yiannis_Galidakis","What the heck?","16 October 2020","The first and best of the ""found footage"" genre. Terrific cinematography - albeit somewhat tiring trying to immitate an amateur camera, interesting development of characters and nice gradual increase of tension and terror, culminating in an apotheosis of voodoo-like magic scenery with associated absurd terrorific bells & whistles. Leaves the viewer hanging with ""wth WAS that thing"", and it's best that way, without revealing too many details about the perpetrator of all the terror. Gist of the story implies that ""it"" cannot be human or animal, but something else, probably inbetween the two, and that's what I liked best. Time looping, path looping, unexplained memory and object loss, random involuntary wondering in the maze that is the colorful American woods, all leading to the inevitable: Loss of sanity from scaring your living daylights from the terror of the unknown in more than one subtle way.

""It"" is haunting you. ""It"" shouldn't exist according to conventional wisdom. Perhaps ""it"" is an illusion constructed by the locals to scare you. Perhaps ""it"" is real. You never find out before it is too late. ""It"" draws you to that basement. ""It"" is inevitable.

Friendships fall apart, along with the ""cool"" you tried to muster. Your idea of ""control"" is revealed to be the illusion it always was. Someone kicks the map into the river. Why not? It was useless. The map is another illusory weapon of control. But ""It"" goes beyond humanity's control of anything.

Still, you obsessively film the events, even as you begin to lose your sanity – or rather, begin to truly realize the above facts. ""It's the only thing I have left!"" Even if everything is falling apart, it needs to be catalogued and savored. You must document the madness and the end.

Nature all around you, you are walking in circles. Blame quickly becomes childish and meaningless. Symbols you do not understand begin to appear around the thin walls of your hideout, sounds that shouldn't exist begin to keep you awake at night. You are so far away from home. This is the primal reality that humanity cannot forget. It is ingrained in us. In the woods, it becomes impossible to look away from it. We are lost and left at the mercy of forces we cannot understand. The darkness is complete.

""I can see why you like this thing. It's like filtered Reality.""

It strikes me upon second viewing how this may be one of the essential films. It's brutal in its unpretentious, short, and effective display of our condition.",NA
"bowmanblue","The (sort of) original and (sort of) best","28 December 2015","'The Blair Witch Project' invented the 'found footage' portion of the horror genre. Well, it kind of did. The genre was technically lurking in the background, somewhere behind the slasher genre and low budget zombie flicks. You could probably trace it back to such cinematic delights as 'Cannibal Holocaust' in the seventies (only you'd probably regret it if you did). Anyway, The Blair Witch Project may not have entirely invented the type of film which is purely watching shaky hand-held camera-work filmed (for the purposes of the story) by the characters we're following, but it did bring it back to the forefront of horror-movie making. Maybe that along means I should despise it. Only I don't.

If you're not familiar with the 'found footage' genre then you probably don't watch enough horror films, therefore any interest you may have in watching three teenagers get lost in a woods will be minimal. That's pretty much the story. The three of them are film students and decide to make – you guessed it – a project on the (allegedly fictional) 'Blair Witch.' Naturally, things don't go according to plan and, if getting lost wasn't annoying enough, some unseen force starts to mess with their little school trip (and one girl gets a runny nose – if you've already seen it you'll know what I mean).

You may have picked up on my use of the word 'unseen.' For all found footage films are cheaply produced (okay, feel free to shout me down with such epics as 'Cloverfield' and the odd high budget one, but MOST are!). That way the film-makers don't really have to spend that much money on special effects when they can just have the person holding the camera shake it about a bit and then run off. This is the Blair Witch Project all over. If you're expecting hordes of computer-generated monsters storming the woods and chasing our hapless teens down then you're going to be sorely disappointed.

You have to realise that you're going to get long periods of time where not that much happens. The highlight for much of the film is crossing the same river again and again. When I read what I've written I really think I'm not really selling the ol' BWP very well. Believe it or not, I did enjoy it. Back when I watched it in 1999 it was still a fresh genre and, not including old 'video nasties' was pretty original. Plus the acting was good. It really felt adlibbed (actually I think some was) and what you might expect from watching hours upon hours of footage filmed by just some bloke behind the camera. Perhaps one of the reasons I enjoyed it was because I spent a fair proportion of my childhood as a young boy getting (sort of deliberately) lost in the woods and could relate to how creepy the prospect of never getting home again could be (although I made sure I was never more than a stone's throw away from the road and with my dad at all times!).

The three actors themselves were just about likable enough, but they do get a little bit annoying and whiney towards the end. I guess that could be explained by them slowly losing their minds due to their predicament, so, if you don't mind their constant swearing, it can be excused.

So, if you're okay with 'found footage' films and are interested in the one that spawned a hundred inferior clones, then give this one a go. It's not long and you won't waste too much of your life on it. It's genuinely creepy here and there. Just don't bother with the sequel which doesn't even bother to be original and is just your standard horror cliché-fest.

Oh, and if you don't think much to the way BWP ended, you're not the only one. It's a love or hate ending. I guess Family Guy hated it – look up the clip of Brian Griffin the cinema watching Blair Witch on Youtube and see that you're not alone. I felt a little cheated, but grew to accept that that was the way it was just going to be.","8"

"Afracious","Overrated and avoidable","9 November 1999","We had a website devoted to it, trailers, magazine articles, and superfluous information about it, so when this film finally arrived on these shores it was not going to have the same effect as when it opened in America. Shot with video cameras on a minuscule budget, the film is about an asinine trio of film students who decide to go into the woods and make a documentary about the myth of the Blair Witch. Led by the bossy and foul-mouthed Heather (who seems to use the 'F' word in every sentence) along with her two geeky-type male associates, they get lost and are stalked by an unseen witch/spirit/whatever it is, notice the word unseen, we never see anything only sets of twigs made into a strange symbol and the tent moving, and we hear lots of strange noises at night. At first the amateurish camera style works but soon becomes tiresome as the trio constantly bicker. The ending is also unsatisfactory. The film has broke box office records and good luck to it, but when you have seen it you feel letdown. There was howls of derision at the cinema when I saw it, and that was from a lot of people. An overrated disappointment. Don't believe the hype.","1"
"CinemaClown","A Landmark In Horror Filmmaking And Still The Most Influential Found Footage Film","6 October 2015","Incorrectly labelled by many as the film that launched the found footage subgenre of horror, The Blair Witch Project was a new type of scare for the majority of mainstream audience at its time of release. It was promoted as retrieved footage before its premiere, the fate of the cast was kept secret, and it was filmed in a way most home movies are made, due to which many were easily sold by its gimmick.

The Blair Witch Project concerns three film students who decide to produce a documentary about a local legend known as the Blair Witch. They travel to Maryland forest on a two day hike to find evidence to support the myth but never returned. A year later, their camera was found in the woods with the film in it. The surviving footage was eventually compiled into a movie that captures what really happened to them.

Written, directed & edited by Daniel Myrick & Eduardo Sánchez, The Blair Witch Project is a cleverly crafted cinema that gets right where most found-footage films go wrong. Here, the reason why its camera is on & around all the time actually makes sense. The story is simple and its the simplicity of it all that makes it interesting. And by not showing any supernatural entity on camera, it allows the viewers' imagination to run wild.

The shooting location & setting add a few elements of its own to the picture. Using the real names of the cast brings more plausibility to what the film claims to be. The camera-work is raw, unrefined, grainy & poorly handled, which ultimately works in its favour. Its 81 minutes of footage raises the tempo quite nicely. And since the cast is responsible for shooting the film & keep the dialogue running in a natural manner, they did a pretty good job at it.

On an overall scale, The Blair Witch Project may not look as effective today as it did during its time of release but it still ranks amongst the best examples of found footage horror. And what it lacks in conventional horror elements, it makes up with the fear of the unknown that connects its viewers with those trio of characters plus the situation they find themselves in, and that, in my opinion, is its biggest strength. A landmark in horror filmmaking and still the most influential of all found-footage flicks, this faux documentary comes recommended.",NA

It was boring, and the jerky camera work left me nauseated. The acting was decent, but the storyline didn't really go anywhere and the cinematography was atrocious. I understand they were supposed to be film 'students,' but my 10-year-old sister can shoot better footage than this. At the end I was really wondering why I bothered to sit through the whole thing, and I was definitely sorry that I actually paid to see it in a theater. If you're still curious about this one, wait until it comes out on video. At least then, hopefully, the smaller screen will reduce your motion sickness.","1"

It's really hard to find any words to say how bad this film is. I gather it's meant to be scary or spooky. Well Big Bird has got more tension in his alphabet song than the Blair Witch. How it worked for so many people, i do'nt know. It's a while since i've seen the film, so facts may be wrong but i'm not going to watch it again to correct them. Lets just say something like this did happen. You'd be up and out of that wood before you could say brown trousers. It's not something you'd stay for if you were actually there.

"zkonedog","A Precursor To ""Paranormal Activity"" (But Probably Even Better At What It Does)","4 March 2017","Just recently, I read Stephen King's horror treatise ""Danse Macabre"". In that book, he discusses ""The Blair Witch Project"" as one of the most frightening movies he has ever seen. I decided to watch it on that recommendation, and I came away fascinated by the experience.

For a basic plot summary, ""Blair Witch"" focuses on a group of three friends trying to produce an independent documentary about the so-called Blair Witch that haunts the woods surrounding a rural town. At first, the documentary seems to be going quite while, but when the trio gets lost in the woods and strange things start happening, things take a turn for the worse.

Sadly, history will probably only remember this film for the controversy that surrounded it at the theater (people thinking that the documentary was actually a real thing). While it isn't an all-time classic, to be sure, it does produce some genuine emotion by touching on some very deep themes.

Basically, this movie preys on those all-too-human emotions in which the ""monster behind the door"" (as King himself describes it) is much more scary when it is unseen. SPOILER ALERT HERE: During the entire entire, viewers never even catch so much as a glimpse of whatever/whoever is causing the strange happenings. It's the ultimate ""devil you don't know"" story.

Yet, ""Blair Witch"" also works on a more human-drama level. Much like the later ""Cloverfield"", it is filmed entirely in the shaky-cam style, trying to be as close to human reality as possible. As the three hikers slowly begin to realize just how hopelessly lost they have become, parts of the film become a sort of character study in panic and emotion. Viewers begin to wonder ""would I react the same way in a similar situation?""

Overall, I was more intrigued by ""Blair Witch"" than anything. It is amazing to me how a movie so stark and completely devoid of any conjured drama (no soundtrack, no ""jump scenes"", etc.) can still be a bit unsettling to watch. I have also seen the first ""Paranormal Activity"" movie, and I don't understand why that is viewed with such reverence while ""Blair Witch"" has to fight for every inch, so to speak. They are the same type of movie, but this effort actually shows the descent into panic/madness better than ""Paranormal"" ever did.","6"
"IonicBreezeMachine","Minimalist filmmaking that captured the audience of 1999 and became a sleeper hit, Blair Witch Project is the prototype for Found Footage horror","1 October 2022","In October 1994, three film students, Heather (Heather Donahue), Joshua (Joshua Leonard), and Mike (Michael C. Williams) traveled into the surrounding woods of Burkittsville, Maryland (formerly know as Blair) to document the legends surround the Blair Witch that haunts the woods. However the three were never seen again and only the footage was recovered detailing their journey through the woods.

Blair Witch is a 1999 found footage horror film directed and produced by Daniel Myrick and Eduardo Sánchez who'd been inspired to make the film after finding documentaries on paranormal events scarier than traditional horror films. Forming Haxan films with various other colleagues, the film was shot in 1997 with only a 35 page script while the majority of the film would be based on improvisation. Artisan Entertainment Bought the film for $1.1 million following its success at Sundance Film Festival, and Artisan in one of the first major acts of using the internet as a marketing tool for a film positioned the film as a sleeper hit by playing up the ""realness"" of the film including printing missing persons posters of the actual actors and IMDb even listed the three as ""Missing presumed dead"". Thanks to strong critical praise and savvy marketing techniques the film became a monster hit earning $140 million in the United States alone and $248 million worldwide. Audience reception has been more divisive as many dislike the film's loose structure and handheld camera work while others praise it as a horror classic. I myself fall somewhere in the middle where I admire the film's simplified low frills take on the horror genre, but this isn't a movie I revisit all that often.

For me the best part of the movie is in the opening 20 minutes where Heather, Josh, and Mike are going around Burkittsville and asking locals about the legend of the Blair Witch. I honestly found the people in the town so interesting and quirky with their ""on the ground"" knowledge of the urban legend surrounding their town and their banter between each other did lend itself to some legitimately humorous moments that made their stories of murder and unexplained disappearances seem more real as they described them. Honestly had this film been a mockumentary of simply interviewing these eccentric residents, that alone would've been enough to sustain this movie. But of course this is a horror film and as we all know horror films are based on isolation either through social constructs or physical isolation so the movie is predominantly set in the surrounding woods with Heather, Josh, and Mike going into the woods to find a cemetery linked to the Blair Witch for their documentary but ending up getting lost. I will say that the fact the actors improvised their interactions in the last two thirds of the movie is impressive and the slow descent into insanity as they find themselves lost in the woods unable to get out is a solid concept, but I never found our three characters all that interesting as they're just generic twentysomethings who are supposed to be average ordinary people, but they're not all that much to them other than buildup of petty annoyances. Once we get to weird stuff happening like weird stone piles appearing around their tents or creepy dolls and totems made of sticks showing up in the woods they do fine reacting to them, but I didn't really care about them all that much because I didn't feel like I knew them all that well.

While The Blair Witch Project didn't invent Found Footage as prior films such as Cannibal Holocaust had dabbled with the format as far back as the 70s, Blair Witch served as a blueprint for future films in the format including the endearing Paranormal Activity films. While I appreciate the legend the film builds up around the Blair Witch especially with the opening 20 minutes as well as what it accomplishes with minimal resources, our three leads aren't all that interesting or memorable leading to their descent into madness lacking as much punch as the movie wants it to. It's an impressive work on its own merits, but hardly the classic it was hailed as at the time.","6"

"Mickey Knox","wooow","29 December 2002","This is by far the best horror movie I have ever seen. It's very original, and everything looks REAL. That's what makes it so great.

This is the perfect proof that you can really create some scary sh*t even without special effects, or clever camera work, or hideous monsters.

Three students go deep in the woods to make a documentary about the myth of the Blair Witch. They disappeared... and the footage was found a year later. The movie is actually a documentary-style presentation of what the kids have filmed during their quest.

So... everything's filmed on 16 mm, with cameras held by the actors. First, they interview some people in the village next to the forest the Witch is supposed to be in. And then they go deep in the forest. Only to get lost.

So. There are NO effects. No monsters. No witches, or killings, or horrifying images. There are 2 handy cams, held by the actors, and nothing else.

Still, throughout the whole movie, your heart beats like crazy.

What makes this so scary? Maybe just the fact that it DOESN'T have effects. So it all looks real. Or the documentary-style. The noises in the night. Their discoveries. When they get lost, the forest looks haunting. And - honestly - whenever there was night, I kept hoping dawn will kick in soon.

This is an amazing movie. Vote: 10 out of 10.","10"
"horrorflicklover","Unique, Intriguing, Suspenseful","28 October 2013","Maybe I don't get the critics of this movie. I think we can all agree that by the late 1980's, the horror genre was beaten to death. Scream eventually came along in the mid-90's and gave it the shot in the arm that it needed. However, soon after the genre was flooded again with much lesser films cashing in on Scream's success.

So what was the Blair Witch Project? A very different horror film indeed. While not the first of the found footage genre, it made a much larger impact than previous movies of the sub-genre had. And like Scream before it, it gave something fresh and original to the horror film scene.

Isn't that what we wanted all along? By 1990, slasher flicks were a dime a dozen. Same in 1999 with the films that followed Scream. Blair Witch went in to an entirely different direction. Sure, it was proposed before Scream (and filmed the following year of it's release), however, it came at a great time. Just as horror movies were yet again becoming tired parodies of themselves.

I don't even know why we need to put spoilers, seeing as just about everyone whose heard of the film knows how it ends. But know this: If you're expecting a bogeyman to jump out at you, then you'll be disappointed. If that's what you must have in a horror film, then keep going. Blair Witch operates largely on the elements of intrigue and suspense. Suspense, intrigue, both important elements to any great horror film (like Halloween). But unlike many of these films, there is no bogeyman on screen. Everything is left open to interpretation, with the general idea being the same. You clearly see these things happen in Blair Witch, but you have no real idea why they're happening, or who's responsible. You're not given an answer, you're not given violence and gore, you're not given big, on-screen effects, you never even see the antagonist's face. But you are given clues, ways to connect the dots.

But THAT is just what made this film great. It was a solid, original idea that was executed remarkably. It didn't follow a typical formula, but why should that matter? If this film couldn't be enjoyed for what it was, then it's not the fault of the film. Because it's simply not a bad movie. To dislike it because it wasn't well-written, executed, or interesting, I can understand. But if that's what you think, then are we even talking about the same film here?

It doesn't have the typical ending, or the typical ""bad guy jumps out at you"" moment. But it's a sure horror thriller, and the rhyme and reason is all made obvious if you've paid attention throughout.

The Blair Witch Project is a classic. A movie that laid the groundwork for mainstream acceptance of it's sub-genre, and became a masterpiece of it's main genre in it's own right. This is a must-see for any horror fan.","10"
"ccthemovieman-1","Inventive Approach, But Marketing Was Disgraceful","13 August 2007","I never really was interested in watching this but when it got so much publicity, I thought it would be worth a shot to give it a look. I should have saved my money. I don't really find a film featuring ultra-profane, punk college kids that appealing. The movie might have been effective at what it aimed to do - to scare people - but it was just too sleazy for me. Of the three leads, the girl is probably the most annoying because of her smugness.

My main complaint is really not the movie so much as it was the marketing. This movie was viewed by millions of teenagers, and that's what the producers wanted. That, along with the college crowd, was their target audience. Hey, as far as college kids seeing this, I have no problem, but not high school kids.

To promote a film to that young a crowd - which it undeniably did - and have over 130 f- words, over 60 uses of ""sh-t,"" 20 usages of the Lord's name in vain and tons of other profanities - all in a paltry 80 minutes - is absolutely ridiculous and just plain wrong.

I recognize the inventive film-making. They make it look - effectively so - that the kids in the story are filming some sort of documentary. It certainly has that feel to it and it's very realistic in that regard. It doesn't rely on gore but on a psychological level for the horror. It shows the evilness of witchcraft and the occult. No problem.....but.....

I still remember my local library having an entire wall on where the computers are located, promoting this film, reading ""Hey, kids - It's Blair Witch Month. Celebrate with us....blah, blah, blah."" I am not making that up. Unbelievable, but that's our Liberal libraries these days. I guess that's what still ""sticks in my craw"" about this movie. It should have been promoted ""for adults only,"" but it wasn't.","3"
"lot49","The Web site is more entertaining than the movie","7 August 1999","After weeks of reading the hype about this independent film that supposedly impressed audiences at the Sundance Film Festival, I finally found time to see it in Colma, California a town in which the dead ""residents"" outnumber the living. After seeing this movie, I envied those dead people buried in the nearby cemeteries. They did not have to sit through 87 minutes of shaky handheld footage.

Rather than a ghost story, the Blair Witch Project is largely a pseudo-documentary about three often-obnoxious Gen-Xers lost in the woods. We grasp their plight early in the film, so it's difficult to endure their bickering and histrionics after that point is made. By the time we arrive at the film's climax, most of us are glad to know that these tiresome filmmakers will be bound, tortured and disemboweled.

The Blair Witch Project Web site actually contains more information than we see presented in the film. Web surfers are allowed to read the ""back-story"" of the Blair witch and her lingering hold on the Burkitsville community. I was hoping to see some standard ""talking head"" footage of the law enforcement officers and the private investigator who eventually located the personal effects of the missing filmmakers. I also expected interviews with the trio's grieving friends and relatives. While I normally dislike such cinematic cliches, in this instance, it would have been a relief.

This film could easily be edited down to about twenty minutes of footage that could be presented as film clips within another documentary film about the filmmakers' disappearance (the film I expected to see).","1"
"davispittman","One of the most effective horror movies ever made","15 April 2017","If you're a fan of horror movies then you absolutely must see this classic if you haven't already. In 1999 when this extremely low budget movie was released, it very quickly became a success, both with critics reviews and with the box office. It raked in over 140 million dollars. It was made for about 40 thousand dollars, it was literally all filmed by these three young people, this is the found footage category of horror films all began. We have the filmmakers of the Blair watch project to thank for movies like paranormal activity. I love scary movies like this! This is how you make an effective scary movies that actually scares viewers. Too many horror movies use buckets of fake blood, over the top effects, and show you exactly what you're supposed to be afraid of. This movie does none of those things, not a one of those tactics are exercised at any point. And not doing any of those things is what makes this film work and it's what made it so popular back in 1999. The performances by heather, mike, and josh are all so great, they're realistic and very believable. With this movie, if the performances by the three actors didn't work, then nothing would've worked at all because that's all it is. Seeing these actors reactions to the supposed horrors that are happening to them is what sends a chill up your spine. You hear one of the guys yelling for help at night and you hear far off creepy sounds. These things are effective because it's dark and you literally have no clue what it is you're supposed to be scared of. The stick figures hanging in the woods was a good touch too, it just added on to the eerie creepy factor. If you're going to watch a scary movie one night and you have yet to see this one, just give it a try I promise you won't be disappointed. And the ending is just the icing on the cake. It's done extremely well. 10/10!","10"

Heather, Mike and Josh, actors, play ""Heather"", ""Mike"", and ""Josh"", characters. They are students doing a project and get lost in the woods, camping there several nights. There is absolutely *zero* character development, *zero* inventiveness in dialog, and *zero* believability in their plight. The first 85 minutes you follow them through the woods, listening to their teenage dialog with the ""F-word"" used 2 or 3 times each sentence. When they meet their fate, you don't care one bit about them. At least I didn't.

Still, I give it a generous ""3"" of ""10"" for the novelty of the idea. However, as movies go, this one is simply a good ""school project"" quality. It in no way deserves to be in the same category as any of the above-average films made these days.

If you have an inner-ear type problem, the skaky-camera style of filming that was used in this movie can make you nauseous.

I guess I went into this with too high of an expectation. Three friends and I tired to see this movie on the third day of the opening weekend, but it was sold out. So a week later, two of those same friends and I tired again. This time we made it in...with only about six other people. I know now why there were so few people in the theater that time. No one was going to see it a second time, and anyone who had seen it before their friends must have done the same thing I did after seeing it...if a friend told me they were going to see it, I did everything possible (short of bludgeoning them with the nearest piece of furniture) to prevent them from seeing it.

The home video touch was interesting, and had potential, but it just didn't come off. The only thing it did for me, was give me the kind of headache and eye strain I get after reading several hundred pages of an engineering textbook or writing a C++ program. I did not find this movie the least bit scary. I can think of several other movies that scared or disturbed me much more than this one. Actually, I spent more time to stiffle my laughter than anything else.

I know what some of you are thinking, ""The movie is trying to portray the emotion they are going through being lost out there. Try putting yourself in their shoes."" Well, I think I can imagine that desperate feeling they were supposed to be experiencing. One time while backpacking in the mountains of New Mexico I ended up away from the campsite with several others after dark without any kind of light (it was overcast that night, and somehow six of us forgot to bring along a single flashlight). It took us an hour to slowly walk only a few hundred yards with everyone holding on to the shoulders of the person in front of them, and the person in front feeling for trees along the side of the trail. And I don't know how many times I have lay awake in my tent by myself or with one other person trying to figure out if the noises I hear are just the wind, or something looking for a meal, and how big is that something?

To this date, I shudder whenever this movie is mentioned. Not because it scared or disturbed me. I shudder out of disgust that I wasted so much time on this movie. I can't believe this actually made it to the big screen. The film should have been burned before it was ever reproduced.","1"

"Wilson102","waste of a good Saturday night","10 September 2009","Please, please, don't buy into the hype surrounding this movie. It was pretty darn awful. Let me tell you now; I'm a very squeamish and easily frightened viewer(I practically had a heart attack when a certain little girl crawled out of a certain TV-you know which movie I mean!) but this film did not have me diving behind the sofa cushions. Not even a little bit. It starts out good; the tension is there alright, but because it is set 'film documentary' style there is no atmospheric music to set the scene, which means any tension or atmosphere has to come from the actors. Maybe I'm missing the point, but a bunch of teenagers running around in pitch black woods whispering the 'f' word over and over-and yes folks, a good five minutes is spent where you can't see a darn thing and can only hear the sound effects as the kids drop the video camera and screech terrified obscenities to each other-doesn't really entertain me that much. Even then the volume had to be turned up ridiculously high just to hear what they were saying, then turned down again in disappointment as I realised I wasn't missing much. I found the scene where they emerge from their tents and practically have a hernia over some re-arranged twig formations more funny than ominous. Was anyone else willing the Blair Witch to pop out and say boo? Anything would have been less laughable than twig formations!! It is true that a good horror flick can entertain you not by what it shows, but by what it doesn't, but here is where the movie fails. Had the teens been stalked and chased down by an evil presence then it would have been frightening and entertaining, instead we have three college-age idiots lost in some woods and behaving like hysterical, well, college-age idiots. 'AHHH!! A re-arranged twig formation!!!' Please. Can you say 'low budget?' Give us viewers some credit! And I won't go into the disaster that was ending. Just as the movie builds up some tension and genuinely grips you to the screen, the credits roll. I had to go back to the title menu screen and repeat that scene just to make sure the DVD hadn't skipped. In the words of Comic Book Guy...'Worst Ending EVER'. Bless Heather Donahue, for she was meant for things far greater than this. Well, thankyou for taking the time to read my little review. I beg of you not to waste any more actually viewing this movie, if it weren't for the foul language it would barely make a PG certificate.

I sat through the whole film expecting a scary bit. I even tried to ""let the fear wash over me"" what a laugh. This isn't even so bad it's good.

Blair witch makes a joke of good horror films that have been made without having to use expensive special effects. The only people who deserve a prize for this are the marketing people who had us believe that this is the best film ever.

The characters were horrible and seemed to say the F word in every sentence. After they got into the woods I wanted them all killed by the witch. I hated everything about them, nothing endeared them to me, not even when a 20 foot snotty nose reared up in front of me.

"TedStixonAKAMaximumMadness","""The Blair Witch Project""- One of the most unnerving, exciting (and divisive) horror films of the past twenty years.","2 September 2016","""In October of 1994 three student filmmakers disappeared in the woods near Burkittsville, Maryland, while shooting a documentary...A year later their footage was found.""

...with those words, ""The Blair Witch Project""- one of the most successful independent films of all time, kicked off back in July of 1999. It was hailed by critics and became a worldwide phenomena, catapulting itself into legendary status in the world of horror almost instantly.

It was not only one of the pioneering films in the current wave of the found-footage sub-genre (which had existed since at least 1980's ""Cannibal Holocaust"", but had never quite met with such public recognition), but also one of the earliest films to successfully implement a wildly successful web-based viral marketing campaign. It helped to sell the idea that this was more than a film- this was ""real."" People genuinely did not necessarily know that this was just a movie- the marketing made us question if this was real life footage, which only garnered more and more hype.

It became something more than a film... it was an event. A piece of history.

So, how does it hold up now, nearly 20 years later?

I'd say extremely well.

Yes, it is true that ""The Blair Witch Project"" had a somewhat divisive effect on audiences around the world. Horror has a way of dividing audiences in a way due to fear being a wholly subjective experience. But I do firmly believe that it is a masterpiece of horror, able to do so much with so little, while maintaining strong character, a compelling storyline and building a top-notch mythology that still has the power to stick with you long after the credits begin to roll.

We follow a trio of student filmmakers- Heather Donahue, Michael C. Williams and Joshua Leonard- as they travel to Burkittsville, Maryland to work on a documentary about the local legend of the ""Blair Witch."" However, their passion project soon gives way to absolute terror as they become lost in the woods, unable to find their way out, and mysterious events begin to plague them. It appears they are being followed by a mysterious force in the woods, which will stop at nothing to get them... And so, armed only with their wits and cameras to record the events plaguing them, they continue their journey, trying to escape the clutches of the evil that is pursuing them.

The biggest appeal of the film is that it very much does prey on the idea that what you don't see is oftentimes scarier than what you do see. The film makes a constant and consistent effort to build an absolute atmosphere of dread using only minimal tactics. Strange sounds in the distance... pitch-black darkness surrounding our characters... the appearance of mysterious piles of rocks and figures made of sticks. It's incredibly minimalist, and yet it is so darned effective. And when the film finally does move in for those jumps to punctuate the atmosphere, you're so enthralled that it rattles you right to the core.

The performances also help to elevate the material to its legendary heights. While it's key moments have been parodied to death in the ensuing years, it's hard not to connect with the characters. Particularly Heather, who despite her flaws, is still very much a person. When the film's iconic ""I'm so scared"" moments pops up (and that's not spoiling anything, it's one of the iconic images that the film was marketed by), your heart will be breaking while the hair on the back of your neck continues to stand with tension.

It really is without question that writer/directors Daniel Myrick and Eduardo Sánchez struck gold with this film. It's become a pop- culture phenomena and to this day, is still aware and relevant to horror audiences.

While it's slow-build nature may turn off some movie fans, I cannot emphasize how much this film works and how important it is when viewing the history of film and horror.

It's easily a perfect 10 for me. Let's hope the upcoming 2016 follow-up is able to deliver even more of what made this film so magical!","10"
"KingM21","Great horror.","2 September 2005","I watched The Blair Witch Project again (and the commentary and extras). Was it still a good movie, was it still scary? Absolutely. The characters were strong and realistic and showed real emotions, the setting was perfect and fully used, and the use of sound was awesome. All that made for an incredible atmosphere. At only 77 minutes, the movie moved along at a brisk pace. The shaky footage wasn't that bad at all and some of the shots of the woods are just great. I will admit that some of the power of the film has somewhat diminished over the years (and from watching it at least four times!) but the same can be said of most any scary horror flick. The ending still gave me chills for a good fifteen seconds though. I even rewound it to check something and it creeped me out a second time! BWP is not conventional horror and that's one of the reasons it works so well (but maybe that's the problem for some people too?)it's different, unique. The presentation, backed up with the mythos, is what really makes this movie something special. I've never seen another quite like it. The DVD commentary is decent and goes over the making of the film. The makers discussed the great ideas and techniques used to make the film as realistic as possible. The three trailers were pretty cool toono wonder it was a box-office hit. I also watched Curse of the Blair Witch and Stick and Stones. Sticks and Stones is basically the same as CotBW, only it's edited a bit quicker. These documentaries are informative and compelling and help set up the mood for BWP but I didn't find them particularly scary. All in all, though, I really had a good time revisiting this whole cinematic experience.","10"

It started with entertaining interviews with local people about the Blair witch. Then they got lost in the woods and kept coming back to the same spot after hiking the whole day. They kept arguing over who's responsible for them getting lost and Mike is cobstantly having panic attacks. Then Mike went missing and something from the dark calling out with Mike's voice. They knew it wasn't him. They found a ruined house and went down in the basement and Mike was looking at the wall at the corner like the kids the witch killed. At the beginning I thought they were overacting but it became geniuinely scary even though the video and audio quality of the footage was very poor but perhaps it added to the genuine feeling of the atmosphere. And of course the most iconic scene was when Heather turned the camera to herself and made a confession about how naive she was and so on while crying hysterically which looked petrifying. It is what Halloween is for slasher genre for found footage horror.","7"

It feels very real. I love the beautiful scenery and the autumn look of the woods.

A woman named Heather is making a documentary on the Blair Witch. Her two friends, Josh and Mike help her with filming and the equipment. Pretty soon, they begin to hear strange noises at night, they get lost, and begin to see twig stick figures.

There was only one movie I've ever walked out of: FEAR AND LOATHING IN LAS VEGAS. I tell you if THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT lasted a minute longer, I was ready to walk out. First of all, the way it was filmed with the bouncing camera was horrid. I was getting headaches throughout the whole movie. Second, it was not the least bit scary. There were actually people laughing in the theatre throughout the entire movie. I don't know which ""horror"" movie was a bigger comedy; this or THE RING.

You people say this was the scariest movie ever made. Obviously, this was made for the DAWSON'S CREEK little teenybopper audience who probably thinks SCARY MOVIE was scary. Go to your local video store and rent THE EXORCIST and THE SHINING, two TRUE horror classics.

We are treated to about 20 minutes of a black screen and a good 15 minutes of some pretty trees. Other than that, these guys just go about scaring themselves and boring the viewer. The 'documentary' aspect of the film is overdone, as these guys can't even manage to hold the camera straight most of the time, and the dialogue rarely rises above a fourth-grade level.

"elicopperman","It Holds Up Just Enough","10 June 2019","Ever since its release 20 years ago, The Blair Witch Project has made history as a cultural horror phenomenon, mainly for how it utilized the found footage genre without showing much of what the real horror is. While it did divide audiences back in the day, the intrigue of the film lies a lot more in what we hear rather than what is actually causing hysteria. It's a testament to how divisive the film is when even though what was videotaped did actually happen in real life, just the thought of what lies out in the middle of nowhere is enough to make one feel at ease.

Now understandably, the film has a very simplistic plot, in which three young filmmakers named Heather Donahue, Michael Williams and Joshua Leonard seek out the local legend called the Blair Witch infamously located at the Black Hills near Burkittsville, Maryland in 1994, but they all disappear and the film plays out as a feature length collection of raw footage based on what they experienced. Admittedly, the film doesn't have a great start, as the leads come off as more annoying and obnoxious than likable and charming, and not much happens besides them goofing off for the first twenty minutes. However, as the film progresses, strange oddities start to occur and slowly heighten the stakes with every passing day. The very idea of being lost in the deep woods can really affect someone mentally, so even without the supernatural aspects, the movie works well in playing with the viewer's expectations with suspenseful tension.

One major problem with most found footage movies is that the creatures feared by the cast are either always seen or are in a typical environment we're all familiar with. The better way to create paranoia within your horror narrative is by placing your characters somewhere they've never been before. Also, the decision to have many of the night scenes be pitch black and out of focus really helps the soundtrack, as all the crazy sounds coming from the area feel all the more terrifying without knowing where they are coming from. What people hear is more reactionary than what they see, and the filmmakers react so well to what they hear that the audience could be in their shoes as well. Even then, as the film goes on, Heather, Mike and Josh become much more relatable with their ever-growing impatience and frustrations with the whole legend itself, whether it's fake or not, and even towards each other with anger and fear. The more away from civilization you are, the less human you become.

So while it may be slow paced and the idea of not seeing the real terror can be a turnoff to some viewers, I definitely think The Blair Witch Project stands well on its own after its original release. Regardless if this whole movie is complete fiction, crafting a whole narrative around the supernatural in a place as unknown as a forest at night can work if you center it around the idea of implication rather than flat out showing the creature. All you need is a shoestring budget, a cast of people you know personally as opposed to famous celebrities, and an environment you're familiar with enough to let your small camera create practically everything. In spite of the found footage genre being somewhat of a joke nowadays, there is nothing stopping you from taking on the challenge of forming a film around raw recorded material.","6"
"moviefanintheusa","How bout this being almost the worst movie I've ever seen if it isn't the worst.","27 March 2010","I'll start off by saying that these hand camera movies always revolve around a horrific storyline, like say, there just happens to be a random witch living in the woods and Cloverfield sucked as well. There is nothing even remotely scary about this piece of trash, not to mention it is terribly unrealistic. By the time this so called ""film"" was over, I was literally thinking ""Wow, I can't believe I actually just wasted an hour and a half of my life on that!"" Literally, the whole movie is just the people walking through the woods screaming the f word at the top of their longs for 81 minutes! I'd love to tell you the stupid ending as well, but I'm afraid I can't because IMDb won't let me. In short, don't waste your time and money on this garbage.

"TaylorYee94","Playing with your psychology","30 September 2020","Playing with your psychology rather than showing blood, corpse, ghosts, or murderer, makes this film more upscale horror film. I am not a fan of horror movies because their success depends on scale and budget rather than smart screenplay or director's capability. The more money one puts in special effects, make-up, or props, making the movie more realistic, the more it can bring out simple and direct reaction from audience (screaming, surprise, and horror), and the more success.

This movie twists one factor of the film, camera, and creates butterfly effect. Three main characters go into the woods, and its shaky hand-held camera style brings the audience with them. A sense of reality skyrockets, absorbing raw emotions of the protagonists 100%. This one little innovative trick erases the screen between actors and the audience. 'The Blair Witch Project' almost created the word 'found-footage'.

This horror movie does not make me scream or frown because of grotesque image. However, it is scarier, and the fear stays longer because of the reality of the movie and the use of psychology.","9"

And as we continue I might point out that this movie has the worst dialogue ever put together in movie history and the actors in this movie make the acting on the soap operas seem like Spencer Tracy. One of the worst movies ever. Even worse than its 99 partner in bad horror movies The Haunting.","1"

I found the idea of a Blair Witch to be interesting and kind of unique. I really like the history behind it and the documentary feel at the beginning. Also the movie is pretty realistic on how it presented here. The symbolism is pretty interesting on the stuff that the crew members found inside the forest.

Unfortunately there's a couple of flaws with this movie. One issue is that the movie spends most of the time either the characters wandering around or them arguing, which is not entertaining at all. Also the movie gets repetitive when it gets to the forest.","5"
"mermatt","Interesting study in the psychology of fear","2 August 1999","As a horror film, this is disappointing -- perhaps intentionally so to keep the audience talking about it after it is over. But as a study in the psychology of fear and self-fulfilling prophecy, the film works well. The moviemakers use fear of the unknown, fear of the dark, fear of the night, fear of unseen forces, fear of getting lost in the woods -- all very effectively.

While this is not in the same league as THE EXORCIST to which it has been sometimes compared in the PR hype, it is nevertheless a good example of the old rule of horror -- less is more. The people who remade THE HAUNTING could have taken a lesson from these people instead of relying mainly on FX for the atmosphere.

I think the unresolved ending is intentional to keep the word-of-mouth going. The Sci-Fi channel show ""Curse of the Blair Witch"" gives more information than the movie and is actually better than the movie. I think what we have here is the beginning of a legend. The Blair Witch myth is concocted solely for the film, but now the myth will begin to grow. Clever gimmick for a small-budget film!","8"
"Hayden-86055","Intriguing and different","5 June 2020","The Blair Witch Project is a very interesting film, and I've always struggled with how to rate this one. Technically the acting is bad and camera work is shoddy, but there's just something about it that makes it difficult to stop watching.

Obviously it kicked off the now massive found-footage genre, and genuinely this is probably one of the better ones, the plot is fairly good and mysterious; and the location being set in a woods is spooky and fantastic. The surroundings and camera work make you feel as if you're actually there, experiencing every twig snap and the wind smack your face as you trudge on.

So why do I rate it only 6/10? Because, unfortunately, it is very boring!! Especially on a second viewing, the ""Witch"" never even bothers to show her face, and the scares are mostly left up to our imagination (not necessarily a bad thing), actually at times I see this film as art, other times I don't.

6/10: Despite the relatively average rating of a 6, (due to bad acting and boredom), this is something you really need to watch and experience. So I 100% recommend giving it a try, you may love it or hate it, but it sure is an experience nonetheless!","6"
"wineguyroman","At least i didnt pay money to see this film","18 September 2001","I saw this film after hearing all the hype, both positive and negative. Perhaps because i watched the film in the comfort of my living room, on video, that this film didnt have the desired effect of being scary (or perhaps because it was a very poorly made film.)

Whatever the reasons, i found BWP to be one of the worst films i have ever seen (and I'm not prone to hyperbole).

*mini spoiler* The idea of college aged kids getting lost in the woods with a STREAM nearby is completely implausible (Follow the stream, you morons). And intentionally losing the map, the ONE source of information, left me with a feeling that they all truly deserved whatever fate befell them and that the human race would be a slightly better place without them contributing those defective genes to the gene pool.

Additionally, i found the characters to be annoying, argumentative and having few redeeming qualities. PET PEEVE - WIPE YOUR NOSE !

Initially i was going to rate this film a 2 because they did manage to make over 100 million dollars on this piece of tripe, which required a bit of marketing genius. But due to my love of true cinema, i couldn't justify any rating above 1","2"

"FKDZ","Eerily real.","8 August 2021","I finally got to watching this cult classic. Though, not so much cult anymore as pretty much everyone has seen it by now.

I got to say, it holds up. It takes you back in time a bit and that's something to get used to. Because the characters feel so real and modern, I had to remind myself they don't have phones with a GPS in 1999 and physical maps were still a thing.

What this film does incredibly well is create a real sense of dynamic between the characters and making the world feel real. Aside from some oddities like the blue goo which I wish they left out, everything else feels real. I could see why people loved this in 99'.

It is a dramatic tension thriller that once it gets started, doesn't let up. I can't get enough of the characters and performances, they carried this entire premise and dragged you into this movie. The sound design (important) is good, no fake sounds used for what I can tell so that helps a lot. It's all just practical.

The documentary/handy cam style directing is a essential part of making it all work. It adds to the claustrophobia and paranoia that this movie will evoke.

The ending was a bit lackluster for me but I don't really know what else I'd expected. Perhaps a bit more scare. Regarding it being scary or not, its more so anxiety inducing. Not scary visually or anything.

8/10 Still holds up!","8"
"Ron L","extremely boring, 100% hype","17 July 2000","The only possible way this 'film' could be bearable to audiences would be to lie to them and tell them it really happened, and this was the actual footage - which is exactly what the film makers did.

I saw the film after I knew it wasn't real. I alternated between being bored and annoyed for the entire 45 minutes I watched it. After 45 minutes of suffering, I just had to stop watching (it was either that or put a bullet in my head). If you are going to make a film without a script, you damn well better have actors who can improvise - unfortunately, the 'actors' in Blair Witch do not have that ability.

Wouldn't it be funny if a poorly written movie with no plot, no script, bad acting, and bad filming could be hyped enough to make millions of dollars? The joke is on us, the paying public, and I'm not laughing.

Oooh...a mysterious pile of sticks....am I supposed to be scared? The fear of the unseen can be potent in a movie, as evidenced by the creepy forest scene in ""Night of the Demon"" (1958). But ""Blair Witch"" is strictly an amateur affair from start to finish. The characters were poorly developed and not the least appealing. I didn't care what happened to them. As for the hand-held camera, it was effective for maybe ten minutes, then its effect became irritating...very irritating. I will say this: The studio did a super job of marketing the film and generating a tremendous amount of hype.","1"
"FuriousGiorge","Boring as hell","6 August 1999","It's a sad commentary on the state of film that people are willing to christen anything that is offbeat or different as the great white hope of the film industry. This movie has made gobs and gobs of money, has probably made the people involved richer than they could possibly have imagined, but this is not the great movie that people want to believe it is. It is extremely boring and depressingly unscary. There is absolutely no excuse, in my mind, for the mind-bogglingly crappy way the film was shot...things are out of focus, it is jumpy, and much of the time the film is either completely dark or the shot is of trees or rocks while action is happening elsewhere. I realize it is supposed to be a documentary shot by amateurs, but there is no reason to put the audience through that for some arty notion of what is ""realistic filmmaking"". A 60,000 dollar budget doesn't mean you end up with ""Clerks"". Usually you end up with a crappy-looking film, which is exactly what the money bought here.","1"
"the amorphousmachine","Now that the hype's gone...it's Brilliant!","5 November 2000","I was expecting crap! I heard so many bad reviews about this film that I didn't expect much from it at all. I was pleasantly suprised.

This film is brilliant and vividly scary! I can't believe so many people bagged BWP! It was made with a low-budget, broke all the traditional rules of the horror film genre and bought us something new and different.

People were actually complaining about the fact it wasn't 'real', yeah well so what! The point is, if you watch BWP and you attempt to believe it's 'real', eventually the line between fiction and reality become blurred in this cleverly constructed film. I knew it wasn't real from the start, but it was so convincingly made, that it became very scary indeed.

I liked the clever use of the two cameras, and I even liked the filmmaker's excuse for the overuse of the cameras incorporated into the narrative (through the character, Heather)! Although there is some flaws (i.e. constant use of cameras especially when you need both hands free), this film is a totally inspirational film to any would-be student of film-making. ****1/2 out of *****!","9"
"itakethesquare","You Had To Be There...","10 November 2021","I had noticed that the IMDB ratings have dropped since the last time I checked in and it's obvious there's a divide between modern critics and/or a generations of movie go-ers.

It's an awful shame because the budget for marketting this movie is phenomenally creative as it was a ""word of mouth"" or ""virality"" as some would say. The creative team made a full on universe of a supernatural element happening in the real-world and was publicized as such. There were mockumentaries all over the television and internet before the movie was released saying it was ""authentic found-footage"" making this a ""snuff"" film.

The lore in the documentaries almost make it must-see so that what happens in the film chills you to the bone as it all starts coming back to you. The acting in the documentaries are very convincing too as they had many talented people fabricate a mythological story that never existed.

Cannibal Holocaust and the Last Broadcast came before this and are equally great faux found-footage films. All 3 should be praised.

It's just an awful shame that this movie suffers because, during the giant influx of young youtubers reviewing films will never know the terror of the unknown questioning conventional human standards.

The acting is entirely improvised with small clues by the crew harassing them at night and taking away their food for 8 days. This is a very important film for filmmakers and horror fans. The sequels and video games aren't as great but they are of importance if you want to know what's going on. But ambiguosity is more terrifying.

"Rickting","Important but over-hyped","14 January 2014","The Blair Witch Project is considered to be a landmark in horror history and terrified everyone back in 1999. Why exactly? This is the first found footage horror film (The first to exclusively use the format) and 3 annoying teenagers go into the woods to film a documentary, get lost and are hunted by the Blair Witch. That's all there is to it. I'm sick and tired of found footage as it's just a way to make money without actually scaring anyone. Troll Hunter, Cloverfield or the excellent Chronicle are all smart examples which use the format well, and this shows in other genres found footage can work. I still can't stand those stupid Paranormal Activity films though. However, at the time, this movie would have been very scary and boosted by a good marketing campaign. It's still scary today. For about 5 minutes. More an experiment than a movie, this is a very interesting film but it's became cool to hate for good reason. It's not a bad film like some say, but it's certainly not a great movie.

The film has many assets. The finale at the house is very suspenseful, the way the film never shows the witch is very good as well and what people often forget is the acting is actually good (Heather Whatshername didn't deserve that Razzie) and the film creates a sense of unease and fear. But that doesn't mean it's scary. It's unnerving, patient and unique but it's about as scary as a walk in the park most of the time. Overly minimalistic, underwhelming, full of stupid decisions and deeply, deeply boring, this is one film you should never watch more than once even if you liked it the first time. There are only so many times one can stare at trees, tents being shaken and listen to weird noises before they just start to get annoyed. It's not a bad movie, just a remarkably average one hyped to absurd levels. It had a big impact at the time, but having seen many other superior horror films TBWP feels woefully unscary.

"SKG-2","Entertaining and scary","3 August 1999","A lot of the reviews of this film have said the reason this is so good is it doesn't show anything, it lets you imagine it all, and that's the only way to make horror. I think that's more than a bit simplistic. After all, NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD, THE EXORCIST, THE SHINING, and many other films cited as classics show a lot(if THE SHINING was truly ""suggestive,"" would we have seen the blood coming from the elevator?). Nevertheless, they are right in praising this film. It is entertaining and scary, and you do care about the three filmmakers and what happened to them.

This couldve been a lot more if they had cut some of the blah blah blahing and threw in a few more scares. I know you have to have some talking in movies but how many times are you willing to watch the same people say the same stuff day after day. Each morning starts with ""lets go this way"" and by afternoon its ""you blankety blank you got us lost!"" Then by nightfall we wait for a witch that never comes. It wasnt till the third night I think, that the kids tent gets attacked by ""something"" in only one of two really effectively scary scenes. Theyre sent screaming into the woods and its pretty creepy stuff. Not much happens till the final 5 minutes when the filmmakers think theyve found their lost buddy in an abandoned house. Though the film disappointingly ends so abruptly, it does give you a lot to talk about ""what Mike was doing in the corner."" Id say yes it was an extremely unique idea for a terror film but no to the uniqueness of the setting. I mean, havent woods been spooky in movies for years? It couldnt help but add the films eerie atmosphere. And be forewarned about the dizzying camera movements at times, where the actual filmmakers wanted to add realism to the documentary style idea by having the shots not be perfect at times.

"thesar-2","The Real Witchbusters","3 April 2013","The coolest thing about seeing The Blair Witch Project back in 1999, probably two weeks following its release, was that people still believed one of the biggest movie hoaxes and most cleverest marketing ideas in cinema history. (This was marketed as a documentary on ""true life"" footage found when three young adults died from an apparent witch attack.) I even remember seeing the TV (later to be confirmed as a Mockumentary) special recapping what ""actually"" happened during the incidents of three film students that went into the witch'fested woods and never returned.

Now, I don't believe in ghosts, ""real"" witches, spooks, etc, so I never bought it. And my disbelief runs so deep, that the movie never once frightened me, despite my appreciation for what the film was. (AT THE TIME, that isand I'll get into that later.)

I do want to clarify, and I'm getting ahead of myself, something from that last paragraph: while I was not spooked, there was a moment, not 10 seconds from the end credits that was very creepy and thought was the most effective shot in the movie. Again – not scary, but absolutely eerie.

Much like what Star Wars (Episode IV: A New Hope) was to that time period, was The Blair Witch Project to the late nineties. It was the found footage newborn. Sure, there were many, manyhorrifyingly too many rip-offs and more found footage films to come, and yeah, there were just a minute number before this, but this was the nice, original and refreshing in 1999. Again, I did not believe this was a true story, but they sure as hell made you at very least believe it was. And they did all that with almost absolutely nothing. I truly admire this movie.

The story was jokingly simple and that's not a bad thing when it comes to horror; think about: the masterpiece Halloween's thin script. As an amateur documentary project, two film student friends and a third newly recruited film student venture off into the woods where supposedly (to them) a witch killed many, including a lot of children decades past. Beforehand, in a fairly brilliant scene, they interview the just-outside-the-woods townsfolk for their take on the legend of the infamous Blair Witch.

Once inside the woods they're armed with their camping gear, expensive, yet ""borrowed"" cameras, a device known to us to be the pre-GPS: ""a map,"" and tons of batteries to ""run a small third world county."" That last one, I loved for, they actually explain why they can continuous film miles from an electrical socket and yet, for the countless – and unnecessary found footage films to follow, they seemed to have forgotten that simple plot explanation and make us believe their devices will basically run for weeks without a recharge. My phone dies in probably 4 hours without a charge.

But, I digress. Basically, the two males of the triangle of terrors are lead by the bitch (yeah, she was) Heather who claims to ""know where they're going"" deep inside the woods. As this does NOT turn out to be the case, tensions rise, and the typical motions of getting lost and feeling hopeless emerge. Oh, and lest we forget, there might be a witch out there hunting the witch hunters?

While I had admitted I wasn't frightened in this movie, this type of movie or pretty much any ghost stories, such as the weak ""found footage series of the next generation"" Paranormal Activity franchise, I found the built up tension, comradery between the cast of three, the comedy, cinematography, music and dialogue real enough. They actually convinced me – and this is a rarity, for me – that if I had believed in ghosts, etc, I would absolutely have fallen for the ruse the marketing team came up with. And perhaps, it would've been even more fun to watch it. But, then again, I'm really too smart for that.

Sadly, since, again, there has been countless, and mostly insipid found footage films since, if one were to watch this today, for the first time, they might be jaded and dislike it. I can dig that; but for those who pretty much started here, I'm sure there are more people that enjoyed this. For, I did love this movie and still today do.

Side Note: It helps I had/have a major crush on the actor and character ""Mike."" Now, I wouldn't have rated the movie higher just because of my attraction, but it sure as hell helped while watching this. Further, and again not a star up or down in my rating, I would've preferred in a movie that basically only featured THREE actors, that Mike would have been shown more. It seems like the percentage of on screen time: (the bitch) Heather: 40%, Josh: 35% and Mike: 25%. Oh, well; that's why they made pause.","8"

Don't listen to what others may tell you, watch it to make up your mind yourselves-and watch it alone! Don't bear with anyone making silly comments while you watch it! Only then will you appreciate the value of BWP, that is FEAR at its utmost degree. For that matter, it can only be compared to the Exorcist.

"superboy478","A Genuine Horror Film","17 April 2002","The Blair Witch Project was a box office hit at the 1998 Sundance Film Festival and was hailed by critics and audiences alike. Eventhough it only grossed $12 million in production, it was one of the biggest box office hits of 1999.

Heather Donahue, Joshua Leonard, and Micheal Williams are film students at Montgomary College in Maryland. They are given a project by their film professor to do a documentary about a legendary witch scandal that occured during the Colonial days. They travel to the small town of Burkitsville to interview the locals about what they know on the Blair Witch. After one day of filming, they decide to head up to Burkitsville's Black Forest where they choose to film at Coffin Rock and other locations. When they reach the forest, it starts out like a walk in the park when they stick to their path. But, as the story moves along, they go off their path which ends up getting them lost. As the nights go by, they hear noises that don't sound normal for camping, and when the sun rises, they discover new things outside their tent every morning when they wake up. Their trip turns into nothing but a pure nightmare in the Black Forest of Maryland. Their cameras never stop rolling.

Produced and directed by Eduardo Sanchez and Daniel Myrick (Blair Witch 2), The Blair Witch Project is a very chilling and disturbing movie that will leave you breathless by the end. For sure though, it is a very good movie.

"Buddy-51","creepy and original horror film","11 November 1999","""The Blair Witch Project"" succeeds where so many horror films fail because of the sheer simplicity of its conception and design, allowing it to tap far more deeply into a wide range of primal fears than the conventional ""fright"" films churned out regularly by major Hollywood studios. While the latter films tend to dilute their terror through overplotting, over production and over reliance on special effects, ""The Blair Witch Project"" eschews all that for creativity, visual inventiveness and an admirable conviction that what is left unseen is often more terrifying than what is visualized.

The film presents itself cleverly as a pseudodocumentary tale of a group of fictional college students who become lost in the woods while endeavoring to film a study of a local scary legend. With this structure, the film creepily conjures up many of the basic anxieties and dreads humans are prone to such as fear of the dark, of being hopelessly lost in an isolated environment, of unidentifiable noises on which one can project one's greatest terrors, of total loss of control against an unknown and malevolent force.

Even more impressive is the way the film expands to become a study of the human psyche when it is placed into a situation of unspeakable fear and desperation. As the characters begin to grasp the gravity of their situation, the forced jocularity begins to be stripped away revealing the childlike terror, guilt, need for recrimination and eventually despair and hopelessness that overtake them. The actors are brilliant in capturing the full gamut of emotions these characters must go through before the preordained tragic end. The film also provides a slyly satirical spin on the obsessively cinematic tone of modern life, wherein every event must be captured on film or videotape, so much so that, even as death is breathing down the necks of these characters, the cameras continue to roll to record it. As one of them says in justification, ""That's all I have left."" That is her piece of the comfortable world of familiarity that helps her, at least momentarily (if futiley), evade the harsh reality of her situation. Also, these characters pay a high price for the superior tone of cavalier indifference and almost mockery they display towards the tales of the legend they have come to ""investigate.""

More than any horror film of recent memory, ""The Blair Witch Project"" gets under the viewer's skin and gives one that feeling of creepy vulnerability that only the best horror films can do.","9"

I had fallen asleep within the first 45 minutes. I had been extremely disappointed. Now, I had heard about how ""Paranormal Activity"" is one of the creepiest horror movies of the year. I thought that if I'm going to see ""Paranormal Activity,"" then I'd better watch this movie again in order to know what I'm in for. After a second viewing, I admit that ""The Blair Witch Project"" is absolutely one of the creepiest horror movies I've ever seen.

Shot like footage, ""BWP"" follows three student filmmakers shooting a documentary: Heather Donahue, Joshua Leonard, and Mike Williams. Heather is the head director of a documentary about the infamous Blair Witch of Blair, Maryland. After many strange and eerie stories of the witch, including the tales of over seven children being kidnapped and found dead, the three teens are pretty skeptical that there really is any witch living in the woods of Burkitsville. As they venture into the woods to shoot their film, strange things happen, things that they never thought would happen. Things that are going to tear them apart emotionally. Heather, Josh, and Mike discover that the Blair Witch might be more than just a legend.

""The Blair Witch Project"" opens as a seemingly ordinary documentary-style horror movie. But there is plenty to love about it. As the movie progresses, it unfolds with a horrifying tension, with an event just as frightening as the one before it. Also, the Burkitsville woods are a perfect atmosphere for the movie. The camera kept closing in on the cast, and it produced a strong feeling of claustrophobia. Whenever I heard a noise in the background, and one of the filmmakers would scream ""What the **** was that?!"", I kept turning my head back and forth to see if there was anything there. ""The Blair Witch Project"" is a very good example of ""What you don't see is scarier than what you do see.""

The movie gives excellent performances by Heather Donahue, Joshua Leonard and Mike Williams. The most iconic moment of the movie, with Heather turning on the camera and making a tearjerking apology to her family and the others, is one of the most heartbreaking moments of the movie.

""The Blair Witch Project"" was a movie with a very low budget of 11,000 dollars. And after a lot of hype, audiences ran to the theaters and were scared out of their wits, bringing in over 5, million dollars in a weekend. The movie had beaten out the box-office record that was held by the horror classic ""Halloween."" This movie takes a rather simple premise and goes a long way with it. It's scary, eerie, claustrophobic, and leaves you on the edge of your seat. ""The Blair Witch Project"" is perfect psychological horror.

"Gjay2","the woods will never be the same again","17 May 2002","A lot of people tell me that they did not find the blair witch project scary in anyway shape or form. I later found out that most of these people had seen it in the cinema so what do they expect. You can not be truly scared when you are surrounded by loads of other people, eating and coughing and walking in and out all the time. So i waited for it to come to video. And when it arrived, i rented it, went home, waited till midnight, closed one set of curtains, left another set open, turned off all the lights and plugged in my big headphones. Now that is the best way to view this film, because after it had finished, i found myself running up the stairs, straight into the bathroom just so i could lock the door behind me. The Blair Witch Project chilled me to the bone. When i was younger, i played a lot in my local woods, and sometimes i would be afraid of what lurked in them, so this film attacked that fear with a vengeance. The performances (improvisations) were very real, aswell as the atmosphere. The attitudes the three characters had were believable, very human unlike most other horror films. And with my headphones on, each footstep, shout and the quiet cracking of twigs could be heard, which made it more chilling, as it's the almost unhearable sounds which create the scares. So if you're gonna watch this movie, do it right, be brave and watch it on your own with the lights off. I think everyone who didn't like it would have a different perspective if they watched it like that.","10"

"San Franciscan","It may sound cliched, but I was unable to sleep for 4 nights.","25 December 1999","I'm not a fan of horror films at all, probably because they don't impress me. Oh sure, their special effects tend to go ""gross out"" and all, and they get a reaction from me, but as far as I'm concerned being grossed out is not the same thing as being terrified. Just because something looks or acts disgusting doesn't mean it frightens me. And to be frank, I've grown bored with the constant parade of ""horror"" movies coming out these days, and not just because I don't care for them... also because they don't frighten me. Enter THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT, the first movie I've ever seen which terrified me so badly that I was unable to sleep for four nights! (It doesn't help that my apartment is currently in a cellar. If you've seen the movie, you know what I'm talking about.) This is a movie for, say, computer game fans who prefer thinking games to arcade style games, THIEF as opposed to QUAKE. This is very much a thinking person's movie, and those who (I hate to say it) don't have much imagination will get precious little out of it because they are the types who need to have their visuals spoonfed to them. I did have a few complaints about the film, but many were answered in the info provided by www.blairwitch.com. **The following are considered spoilers, if you prefer to see the film without knowing any background info first, please stop reading.** For example, I kept wondering why no one tried using any of the techniques of that ""lost in the woods"" book that was brought along. But then, I went to the webpage and read the personal diary that was there which said things like (paraphrased), ""Why can't I remember what I'm supposed to do after reading it so much in that book? Why isn't our compass working?"" The suggestion is that they've been put until a spell by the Blair Witch, and that it's slowly eating away at their logic...and maybe even screwing around with their compass? The only part which still makes me jump a little bit with suspicion is the idea of carrying the cameras and filming everything all the way to the very end of the film. While this is soothed a bit by the fact that the webpage's diary says (paraphrased again), ""I'm going to film everything that happens, so hopefully some good will come out of this..."" so it can be argued that the characters continued doing so in case they felt they'd need the filmed information in the future, I can't help but wish that, say, they had been equipped with those special cameras that mounts on one's head so they could have an excuse to forget the cameras were still rolling while everything was happening. That's the only slight damper on what is otherwise a brilliant film, and I for one am willing to suspend disbelief enough to enjoy such a great movie. It may very well become at this rate the only scary movie I would ever actually BUY.","10"

"Rinho18","My number 18 movie","5 March 2001","The Blair Witch Project is my number 18 movie. It is a great horror flick, at least if you see it on the big screen, and it was something very new. When I saw this movie in cinemas back in 1999, I was not that impressed. But when I was home again, alone in my room and heard any noise downstairs, I started liking it.

After having seen Blair Witch Project, camping will never be the same. It is the same with surfing after Jaws.

The thing I HATE about Blair Witch is that there was a sequel. The sequel still is the worst piece of cr*p I have ever seen in my entire life. I recommend watching Blair Witch Project either in cinemas, or alone in a dark room. This film includes unbelievable psycho-terror, at least for me. I read many comments who claimed that this just was not scary, but it was. There have been scarier movies, definitely ( The Exorcist, The Sixth Sense, It ), but this is at least in the Top 10 of the scariest movies ever. You just have to want it to be scary. I am glad that I love this movie, since so many people did not.

Good points : acting, directing, authentic camera work, story, ENDING

Bad points : sequel, too short, there could have been more shock effects ( there were just some, but those were very shocking )

All in all, I rate this movie 9.8/10 and recommend watching it alone in a dark room.

"jonmccann","Fascinating - for the wrong reasons (or are they?!)","11 April 2021","Late to the party, simply because a work colleague dared me to watch this as homework, after spending an afternoon procrastinating rather than working! To clarify, I am not a horror movie fan, and have very specific labels for horror - paranormal horror, psychological horror, old school horror etc!

I most certainly have this as psychological horror, it is to me the same style as Saw, as in it is written to build and test the boundaries of your mind and where and when you scare - it is different to me than paranormal horror, which are films like paranormal activity, or the ring, specifically designed to challenge your thoughts on ghosts from the outset, and hit a scare nerve intermittently, so that you struggle to forget!

I felt it necessary to clear the above up, just so you understand my rationale for my review - basically I thought this was really rubbish, I practically skipped and danced through this, waiting for something to happen - BUT that's the point isn't it?! I saw this on a sunny Sunday afternoon, in my living room with a cup of coffee, it didn't even really entertain me, but it wouldn't, because this film was never designed to be watched at home in those circumstances, that is the point of it, your best viewing of this film would be in Delamere* Forest on a cold wintry night, with just a tent, torch and maybe a video camera but nothing else, save for food and drink, then watching it would likely have scared the bee Jesus out of me and that's why people in my opinion, including myself, struggle to understand how other's can rate it soo highly, because context is everything for this type of movie.

There is no point me complaining about aspects of the film, because it was shot purposefully the way it was, with the hope true fans of the genre would watch it as intended and get it, it is for cult horror fans only. I do get, watching this in a dark cinema probably did it more justice, but sadly it's not my thing and my rating reflects this and the fact it simply relies on external factors to bring it too life!

"Skeletors_Hood","Someone did their Hitchcock homework....","20 January 2003","Why do people find this movie scary and others do not? Having spent many of my years watching all sorts of horror movies, I can say that this movie is very eerie and scary, even more so than most of the movies from the last two decades.

First off, the propaganda around the movie sets up that these events really happened, so people see the movie the way many would have watched the OJ trial or the JFK assassination...they weren't there for a movie, they went to see a documentary, so they were a bit freaked to begin with. It also helped the realism along that it was filmed by the actors on video cameras.

Plus, they never show you the Blair Witch, and folks, that's spook genius right there. Rent any number of Alfred Hitchcock's films, and you may see a parallel. What you don't see will scare you more than what you do see. When we watch a Jason or Freddy movie, we are relieved when they come on screen, because we can stay in that ""it's a movie mindset."" But by not seeing the witch, you mind can't find that mindset as easily, leaving it to your imagination, which can raise your pulse just a little more than normal.

And yes, the movie is slow, but that's part of the whole point. It builds to the climax we see at the end, taking us on a ramp of anxiety, rather than the up and down formula of a slasher movie. Boring? At first, yes. Dull? Only if you aren't paying attention...

Take it for what you will, I see a great addition to the horror genre. And whether you love this movie or hate it, you must admit that there are certainly fewer people going camping nowadays.",NA
"Tcarts76","The Film that launched one of the worst trends in filmmaking","29 September 2012","This is one of the most awful overrated, over touted, and waste of a viewers time ever made. The only credit I give to this movie is that it actually fooled a lot of people into thinking it was a true story and it launched the worst trend ever in the industry now known as the ""Found footage"" movie or what I call it: ""The new excuse to make a really bad movie"" trend.

This movie is not scary at all. I felt like a genius when I waited for this to come out on DVD, because as I expected, it was horrible. I do say that at the time it was a genius idea and it was something new. It is one of those ideas that should have just stayed that, an idea.

I can't believe people got conned into this crap. The acting was poor, it was basically shot as a home movie. Do you enjoy when your friends break out the family vacation videos? No, I didn't think so. So why do I want to watch a movie that is about the same thing.

Was it scary...not even close. I have seen Disney cartoons that are scarier than this. If fact this movie was credited for making movie goers sick because of the bouncing around poor quality photography.

If you want to see scary home video's go down to the local Walmart and ask to see their security tapes, they are bound to be more interesting and far more nightmarish then this heap of dung.

Every version is a bit different, but the details are unsettling.The tension mounts as the trio begins a two-day hike into the desolate forest to the witch's reputed lair. ""The Blair Witch Project"" is terrifying. It's also an exuberant prank of genius. The thought that Blair Witch Project just might be real makes it much scarier than any of the teen horror flicks that have stumbled along in recent years. keeps audiences in the dark about its titular villain thus proving that imagination can be as scary as anything on screen.Scarier than ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre."" Scarier than the shower scene in ""Psycho"" the first time you see it. Scarier than the final twist in ""Carrie"" and the shark attacks in ""Jaws.""""The Blair Witch Project"" is scary because it doesn't really show you anything.A lesson that other horror directors would be well-served to learn. There's only a brief moment when you see blood, but it registers like a howitzer.t also makes us as viewers uncomfortably complicit in the characters' suffering. Watching the film is an act of ghoulish voyeurism. We're granting their wish to attract an audience, but at a cost they never could have imagined. It's a chilling comment on action-thrillers that sell sanitised brutality as fun, and the decadent appetites that draw us to them, like Romans to the Colosseum.

Clasp your hands, press them into your lap, cross your legs tight and brace yourself. You're about to take one hell of a ride. A sequel, Book of Shadows: Blair Witch 2, was released in the autumn of 2000, but was poorly received by most critics.A third instalment has been announced.","10"

"Novelty","Avoid at all cost!","3 March 2000","Oh, my. I wasn't overly enthusiastic when I saw the trailer for this one, and I avoided it at the theaters. I'm glad I did, because it was absolutely appalling! I was really in the mood for a chill when I began watching BWP, but I soon started yawning. And there was no turning point, it just got worse and worse!

First of all, what's the point with this movie? To scare, would be the only possible answer (apart from making dollars). Well, I wasn't the least scared more than a few moments. The rest of the time was just a plain bore, and the climax of the movie is actually a big anticlimax. What about the script? Was there one, or was everything made up as they shot the movie? The lines were certainly not believable, and the actors didn't add anything to their roles. No soundtrack deepened the atmosphere, and the visuals were uninspiring; how many minutes of the movie were completely dark?

Actually, I can't find one good thing to say about BWP, and that doesn't happen to me often. Even the Critters are more scary. This is a dull, tedious and unimaginative movie that should be avoided at all cost.","1"
"Mr_Mirage","This is the future.","28 August 2003","While many deride this film as empty, or less than entertaining, the fact remains, like it or not: This is the future of filmmaking. Period.

If you hate or loathe this film, all I can say is: do it yourself, do better. Like it or not, the makers of BWP have pointed the way. Anyone with access to a digital camera, computer and a simple editing program has the capacity to make a film.

This particular piece, so roundly trashed by many, does have its own, odd, quirky points, moments that stand out and are now part of the horror iconography.

While the detractors moan and groan, a simple tale from my own experience explains why I love this odd little thing.

One of my supervisors overheard me enthusing about BWP. He chided me, as I am sure so many others will, about how ""bad"" the film was, how ""stupid"" and simply not scary. He went on in detail, and I responded simply ""to each their own,"" or some such. A few seconds afterwards, though, he pulled me aside and asked:

""It wasn't ... REAL... was it?""

See, one of the greatest things about BWP is its simplicity.

Once upon a time, two boys and a girl went into the dark forest, and were never heard from again.

The stuff whispered around campfires, or cautionary tales told by grandmothers to correct the unruly child... the power is in the simplicity.

Would that Hollywood could see the point... but I fear they are blinded to it... I have hope, though, because, as mentioned above, this is the future, I have the technology, and I can do it myself, should I so choose... I would invite anyone that hates this film to see if they can do better, not so much as a throw down challenge, but rather as a simple desire to see what others can do with such limited resources.","10"
"LanceBrave","A Perfectly Plausible Urban Legend","27 March 2014","Upon release in 1999, ""The Blair Witch Project"" was immediately declared a horror classic. The film was a huge sleeper hit and remains one of the highest grossing independent films to this day. Much of the film's box office success can be contributed to its brilliant marketing campaign. Through a then innovative website (which, charmingly, remains up and mostly unchanged to this day), the studio convinced countless people that the film was genuine. That the footage of three college students entering the woods, attempting to make a documentary about a local legend, and mysteriously disappearing, was the real deal. I wasn't fooled at the time, recognizing it as the clever marketing ploy it was, but many of my middle school classmates were. After the hype wore off, a backlash quickly kicked in, many derisively describing ""The Blair Witch Project"" as ""eighty minutes of jerks wandering around the woods."" Nearly fifteen years later, after hundreds of found footage films have followed in its wake, how does the film hold up? That the film managed to fool so many is a testament to the believable mythology it builds up over its brief run time. The legend of the Blair Witch is surprisingly detailed. The metafictional device is furthered by setting the story in a real town, Burkittsville, Maryland. Though completely invented, the Blair Witch seems like a perfectly plausible urban legend. Numerous missing children over the years are connected to the story. In the forties, a serial killer blamed his murders on the witch. The three filmmakers visit a local nut, Mary Brown, who claims to have encountered the witch. In the early scenes, local people from the town are interviewed, each giving their own opinion and stories on the legend. We are shown Coffin Rock and its gory story is related to us. In practice, the Blair Witch isn't any different then the Bell Witch, Mothman, the Bunnyman or any other real life urban legends.

The success of ""The Blair Witch Project"" is built mostly on the unsettling atmosphere it generates. The film begins with white-on-black title card, letting us know that the three kids don't make it out of the woods. This information lends many of the early scenes a quiet unease. Even when Heather, Josh, and Mike are goofing off, we know dark times lay ahead for them. The movie takes the woods setting a long way. Though frequently parodied in the years since, the scenes of the three kids running blind through the dark woods, listening for strange noises, still have the power to chill. These scenes are low-tech, relying on nothing but the real fears of the viewers and the actor's terrified performances.

What engineered horror elements ""The Blair Witch Project"" does have are equally subtle. Throughout the film, the campers make strange discoveries. First, they find strange piles of rocks outside their tents. Infamously, they come upon bizarre stick figures hanging in the trees. One of the highlights of the movie is, after Josh's disappearance, Heather discovers a bundle of sticks filled with bloody bits of flesh. Donahue's panicked performance really sells that moment.

The common complaint of ""jerks lost in the woods"" certainly does hold some water. Long scenes in the middle section are composed of the characters wandering around, yelling at each other. While it certainly adds to the film's tone of desperation and a few moments, such as a revelation concerning some downed logs, prove effective. However, this part of the movie goes on for far too long. As short as it is, ""The Blair Witch Project"" is truthfully a little long and probably would have been best served as an hour long short.

The ending makes up for a lot though. The survivors stumble into a strange house in the middle of the forest. The ending is notorious and well known. It's also incredibly stark. The viewer is left with no answers, the mystery maintained. First time viewers might not even catch why Josh is facing the wall in the basement, a reference to the earlier legend. The effect is intensely creepy, the found footage illusion maintained until the end credits roll.

""Blair Witch"" was a true pop culture phenomenon and that's honestly sort of surprising. I'd never expect a film as low-key or divisive to resonate with so many people. Maybe the internet campaign really caught everyone's attention, even those who knew the movie was fiction. The movie spawned a television special, several books, comics, collectible figures, a much-contested sequel, even a series of computer games. Yet its biggest influence was on the horror genre. It took about another decade for found footage to really catch on, hundreds of copy cats following in the wake of the wildly successful ""Paranormal Activity"" series. Every notable title in the sub-genre to come, from ""Cloverfield"" to the ""Marble Hornets"" web series, owes something to ""The Blair Witch Project.""","7"
"Kajisan","Worst movie ever?","14 July 1999","""Blair Witch"" is one of those movies that either lives or dies on whether or not you're really, really scared of the things that go bump in the night. If rocks banging around, bundles of twigs hanging in trees, and unknown voices in the night are what freak you out, then maybe you really will be scared by what's happening here. Still, the whole ""the most terrifying thing to the human mind is the unknown"" is a little overplayed here, to say the least. Hey, even in ""Jaws"" we eventually got to see the shark. This thing was made on a shoestring budget and it shows. Why did they even bother to use 16mm when the best parts are on video? Anyhow, blah, blah, blah, get ready for a disappointment, folks. This thing probably would make a good five-minute campfire story, but for crying out loud, why make something that goes on for so long but, like our heroes, really doesn't go much of anywhere by the end?

Having said this, sure, most of you are going to go see this movie anyhow. I can't even convince my friends not to. But if you have any morals, at least buy a ticket for something else and sneak into ""Blair."" This movie isn't worth the price of admission.","1"
"len-21","9 on a scale of 10","30 August 1999","I saw this movie before I read any reviews on imdb. After going back and reading dozens of them, I realize that many people were unfortunately victims of the hype. By that I don't mean they went to a movie that wasn't worthy of their hard-earned money, but rather they went expecting something other than what the movie delivered.

I think the critics loved it so much because it was fresh, unique, original, riveting, well-acted, and because they hadn't been told ahead of time that it was the scariest movie of all time. And, by the way, it isn't.

However, if you enter the theater with the only idea that you are going to accept the premise for what it is and go along for the ride and don't expect a Hollywood ending (which would be impossible anyway if it were truly a real story), then you will be more than entertained. I was and so was my wife.

I wouldn't call it scary, but I would call it creepy - very creepy. And, it leaves you with some questions that you want to be left with. I mean it would take another hour or more to have answers. The idea is that a film made by dead kids in the forest is found. Do you think they had time to wrap up a perfect ending just immediately before they were killed???? I don't think so.

As to the jerky camera movements. All I can say is that I get sea sick on the water as well as queasy when I view surround video. And, I don't like roller coasters, etc. Nevertheless, shortly after the movie began, I didn't think about it again. I was too wrapped up in the adventure.","9"

"allyjack","Deserves its success","3 August 1999","I think it's the snuff film aspect of the exercise that's most captivating - the psychological verisimilitude inherent in the working method, coupled with the knowledge (from the opening caption) that there will be no happy ending, marks it as a morbidly voyeuristic exercise - but with a contemporariness that lends itself to a bandwagon and to mainstream respectability. The characterizations are well-judged, with the initial hubris of Heather's leadership providing the perfect springboard for the tensions that explode as their situation worsens - I didn't detect many false notes in it. It pushes all the buttons while remaining open to ambiguity and alternative interpretations, and on the whole seems to me to deserve its success for its fresh but respectful approach to the genre.","8"

Without the success of Blair Witch you wouldn't have series like Paranormal Activity and other found footage flicks. As far as the movie goes, I watched it with little prior knowledge and while it was definitely a slow and shakily shot it managed to ratchet up the fear and intensity with simple but effective methods and annoying though fitting acting. Each night they spent in the forest added to the tension as you wondered what they would encounter next. The abrupt and frightening ending was suitable for a found footage film and it left me with a fear of people quietly facing walls without responding haha.

"Phroggy","Back to the roots","28 July 1999","Since there was no ""hype""in France and I don't listen to critics anyway, I saw this movie with no preconceptions other than the trailer. By the way, it must be the cheaper-made movie in recent history ! Instead of being innovative, it gave me the feeling of going back to the roots of horror with stories, not by Lovecraft, but Algernon Blackwood (""The Wendigo"") or Arthur Machen, who could convey this sense of unseen terror and dangerous landscapes. The idea seemed reminescent of the ""dogma"" movies and a series of mock-documentaries made by the French/German TV channel Arte, all showing false documentaries about abnormal events presented as the real thing - but giving the trick in the end to question the viewer's gullibility. (But the filmmakers of BWP can't have seen it, of course.) And the movie ? I thought the end was a bit of a let-down, but as a suspense story, it was quite gripping. Why all the hype ? Maybe because low-budget ground-breaking horror is an established tradition since NOTLD and there was nothing else around ?(Like ""Henry"", very overrated in my opinion.) Why did the media jumped on it ? Maybe the devil made them do it, or i","7"
"TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews","Lame, slow and amateurish","3 July 2004","How someone can actually take this obviously fake documentary seriously is beyond me. I guess the world has too many naive, superstitious people. The film has so many revealing things in it, like audio continuing from one clip to another, that is supposed to take place several hours later. The whole thing is so obviously staged that you'd have to *really* want to believe it to believe it. The film has no actual scares... just a bunch of sequences that might seem scary if you believe them, which requires you to be very naive. What could have been a decent enough attempt at a semi-scary documentary is ruined by it containing scenes that there is no possible reason that any sane person would film(if it were real), including arguments, fights and various pointless conversations. The worst thing about this film is that there are actually people who believe it. People who think that this film was a true documentary, and that everything on the film happened. I can't believe that there are people who are actually that naive and superstitious, that they'll accept something so blatantly obvious fake as real. I mean, I don't have anything against people who believe in ghosts and witches, not at all, don't believe any of it myself, but I wouldn't entirely write it off as rubbish if someone was trying to convince me it does exist; but to go from believing in it, to grabbing something so obviously fake and try to pass it off as evidence in these phenomenons... I mean, had they actually documented something real, something that actually happened, that can't be scientifically explained, then I would say that the movie actually accomplished something. But it doesn't. It just preys on naive, superstitious people. No one, and I do mean no one, in their right mind could possibly accept any part of this rubbish as real. The whole thing reeks of 'staged'. I won't even comment on plot, acting or character development as it's all non-existent. This movie is just plain bad. It has no actual positive qualities. Please, do yourself a favor: don't watch this movie, as it will just waste an hour and a half of your life, and you will not have gained anything, any new knowledge at all by the end of this awful excuse for a movie. I don't recommend this to anyone, seeing how all it is, is the ultimate proof that there are too many ignorant, naive people in the world.

Anyway, the film was not the least bit scary (unless you are scared by piles of little rocks and the sounds of sticks being hit together). I can't believe I sat through the whole movie. I just kept thinking, 'o.k. it's gotta get better because of all the great reviews, especially the one that read 'Scary as Hell!.' Alas, it wasn't. What a waste.

There are much better films that scare you that you never get to see the 'evil entity', so I don't buy the argument that says I have no imagination since I never saw the witch. ""Evil Dead"" is still the best 'Horror in the Woods' movie and that film never showed the entity either. And it was a million times scarier than this piece of overhyped trash.

But the filmmakers made millions, so I guess their happy and my opinion doesn't mean squat, since they already got my 8 bucks.

"lou-50","Hungry, Cold, and Hunted","7 August 1999","Three filmmakers go to the woods near Burkittsville, Maryland to shoot a documentary on a mysterious local legend but what they discover in the reenacted film, ""The Blair Witch Project"", is much more tragic than they could imagine. This is a unique and terrifying film in which all that we see comes through the lens of two cameras that the three bring along - one, 16 mm black and white, for the documentary and the other, full video color, as a tag-along. This depiction is already spooky enough because the audience becomes voyeurs through the eyes and senses of these filmmakers; indeed, they accurately reflect upon this technique as a sort of filtered reality'. Therefore, we see a blending of the images of the two cameras which, while sequential in time, comes across as choppy rather than continuous because they decide when the camera should be turned on and when it should be off. This adds to the heightened suspense as the three people get totally lost in the forest and we never get a full picture of what is confronting them because our vantage point has been micro-sized to their level. ""The Blair Witch Project"" is challenging, tricky filmmaking but it works because it is one of the few times in cinema that you can feel and experience what the participants are experiencing that very moment. Toward the end of the film, one of the characters, Heather, looks into the camera and poignantly apologizes to each of the three mothers about how sorry she is in getting them all involved in a tragedy that she well senses. That is a particularly powerful message about taking responsibility for one's actions. For me, the appeal of ""The Blair Witch Project"" goes beyond the chills and frights of a brilliantly conceived form of cinematography. It boils down to accepting failure as a necessary part of life, however tragic and final that might be.",NA
"SmileysWorld","A uniquely done classic!","26 September 2001","When my wife first approached me with the idea of going to see a film called ""The Blair Witch Project"",my immediate thought was,""The Blair what???"".I heard nothing of this movie,no advertisements or anything,prior to going to the theater,so naturally I was skeptical.Normally,when I have a premonition that a film is going to be horribly bad,9 times out of 10,it turns out to be right.This time,however,I was pleasantly surprised. What we have here is a very uniquely done classic horror film that I think we can safely place in the same ranks as ""Night of the Living Dead""(the original '68 classic).Just look at the similarities;Both were very cheaply done with a practically unknown cast.Most of the people I have spoken with about this movie either love it a lot,or hate it a lot,but one thing I look for in a good movie is uniqueness,and this movie definitely has it.

This is certainly an approach that I truly respect. Not many simply-shot films work, this could not have worked, but it did. It also happened to work because of all it's realism. Just three untrained actors working. I found all of them perfect. They did not seem to act, they just seemed as normal, and very realistic, which after all did help this film. I also always wondered how people in horror films should truly act in real life. Well, this is possibly the only film that really feels like it is a real-life experience. I also think that the writing, the dialogue, really was very strong. It was not just because of the camera, but it also added to the complete realism. The Blair Witch Project is definitely a film that stands out in every aspect.",NA

"Tin Man-5","The SCARIEST movie ever made....and not a single drop of blood.","9 August 1999","I've been reviewing movies for a long time. I'm the Entertainment Editor for a local newspaper, and I've been studying films for a while. I thought I had the whole movie thing pretty much figured out, and I went in to see ""The Blair Witch Project"" thinking, yeah....just another quickie filmed to cash in on the success of ""Scream.""

What I saw defied and challenged everything I have ever known about filmmaking, and quite frankly, it's sending me back to the books to try to figure out just how the heck they managed to pull it off.

This is indeed the scariest, creepiest movie that has ever come out of Hollywood....EVER. Scarier than ""Night of the Living Dead."" Scarier than ""Scream."" Scarier than anything. You name it, I've seen most of them. And they don't hold a candle to this one.

The reason is, there's no monster. No real emphasis of supernatural events. Just three college students trapped in the woods, in a battle with unseen supernatural forces and nature. This alone would have set the stages for a good movie, kind of an interesting play on paranioa. But it takes it a level higher....or maybe a level lower. It's filmed like a documentory, with a camcorder that shakes and moves the whole time. And that leaves it all absolutely nervewracking.

Here's the premise, and it's pretty simple: three college students are out to film a documentory about the Blair Witch, an Urban Legend from the woods of Maryland. But upon a closer examination, they get lost in the woods, and it's basically an account of their struggle, from fleeing from ghostly apparitions in the night to battling with each other. And it's all filmed on a camcorder, and presented like one would present a family vacation that they taped themselves. It's not even in widescreen format....just plain camcorder.

Therefore, it's all realistic, and you question whether or not it is false or ACTUAL footage, due to the authenticity. I was in a cold sweat fifteen minutes into it, and but the terrifying closing scene, I was losing my nerve and trembling violently. Only one other film has come close to having this affect on me....the original ""Candyman""....but it doesn't come anywhere close to this. I knew that film was made up....But this....this challenged fiction and you are absolutely convinced it is real. Kevin Williamson, hate to say it, but you've suddenly been booted into second place by a handful of unprofessionals!

What also helps its realism is the fact that the actors are so great. Most horror movies nowadays have great looking leading teenage actors getting slashed, but this one features normal looking people in terrifying situations. How affective are they? Believe me when I say that Oscar nominations WILL arise.... The character of Heather (an actress playing herself, like her co-stars) has a scene in which she apologizes to the camera for getting her friends into this whole mess. She knows she will die soon, and she is trembling with fear....and it is the finest performance I have ever seen in a horror movie....ever.

Filmed with almost no budget (a budget would have taken away from it), it is choppy and a mess....just like a camcorder recording always is....and that just helps the situation. And this only enhanced the true affect of the film. No film has ever scared me as terribly as this movie.... Go see it only if you think you're strong enough to handle it. Not for the intense gore (there is none), but for the true suspence. This is indeed a horror film that challenges the idea that horror movies need gore, and I totally respect that. That challenge it also sent me screaming, and it will you, as well.

So if you wanted to see this movie thinking a hockeymask-wearing maniac jumps from the bushes, lopping heads off with an axe, you've been heavily misinformed. You can't be cheated, nothing of the sort was ever stated in the ads. This is a movie about REAL terror, not about 7 foot mutes who get up after stabbing them 20 times with a pitch fork. Those who say they've never been remotely scared or at least feeling uneasy when hearing strange sounds in the woods at night, read no further. You don't really exist. I dare you to really watch this movie, try to experience it, and then go out in the woods at night and say you're totally cool when you hear children crying out in the dark, or twigs snapping all around you as if you're surrounded by a group of unknown animals or even humans.

I must honestly say i knew about the hype when i saw this movie, and still wasn't disappointed, because once again, i KNEW there was going to be no Jason hiding in any barn waiting for an unsuspecting victim to foolishly come strolling in just to get spliced into ribbons of human flesh. I expected frustration, anger, fear, hysteria and downright TERROR. You know, the emotions real people have when in a situation like this. That's why the acting was perfect. These were real flesh and blood people who first got uneasy, then frustrated to getting more scared with each abnormal sound or found object. Real people yell at each other when frustrated and get hysterical when at the end of their emotional ropes. The photography and editing was perfect too. To people saying it was amateuristic: HELLO,WAKE UP! The whole idea of the movie is based on the premise of amateur filmmakers making the footage we, as an audience, see when they go into the woods. If these amateur filmmakers made professionally shot footage, then it would have been an amateuristic movie. The whole thing is brilliant. Right upto and including the nerve-wrecking ending. If you only have about 50.000 dollars to spend and want to make to make the best movie you can make with that kind of movie, this is how you make it.

HALLOWEEN 2021 FILM MARATHON #1 78/100

It goes without saying that the freshness The Blair Witch Project radiates is, incontrovertibly, the film's mightiest aspect. That said, the film overlooks that need of going further with its narrative in order to be even more conspicuous, leaving me with a half-full bigger picture, leaving me half full in general....

The taut notion the film manages to hold up until its very ending (which couldn't be any more divisive, by the way), make the film gripping enough to keep me tied up despite a lack of soundtrack and charming cinematography. It's almost as if the movie wants you to overlook it as an extant feature and more as some real-life event, achieving it almost entirely if it weren't for some bits of dialogue and post-production decisions.....

Although it struggles to justify its runtime and plot decisions despite being so intentionally cursory, The Blair Witch Project's sense of natural divisiveness between whoever dares to watch it might probably justify why it feels as a particular treat to check out at this time of the year....","7"

People say Hollywood insults their intelligence, but after the success of Blair Witch, I wonder if the mass audience has any intelligence to insult.

This is an amateurish gimmick movie. No more, no less.

I can only hope nobody wastes their time making a knock off version of Blair Witch, because as stupid as this MTV generation might be, I don't think you can fool them twice.

I´m sorry, but The Blair Witch Project just didn´t work for me. Maybe it´s because I knew that it was fake before I actually saw it. Thus, all I got to see was three kids trying to scare me with a flashlight in the dark, panic cries and wooden sticks hanging around in the woods. And of course the low optic and acoustic quality which made an utterly boring movie unbearable. The ending sucked, too, I was neither frightened nor surprised.

"poem","Realism - in a degree never seen before","2 December 1999","Hard to say anything about this. Is it good ? Is it bad ? I don't know. I just know that I've sat during the movie nearly without any move, with full concentration, without thinking about anything else but the movie, what will happen next. It was so realistic. Is reality good or bad ? Does any of the ordinary categories for movies matter if its real, and not only a game ?

This movie focuses enormously, nay in an ideal way, on the character development. There is no sudden change, no compression of the emotions, like normally in movies. Everything happens in a way and speed normal emotions of real people would develop. If the characters had changed very much, there had been a pause of some hours where they didn't used the camera. I repeat myself, everything here looks totally real. I've never seen that in this degree in a movie before. And I'm wondering why I've never missed that in all these comedies and tragedies and maladies (french: illnesses) I've seen before. So often I've called a movie ""realistic"" before, not knowing that it wasn't realistic at all, compared with this reference.

This is not a horror movie. Read it again: this is not a horror movie. One could say much about the properties of all horror movies I've seen before, brutal, idiotic, boring, or sometimes funny, and some classical movies (such as Nosferatu, eine Symphonie des Grauens (1922)) even brilliant - but they where never, never realistic. I often cursed inside when I saw how illogical people behave in ordinary horror movies. Not here. No way. So at least if you're a fan of horror movies, you are not at all guaranteed to like this one, for its so different.

The screen picture is often of very bad quality, especially in the night. Is this a fault or an advantage ? Of course, this is also realistic; the ears gets more informations what's happening than the eye in the night.

So what should I say ? Who could enjoy this movie ? I've no clue. I guess that many horror fans might even hate it. Everyone might hate it. But everyone might also love it. I've no clue, except that I think (I'm not finally sure!) I myself liked it.

Will there ever be a movie like this so successful ? I think so. It has very big faults, but also big strengths, and I think its strength are the more important ones. Again, I'm not sure. I don't know if I've seen a revolution or a bad joke of a movie.","9"
"Beeblebrox","A refute to the detractors. (possible spoilers)","3 August 1999","Considering the comments of 90% of the comments on this site, this film has proven to be(for lack of a better word) powerful. There have been some criticisms that I think are unfounded, especially if you pay close attention to the dialogue.

""No real person would keep filming while going through what we saw on the screen."" If the film itself did not address this issue, I would be inclined to agree. However, during one of the day shots Josh began repeatedly bothering Heather about why she was still filming. She replied that this(filming) is all I have left(to keep her sanity). Furthermore, when Josh goes behind the camera, he says something to the effect of, ""you know, I can see why you keep filming. It's not quite reality through the viewfinder, you can trick yourself into thinking that it's not real."" Heather was the only one I think who truly thought this way...she pretty much just bullied, nagged, and prodded the others into going along with her.

Another complaint was why didn't they use the stream or the sun to find their way out of the woods? Well, you could go for two arguments here. One, perhaps they were just too dumb or too scared to do it correctly. Which is fairly hard to swallow considering that following a compass' arrow isn't rocket science, but can be an argument nevertheless.(Perhaps Heather never read her bought copy of How to Stay Alive in the Woods) What I think happened is that the witch kept them where she wanted them. If this supposed supernatural being is real, I don't think confusing a group of lost students who are obviously out of their element would be that big of a deal.

It is not very difficult to tell who ""got"" the movie. It's not a question of academia, or film history, or even horror itself. The way the movie gets you is the involuntary empathy you are drawn into because of the immadiance which is achieved by only using footage shot by the actors from their cameras. Sure, many people hated the characters and found them annoying, but such is life. In the real world, not all are are likeable or sometimes even believable.

If you get a chance, read how the film was shot. It's an interesting story. Basically, the directors put the three into the woods with no script and two cameras and left them baskets with tiny portions of food and a few needed plot events. They told them, ""you won't see us, but we will be watching. In the night we will mess with you. We won't hurt you, but we will try to scare the hell out of you."" Did it work? I think so.

The film is full of gems. The humor, Heather's soliloquy, and of course, the end scene. Even using the black and white 16mm camera for the final shot gave it the crispness and utter dread that marks it as art that can only be fully appreciated if one pays careful attention to the initial interviews.

This film is more than a horror movie. It should be rated NC-17 not because of gore or porn(which there is none) but because of the utter frankness and reality that the film submits to the viewer. Children, the faint of heart, and those with mental or emotional stress should avoid this movie. Pardon the language, but the only succint way to describe this film is ""It will f*ck you up.""

Given a big enough budget this film could have been terrifying. Instead it was just dull. Most of the time you are staring at a black screen waiting for something to happen. It doesn't.

There wasn't a scantly-clad babysitter getting slashed and gutted on screen, but 3 filmmakers lost in the woods getting terrified by things that go bump in the night. It's not what you see that scares you, but what's implied. Also, it's very intelligent. You need to pay attention to the interviews with the townsfolk and relate them to happenings in the movie.

Also, I must warn you that if you get motion sickness fairly easily, take precaution because the camera is almost nonstop shakiness and I felt kind of nauseous by the end.

If I had to pick between 1. horribly horrific scariness or 2. queasy, nauseous, I-think-I'm-gonna-barf scariness, I would pick the second. Very scary and gut-wrenching, because my imagination made things way more horrible than ever.

The Blair Witch Project - 30 minutes after seeing it! By, BillStoll@aol.com

Alright I saw it. I had to cross the country to Los Angeles. to find a theater showing it. But I did it. You need to too.

There are a hundred summaries of the film's plot on www.imdb.com, so I'll mercifully avoid restating it. My reaction to all the hype follows instead. Here at a Santa Monica, 800 seat theater near L.A., the show was sold out ""seven shows"" in advance. We wound up going to Sunday night's 9:50 PM showing (that's about 1 PM, east coast). And it was worth the wait and navigating through the packed (large!) theater's audience. Which I hate to do, generally speaking.

A comment first about movie's quality. The home movie (shaky camera; crappy images) thing got on my nerves eventually, as I thought it might . . . until the last ten minutes or so, when the movie pays off. Trust someone who has seen a lot of horrr films in his day: You will be freaked out by its closing minutes. Oh yeah. . . . it paints the face of fear like you've never seen it before, then goes on to chronicle it, bringing you along for the ride as it wraps up the story in a neat little package.

Great essays open and close to the same central thesis. Listen closely to the opening small town dialog (about the Blair Witch legends) from the Burkittsville MD residents. In particular, to Mary Brown, one of the creepier castings the creators of this film arranged. It is a clean story, from back to front. Stories like that are what movies should be all about.

There are a hundred things to pick apart regarding the film's manufacture, particularly if you're a fussbudget viewer like myself ( . . . did I actually write that about moi?!). But therein lies the genius of the home movie / college-student approach. You forgive the flaws because the participants and their amateur process (in their fear) surely could have taken the tack portrayed. Anyone reading this ever truly get ""lost in the woods?"" I have (35 years ago albeit) and it is scary. Damned scary! So: to the major criticism assigned by the internet reviewers about it being unrealistic for anyone - under those conditions - to continue filming, my take was that they needed to do ""something"" to preserve their sanity in their hopelessness and terror. The alternative: to give up, wither and die frightened and unproductive in the woods. The prospective flaws (I saw) were the absence of a cell phone or a search party perhaps. However, even as I write this now (late, after getting back to my hotel,) my own cell phone is miles away in my daughter's car trunk, forgotten by yours truly. So anything's possible.

Do I recommend it? (Fargo Voice) Oh, you betcha Margie! It is only 80 minutes or so long; you get a kick out of it at first . . . well, up until those last ten big ones. And those, my friends, are - all by themselves - worth the trip.

Don't worry about sleeplessness after seeing it. Unless you're prone to camping, hiking or living near the woods now or anytime in the future.

See it when it comes to a theater near you.

"Rusty-61","try to ignore the hype and just keep an open mind.","2 August 1999","First, I feel like I have to address the buzz surrounding the movie. I am at the same time disgusted and sort of impressed with the hype. It is pretty clever when you think about it. No trailers (well, they are showing one now, but still, it took them long enough) no cast members doing the rounds on talk shows, no big budget, etc. Just the website, the documentary on the SciFi channel, and bigtime word of mouth. It sure worked. I feel for those actors, since they got paid about what I make in 2 weeks for 3 weeks of hell. I hope to God the filmmakers were generous and gave them points in the film. I am also hearing that at most theaters, they pay the manager, etc to get up before the showing and get the crowd all hyped up, which is kind of lame. When we saw it Saturday, the owner (before she threatened people who had laser pointers) got up and yelled, ""Hey, welcome to Crossroads theater, and ARE YA READY FOR THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT?? Whooooo-hoooo! Everyone READY TO BE SCARED?"" I was like, oh please. I also heard these girls in front of me asking someone next to them if **this was a real documentary**. We got up and moved because I did not want to spend the movie sitting behind someone so incredibly stupid and naive. But I guess that's what a good job they did marketing it, because I heard there are plenty of stupid people out there who think the thing is real. I also grudgingly admire whoever decided to market it initially as a 'hard ticket', meaning they wanted to have it only at one theater or so per city for a few weeks. I'm sure that helped the buzz. Hyping it as the scariest movie of all time (though maybe this is more word of mouth than the filmmakers doing it) is kind of dumb, though, because people are just going to be disapointed, unless all they've seen are ""Scream"" and ""I Know What You Did Last Summer"". I heard kids talking after the movie who were let down because they was very little gore, no monster, and no real pay-off. I had a good time because I told myself not to expect anything. I guess if you go, just keep an open mind, and don't think, ""This better be the scariest movie of all time after all the hype, or I'll be p**sed"". I do think it's kind of funny how the big studios spend millions of dollars marketing their lame summer 'event' pics, but this is the one most people are talking about wanting to see.

So, that's my 2 cents as far as the hype goes. Went and saw BWP for myself this weekend. Inside the theater manager had to come make an announcement about laser pointers, she said if anyone used them during the movie she'd take them away and kick them out. She was this huge, burly, tough woman who looked like a prison warden so people calmed down after that and shut up. Anyway, I loved it. Not the scariest movie I've ever seen, but if you asked me what the scariest movie I've ever seen was, I wouldn't be able to name it. I would saw BWP, the Exorcist, Henry Portrait of a Serial Killer, Last House on the Left (and a couple more I can't think of right now) are like the top scariest. I was really impressed though. Very realistic, the way it was shot and put together, and the character's reactions to stuff. My spouse said it really scared him, which he hardly ever says, because he's been camping and that's like your worst nightmare. The whole movie was very creepy and spooky but the last 5 minutes REALLY scared the crap out of me.

It's funny, the audience started out very rowdy, and I thought I'd have to ""shhh"" people the whole movie. But after the first 5 minutes, people were engrossed. As the film got more and more tense and scary, there were no screams. Instead, the whole audience just sat there cowering quietly in fear. Not a lot of talking back to the screen, etc like there is in most horror movies, and the audience was full of teenagers. That speaks for itself, I think.

I read a review in which they said that the movie was all about panic, and I agree. One of the most upsetting things is the way the charcters go from calm, controlled, and joking, to nervously joking and then arguing, to trying desperately to hold it together, to understandable total freaked out panic by the last reel. As the film draws to a close they just give up all pretenses of composure and control and just panic and run around like maniacs screaming incoherently at the top of their lungs. Usually when characters in a movie do that you feel like slapping them, but the film draws you in so much that you do not blame them, one bit. You know you would probably act the same way if you were in their shoes, and the way the movie is filmed, you are pretty much in their shoes.

Bottom line regarding how scary it is: If I'd been watching it by myself at home at night I probably would have started crying.",NA
"SteakSalad_101","By far...the worst horror movie I've ever seen","22 April 2008","I very, very rarely write reviews for films that I don't see in the theater. However, this is a gross exception. Now you may think I am writing this review because the film I saw was a spectacular piece of cinema, something worth drooling over, spending $20 on and watching every Friday night with a different group of friends. But noI am writing this review to tell you that if you ever so much as THINK of seeing it, I strongly recommend you to reconsider your decision.

Those who know me, know I love a scary film. The original 'Saw' is the only horror movie I have seen that managed to scare me. I picked up The Blair Witch Project after it had been called the scariest film since the Exorcist, genuinely frightening, and among other critics' ravings, I knew I had to give it a shot. So I made myself some tea, some popcorn, and sat down in the middle of the night and put it into my DVD player to watch on my big projection screen TV. All alone with the Blair Witch Project. Some may say, quite a daring thing to do! I may say, quite a laughable thing to do. (that is, laughable in the sense of me thinking I actually was going to be scared.) The Blair Witch Project is 87 minutes of pieces of footage collected by three young adults who go filming a documentary on the Blair Witch legend deep in the woods of Maryland. After interviewing several locals about the legend, they trudge into the woods, only to become horribly lost. They begin seeing strange thingssticks that look like witches, babies crying out in the middle of the night, rocks that magically appear in piles outside their campsyou know. The stuff from your absolute scariest nightmares.

So basically we have these three stupid people who DON'T stop cursing (130 F-bombs in one film) and these poor souls just can't find their way out of the woods. About 75% of the film is made up of footage of these people crossing streams while saying ""turnip! I hope I don't fall!"" and ""I thought we already WERE traveling south!"" The other 25% is made up of them crying during the night in their camps saying ""Jesus kissing Christ, what the kissing turnip was that?! turnip!"" While leaves rustle outside, rocks fall, and voices murmur. Then the morning comes. And they go back to crossing streams. Except this time, their map is gone. Ooh! The Blair Witch took the map! Getting scary, eh? Yeah, right. Then the night comes again. More ""turnip! ITS BACK! turnip! WHERE THE turnip IS JOSH?! turnip!"" Then the morning comes.you get the idea.

I kept thinking ""This has GOT to get scarier, maybe the film hasn't gotten going yet."" I was saying that throughout the whole film. I was even saying it during the final scene, and then the credits came up, and I was like WTF? Is there more? Wow, guess not. To be honest, that's what the Blair Witch Project is. And I'm not being funny or making it seem dumb for the sake of this review's successI'm being completely serious.

All three of the people are laughable. Heather Donahue, who is an actress I love the work of, is the only one who seems mildly genuinely unsettled. The other two just scream like idiots. And then more F-bombs are dropped. Give me a BREAK already.

So yeah. Then we get to the final scenethey find a house in the woods. Pretty scary. They go in, they hear screams in the basement, and their cameras drop. THE END! Roll credits. I was thinking to myself, ""They just used an hour and a half of camera time for something that could've been shown in literally five minutes."" Now, I am not saying that the three people in this situation weren't scared, or wouldn't be scared. It's a pretty creepy set-up. But watching it on a screen? Bleh. It's just three stupid people who can't get out of the woods and who scream and curse at random noises they encounter. Last night I had a dream Nathan Radley from To Kill A Mockingbird snuck into my house, hacked my computer, and stole my kitchen table. And even that was scarier than this terrible movie. I'm not trying to be funny either.

So, in conclusion: mix three stupid people, a big woods, 130 F-bombs, and a bunch of weird noises that don't make sense, and you've got yourself The Blair Witch Project. I mean come ongimme a break. Or, better yet, give YOURSELF a breakand never see this movie.

"Bob-Writer","Entertaining and Original","5 April 2022","I felt the originality of lost tape was immersive. Sure, the story was loose, but the film captured genuine suspense - bringing you into the eyes of the actors. Again, very loose on story structure, dialogue, no character development, but yet, oddly entertaining for a very, super cheap, shoe-string budget horror movie.","8"
"dust-7","Shocked and Horrified!","12 October 1999","(Spoilers! (really))

Shocked - by the hype - after seeing the film, a month or so ago.

Three kids lost in a small wooded area, eager to argue with each other, never able to detach themselves from their camera equipment, unable to stick together even on watch, and so on. It's so bad, hey - it MUST be some sort of satire (that seems the excuse for other silly movies in reviews on imdb).

They don't need the cameras, they don't need a map, they don't need a compass. Take the film you've got, travel light if you think you're being stalked, and head back to the car (remember where you put it?). Follow the sun? And so on. It's nuts.

End of the film I literally shrugged my shoulders, involuntarily, not from horror or fear - but disbelief. What the HECK was that? I asked myself. I could see in the dimly lit multi-plex, the others just shaking themselves awake, seemed to be having similar thoughts - perhaps similar to the person who walked right out in the middle of the lost in the woods scene (sorry - one of the lost in the woods in the day time scenes, as opposed to the scary lost in the woods in the night time scenes).

I was so . . miffed, I haven't been eager to see another theatrical release since. Once burned, right?

I wonder how soon it will be before the 'executive decisions' are made to try the hype again? In for a few thou, in for another few thou? Hey - maybe Blair Witch II - the finding of the film cannisters. Or, Ernest Goes to Camp, in the woods, with a compass - and gets lost. Sundance Festival runner-up. A true watershed in filmolological history. No music. Makes it even better. And Ernest does something truly unique, by shooting macro lens close-ups of his imbecilic features and whispering aloud - ""I'm reaallly scared, I've never been so scared."" And so would we be.",NA
"Smells_Like_Cheese","""You'll leave the movie theater with shock!""","2 June 2002","I left the movie theater with a headache. This was the most over-hyped movie ever!!! All I hear a million times in the movie is ""F**k this. F**k that"". God. How many times do I have to deal with it. I hear that word a million times a day at my school, now in movies? I went to the theater because it was claimed to be ""scary as hell"". I laughed when I got home, so I wouldn't go crazy and run over to the director's house and just smack him for creating this. There is only one good part is at the exact end. When the guy is against the wall, from a legend. Where a killer who claimed to be possessed by the blair witch would gather a bunch of children. And kill them. But when he'd kill one, the rest were facing the wall, like the guy was. And they end it! A scary part, and the end? The credits have to be the best part of this movie. I look at this website...6.3?! 6.3?! I hope the viewers were kidding. Because I have a million people who would say, this was the worst movie of all time!!!

"Tug-3","It hit me where it hurts! (Warning: some possible spoilers)","2 August 1999","It is difficult for me to give an objective review of this film. It is the most terrifying movie _I_ have ever seen, but my appraisal is, in this case, very subjective. I was raised in the Pine Barrens of New Jersey, where Jersey Devil lore still runs rampant and where, as recently as five years ago, a city-slicker couple got lost only ten miles away from the nearest paved road and starved to death. I have always considered the woods to be sinister, and _Blair Witch_ might be the fulmination of all my unspoken fears. It's pompous to say that whether or not you think this film is effective is dependent on how much imagination you have. It is more accurate to say that your enjoyment of the movie is based on what sorts of fears you already have.

I am fairly certain that at some point, one of the filmmakers must have seen a low-budget 1984 movie called ""The Wind That Walks,"" which used to air every Halloween on the NJ PBS station. Many elements of the movie seem borrowed from this short film about a scientist who mistakenly kills the Jersey Devil's offspring, including a reliance on sound effects to convey the unseen menace, jerky camera work, and even the same low-tech font in the credits. All of my childhood friends were scared to death of this film -- another reason why _Blair Witch_ got to me at such a visceral level.

One recommendation. As much as I liked this film, and as much as I want to see it succeed commercially, I must advise you to wait until it hits video stores. Seeing this film in a theater is a bad idea, not because you might need a dramamine to get you through the more jerky scenes, but because any shuffling or coughing around you seriously detracts from its intensity. You must play along with this movie: don't watch it guessing what horror cliche will show up next, but watch it as if you have uncovered some weird video that you are not supposed to see. Think of it as an illicit snuff film, and you will be terrified.",NA
"cjh668908","There's nothing worse than shaky camcorder footage","27 February 2013","This ""movie"" is a ""documentary"" about the so-called Blair witch legend. It was marketed and hyped up as a true story, that three teenagers went into the woods in search of the Blair witch in October 1994 and never returned. Then their camcorder footage was found a year later.

The whole idea behind this movie was to scare its audience with the concept of making the audience get frightened of things they don't see. It's called psychological horror. Other horror movies of the past have accomplished this goal. The Haunting (1963) is a perfect example. The Haunting was a professionally made movie with a musical score, the whole nine yards. In contrast, The Blair Witch Project was filmed with a camcorder and a shaky one at that. There is no music in the film. It's raw. It has a skeletal budget. It has the sounds of the day and the sounds of the night and the sounds of profane teenagers. It's basically a ""reality"" film about some teens who are lost in the woods in search of a legendary witch that supposedly lives there. The fact that they're looking for a witch and lost at the same time makes them increasingly frightened and frustrated as the movie progresses.

The main problem I have with this film is that the footage is so shaky and amateur-ish. This movie is unwatchable. It'll make you dizzy and give you a headache. It's fine to use a camcorder. I thought it was a unique way to film a documentary ""movie"". But at least make the footage watchable. I can understand the camera shaking at times when the kids are running away from something that's scaring them, but to have shaky footage when they're just sitting around and talking or when planning their trip is really inexcusable. If I want to watch really bad and I mean REALLY bad and shaky camcorder footage, I can watch any one of the countless lame and shaky videos that people I know have made throughout the years. I don't know what's so hard about keeping a steady camera. This film would have been better if the camera-work was better. Instead of feeling scared, I found myself being distracted by the terrible camera-work and feeling dizzy with a headache, also. The bad camera-work robbed me of any scared feeling I was supposed to have when watching this film.","1"
"Robert Thompson","Truly frightening","26 May 2001","I can see why so many people didn't like this movie and it was very interesting to hear other peoples comments as I left the Theatre. It seemed to me that it was mainly the younger audience did not get the movie or the concept behind it.

I was truly frightened by this movie and I think this has a lot to do with my age. I was raised on a diet of old black and white Dracula movies and me and my sister used to sit up every Friday night, pillows ready to hide our faces, being scared stupid by these movies. Looking back at these movies now they are not vary scary but they are not graphic either. You only ever got to see some vague shadows and very little else. Every thing else was in you imagination.

The Blair Witch Project has tapped into this fear very effectively. By not showing what is stalking our hapless adventures the directors are letting our imaginations run riot as to who or what is following them.

I think younger viewers of this movie has been brought up watching films where every thing was shown and nothing was left up to the imagination. They wanted to be shown everything and were disappointed when they weren't.

This movie is unique and could not be made in the same style again until this movie is a distant memory.

If you like to let you imagination take over from the movie makers this movie is for you. If you have no imagination and have to have everything served up to you on a platter, don't bother. For me this is a 10/10","10"
"EdRooney","Something in the woods...","13 June 1999","""The Blair Witch Project"" ""In October of 1994, three student filmmakers disappeared in the woods near Burkittsville, Maryland while shooting a documentary called 'The Blair Witch Project'. A year later their footage was found."" That's the premise the filmmakers give the audience for this recent Sundance Film Festival rave. You can think of this film as a horror ""This Is Spinal Tap"", - completely fictional, but filmed in a way that suggests that what you are seeing really happened. Shot with a digital video camera and 16mm film, we watch as three young filmmakers get lost in the woods and bicker like a married couple from hell. I give first time directors Daniel Myrick and Edward Sanchez a ton of credit and respect for this creepy feature. They create and execute the most searing horror film in some time. It's a truly original creation. With more and more films itching toward the excess and pomp of the visual terror, ""Blair Witch"" is purely psychological. We only see bits and pieces of what is terrorizing the trio and that is enough. Any more would kill the illusion and ruin the suspense. Trouble is, cut to 82 minutes from a 150 minute cut (even longer at one point), the movie oozes choppiness. Jumping from moment to moment sours the spooky mood. More scenes should have been left to linger. Instead, the film cuts around aimlessly. When the picture truly hits a nerve - in the final 5 minutes - it makes the 77 that proceeded it seem pretty wasteful. Most of the film consists of watching the trio yell and agitate each other. Only a small amount of attention is played to the Blair Witch of the title. While being lost in endless woods with nothing to eat and no way of getting home is a pretty damn scary concept in itself, the film keeps reintroducing the supernatural element only to dismiss it for yet another puerile fight. If this was truly a real incident, I would bet the farm that any news outlet who got their hands on this footage would squeeze the Blair Witch teat till it ran dry. When the ending arrives, it only reminds you of the gaps in the storytelling that should have been fixed. Actors Joshua Leonard and Michael Williams do a sharp job as the cameraman and soundman of the group. They successfully convey fear and anger, and they convincingly look like hell. It's actress Heather Donahue that bothered me. Out of all three actors, Donahue feels the most false. She's just too cinematic in her acting, often resorting to melodrama when the film begs the opposite. This is a situation which invites a million different questions. A perfectly acted film can make you forget the seams. Donahue's acting keeps you reminded that this is a fabricated film. While I did like ""Blair Witch"", I fail to see what all the fuss is about. It's a wobbly horror flick that will spawn countless imitators upon release. It's a primitive film that reintroduces genuine scares to a genre that long ago forgot how to terrorize. It's a easily buzzable film that the cinematic community loves to hype because everybody feels that they discovered it. It's a lot of things except the one thing that counts the most... It isn't great. --------------- 7",NA
"Quagmar","I gave it a second chance...Yup, I hate it","27 October 1999","Straight out of the Valencia Community College film lab, it's the most famous home movie not featuring Pamela Anderson. I know I don't need to explain the details of The Blair Witch Project, so I will instead focus upon the polarized opinions about it. I did not like this movie at all, but the wide variance in thoughts about it led me to give it a second chance on my home theater system. The few redeeming qualities I forced myself to find were not nearly enough to compensate for the poor overall experience this movie delivers. I will explain the reasons why I do not like it, but I first must comment on what a lot of the positive comments about Blair Witch have been mentioning. Every person is entitled to an opinion, even if that opinion is grossly uninformed and illogical. We all know this. But DO NOT tell me why I don't like this movie. The basic premise of defending The Blair Witch Project is, ""The only reason you don't like this movie is because there aren't any ILM FX, or blood and gore, or big scary monsters in state-of-the-art rubber suits."" There are a lot of people who don't care about those elements in a film that still did not like this particular movie. And, please, don't tell me this is cutting-edge material. If that were true, I would pull out some of the movies we made as kids out of the closet and advertise them as ""breakthrough filmmaking"". We ran around in the woods with a camcorder...could the right advertising make us millionaires too? Anyway... The main reason I disliked this movie (disregarding the obvious personal economic waste it created) was the horrid acting. You won't be seeing any of these actors on ""Whose Line Is It, Anyway?"" anytime soon, unless that show changes it format to screaming and cussing ad nauseum. The motivations behind the character actions were highly questionable at best, which easily transitions into bad dialogue. The movie creates no sympathy for the plight of these whiny, arrogant, silly college students. I was hoping for the visceral thrill of having the Blair Witch appear and stick a bunch of rocks in their mouths, but, alas, no such luck. Sticks and stones...now that I think about, I have solved the mystery of the Blair Witch, right here, sitting on my butt in front of the computer 2000 miles away from Maryland. Sticks tied together. Piles of rocks. Little handprints all over the walls of a house. Middle of the woods. The Blair Witch is (drum roll): Boy Scout Troop 529. You heard it here first.",NA
"jmhammerstein-980-842586","wonderful movie","26 October 2016","The Blair Witch Project is a wonderful movie. It's terrifying. I was scared way past the point where I like it when I first saw it. It's about three college aged people named Heather, Mike, and Josh who make a documentary about a fictional (As if all witches aren't fictional.) witch called the Blair witch. They interview people and then go into woods where they get lost. Strange stuff starts happening. One of the strange things is they come to a tree that they had been at before, seemingly without turning around. Another is they hear noises that sound like sticks breaking at night. They lose Josh and hear him screaming at night. What makes the movie so scary is the mystery. You don't know what's happening. This is an amazingly good movie.","10"
"DeathByTelevision","Forget Hollywood formulas, big budgets and effects. Great film.","26 November 2000","I remember hearing about the premise of this movie, and I was hooked long before I'd ever seen it. The premise of three college kids making a documentary about a witch, and then being hunted, is refreshingly original. I didn't need special effects. I loved the shaky camera work. It made the premise seem realistic.

This is a love it/hate it type movie. Many people complain of the cheap production values. Well, the movie wouldn't have worked any other way. Another big complaint people have had is that they didn't understand the premise. They didn't know if it was supposed to be fact or fiction. WHAT,ARE YOU STUPID? I knew it was fiction from the get go. Do you think this would have escaped the news? Do you think the families involved would have allowed a mass-marketed movie to be released in the aftermath of their tragedies? Of course the movie was fiction. But, that didn't ruin a thing for me. I know that most every movie I see is fiction. That doesn't ruin my good time. And, with this movie, I was watching really good, really original fiction. I was glad to see a movie that didn't rely on millions of dollars of special effects. I was glad that we didn't see the money shot of the witch.

This movie left me thinking of possibilities of what happened for weeks. It also worked on a level that truly scary movies like ""Rosemary's Baby"" worked. Both movies were truly scary because they dealt with real fears, with human emotion. Neither movies showed any graphic violence, but both were truly scary. They made me think about scary possibilities that can't simply be discounted. That kind of stuff is a whole lot scarier than a guy in a hockey mask. So, even to those who weren't able to give this movie a chance, go rent it and watch it in the dark on a quiet night. Only a real Scrooge won't be a little scared.",NA
"RueMorgue","The most misunderstood movie in horror history. (POSSIBLE Spoilers).","29 May 2000","Note: This comment MAY contain spoilers, depending on your point of view. If you haven't seen TBWP, and don't know the background of the film, STOP reading NOW.

There isn't much to say about this film that hasn't already been said. Everybody and his brother (or sister, as the case may be) has made and reiterated their point about this film. But the fact remains, that this low-budget wonder turned box-office hit is a scary movie.

Myself, I watched this movie at home, with all the lights turned off, and the volume turned up high. I didn't watch it alone, however, and now I wish I did. The main problem with my viewing of the film was that I had already heard all the hype, and as much as I tried to stay away from it, I knew most of the background of this film. That is another thing I regret.

The fact is, I believe that if one views this movie as it was intended to be viewed, with no background knowledge, it will scare the daylights out of the viewer. It is a classic terror film. I know there are many who would disagree with me.

While I do not believe that this film can be ranked up with previous horror hits such as The Exorcist, the result was the same in many movie theaters in North America. People complained of dizziness, nausea, and some had to leave the theater early because they couldn't take it any more. The same thing happened with The Exorcist. The symptoms from Blair were often the result of watching the shaky, multi-camera views, while The Exorcist was a blast of both imagery and sound that left the viewer reeling in his/her seat. The result of the whole experience, agree with me or not on both counts, was terror.

There are those horror movie buffs out there, I'm sure, who complain that Blair was not classic horror, that the premise was faulty and the background was simply unbelievable. Yet, I'm sure that these were people like me. They knew the background of the film, and were thus not affected as the writers, directors, and cast had originally intended. I believe that if people saw this film as was meant to be, they would have been scared out of their wits. I also think that many people, on examination of the film, downplayed how it made them feel. In other words, the same people that say the film was terrible, probably sat in the theater and were scared themselves at some point during the film.

Overall, I believe that this is the most misunderstood movie in horror history. If it had been viewed by the masses as it was originally intended, it would have scared the pants off almost anybody. I know it scared me... even though I already knew what it was all about. As I have said in the past, any movie that can make me think when it is over, is one that I enjoy. This movie will leave many questions in your mind, but as I said before, only if viewed as it was originally intended.

Heather Donahue delivered a fabulous performance, and ""Mike"" was very funny. However, I must say that as far as the documentary concept, and including several shots (like the final fall of the camera in the last scene) the film- makers

unashamedly RIPPED OFF the French film MAN BITES DOG (1992).

That earlier film was about three independent film- makers who follow a murderer on his daily rounds. They soon get tired and frightened of him, and eventually their lighting man is killed. This scene includes a frantic chase up a flight of stairs in an abandoned warehouse, with displacement of sound due to the distance of the sound man. The scene then goes down the stairs into a dark basement, which is lit only by the new lighting man. The final scenes involve the death of all in the crew, including the cameraman, who falls to the ground at a tilted angle. The cam does not move, and we see the empty room, but not the killers.

""B.W.P."" doesn't have a script. It's just filled with uninteresting trivial stuff that you don't really care to watch at the movies.

Despite everything that happens to them, they keep on filming... That's not logical, and it's far from the human nature.

Three naive American youths venturing into something they have no clue about in its very element. There is a character when they are still interviewing people about the Blair Witch who comes out holding the bible and seems to know a lot more than anyone else who they did not take into account enough, they just thought she was a weirdo. I like how with such a low budget you can have such wonderful results. The film gets more and more and more intense as we go along.

"Toni-15","I can't believe how BAD this film really was !!!!","31 October 1999","Well, never before have I gone to the cinema and disliked a film as much as this one (""Batman and Robin"" came very close).

What I liked; a/ Heather Donahue - she was very convincing and I would imagine pretty good in a NORMAL film !

b/ The filming - for about 5 mins, the camera stuff might have worked but it went on way TOO long.

What I disliked; a/ EVERYTHING ALMOST !!!!

b/ No soundtrack - this is always bad for a film, they may have wanted it to be realistic but it had no depth to it.

c/ The horror factor - Horror, Scary ??? - what are people on about when they say this is a scary film. It's truly depressing and disturbing, but why would anybody want to go to the cinema for those emotions, for a good fright, yes. But depression and disturbance is something we want NOTHING of in our lives.

d/ The language and dialogue - This is REALLY were the film screwed up, I have no problem with the ""F"" word when used infrequent and for the right reasons, but the use in this film was appaling. At no point was the rest of the dialogue clever.

e/ The filming - Good for about all of 5 minutes and then it just got clearly boring and messy.

f/ The plot - Um... didn't have much of one really. The ideal of going into the woods for a project was ""different"" but the rest a What was the nonsense about a witch anyway, more likely it was just Josh fooling around with the kids, maybe they didn't even get killed. Maybe they just got lost and died of hunger in the end.

Sorry, but this is THE worst film I have seen in a long, long time and I had to get this off my chest after returning from the cinema. Don't think I was the only one either, the cinema viewers seemed appaled that they had spent money on it.

MORAL: Do not follow the hype, read about the film first, see if you REALLY think you will enjoy it, then go to the cinema. Well I've seen 1 film every week this year (that's about 47!!!) and this is the PITS of the entire lot !

I'll add another 1/10 to the long-growing amount !!

My guess is that most watched it at home with the lights on and a couple of their friends near by. This is a scary and innovative movie. What makes it scary is that it is different from 99% of other horror movies. In most standard horror movies you have a Freddy or Jason to embody terror or evil. You see Michael Myers an you know he is evil and supposed to be scary. However, real terror is terror you cannot see and that is what is so brilliant about this film. The Blair Witch is a mystery and she leaves our imagination to decide so much. I am a creative person with quite the imagination. If you are a lethargic teenager who shut the mind off years ago, you are not going to like this. Because you have no imagination to draw from.

"luan-penna","One of the very few horror movies that really scared me to death","23 July 2016","I love The Blair Witch Project. It's definitely one of the best horror movies I've ever seen, but I understand why a lot of people hate it. It's actually a psychological horror movie, that what really scares you is your imagination rather than what is shown on screen (unlike 99% of the movies we see around). It's very slow burn but it isn't boring. Do not expect to watch a lot of action or jump scares. The first 20 minutes serves to build up the mythology behind the Blair Witch, and the remaining hour it's all about these 3 people lost in the woods. It sounds boring but it's not. The movie keep your attention because these people are interesting and they really look like real people, people you can relate to, you root for them to survive. There is also a creepy and claustrophobic atmosphere during the whole movie that keep you with fear. It all seems real. You never know what really is haunting this people, it is the witch or is something else? It really scared me and I'm not a easy person to scare. I can count in my fingers the movies that scared me and Blair Witch is definitely one of them, specially the ending... The last 10 minutes are unforgettable. Scary, disturbing, tense, heart beating, edge of your seat type of ending. It's really the most scary part and the last shot still kills me till this day. It's impossible to watch The Blair Witch Project and simply forget. You will think about the ending for a long time definitely. It's all very subtle and creepy.

At the start of the film we are told that three students, Heather, Josh and Mike, disappeared in the woods near Burkittsville (formerly called Blair) in Maryland while investigating the local legend and that a year later their equipment had been found and what we are then shown is the film recorded by them before their disappearance. Once the three of them have joined up and got their equipment together they head to Burkittsville where they interview some of the locals about the legends before heading off in to the woods to film the sites where the events in the legend are alleged to have taken place. All goes fairly well until the trio try to return to their car, while camping over night they here strange noises outside their tent and the next day despite following the map they don't manage to find their car. The same happens the next day and the next etc. as the days progress they get more and more distressed, especially as whatever is outside the tent each night is leaving strange items in the trees and messing with their equipment.

I have tried to keep the spoilers to a minimum as the less you know about what happens in the woods the more disturbing the film is likely to be. If you are put off horror films by gore then this is a safe film to watch as there is almost no gore, the scares all come from being lost while some one or something is messing with your head. The way that it is filmed also adds to the atmosphere, quite often the camera is pointing and something away from the action or in the night scenes there is no image at all, just sound. The acting was very natural probably because most of it was unscripted.","8"

"brianfab","ONE OF THE MOST DISAPPOINTING FILMS I'VE EVER SEEN","4 November 1999","I watched the Blair Witch Project with a dozen other people, who also heard all the hype about this new horror flick and we were anticipating the big ""scary"" moment(s) to come. Guess what? It never came. Although the premise of the film is interesting...the film NEVER (at any point--except maybe the last two seconds of the film) lives up to its potential (you end up wondering why this movie even cost $60,000 to make). One needs to have a lot of unmotivated imagination (or be down right gullible) to find any part of this movie scary. The film is mostly comprised of the three characters arguing and fighting (the girl is especially annoying), them running around at night screaming (as if that's supposed to scare the viewers), sticks hanging on the trees and gathered stones, and of course the grand finale which leaves the viewers numb with utter disappointment. Again, the premise of the movie has (or had) a lot of potential but it nowhere near lives up to its hype...It is one of the most (if not the) boring movies I've ever seen and a total waste of time and money...Our group was so bored after watching the ""Project"" that we ended up watching a video of the Matrix afterwards...A generous 1 (out of 10) for the Blair Witch Project","1"
"Oxgernon","One of the worst movies ever","10 February 2002","This is possibly one of the worst movies I've seen in my life (and I've seen quite a few bad movies). Why? First of all, because although it's advertised as a horror movie, it's not scary at all. Okay, I really doesn't scare easily, but what's wrong with this movie is that all of the characters are so annoying, that after less than half an hour you're just looking forward to see them get killed in some bizarre way. And while hoping for this to happen may be slightly exciting, it's certainly not scary. Second, I don't like the hand-held low-quality cams, but that's just me. So, the final thought: If you haven't seen this movie yet, don't. Ever.","1"
"kaipi-1","Wow","27 August 2008","Really people, has movie making really fallen this far that this pile of vomit is not on the bottom 100 list? Yes, I know, there's a lot of terrible movies out there and unfortunately there's always someone who will think it's brilliant but I'm not one of those people. This movie was so horrible that it was... um, horrible. That' all there there really is t say about it. It was a completely pointless idiotic waste of time with no redeeming qualities, if there was a zero rating, this would definitely be down there, but they don't let us have any fun. I don't even remember what it was about, and while, yes, I did have a pretty bad seizure from the camera shots which can't be helping my memory much, I doubt I'd remember much anyway. It just looked like a bunch of hippies, once again, botching an already botched attempt at movies. This movie was worse than drinking an entire compressed can of ten year old vomit that has been fermenting in the sun.","1"
"arabesuku","A historical landmark of low-budget film making and horror cinema.","25 September 2007","A lot of people have criticized this for not being scary, but on the contrary I think it was very scary and I admire this film for creating an entire new meaning of 'scary' and for being so successful on such a low budget. Universal's coffee bill must be higher than what the budget was for this film. I feel that this was the birth of the psychological horror film.

What also helped this was the fact that the actors used their real names in the film, and the website that accompanied it helped to create the illusion that this incident portrayed in the film was a true event.

Fabulous acting (and REAL snot coming out of Heather Donahue's nose in that heartbreaking famous scene), great shots and eerie locations also help to boost the scariness of TBWP.

Definitely a film you must see before you die.

"Sheepi","AN UNQUESTIONED MASTERPIECE.... here's why","29 January 2000","OK, first about all the very different opinions people have been having. The people who didn't like this movie have absolutely NO imaginations whatsoever!! So if you are a teenager who wants lame special effects to give you the picture, or if you just have no imagination, you'll hate this movie. You HAVE to have a good imagination; there are never any special effects in this movie.

I LOVE this movie because of the lack of special effects. I'll tell you a horror movie that REALLY SUCKS: Scream ! What a piece of crap!

*NOW FOR THE SUMMARY/OPINIONS:*

Blair Witch Project is a realistically portrayed movie about three cussing teens who go into the woods together. They become lost, and things take a very frightening turn... *maybe a slight spoiler* the ending is a total surprise, but if you listen closely, there are hints towards this ending in the beginning. This movie gave me nightmares. It was incredibly scary, the best horror movie I've EVER seen. In short, you MUST see this movie!! Perfect 10/10.","10"
"bnm81510","Groundbreaking Film mortally hurt by excessive hype","28 December 1999","A spit in every major Hollywood studio's face, to say the least, and the second film this summer to learn a lesson from MTV's atrocious programming and put it to superior, even revolutionary use. With ""Run Lola Run"" it was the relentless pace and non-dependence on dialogue which created a sublime effect, a near return to the silent era. ""Blair Witch"" took the channel's utterly false reality of home-video footage and documentary-style acting, transforming it into perhaps the most realistic falseness to ever grace the silver screen. The enormous buzz that surrounds this amazing horror movie (which never aspires to be more than a cheeky genre entry) has already started an undeserved yet equally strong backlash, mostly by jealous film-students at first, then by the spoiled masses which could not comprehend anything beyond Will Smith's special effects-ridden vehicles. Misunderstood both by the critics who hailed it as the next cineamtic movement and the audiences bombasted by the hype, ""Blair Witch"" should be taken at face value; although currently that is practically impossible to do. The degree of scariness in the exploits of three young idiots (types all too familliar to everyone who attended college) doomed to perish in the haunted Maryland woods will largely correspond to one's own level of sensitivity, but regardless of how frightened the film makes you, it amounts to an experience of gleeful delight,(akin to the great ""Evil Dead"" series minus the cartoonish gore), of taking part in something new and refreshing. Of course the overall execution is not totally original, deriving mainly from ""The Real World"" and an obscure 80's Vietnam flick called ""84 Charlie Mopic"", but what does it matter? Nothing, repeat NOTHING spurts out of the blue - (a classic case in point would be Tarantino inspired by Goddard and Melville inspired by Carol Reed and John Huston inspired by the 20's expressionist cinema and ""Public Enemy""). ""Blair Witch"", while not transcending its genre, still has a share of pure visual artistry, some probably unintentional. A certain beauty lies in the shots of Heather Donahue's white shape jetting through the dark forest, the ominous rays of sun glittering in the evening trees. The amateur feel the directors generate is but an expertly-crafted illusion and therein lies the film's ultimate pleasure.","10"

People can not watch a movie and put themselves into a scenario and imagine how terrifying it would be to be hopelessly lost, having your friend disappear mysteriously and be awoken late in the night by his futile cries for help and knowing there is nothing you can do, and most terrifying of all being stalked by what you can't see. People don't like this movie because it forces you to reach into the deepest part of your mind and imagine what is stalking you. If you don't know what it is, you can imagine anything. That is what makes this movie so terrifying. This is brilliant and very well done. ***** out of ***** and for all you dumb mother F****** who don't like this movie.

The worst part was their reactions to the first ""mysterious"" events going on outside the camp. You can barely hear the noise that's terrifying them, so you can't identify with how scared they are.

I know it's been said, but the image in the room at the end of the film was truly chilling. Oddly enough, I think this movie may be even better on video, in the dark and private confines of your living room, letting your imagination play without the disruption of bag candy and popcorn eating.

"ciscokid1970","Lost in the woods","17 August 2006","If you were around when this actually showed up in the theaters it was a strange sight. It was un-watched for about 2 weeks then someone spread the rumor that is was a true story of amateur film students who found a real witch. All of a sudden people started watching it.

I think it is one of the first movies to become famous via internet. Of course there are a lot of ""film students"" who love the idea of this movie that gives them hope of one day duping the public in the same way and making some money for a crappy film.

In reality it was not a true story, because even really stupid people could not do the moronic things these ""educated college students"" did. But it was different, full of amateur acting and amateur shooting, and writing so bad I wonder if a script even existed. The story moved way too slow, and did not have enough clarity to keep you in suspense. But the worst part about this was the filming, the camera hoping up and down is almost enough to make you sea sick.

Really what kind of idiots go investigate a ""witch"" with NO GPS, NO real Map or compass. Oh and no phone or emergency radio?...geez.

This is one of those rare things like Pet Rocks that gets unexpectedly hyped up, reaches a point that everyone says hey I got to see that. Then they go watch it and say to themselves ""wow that was a waste"" But then they are afraid to say how lousy it was because they will seem un-cool.

"Kelly G.","A new classic with only two minor flaws.","2 August 1999","Since my comment will be buried under hundreds of others within weeks of it's posting, I'll keep it very brief.

First of all, it's a classic. It met almost all of my expectations that the last three months of underground hype built up. Seeing this, I felt exhilarated that I was watching horror movie history unfold. It was kind of the equivalent of taking Mr. Peabody's Way-Back machine to the 60's to see the original ""Psycho"", or to the 70's to see ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre"".

I only had two, VERY MINOR, problems.

#1. The sound level. I know the directors wanted this to seem very real, and that digitizing the sound would have ruined the realism. But the movie was so quiet, I felt they lost an opportunity to utilize the sophisticated sound systems that most theatres have. The low volume also makes it possible to hear what other moviegoers are saying. I saw the movie in a packed house at midnight, and unfortunatly just a few jerk-off screen talkers who kept laughing at inappropriate moments almost totally ruined the vibe of the film. That's why I wanted it louder, I wanted something to drown them out.

#2. I wanted a bit more back story. I knew that the web site to the film had lots of neat information about the town history of massacres, and how the tapes were found. To my surprise, almost none of that was in the film. Now I know that part of what makes this so scary is it's self-contained ambiguity. But I still wanted a little more near the beginning about the history of the town. The fact that the producers leaned too hard on the website for details was the one element of it's promotion I didn't care for.

But as I said above, these are very minor quibbles that didn't keep me from enjoying what, ten years from now, will be considered to be a classic.","9"
"sleons","Only for peasants!","11 April 2012","I love horror movies and I recently had the chance to watch this one. It is admirable to make a low budget film a main stream thing. I think this film is an achievement in its publicity. But as a movie it's a complete piece of crap. In order for you to be scared by this movie you must be like a XII century peasant.

Nothing really happens in the film. If you are afraid of people standing in a corner you'll be pissing your pants at the end. Unfortunately I need something happening for a horror movie to work its magic on me. Crappy cinematography just doesn't cut it for me.

note: I also hate Paranormal Activity. In both cases (PA and BWP) I've met people who think they are real documentaries (this people are complete morons).","1"
"zdamico","Only found footage horror worth its weight","8 September 2023","Many people have said the characters in The Blair Witch Project are flat and annoying, but I believe they represent your average joe. Think about it - if your friend is filming you on camera, are you going to tell them your backstory? Your hobbies, fears, ambitions, etc.? No. You're probably going to act awkward, much like our protagonists (or antagonists, depending on which theories you believe). What works in this film for me is the lack of exposition. There's so much that the audience doesn't know or isn't told - and it's the lingering questions that allows our imaginations to be filled with fear & anxiety. Fortunately, I didn't know much about this movie before viewing, save for the fact that I knew it wasn't real, unlike audiences nearly 25 years ago. I enjoyed the ambiguous mythology of the Blair Witch provided in the film's interviews with the townspeople.

The quote that resonated with me was, in reference to the filmmaker's camera: ""It's not quite reality. It's like a totally filtered reality. It's like you can pretend everything's not quite the way it is."" To me, this quote summarizes my experience with the film. The audience, if you can suspend your disbelief, can pretend everything's not quite the way it is - that the Blair Witch is real, manipulating the woods to trick the naive film students, planting cairns and mysterious stick figures, ultimately luring them to the abandoned house in the chilling final scene. The only found footage horror worth its weight.","9"

"LessThanPaddy","Criminally underrated.","18 May 2017","I say 'criminally underrated' because there seem to be two schools of thought concerning this movie. The first appreciate how much this film does with so little resources, i.e. these people take the time to enjoy it and become engrossed throughout by the well structured tension... The second school switch off early because of the lack of a horrific CGI witch flying around tearing people apart for the sake of it, thus dubbing it as 'boring' because 'nothing happens'... i.e. those people don't appreciate how this film rejects visuals in favour of a well-thought out developed story.

Blair Witch Project (BWP), is absolute minimalist genius when you consider how little happens in it... yet so much happens! It's a slow build up of tension based around reasonable sounding lore in an environment that we could all imagine ourselves being in. Horror films have regressed so much in recent years, mainly because jump scares become too commonplace to be scary, the visuals are too far-fetched and the back stories are horribly written. BWP addresses all of these by putting the audience into such a real scenario, at no point is there any hard evidence of the supernatural...and it is that very insecurity that keeps things interesting!

You need only read the wealth of trivia to appreciate what the writers and actors went through to make this all happen. One piece of trivia claims that we were supposed to get a flash of the Blair Witch herself at one point for a brief moment but due to a cameraman error this didn't happen... personally I think it's better that way and always believed that part of the mystery was not being able to see her.

Found footage films haven't had a good hit in a while, personally I don't think any could top this one. Say what you like about all the fancy visuals in Cloverfield, they just can't give you what the BWP provides... IF you take the time to sit, put your smartphone away and watch it.","10"

This one is unusual...and terrific!","10"
"Castor-5","Hands down the scariest film ever made","3 August 1999","Many may find the shower scene in Psycho, the shark attacks in Jaws, the breakdown of Jack Nicholson in The Shining, or Hannibal Lector in Silence of the Lambs more creepy than this indie film, but I disagree. Never before have I felt so uncomfortable, so shocked, so disturbed, and so intense after seeing this film. And for some reason, after feeling all that even now (4 days later), I'm dying to see it again.

The Blair Witch Project is best left unknown for those who haven't seen it. The less you know about the film the better, because some of the best parts would feel rather lame if you knew it was coming. The last 45 minutes of the film I sat there with my hand over my mouth wandering what would happen next and truly caring for the students. There wasn't a script written for this film nor was there a storyboard to decide the events, it is all incredibly realistic with no hocus pocus or special effects. It costs the price of a car to make this film and it shows how brilliant the directors are when someone like Wes Craven or John Carpenter can't come close to frieghtening us as much as this film does, despite the millions they can put into their films.

Not everyone will like this film, however those who don't like it can't criticize it. For those that think they can, they minus well shut the hell up and look at the originality and differences this film has to every other horror film out there. This is definatly a film to see in theaters because not only is the sound an important aspect of the film but it's so amazing to sit there and notice how quiet a sold out audience will be while watching this film, you could hear a pin drop. Truly remarkable, quite easily one of the best films of the year if not the best horror film ever made.",NA

"dougdoepke","A Broken Glass Holds No Water","19 December 2021","Eyeballing this flick is like staggering atop broken glass. Most every step is off-putting, a pain rather than an invite. My impression of movies is that they should draw you into the subject matter, not separate you from the experience. Here, the rapid fire, disconnected filming reminded me every moment that I was viewing technique and not story. In short, the filming method killed the story, whatever that splintered narrative was. Then too, the improvised dialogue showed no real effort, just a succession of shouted profanities giving me a new appreciation of traditional screenplays. Between the broken visuals and the inane sounds, this mess is more like a badly done home movie than a theatrical release. No need to go on, but 'projects' often amount to abject failures as well as steps forward. Unfortunately, this one reflects the former in spades, or should I say broken pieces.",NA
"Roddy-15","Scary","27 August 1999","It is hard to believe that a low budget horror film like this can actually deliver the goods: to scare viewers. In a time when special effects seem to be the most important aspect of movies, Blair Witch Project offers something different. It is one of those rare movies which can make people inside a theater be quiet. When I saw it, everyone inside the theater was quiet during the scary scenes. When was the last time that happened?

Blair Witch can be compared to an Italian movie named Cannibal Holocaust; they both have something in common: they are about people who disappear, and then their footage is found. Yet Cannibal Holocaust wasn't scary at all. Blair Witch is a good horror movie.

Of course, there are many people who won't like it. If you are expecting special effects or a typical horror movie, then you are probably one of the many people who will hate this one. Those who want to be scared, well, that's a different story.",NA

"utgard14","Holds up well","25 August 2015","Compelling and eerie found footage movie about a trio of amateur filmmakers who disappear after hiking into the Maryland woods to shoot a documentary about the legend of the Blair Witch. A modern classic that helped usher in that particular subgenre of horror we have today. Most found footage movies are absolutely terrible and can't hold a candle to this one. It's probably the only movie of its type that ever seemed remotely authentic to me, even though I knew it was all fiction. At the time, people debated whether or not this was actually real. That seems silly, of course, but I knew several people back then who believed what they saw on the screen really happened. A lot of the credit for that should go to the actors, particularly Heather Donahue, for doing such a great job of making it seem believable. I just saw it for the first time in probably a decade or more and, while it doesn't hold the same impact as it did initially, it's still a remarkably well-done low-budget psychological horror movie.

Yes the movie was heavily hyped but it was deserved, in my opinion. This was a huge box office success built largely on word of mouth which is a testament to its quality. Sadly, because of its popularity, a lot of people bashed the film (and still do, judging by some of these reviews). If by some chance you have never seen this movie, please ignore the haters and give it a fair shot. I know that, after so many found footage horror movies since it was released, it won't seem as fresh. But I think if you drown out the background noise of the whiners and allow yourself to become immersed in the story, you'll find this movie is one of the best of its kind and worthy of praise.","7"

"ElectricWarlock","A brilliant horror movie","5 March 2013","This is one of my favorite horror films of all time. The main reason I love it is because it leaves everything up to the imagination of the viewer. It doesn't show you the villain (whoever or whatever it may be), so you have to decide for yourself what is happening. This film gives the viewer just as large of a role in the film as it does with the characters. I can't think of many films that do that, so this film is truly one of a kind. If you don't have an imagination and like to have every detail of a film spoonfed to you, this film is not the one for you. This is a horror film that actually requires the viewer to think, and not all viewers like to do that, so that's one of the main reasons many seem to dislike it.

This film doesn't need cheap gore, brutal death scenes, tasteless nudity, or even overly loud jump scares. It relies solely on suspense and atmosphere. Every moment of the film captures the viewer's interest and keeps you on the edge of your seat waiting for what is going to happen next. The amount of tension this film builds is horrifying. There is a brooding atmosphere that permeates the entire film. The second you see the characters, you can sense that something bad is going to happen and you dread it. You really feel sorry for the characters and sympathize with the situation they're going through. This is due to the amazing performances from Heather Donahue, Michael Williams, and Joshua Leonard. You can't tell they're acting at all. It seems as if they're truly in danger.

If you like subtle, intelligent horror films that are truly about being scary rather than blood, gore, and loud noises, this is the film for you. If not, then perhaps you would be better off watching something else.","10"
"Brownie-2","A different kind of scare.","30 July 1999","I heard a lot of hype about this movie.But that kinda spoiled the experience a bit for me.Since this film would have been way scarier if people thought it was real.Oh well. The movie was still pretty good.Its a whole different kind of scary movie,since the enemy ( enemies?) are never seen,not even a glimpse.So the audience keeps guessing untill the end,:was there actually a ""Blair witch""?Or just some very sadistic killers that enjoyed playing games with their victims.And its cool that virtually no gore is used at all.

And thank God no cheap ""jump at ya"" scares.I was actually getting chills and gripping my seat at the dark screen,the darkness reminded me of when I was a child scared of the dark. ( This movie works great in a dark theater,but I'm not sure how it will work in a living room TV.Maybe too ""Home-movieish?"")

Its great what filmakers can come up with,when there is no money for flashy fx.The only thing missing is a slight glimpse of what was hunting them...a shadow, a shape...but nope,maybe it does work in the movie's adventage in the end for some people.But I wanted a bit more, but still a very cool idea.Great job guys!",NA
"sddavis63","Imaginative And Pretty Effective","7 November 2009","Although the style has become fairly common, at the time this movie was released, the idea of a simple movie filmed in a documentary style using a single hand held camera was pretty imaginative, and to give the makers of this film their proper credit, no one since has mastered the raw style as effectively. The story is a simple one. Three college students learn of a Maryland legend about the “Blair Witch” and they set out for a weekend in the woods to investigate the stories.

The film starts out in a light-hearted manner, showing the trio joking around as they prepare for their adventure, then doing some background interviews with residents of the nearby town of Burkittsville, which adds some horror-type mystery and “history” to the project. There wasn't much excitement in that opening, but it established that the three didn't take the legends seriously and that they weren't expecting much more than a weekend in the woods. At first we watch essentially a routine nature hike, but the suspense builds pretty quickly once the three realize they're lost. Then they begin to hear mysterious sounds at night and stumble upon strange things by day - unusual rock piles, and the now famous Blair Witch symbol made out of sticks and hanging from trees. The movie never tries to explain these things, focusing instead on the increasing terror felt by the campers. There's an interesting study of group dynamics as the three respond to their plight by increasingly turning on each other. The climax of the movie starts when Josh goes missing. He's nowhere to be found, but Heather and Bill hear him calling to them. Their search finally leads them unexpectedly to a crumbling old house. There's something terrifying in the house, but it's never revealed, the filming stopping suddenly when Heather comes across Bill staring at something. In the story, the three are never found, but the camera and film are found a year later.

I realize this was in keeping with the genre, but I would have liked a bit more resolution. The movie leaves you with your heart pumping but no explanation of what happened. Still, the film is effective at building suspense and presents a frighteningly creepy feel once the kids realize that they're lost, and the three do a great job of portraying their increasing fear and desperation. The college documentary project angle also shields the film from the typical, ”low budget"" criticisms. Altogether, it's pretty effective. 7/10","7"

"sol1218","A Witches Brew","28 April 2004","(+SPOILERS+) Modern day horror story about a trio of college students Heather Donahue Michael Williams and Josh Leonard going into the woods outside of Burkittsville Maryland in October 1994 to do a documentary on the ""Blair Witch"". A ghost that has haunted those woods since the founding of the town of Burkittsville in 1810.

Supposedly desecrating an old Indian cemetery in the in the area by building the town there it's felt by the people who live in and around Burkittsville that the ""Blair Witch"" is responsible for a number of vicious and unexplained murders. The string of killings started in the late 1800's when five hunters were brutally murdered by the stream at Coffin Rock. The killings continued on intermittently up until the winter of 1940-41 with the murder of seven children at the old man Parr house. The children who were still alive were made to stand in a corner and wait their turn, looking at an empty wall, in order not to see Parr murdered the others. Parr was found to be insane but the people of the town feel that he was possessed by the ""Blair Witch"".

The three students drive out into the woods with their van and then take their video and living equipment in backpacks and go hiking out into the eerie forest. Nothing at first really happens to them until they pass by the haunted Coffin Rock. After a nights sleep in their tent the hikers find themselves in what is an old Indian cemetery with a number of rock piles as tombstones all around them. On their way back to their parked van the next night they hear strange noises all around their camp site and when they wake up the next morning they see the rock piles outside as if they were following them. Things become very weird where the three seem to be going around in circles and even worse Mike for some reason throws away the map that Heather had to help them find their way out of the woods.

After another harrowing night in the forest the hikers find themselves in an area of the woods with Voodoo like symbols and artifacts all over the trees! Panic starts to set in on the three hikers with Josh, not being able to take it anymore, going crazy and running out into the woods away from the other two hikers. Heather and Mike searching the woods, trying to find Josh, later that night hear faint cries coming from what turns out to be an old abandon house,The old Parr house?,in the woods. Mike going in first goes room to room trying to find Josh and finally realizes that the cries are coming from the basement and runs down there, just as the cries started they all of a sudden stop.

Heather screaming for Mike and Josh to answer her also runs down to the basement and then all we see from her video camera is Mike standing in the corner looking into a blank wall, like the children who were killed at the old man Parr house some sixty years ago! Terrified with fear we hear Heather give out an ear splitting cry and the camera falls out of her hand! All we can see from what the video camera recorded is an empty ceiling! Heather Mike and Josh were never seen or heard from again and all that was left of them was the video tapes that they made of their expedition in the woods that made up the movie ""The Blair Witch Project"".

""The Blair Witch Project"" is a lot like the movies directed by the late Jacques Tourneur like ""Cat People"" in 1942 and ""The Leopard Man"" in 1943 and later ""The Curse of the Demon"" in 1957. Tourneur used lights and sounds and shadows to scare the wits out of his audiences not special effects that were so used to seeing in horror movies now.

The the film has over 3,000 IMDb users comment on it as well as taking in over $140 million in domestic ticket sales during it initial release in the summer of 1999 shows the tremendous effect that it had on those who saw it. These two facts, among many others, shows that ""The Blair Witch Project"" made an impact on the movie going public far bigger than many of it's detractors would like us to believe.","7"

"Chubbs-2","Scarry? (Spoilers)","6 November 1999","I was so geared up for this movie, i was expecting to be scarred senseless, but instead I had the worst movie going experience ever.

Now I understand the Movie was made on a shoe string budget, but it was completely without any shocks or scares at all.

I am not a Horror fanatic so a reasonable scare will scare me, but this had nothing, I've been more scared watching the Simpsons Halloween special, or even worse Show Girls.

The acting was convincing but the movie was not at all scarry, and the ending, with that m***n standing in the corner and then nothin, I was left robbed and wanting closure on this ordeal which I did not get.

Overall, I would place this in the Comedy section of a video store, because there more more laughs than scares.

Pitifully bad and misleading.",NA
"Swampfox","DO NOT READ ANYTHING ABOUT THIS FILM OR IT WILL DISAPPOINT","2 August 1999","That said, I have to say I was disappointed. On the day when the public finally got to see the year's most anticipated ""serious"" film from a dead director, I was anticipating the scariest film about the dead. In other words, this was a film I wanted to like, wanted to get sucked in to and wanted to have scare the bejeezus out of me. When the lights came up after finally seeing ""The Blair Witch Project,"" I found I only liked the first half, was only sucked in occasionally and never once felt anything than some mild creepiness.

All those clamoring about the film on the internet may or no be real (there's talk in the entertainment industry that much the buzz was planted by the distributor), but the initial reaction at film festivals last winter was undoubtedly uncoached. Thinking that this 80 minute mixed media movie is real would probably make most viewer's skin crawl. But once that cat's out of the bag (and even the most cursory glance at articles about this film give that away), the big gimmick turns out to be the biggest thing going for it. Not the only thing, but it can't drive the film anymore once a viewer is no longer scammed into thinking the ""In 1994 three student filmmakers went into..."" is on the level.

All the shots used in promotional stories about ""The Blair Witch Project"" are not used in the actual film. It begins with the same preamble that adorns the poster and ad copy. This is a mistake, as it shows a lack of foresight on the filmmakers' part. They should have realized that only the first audience would benefit from complete ignorance, the rest of us might need a sequence that builds the idea that what we are seeing is real. The distributor is obviously trying to sustain the illusion: at my screening a booklet proclaiming itself as the Blair Witch Dossier was given to us in line. Inside are notes from fictitious private investigators and class statements written by the ""missing filmmakers."" If only this had been included in the movie.

The most impressive thing about the film (after the chutzpah of its filmmakers) is the improvisation of the actors. There are scenes that rang so true that I will not be surprised next winter if one of the endless series of awards given out goes to one of the three faux documentarians. One scene that starts with gallows humor and ends in near fisticuffs affirmed that those magical moments of theater or recorded acting can still pull us out of our seats. On the basis of it alone I can see why the uninformed would take the events at face value.

As with most, ""Blair Witch's"" undoing is its last act. As events unfold, the filmmakers repeatedly squander the tension that has gripped the audience. Perhaps a little too attuned to the aesthetics of the documentary-within-a-film they have created, they let its sensibilities guide how they shape the events of the last 20 minutes. Too much of the ""found"" footage is allowed to unreel, loosing the dramatic build-up. And after all this overage, the ending is abrupt and confusing. There isn't a single back story to the legend of the Blair Witch but three, which undermines the payoff. We never see anything of the ""presence"" that is pursuing them through the woods, so it's hard to even begin to debate if it is supernatural or not. If not for a friend seeing it with me, I'm not sure how long it would have been before I ""got"" the ending.",NA

While watching this movie I found myself several times nearly falling asleep. I have no idea how anyone could get scared in a piece of garbage like this. When the movie was over, I saw many people laughing. I heard the person sitting behind me say that BWP was the least scariest movie he had ever seen. Even my friend who is scared of every horror movie possible was like, ""that was not scary at all."" The movie's desperate attempt to try and scare people just doesn't work. Oooooooo they hear sounds in the woods while they're sleeping. They see rocks at their camp that weren't there before. Oh my god, that's soooo scary. The only thing that should have scared those 3 people was when the other 2 found the guy's who disappeared tongue. Even when they found his tongue wasn't scary. It was just gross. Everyone I know who saw this movie agreed with me. This movie is a disgrace. And now they're making a Blair Witch 3 after the 2nd one was a flop. Get a clue! One last comment: God help the people who wanted to make BWP.

There is know way you were scared of this. And if you really were scared of this then the real reason you don't like Plan 9 from outer space is because it made you pooh in your pants. Just because Leonard Milton said something was really good does not make it so. I'm not saying he is an idiot. But he is not as smart as some of you think he is.

That girl in the video showed real fear. I mean it nearly frightened me too. Many documentaries have their own twists and turns. Some of them are real the rest were made up to fool the viewers.

"robertodandi","Marketing rules!","5 June 2002","When I saw this movie, in Rome at the Barberini Cinema the first weekend, there was almost a riot (whistles and yells from almost all young public). This movie is really disappointing (I`m polite). First, it`s not scary at all. The script wanted carefully to follow the rule `do not show the monster to be scary` but what it obtains is that it doesn`t show ANYTHING worth watching. Second, the interesting idea of the story is the part we all saw in the trailers and commercials. The story in the film adds a little more and not always unexpected: in conclusion BORING. Third, the camera work, in the attempt to appear `real`, is unpleasant (most scenes are shot while walking or running and this causes something like the sea-sickness). If I can forgive the neorealistic movies, the intellectual French movies, the Danish DOGMA movement for this is only because they can offer something back and the naive camera work adds something to the overall art of the movie. But here?

The post-movie question was: are we really all stupid to be cheated by a commercial? The answer was: yes. But only this time.

It`s another proof that a good (excellent) marketing is enough to make money in this business. Don`t waste your time and money watching this boring, useless, unneeded movie.","1"
"Jess-24","the scariest movie ever made.","1 August 1999","i can not believe anyone who gave this one a bad comment.

I hardly ever get scared at movies, but holy hell was i scared here! The haunting story of the death of 3 documentry filmmakers told through the eyes of a camcorder is the most brilliant idea to come along in ages, and it is played out as a non-typical horrer movie. There is only brief gore and one shot of it. the suspense comes from the fear of the dark more than anything else, unlike other horrer movies. Not since The Shining has fear been played out like it could drive you insane.

The story begins with 3 film students, all determind young people with an obvious knack for the art, and camping. They first destination is Burkittsville, formelly a town called Blair. But Blair has quite a colourful history involving a witch who likes to kill small children in the woods. She would often kill groups of them one by one while making the others stand in a corner. (If you didnt get the ending there you go.) The 3 would-be film students learn storys about it from locals in Burkittsville, which of course dont fase thier plans to film in the woods. Up in the woods their trip is all but cut off when of course they get lost. They turn against each other and themselves and are eventually drove close to insanity trying to get home. Thats all I'll spoil about the plot.

Things I like about the movie: The idea of of mockumentry-horrer. No gore. (Well, a brief scene.) The scenes where they first find the furry stick figure hanging from the tree, and the house. Amazing acting. The best ending ever besides ""The Usual Suspects"" Heathers confession-Powerful stuff. The scene with the two fisherman arguing.

Things I didnt like: Way to much swearing, even for me. Sickness enducing camera. They would never keep the film running when all that was going on. Heather found time to do her hair a new way every morning. I go camping alot and I think this might stop me from continuing. As some commenters already said, they would have taken a guide or a cell phone. Thier footage was way to deep in the woods to be ""dug up.""

"flickjunkie-3","Unique, Haunting and Original.","24 November 2000","The Blair Witch Project is not your average horror film. I did not expect it to be what it was like, which was bad and differently shot. But, the way this film is shot isn't bad at all, and the film is actually a great surprise!

The first few minutes are disorienting, deliberately shot with all the shakiness of raw footage from some backpacker's video diary. The actors, using their real names, swiftly establish soon-to-fray relationships: Heather (Donahue) is the director willing to suffer for her art who doesn't care if others suffer less willingly with her, cameraman Josh (Leonard) is the slacker-type along for the ride and sound technician Mike (Williams) is mostly concerned with making sure they get the rented equipment back on time. After interviewing a couple of locals about the legend, the foolhardy trio head into the woods, and everything starts to fall apart.

Everything about this film is powerfully real, the performances are all very polished and excellent, Heather Donahue was amazing, she did not deserve her Razzie award, even though she got annoying, her performance still lives long in the memory. Mike Williams is frightfully good and Josh Leonard is towering. The directional debut from Edward Myrick and Eduardo Sachez leaves you wanting more, I can't wait until their next film. The screenplay is extremely unique and memorable, I have never seen a piece of writing that seems so realistic.

Chillingly memorable and stunningly filmed, The Blair Witch Project has made it's place in film history as one of the most haunting films ever made.

It's not on general release here yet, but hey, I'd heard about the film, and got chance to see it on video. Yes, it's different, yes it has suspense. Generally though there is no substance and no decent 'events' within the film. The premise alone may negate the requirement for graphic or typical plot devixes, but you have to question the validity of a film that seeks to exist on a fictional authentic-esque documentary film style but neither shocks, revolts or disturbs to any degree whatsoever. It was though a change not to have familiar predictable shock scenes, over the top mutilation or typical actors, film grade and of course artificial/background soundtrack. As a concept it could run. However, with no plot, it plods. And although the ending was necessarily weird, it just reminded me of the ending of Monty Python's Holy Grail. Vaguely interesting, ultimately very disappointing.","1"
"Adrian-32","A tad overhyped, but still good","29 August 1999","Cynics has butchered this movie into pieces, calling it nothing but cheap footage of three people screaming, swearing and smoking. I thought I was going to be one of those cynics, but after viewing, I was pleasantly surprised. Okay, so the hype may be excessive, and the editing was a bit too neat for it be considered ""real footage"", but overall it was a genuinely creepy, thoroughly fascinating and innovatively made film. It's not very scary, definitely not as terrifying as ""The Exorcist"", but it's harrowingly realistic footage style is a refreshing change from everyday blood-and-guts material. ""The Blair Witch Project"" has been called ""a masterpiece"" and ""brilliant"", I wouldn't go that far, but it's movie that definitely stands above the rest, proving that the most effective chills are through minimalism. The two eeriest parts for me were the ""What the f**k is that???!"" chase through the woods (which looked extremely menacing) and the very final scene, which was just chilling to bone. The performances by the three actors were impressive, especially Heather Donahue's. Although they are screaming hysterically at each other most of the time, we were still able understand perfectly why they were so angry and terrified. More information on the Blair witch would of made the movie a bit more clearer, we would of known what exactly was so horrific about her, the makers should of made Heather recite more passages out of her book. The famous ""I'm so sorry"" speech given by Heather near the end unfortunately had no effect on me, but I'm pretty sure it wigged out some people. So in all, ""The Blair Witch Project"" has a few flaws, but it's definitely a horror film worth seeing.","8"
"-Peter-","Pure class imo","1 November 2002","First of all I saw it only gets a 6+ on imdb, I can completely understand this, because this movie has a typical awsome or awfull feeling on people. Also I wanna say it's not a movie for film critics who judge on the story, directing etc..., it's not a movie like shawshank redemption or american beauty with an brilliant plot and meaning... This is a film to get u completely into the atmosphere of ""the unknown"", not a movie where the storie grabs u with your throat, the atmosphere, the feeling of being there yourself does this. Therefore many people will think it sux, because of the meaningless things you see on the screen. On the other hand I personally think this movie is pure class, the hype around it makes this movie certainly ""better"", just the thought ""did this really happened?"" grabs you, at least me. If u start watching the movie with the feeling of being unrealistic, fantasy etc... U will not enjoy it. Just sit back, and enjoy the amosphere of this awsome piece of independant filmmaking. It's original, thrilling, and its based on true facts. If u start watching the film with these three things in mind u will certainly enjoy it, others who take this movie down, are just not made for this. That's why it's an awsome or awfull movie.

At first we're given the impression that this film was based off of their raw footage. The research going into the documentary is pretty shoddy in execution. The camera is purely out of focus and plus that Heather (Heather Donahue) repetitively utilizes ""u-huhs and yeahs"" when she's asking questions towards the residents in the area. The opening scenes will surely make you gnash your teeth in annoyance. In fact this whole movie within a movie can be contrived at times. But once the young students enter the woods in search of the Blair Witch, the annoyance becomes more paranoiac as the fears and the anxieties start to send chills down our spines.

Fortunately, the real filmmakers (Daniel Myrick and Eduardo Sanchez) were not as inept as the student filmmakers. We get some believable settings as the determined crew makes their way into the Maryland forests, where they are lost and the more trapped they are in the labyrinth of tress and shrubs, the more the adrenaline level goes up rapidly as the fears and paranoia become overwhelming. The daytime scenes start off quite equivocal as just the sounds of twigs from tree or on the ground snap can surely garner scares where expect the unexpected becomes focal in our minds as much as theirs. The rock piles that bear a resemblance of grave markers epitomizes a sense of unsettling tension of the students as though their eyes are playing tricks on them. These supernatural elements that the threesome face would likely drive anyone insane.

The daytime fears seem pretty tame at first because the paranormal activity doesn't generate as much fear as the gang might shed some hope of finding their ways out of the woods, if they could trace back to where they begun their journey. When night comes and when things go bump in the night, the fear factor really gets the boost. The strange sounds nearby can be chillingly frightful and our brave but naive, unequipped students can do nothing but stick together. But nightfall the horror party finally gets tense and the audience watching this can feel this level of fear that anyone sneaking up behind them in the theaters can get someone a cardiac arrest. The forest is black, the theater is dark, everything is painted black during these scenes.

The main prop in this movie is the cheap first-person camcorder which eventually becomes a character in itself as we become a part of this movie courtesy of the camera as well as the terror the gang faces it lingers on us as well as we feel convinced that there might be a Blair Witch lurking in these forests. These camera traits show adults that it is normal that human beings are scared of the dark and nothing shameful about that.

The lack of preparation when entering the woods, the students have been faced in a sort of predicament they can't seem to get out of and the more they struggle the worst it gets. When Heather the booger- dripping leader of the team she confesses that it was her stubborn ways and determination to finding the truth she begs her cohorts Josh and Michael for forgiveness, we actually feel for her without the audience feeling manipulated.

""The Blair Witch Project"" is utilized as a staple on why we're obligated to watch and let alone produce films. When the students start to get restless, hungry and feared, Heather decides that now's the time to close the camera. Finally, the more restrained Joshua takes her camera and retaliates by pointing it back at her and shouting back at her as though, the camera rules her life while it affects the other two characters caught in the middle of the mess she put them in. In some ways this movie helped spawn shows like ""Ghost Hunters"" and ""Ghost Adventures"" where paranormal experts go around the world in seek of the truth in that there is life beyond our mortal lives.","8"

"Dr. Nick*#3","A masterpiece of suspense and terror...not horror","26 July 1999","Being in the woods in the middle of nowhere is scary in and of itself-scarier when you tell ghost stories-scarier still when you're in a ghost story. This simple truth has finally been exploited to(almost)maximum effect and create a truly gripping movie.

Blair Witch Project is a brilliantly conceived and executed film

that unfortunately cuts itself too short just as it's momentum finally starts to build to a fever pitch. The situation for the three protagonists gets increasingly desperate and weird and genuinely scary but the climax is overly abrupt to say the least and leaves the viewer distinctly unsatisfied(although the last shot is haunting).

The film also spends too much time concentrating on the three tired young filmmakers bickering amongst each other and basically breaking down mentally(although the actors all give very impressive performances-It's easy to forget that this is a movie and not a documentary while you're watching it). These scenes are very well done but go on too long and it's nothing you haven't seen in Deliverance. They detract from the overall impact in the long run.

I would still recommend this film but I have to admit I needed just a little more gore and a little less mystery.","9"
"rugmatt","Why do most people give this a bad IMDb score again?","6 February 2022","What a movie! It popularized the found-footage format which the infamous ""Cannibal Holocaust"" arguably created nearly 19 years before! It doesn't rely on jump scares or blood and guts to be scary, instead relying on tension and atmosphere! There's a scene where Heather sees something in the woods (which was supposed to be the Blair Witch), but they don't show what she's looking at. I know the movie's scarier since we never see the Witch, but I do wish they could've at least edited out the part where she says that. Otherwise, one of the greatest horror movies ever made!","9"
"ChrisJones","Not that hot","14 September 1999","So, it's been hyped to death as most films seem to be these days, but is it really any good? In my opinion, no. The film makes clever use of the home movie style footage, but the whole thing is a complete waste of time. Hardly anything actually happens in the film apart from a lot of noise and blurred pictures. This could be argued to contribute to the chill factor of the film, but in my opinion it really just annoys by not ever actually showing what is going on. You probably think I'm just not getting it, but I would say that I get what it is supposed to be, but it really isn't that. I'm not asking for a gore slasher fest, but I really don't want to sit through over an hour of poor quality rubbish.

Controversial? Sure. So be it!","1"
"HiPPieGiRl","It looks and feels real....that's the scary thing about","3 December 1999","In Australia at midnight over 200 hundred people flocked the cinemas to be the first to see The Blair Witch. Alot of hype and anticipation was surrounding the movie and to me it lives up the hype!

Never in my life have I seen a movie with such fear and unhappiness in someones eyes that it was enough to keep me awake all night.

This movie was set around three student film makers who set out on a on - foot hike through the BLACK HILLS in Burketsville on a search for the Blair Witch formally known as Elli.

It was a weekand journey planned out by director Heather Donahue , who was making a documentry about the Blair Witch. Little does she know she was filming her last days here on this Earth.

Watching the movie without music or professional camera shots was a much more frightening way of watching three people being hunted by something unknown the camera. Every new shot something different was saw or heard and as the nights dragged on, things became more scarier and more obvious.

The ending was terrifying and left the audience speechless. The fact that these three students didn't know what to expect and weren't expecting anything that had happened to them for those five nights was the most real life encounting fear and angst that it felt incrediably real and terrifying to watch.

I really really loved this movie and it is the best scary flick ever made. It's independent which amazes me more but it's a job well done. It was planned and organised very well. Thumbs up!

It's about time a movie with a reality check was finally made!","10"

"uds3","The ""Duh, What Project?""","24 November 2001","Like Tin Man, I have been involved in writing film reviews for many years and have had my fair share of exposure to just about anything you care to mention from BIRTH OF A NATION to JASON X and I'm here to tell you, THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT is the greatest ""Emperor's new clothes"" routine ever foisted on the cinema-going public. Personally I really get-off on horror flicks, good bad or indifferent, and have watched pretty much every bloodletter made! (Still trying to figure out what was actually WORSE than I STILL KNOW WHAT YOU DID LAST SUMMER?)

Whom-soever was ""scared"" by this, has serious issues to deal with. Either that, or a rampantly manipulable imagination, one can only assume is totally at the mercy of repressed childish fantasy. My GOD - WHAT was scary? nothing happened! Its very amateurishness, far from compounding a fear-factor (though so many were taken in by critics worldwide SUGGESTING this be the case) served only to promote the ""home-movie"" status of the finished 'product'...and I use the term loosely!

Now I agree, knowing the fact that other horror flicks are actors, retracting knife blades, latex injuries and half empty bottles of ketchup, interacting before a camera, FOR THE MOST part renders the shudder content (for any thinking person at least) to negative levels. So what's different here? Ok, you got no color, no ketchup...a LOT of trees and no-one can act! (Don't be fooled by Heather's 'natural' funk)....worse still that irritating as hell 'hand-held camera' and interminable shots of the ground (yeah that WAS scary huh?)

Where have you guys crossed over from reality to fantasy? It wasn't the film's brilliance, it was your exploited vulnerability!

You want ""SCARY?"" watch THE INNOCENTS (1961). That and CANDYMAN (The original), perhaps even COMMUNION (1976). That is the SUM of ""scary"" I have found in seventy odd years of horror. (You could add that one ""jolt"" scene in EXORCIST III)

Loved the end too...""Aaaarghhhhhhhh"" Cheapest climactic effect in history! Maybe Sanchez should consider AAAARGHHHHHHH 2? For all its contrived, low budget amateurishness - I preferred BLAIR WITCH 2..not a half-decent concept in there if you think about it! What am I saying? I preferred PLAN NINE FROM OUTER SPACE! Now, thats SURE to rub a fair bit of fur up the wrong way...might have to keep an eye out for some 'sinister' little twig-men hanging off my porch!","1"

"mylucylumpkins","What do I like to do on Sundays? Watch horror films from my childhood!","7 September 2014","The reason I enjoyed this film in it original theatrical release and continue to enjoy it today can be summed up by one childhood story. A friend at the time had an uncle who was on the police force. After we saw the film and debated about its authenticity he claimed that, although we live no where close to where the film takes place, he had seen the official police records of this incident. He was a police officer and I had no reason to doubt him, but it was really the film that sold me on the idea that it was all found footage and that these folks were really dead.

Of course latter I realized the truth, but to be caught in the Blair Witch whirlwind was fantastic! People always try to look back at the excitement they had for this film, and others like it, and belittle the film because of the hype. This film really did live up to the hype for me. Of course there were problems, but it was the first successful film of it's kind. I still feel like it is the best found footage film to date and I can attribute some of that to the hype surrounding it.

Just to point out a few things to address common issues with the film: the acting is exactly where it should be. These people are clearly not reading from a script, and although people criticize their improvisational skills, they are believable as average people. Another issue that people have is that a person being so concerned with getting lost kicks the map into the river. He gives a very valid human explanation, the map wasn't doing anything to help them, and he just got mad and kicked it into the stream. Of course it was stupid, but for that reason I find it believable. The last is the idea that when in trouble, people will stop filming and the fact that the whole thing is supposedly on film is ridiculous. My answer to this is simple, people film life threatening situations so that if they survive they have proof and can relive it. If you don't believe me, look into how many people film tsunamis, or tornadoes, or robberies, or anything else that may have killed them.","9"

This movie is claimed to be terrifying and I heard that some people said they couldn't even sleep the night after. This movie was ridiculously not scary and deserves all the mocking it can get. In my opinion, one person liked it and all their friends just agreed. Then this trend just went on, until almost everyone declares it to be horrifyingly frightening. Those of us with IQ's over 55, know that this movie was a waste of time and although the idea of being lost in the woods is terrifying, you don't get credit for a pursuing the death of some teenagers. This movie was humiliating to everyone whoever saw it, and we are all now dumber for watching it. Thanks losers!","1"
"Big Movie Fan","Absolutely Awful Rubbish","11 September 2002","Firstly, I am a fan of horror movies and I have no problem in suspending my disbelief and being scared by a movie. Over the years I've let myself be scared by movies such as Hellraiser, A Nightmare On Elm Street, Halloween, The Haunting, House On Haunted Hill, The Changeling and many others.

This film however was totally rubbish. Okay, so you don't see the Blair Witch in it? The horror was supposed to be implied rather than shown. I don't have a problem with that. I prefer horror moves where the unseen is more scary but Blair Witch was rubbish.

The majority of the film was set in daylight and the characters stood swearing over their map. Any scenes that were set at night were rubbish. All you could hear was twigs snapping and leaves rustling. It didn't scare me and it didn't scare me when the young lady was sniffling at the end because she knew she was going to die. This movie was supposed to make people never want to go into the woods again. Well, as me and my girlfriend enjoy hiking, I can say that this movie did not put me off going into the woods unlike Jaws which put me off swimming for awhile. Nothing in this movie scared me. As for the camera work, the crew should have brought a tripod.

Another thing was that this movie was filmed documentary style. This made it no scarier. If you want to watch a horror movie filmed documentary style that is scary then I suggest the original Texas Chainsaw Massacre or Cannibal Holocaust.

All in all, this movie was extremely bad and not at all scary unless you find the sounds of twigs snapping scary. This film was rubbish.","1"
"hamburgerman","go see it!","24 July 1999","i highly recommend this movie. go see it, and bring a friend, preferably one that doesn't know anything about it.

it's a horror film, but not one you will be screaming at, nothing jumps through the window, no shock cuts. it provides several natural, real laughs during the set-up and slowly sucks you into the horror. two scenes in particular, when the tent is ""attacked"" and our 3 filmmakers run out looking for whatever it was, and the final house footage. unbelievably effective!

two suggestions to the real filmmakers would be:

1- the final shot, allow the film in the camera to run out naturally, 2- 3- 5- 10- minutes, whatever was left in the camera. do not cut out of it.

2- remove all closing credits. keep the mystery alive. with such a killer p.r. campaign, the general movie-going public will buy into the hype, the dead filmmakers, because this movie is so well done. the closing credits kind of ruined the illusion for me. just a thought.

but GO SEE THIS MOVIE!","9"
"Susie-7","Wow.","23 August 1999","First, I'd like to say that there are spoilers in this review, although I will warn again right before I give them.

This movie scared the crap out of me, which is very unusual. I am usually only creeped out if I watch a movie at home alone in the dark in the middle of the night; in this case, I saw the movie with friends in a crowded theatre and it was still light out when we exited the theatre. Admittedly, I wasn't petrified at first. When we really got scared was when we were walking back to our hotel (as we were visiting a friend of mine) in an area that seemed to have an aversion to street lights. It was very dark and it did not help that we were walking by bushes. We were all totally freaked out and kept looking around behind us. We had the last scene of the movie stuck in our heads, and it stayed there. I am somewhat embarrassed to admit that I had to leave a light on when I went to sleep. I haven't done that since I was 7 and saw an episode of Alfred Hitchcock Presents, where the almost-final image of a girl hung outside on the door of her home stayed with me for days. Any movie that can have this kind of an effect on me is pretty unusual. Even now, when I'm thinking about the final scene of this movie, I am getting somewhat creeped out. The movie was highly disturbing, simply because it seemed so real and we DON'T actually know what happened. I am also with the group that thinks the acting was good; I think that in many cases they weren't acting. For example [WARNING: spoilers ahead!!!], when that one guy disappeared in the middle of the night, I would not be surprised at all if the other two did not know that was going to happen. Likewise, at the very end of the film, I wouldn't be surprised if the girl didn't know when she'd enter the basement, Mike would be standing in the corner. It really seemed to me like she was having a massive panic attack, at more than one point in the movie.

In any case, I highly recommend this film to anyone that wants to be scared out of their wits.","8"

It's a little freaky at some points at the beginning, such as the old lady you will see carrying the bible. But into the movie, it starts to become a little obvious that Josh, Heather, and Mike start to do classic overacting. (This was supposed to be a real documentary, or at least plotted to be) The movie is full of suspense, such as hearing noises in the night, and alot of other spooky stuff. Let me warn you, I got seriously ill to my stomach from watching this movie. People that might be sensitive to the camera moving all over the place, shouldn't go see it. Another thing, bring anti-nausea pills just in case, you never know, I know I never knew I had this problem.",NA
"BruceMc","DON'T BE FOOLED: boring, annoying garbage","1 October 1999","DO NOT BE FOOLED: ""The Blair Witch Project"" is incredibly boring, isn't scary, and contains some of the worst acting you've ever seen. Heather Donahue is the most annoying character to curse the screen since Jodi Thielan in ""Four Friends,"" more annoying, even, than Jar-Jar Binks.

Everyone knows the story of ""Blair Witch Project"" by this time, due to all the hype and incessant promotion, so it's not worth the time to comment on. What could have been an interesting little horror movie looks, instead, like a C- film student's thesis project. The ""acting"" is loud, the characters are annoying, and the ""cinematography,"" if we can call it that, is worthless: since most of the ""scary parts"" happen at night, and most of the movie is shot on a hand-held video camera, there is very little that is actually visible. That would be commendable, if the actors and sound were good enough to carry the story, but they're not. (See ""Wait Until Dark"" if you want a good example of how this SHOULD work.) Example: Heather hears an unidentifiable sound and mutters to herself, ""What was that? What was that sound? Oh, God, I'm so scared!"" Ridiculous. The filmmakers don't trust the audience to even figure out that they're supposed to be frightened.

Additionally, the events that scare the characters aren't scary: awakening to find a pile of rocks by the tent isn't scary. Heather: ""Oh, my God! That pile of rocks wasn't there last night! Who could have done that?""

Also problematic is the fact that nothing happens for the first hour of the movie except the slackers get lost in the woods and whine a lot about how they hate each other.

By now you've all heard that the end of the movie is ""truly frightening""; even if you find it frightening, it doesn't make up for the sleep-inducing first hour and 15 minutes.

""The Blair Witch Project"" may be the stuff of nightmares, but only when you consider that the video will be out soon and that a sequel is in the works.

"Speechless","War of the movie fans...","15 December 2000","I love and admire every single frame of The Blair Witch Project, and nothing anyone says will ever be able to shake me from that opinion. BWP is, for me at least, one of the scariest movies of all time.

You have to pay attention, you have to think, you have to imagine. The movie doesn't show us the witch for the same reason 2001 doesn't show us aliens and the original Jaws barely ever shows us the shark--your imagination is much more effective at creating those images than any special effects artist could ever be. We live in an age where every movie plot point is so thoroughly explained that even the dullest audience member can follow the action and where special effects take the place of characterization. It's incredibly refreshing when a rare movie like this one that actually respects its audience comes along.

Maybe the problem is that the film respects its audience too much. I guess people see the words ""scary as hell"" in the trailer and they go to the movie expecting to see blunt, frightening images. But that's not the way BWP works, and those viewers just sit there waiting for some more traditional movie scare that never comes. Or maybe they've never been out in the woods, and have no idea how incredibly creepy it can be out there at night. Maybe they were too busy ruining the movie for everyone else, yawning and making jokes and obnoxiously asking if the movie was over yet, to be able to hear any of the dialogue. Or maybe they just enjoy bashing successful, publicized movies because they want to feel different from everyone else. I don't know.

Too many people have the mistaken impression that a movie takes one form and that's it, that's all the movie is. The Blair Witch Project is different. It's like a horror movie Mad Lib. It can be as scary as you want it to be.","10"

""The Blair Witch Project"" was the first film to show how powerful the Internet could be as a marketing tool, and it's been copied less effectively ever since, most recently by ""Paranormal Activity,"" which set out to manufacture a ""Blair Witch"" style phenomenon. The difference is that ""Paranormal Activity"" tried to manipulate its way into cult status, whereas ""Blair Witch"" genuinely came out of nowhere to achieve that feat naturally.

"rum2550","Biggest hoax in the history of cinema?","21 August 2021","I saw this movie 22 years after its release. For me, this looked like an amateur's attempt to do a movie. Although this is regarded as a horror movie, it did not give me any scares. Most of movie is made up of characters getting lost in a forest, arguing with each other and wandering helplessly. People have done excellent movies with a minimal budget. Only reason I can think of why this created a sensation back when it came out is the then novel concept of found footage.","1"
"GusF","An absolutely brilliant horror film","14 March 2015","Although this can safely be called one of the films that defined the 1990s, I had never seen it before. The film was not the first of the found footage genre but it is nevertheless an incredibly innovative film. The information about the Blair Witch and Rustin Parr is related to the audience early in the film through interviews with the people of Burkittsville, most of whom dismiss the stories about the Witch as nothing more than a local legend. This is a very clever idea as most towns have stories about ghosts which few take seriously. For instance, there is a castle not two miles from where I live which is supposedly haunted! The stories are regarded by Heather, Josh and Mike as cool material for their documentary but nothing more than that, certainly not as a warning for things to come. It foreshadows their later trouble for the audience but not the characters.

The writers and directors Daniel Myrick and Eduardo Sánchez were able to give a new spin to a very old idea: that what you don't see is more frightening than what you do. This technique is used repeatedly and very effectively in the film with the noises that the characters hear at night. Several of these scenes take place in almost complete darkness, adding to the effect. The film was made on the cheap over a mere eight days and features no real special effects, instead relying on humanity's ancient and instinctual fear of the unknown to provide its scares rather than digitally rendered gods and monsters. Things like the weird, life size stick figures are enough to creep us out!

The three lead actors Heather Donahue, Joshua Leonard and Michael C. Williams - who all use their real names - shot almost all of the film personally. They were given an outline of the plot but improvised the dialogue themselves. They interrupt each other and occasionally stumble over their words, giving the film a wonderfully authentic quality. This is helped by the fact that Heather, Josh and Mike all have flaws and seem like real people.

None of them are especially pleasant people to begin with. As their situations worsens, we see them all go through waves of anger, upset and hysteria to the point that they're borderline unstable. Many of us would try to deny it but I think that 99% of people would react the same way. The fact that Heather keeps recording when logic would dictate that they drop the camera is explained by the fact that it helps her to cope. I would ditch it the first chance that I got but I can well imagine other people holding on to it for the same reason as Heather. There isn't a single part of their behaviour that doesn't ring true. Roger Ebert compared her wonderfully acted (and later much parodied!) apology to the camera to Robert Scott's final diary entries before he froze to death in the Antarctic and I think that that says it best.

I don't usually comment on the promotional side of films but I think that it is worth mentioning in this case. It was one of the first films to be very heavily marketed on the Internet, something which we take for granted today but was groundbreaking in its day. A mockumentary - which, oddly enough, I had seen - was made to promote the film as were several tie-in websites concerning Burkittsville and the police investigation into the disappearances. It was essentially an attempt to do deliberately online what Orson Welles had done accidentally on the radio in 1938. It led to numerous debates as to whether the film was fiction or an actual documentary. We were all far too young to (officially!) see the film but I remember talking about with my friends in school at the time. This kind of campaign would probably not work in 2015 but it was a fantastic idea in 1999.",NA

It is one of the few movies that I regret not only my monetary investment, but also the time I spent watching it.

"Big D-2001","The most terrifying motion picture event of the century.","2 September 1999","Even after the substantial amount of hype surrounding this film before it was released nationwide, I still find this the scariest film I have ever seen. The concept was fresh and original: a group of college kids hiking through the woods looking for clues as to the legend of the Blair Witch, shot as a documentary. From what I hear, the story and myth was a fabrication of the directors and the actors improvised the majority of the film. Even after knowing all that, it was still an extraordinarily effective horror film. The realism of the picture is what heightened the intensity. The absence of a suspenseful score, ""fake"" scares and even a visible villain brought it above the recent ""Scream""-style genre invading cineplexes today. The most effective special effect ""The Blair Witch Project"" uses is the audience's imagination. Our imaginations are so wild and vivid; it taps into our worst nightmare in various moments of the film. What I have learned as a child is that the noise in the dark is, usually, ten times scarier than what makes the noise in the dark. The performances were realistic and very emotional. The three actors displayed the most impressive improvisation I have ever witnessed. Heather Donahue gives an emotional and powerful performance, one of the best performances by an actress of the year. Also, the ending is one of the most hair-raising climaxes ever put on film. My heart was racing until its abrupt end, leaving me a very satisfied customer. See this film while it's still playing on the big screen; trust me, it's worth it. Or you can wait until it debuts on video October 26th. Either way, experience the most terrifying motion picture of the century.",NA
"velvetcactus","Best film ever?","19 November 1999","No. It was appalling. The plot premise was so thin that you could see through it. The likelihood of there being one, let alone three Americans that do not have a mobile phone is laughable. The production values are atrocious and the so-called ""scary"" scenes were about as scary as Scooby-Doo. As for Heather Donahue being nominated for an Oscar, that would make a mockery of the awards. She would be being congratulated for acting when all she was doing was portraying herself as she had no idea what was going on anyway. The only people that deserve awards for this film are the directors who were incredibly successful in utilising the Internet to hype a poor product to the extent that the entire American nation and most of the world have been sucked in.","1"

The fact that it was all home videos was even worse. The camera's kept whirling around so fast you couldn't see anything and it gave me a huge headache.

Well, it happened so that shortly after the release i got hold of some movie magazine that explained the marketing campaign behind it. For me, this has been a much better recommendation.

However, when i went to see it, The Blair Witch Project turned out to be precisely what it was: A low budget horror thriller with all advantages and disadvantages that come with such description.

"nickthegun","Whats all the hubbub, bub?","22 October 2002","My official review of the Blair witch Project.

I watched it again yesterday and it is still three of the most annoying half wits i have ever seen roaming around a wood for 90 mins, before getting whacked by a tramp.

Could someone explain to me why this film is sooooo amazing? I grant you it's a great use of the budget', but so what? If I came across this on late night channel 4, I would have thought O.K student film. Annoying but has potential'. When it is putting itself up with the big boys it gets judged on its comparative merits. Which are very few. I was glad all three protagonists were murdered. I had so little sympathy for their whiny antics I felt like doing it myself. The acting was lame (But it was a low budget'. So what? They were still rubbish) and the ending was an anticlimax (albeit relief) to say the least.

I have to say, though, I don't hate this film as much as I did. When Blair Witch mania hit I had every student and wannabe film critic telling me I had to see it' The indie film of the century' this'll show the big studios'. My personal backlash was so savage I couldn't have a conversation with anyone about it without shouting Your wrong! Its rubbish and you are stupid!'. But now I am calmer. But those who like it are still stupid. And as for those who say its one of the scariest films I have ever seen'","2"

"microbonnie","Creative and original idea not to be mimicked","3 August 1999","Brilliant idea: a movie so realistic it's *real* until you know for sure that it's not. The makers of this film went to so much trouble, in fact, to make it seem real, that even given that I knew it was just a movie, I had to reconvince myself it wasn't real after viewing the film and checking out the web site. To be sure: it's nice to believe it's real if you want to get really, really scared. As a movie, though? Mediocre. They could have done more with the legend to build up the plot, without taking away from the ""real"" aspect one bit. The footage they include doesn't include enough interviews or background to be pieced into a true documentary anyway. I wasn't quite as afraid as I wanted to be, in all honesty. If people try to copy this idea, however, they will FAIL. This is the type of thing that can only be done once successfully. I don't want to be going to a bunch of scary home movies and getting headaches all over the place every summer. I recommend seeing this movie solely on its creativity, though.","7"
"Delerium","The best horror movie in ages.","1 August 1999","""The Blair Witch Project"" is a horror movie with no big name actors, no special effects, and no big budget. And yet, it is better than any recent horror movie I have seen. The horror is all psychological, relying on our own natural sense of fear.

Shot roughly on a Super 8 portable and a portable video camera, it is about three student film makers who travel into the Maryland woods where it is reputed to be haunted. The small town near the woods has a troubled past, and the locals tell tales of the ""Blair Witch"", which is a local myth and the subject of a documentary. As they shoot the documentary, they become hopelessly lost, unprepared, and turning on each other as their situation becomes worse. To make matters worse, they discover there really is something in the woods.

Because of the rough nature of the film, it is all the more realistic. You feel like you are out there with them, and the feeling of hopelessness rubs off on the audience. And since you are discovering things as they do, the horror is all the more real. As a movie, it is very unsettling and one that is sure to leave a lasting impression. Skillfully directed, and a premise that puts most horror movies to shame. I can safely say that I have never seen a movie like this one. One of the year's best.

Funny, but in a summer riddled with big budget action movies and garbage horror movies like ""Lake Placid"" and ""The Haunting"", a low budget indie film like ""The Blair Witch Project"" stands out as the best.",NA
"LnineB","The originator in so many ways.","7 December 2020","This film will always be one of the most inventive and original horror films in my book. Although it wasn't the first found footage film, it definitely set off the trend of so many followers for the next two decades. In addition to that , this film will also be known as the film that probably had the most inventive marketing strategies ever. It literally went viral before anyone even knew the term or anyone even knew that such a thing could be accomplished with the internet. With all of that said, the film is constantly knocked by horror fans for not being ""scary"" or not realistic or ""cheesy"". To me the film shows how anyone can execute a powerfully suspenseful story with little to no violence and a very low budget. It all starts with the acting. The performances by the actors in this film are absolutely remarkable. I was 14 when I first saw it and literally still thought it was ""real"" when I went to the theater to see it. This was accomplished by the believable and realistic performances by everyone , especially the lead female. The story is simple but down right scary and honestly would've held its own as just a survivalist film. This leads to my only gripe with the film and that's the fact that it really didn't need to develop, the supernatural and/or murderer plot beyond what it did in the beginning. It really only served the purpose of giving others a reason to hate on it. Just being lost in the woods is scary enough and to me the director did an amazing job of creating an extreme level of intensity just with that part of the story. The ending was open ended enough to send chills down your spine, once again without showing any blood or gore. It's affective with just atmosphere and acting. Like I said earlier , some people really hate this film but what I find interesting is that many people who hate it love films that were obviously influenced by it. Without Blair Witch we would not have Paranormal activity, Quarantine or even the most recent The Host.","8"
"waxwingslain77","One of the best horror movies ever; here's why:","5 April 2001","SPOILER ALERT. Don't read this unless you have seen the film.

""Blair Witch,"" very original but shot on a very low budget, with no star names, no standard glitter or spectacle is still an excellent film. In fact that is WHY it is excellent; it is original, it is completely non-Hollywood, the dialogue is so good that I felt drawn into the film as I watched it, something which rarely happens with me. In other words, because the three were saying EXACTLY the sort of things I would say in a similar situation, I ""felt"" this film potently.

I love the constantly moving camera, said camera being the chief complaint from those who ""hated"" the film, I think the acting is flawless and the direction and photography make this movie REAL. And what a pleasure to see a horror movie without the cliche-ridden often stupid shock music most horror films have!

I personally relate most to Mike. He is skeptical from the start, and I get the feeling he agreed with Heather and Josh out of boredom more than anything else. ""Thank you for the opportunity,"" Mike says to Heather and I hear a faint blend of reluctance and sarcasm almost at the film's start. Mike is the first to say ""we're lost,"" something I believe Heather and Josh also know, but don't want to admit.

I would not have kicked the map into the creek, (even though the map really was worthless if you think about it,) but otherwise I would have been a near clone of the Mike character. Mike doesn't like the camera on him, and makes no bones about it. ""Shoot some ambiance!"" he says to Heather after she has yet again stuck her camera in his face. My reply would have been more curt than was Mike's. Mike is the most down-to-earth character in the film and I don't think it coincidence that Josh, not Mike or Heather, disappears first.

But I like the other two as well. Heather is an archetypal film student know-it-all, right down to her arrogance. She is completely self-absorbed, (""I'd like to mark this occasion,"") she says acidly when Josh and Mike are complaining about moving on, and she lives to regret her stance. Josh later turns the camera on Heather, who, VERY SIGNIFICANTLY, says ""Are you expecting me to say something?"" She whines to Josh, even though she has practically rammed the camera into both Josh's and Mike's souls. When Josh really starts yelling at Heather, the bitter sarcasm he uses is most understandable. (I personally love it!)

Josh is the first to entirely break down. This is completely unexpected, I was sure it would have been Mike. Josh puts on a convincing laid back facade but when things get bad, he's the first to crack. This was a brilliant stroke.

""Blair Witch"" is a character study, if you'll pardon the expression. I was only scared once. (Those straw and twine symbols of hell in the trees, you know the scene.) Otherwise I was fascinated, and I have seen this rather short film several times. The dialogue, the characters, the moving camera; We KNOW something is going to happen. Indeed something does happen, in fact several things happen, one of them being an extremely well crafted film which contains MUCH more than meets the eye.

I give ""Blair Witch"" a ten.","10"
"John-405","Wonderful -- definitely not ""Night of the Living Dead for the Millennium""","26 July 1999","No spoilers here, IMO, but read at your peril.

Most of the negative comments about this film seem to come from hard core horror buffs who fail to find it particularly frightening. The problem is that hard core horror fans have been hooked on so much blood, gore and cheap frights that anything that asks them to use their imaginations is going to seem boring.

As someone who is not particularly a horror buff, I thought Blair Witch was brilliant.

I should say that I walked into the theater ignorant of any of the hype surrounding the film. I had seen a preview, and so knew the basic premise, but that was it.

The three principles are more or less completely believable, which is probably due to the fact that their situation in real life was as close as possible to their characters' situation. They really were left to wander in the woods, and they knew only generally what they would find there.

There is nothing profound about the film's content. The 3 film students are typical slacker dumb bells, and they react to their situation with honest fright and little else. There is little time for philosophizing, but you get the feeling that even if there were these three would have little to say.

The brilliance of the film lies completely in its concept: the idea of throwing three actors in the woods and asking them to improvise on their own fear. The result is extremely compelling and convincing. There are little clues here and there that the 3 are acting, but, for the most part, they appear to actually be 3 people lost in the woods being terrorized by a coven of witches!

There is *one* glimpse of blood in the entire film and zero glimpses of the witches (or whatever they may be). The horror is left entirely to the imagination and the oblique ending resists the urge to explain. As the credits rolled, I was really grateful that the film makers hadn't tried to make this a ""Night of the Living Dead for the Millennium"".

Oh, and one other comment: Some reviewers have complained that it is unbelievable that Heather would keep filming, even when her life was in danger. Actually, that is is not so hard to believe when you consider all of the documentary films that have been done in life-threatening situations during war time. Heather may be a little more professional than you would expect a 20-something film student to be, but she's hardly unique or without example in real life.

"colossu5","Works better than the sleeping pill!","15 January 2006","Despite the obnoxious voices of the characters, this movie still does a better job than the sleeping pill does of putting one to sleep. In a nutshell, if you are entertained by watching characters stand around, complain, and act foolishly, then this movie is for you! Basically this movie is ENTIRELY about kids acting irrationally, complaining, and whining in the forest. Nothing happens to them, and they're all so annoying that you just hope they die. The first 99% of the movie could've been shrunk to a total time of 2 minutes (and even then it would still be a waste of film), and then the ending could've been made such that it wasn't quite possibly the biggest letdown in movie history.

Nothing about this movie is scary at all. At the end, there is finally hope that the characters might all finally die and the movie will finally be over but nothing is resolved at all because you do not know what exactly happened. Actually, when I saw this movie, I thought that it was either a joke or a faulty tape or something because the end credits just sort of spontaneously popped up and started rolling. That is why this movie is such a big joke/scam. The entire movie is spent the viewer wanting something to happen (which is probably hoping the characters get killed), but nothing ever happens, not even at the end.

Come to think of it, it's hard to even call this ""movie"" a movie. Why? Because there was no plot, terrible acting, no character development, no conflict (other than the absence of a medicine to cure stupidness), no resolution, no conclusion, and terrible cinematography. The only thing that this ""movie"" has in common with a real movie is that they both run on film.

I must give props to whoever's idea it was to come up with this ""movie"". After all, right now he's probably rolling in cash. Throwing together a ""movie"", taking absolutely no care in doing so, and then marketing it such that people flock to the theatres to see it is a genius way to spend practically $0, but make millions. I should follow his example (except when I make my movie, I will actually take time and care and make a good plot).

If you've ever seen a movie called ""Open Water"", this movie is exactly the same, only in this movie they're on land, there's more complaining, more stupid acting, and less of a plot. If 0/10 were an option, I would vote that for this movie in a heartbeat.","1"
"JimRaynor55","Massively Overrated Tripe","9 October 2006","The Blair Witch Project is not the brilliant film that it was hailed as by the critics when it first came out. No, instead it's a uniquely-made (not necessarily a good thing) movie that just had masterful marketing. Before it came out, many people honestly believed that it was real. Even after they learned it was not, they were still intrigued by the eerie advertisements and the unique premise. Coming out in 1999 amid the backlash against of big-budget, visual FX-heavy blockbusters like Godzilla (1998) and The Phantom Menace also likely benefited this low-budget film.

I'm not some stupid kid looking for tons of ridiculous gore in a horror movie. I can understand the idea that sometimes ""it's what you don't see that scares you."" However, I also believe that you do have to see SOMETHING, even if it's just a little, to be scared.

All this movie shows is a trio of stupid kids running around lost in the woods. Occasionally they freak out after hearing spooky sounds, that's basically it. Oh yeah, at one point they find a bunch of little wooden arts and crafts hung on some tree branches. Real scary.

The plot is nonexistent, as is the backstory (I hear it's provided in a sequel which dispensed with the unique first-person video camera perspective, and was just a plain old crappy horror movie). You NEVER learn what the Blair Witch is, or even if that's what's behind the things that go on in the movie.

The characters are stupid and unlikable kids. I heard that the no-name actors were told to improvise their scenes, to make things more ""realistic."" Believe me, it shows. There's an entire scene where the three characters do nothing but scream ""F*** you!"" This movie which supposedly reinvigorated the sagging horror genre is completely overrated. There's not a single real scare in it, and the story and writing is pathetic. Save yourself the time and rental fees by passing on this film.","1"
"manos","One benefit from this movie","27 October 1999","The only thing I can truly be thankful for is, perhaps, the horror genre will finally move away from the hack & slash gore which has flooded the silver screen for the past 30 years with pale imitators of the original ""Night of the Living Dead"". As for ""The Blair Witch Project"" itself, the film is two-dimensional in both character and plot. I couldn't help but to keep looking at my watch everytime a series of whiny exchanges between the three main characters kept repeating ad nauseam. Unfortunately, the public at large seldom allows themselves the opportunity to view older movies for the first time. If you would like to see far superior films to ""The Blair Witch Project"", I would suggest you rent the original ""The Haunting"" from 1963 >""Curse of the Demon"" from 1957, ""Five Million Years to Earth"" from 1968, and ""Freaks"" from 1932. It's interesting to note that ""Freaks"" was originally panned by the critics and by the public as being depraved yet it is now regarded as a horror classic which was way ahead of its time. I would encourage you to pick up any of the above mentioned videos when you rent ""The Blair Witch Project"" for Halloween. If you even get the slightest chill from viewing ""The Blair Witch Project"" you'll break out in goosebumps while seeing any of the older and far superior videos.","1"
"delbomber","""Eeriest"" rather than ""scariest"" movie ever made","1 August 1999","Has there ever been so much hype for such a low-budget film? This film may have gotten a bigger push than any other low-budget movie in cinematic history, and in the end I believe it was hurt by this.

Not only was it being billed as ""the scariest movie ever"" but there were also rumors that these events actually occurred, and the film had been pieced together from actual footage (which is not true, of course). Whether or not the legend is real, I don't know, but it seemed real enough, where one might believe it actually happened. I felt the three actors involved were practically flawless, giving some of the most realistic performances I have ever seen; the fact that they ad-libbed all their lines must have helped them in this respect, but nonetheless they were excellent.

The problem I had with the film is that it isn't scary enough; there were more scenes where I found myself laughing than feeling scared, which was not the intent of the directors. It WAS eerie, I have no qualms about that, but it had the potential to be terrifying without wandering into the realm of ""campiness,"" and with a little more substance than innuendo it would have truly been a masterpiece (perhaps if they heard chanting at night instead of the all encompassing wood-snapping sound it would have been more effective at conveying the intense fear the characters must have felt which, judging by people's comments around me after it was over, was not accomplished). What is meant to be inferred or imagined is almost always more frightening than anything that can be portrayed on screen, but even the subtleties were TOO subtle, and they should have been a bit more graphic.

The conclusion of the film was terrifying and it wasn't until then that I felt truly frightened. There is something intrinsically creepy about the woods, but I think the film-makers relied to much upon that assumption.","8"

"sparky-76","The Horror Movie of the 90s.","27 July 1999","This is it, the movie that dethroned ""Scream"", which is an amazing accomplishment. There's a problem built into the horror genre, what's terrifying, over time, becomes commonplace and then tepid. I don't think people who see films like ""Psycho"", ""The Exorcist"", ""Nightmare on Elm Street"", etc., today are getting the same experience their parents and sometimes grandparents got the first time, audiences have become too media savvy, they know all of the rules. ""Scream"" didn't break those rules, it made fun of them, it was entertaining but not that scary.

""Blair Witch Project"" is based on two premises which give the film it's power. First, it's almost impossible to create a special effect today which an audience will buy as real, they might appreciate an effect but they won't believe in it, they've seen too much fake stuff. ""Blair Witch"" gets around that problem by keeping it all off screen. And second, if you want your audience to feel an emotion populate your film with self-indulgent drama queens. I laugh at those who ever thought this film could be real but it's great entertainment.

For my money the scariest film of the past several years is still ""Saving Private Ryan"", the initial invasion scenes and the ones where Melish fights hand to hand to his death. Terrifying and very well done. ""Blair Witch"" is the second scariest but is much more in keeping with current definitions of ""hipness"".",NA
"jcpdiesel21","A very original scary movie","5 September 1999","I loved the concept of this movie: three filmmakers who intend to film a documentary and end up getting lost and tormented by the Blair Witch. And the fact that the entire premise was made up is very cool. The filmmakers of this movie were very clever in coming up with an idea that no one else has. Unfortunately, many clones will probably result because of all of the success the movie has had. All of the hype that surrounded this movie drove me to see it. I am a big fan of scary movies and wanted to see what made this movie so different from the rest of the pack. I appreciate the fright factor in the film. The fact that there is no bad guy is a very different concept and a chilling one at that. In all of the scary movies that I've seen there is a bad guy who invades your thoughts and you end up thinking about that night in your darkened bedroom. But in this movie there was no bad guy... which seemed to me to be ten times scarier. While I was watching the movie, I anticipated much more than was shown to me on the screen. I kept waiting for something to happen... yet hardly anything did. Here I can see why people did not like the movie. The element of the movie is suspense, but in our society we are used to thrills and chills and immediate action. The ending had my friends and me arguing for weeks. Ambiguous endings can be good for a film. In that way, you can put your own spin on what just happened on the screen. When the movie ended, I was initially disappointed. But this is one movie that gets under your skin with its unanswered questions. You think about it more and more and wonder what really happened out there in the woods. Overall, I enjoyed the movie for the most part.","7"

I can't believe that this was the movie that everyone has said is the scariest movie ever made, they are still having nightmares, can't walk in the woods in broad daylight, etc. I went expecting to be scared out of my wits. I made my husband go with me, I was so scared beforehand. (I am actually scared quite easily.) There was no need--I could've watched this alone, at midnight. Like I said, I did like the movie. I just don't understand what is supposed to be so terrifying about it. It was a really clever concept and was actually quite enjoyable. And mind you, the things in the trees, the bundles of sticks, and the end (although very ambiguous)were really creepy. But people actually think this is scarier than ""The Exorcist""? Please. I will recommend it to my friends but I will tell them not to take a change of underwear. They won't need it.","7"

To see this film, you need an open mind and a pretty good imagination. If you need to see blood, gore, and things popping out at people to be scared--please see something else. The Blair Witch Project is a movie that scares without showing...it's up to you to create the horrors, the unknown, the monster that you're scared of, and take the movie in as real. Suspend your disbelief, and you won't be let down. Knowing it isn't actually based on true events, for me, didn't make it any less scary.

There are no Hollywood gimmicks and touches here. It's not glamorous, the characters aren't typical teens in Hollywood horror, their existence isn't to pad the body count. We see these three people go from confident and determined documentary makers to the brink of madness. We live through this with them, we are THERE with them in the woods, which is what makes their experiences, and ultimately their fate, that much more terrifying.

I think the fear we all share as humans is not being able to see what is unsettling us. Things always seem much less frightening after you turn the light on, and in the daytime. In the dark, we are at our most vulnerable. We are essentially, blind. Couple that with the fear of being removed from our comfort zone and there you have it; the fear of the unknown.

Someone or something is making those horrible sounds in the woods. Someone, or something left those pile of rocks outside the tent. Someone, or something led them to that house. Someone, or something was hunting them in those woods. But we can't see who or what. We're just like Mike and Heather. Blind.

The severe backlash this film has received, has kept it from reaching it's true place amongst the horror greats, in my opinion. Some people scoff at the idea of The Blair Witch Project being listed as one of the greatest horror films of all time. ""The Shining"" was panned on its release. Over 25 years later, it's viewed as a classic.

In years to come, I hope people look back at this film. I hope people study (or restudy, as may be the case) what makes it work so well. The Blair Witch Project has cemented its place in independent film-making history. My wish is that someday it receives the true recognition and status it deserves.

We won't see anything like this again, this was catching lightning in a bottle. Those of you who feel that creeping fear in the pit of your stomach as Mike and Heather enter the house, know exactly what I'm talking about. To those of you who don't feel the panic, the helplessness of this situation, the pure FEAR in those woods, I can safely say, it's your loss.","9"
"elsbed-1","Left me physically ill, but not scared witless","6 September 1999","My husband and I waited a few weeks for the ""hoopla"" to die down before seeing this. Most everyone I had spoken to said it was quite good. I must admit it was very freakish at times, enough to cause hair to stand on end (which doesn't happen too often to me). But it was only so long before the jerky filming made me sick to my stomach. We left the theater feeling dazed, disoriented and physically sick, not from terror but from motion sickness. From total darkness to a sudden bright light, then a sideways shot and running...I literally don't know how much longer I could have sat there. The film was fairly good, interesting concept; I felt connected to the characters. But it didn't leave me frightened to death as I was led to believe it would. Creeped out, yes. (I believe one really would have to view it in a darkened theater to get the motion sickness effect, when one's eyes are forced to focus solely on the screen). At the end of the film, people were asking, ""Is that it?"", disgusted moans were heard; there seemed to be an overall disappointment. Yes, it was fairly good, and different; No, it was not stellar. My only hope is that we aren't subjected to a tidal wave of copycat ""Blair Witch"" films, ready to exploit this ""new concept""--once was enough.",NA
"Brian-272","The worst horror movie that exist. Don't waste your time.","28 October 2000","Just a little over a year ago I rented The Blair Witch Project and after forty minutes I was ready to fall asleep. Don't waste your money or time with this boring piece of crap. It's simple three lost film students become the prey (note supposedly prey) of an unknown entity while researching a local legend (a supposed witch) in the Maryland woods. Tell me what is the scare? Anyone who has watched this movie knows that the hype builds up to nothing. Maryland college students with raging hormones who make a film for a class research project simply disappear out of the night. Not once does this movie show a scary scene of a supposed monster(legend-witch) these students just vanish one by one like it's a planned vacation using The Blair Witch legend as a scheme. To finish this criticism off of The Blair Witch horror movies should contain gore and murder to scare this one falls way short. Anyway if the people in Hollywood want to make a film about a legend please give a try at the Bigfoot/Sasquatch legend now that's a legend to get your blood pumping. Avoid The Blair Witch Project it's a waste to not only film but to everyone.","1"
"Craven80","Terrifyingly Real.","29 May 1999","Clever and TERRIFYING! You must see it , it is so real you will be genuinely scared. I've talked to many people who were trembling with fear after this movie. It CAN NOT be compared to any other horror film. Although Friday the 13th , Nightmare on Elm St , and Scream are excellent movies - you know that they are just a movie , where as Blair Witch lets you envision it as REAL footage. SEE IT - To understand.","6"
"supdoc","Literally visceral impact from a simple, clever idea","1 August 1999","My response to this film was influenced most by my reaction to the relentless jumpiness of the hand-held cameras. I must have a low tolerance for this kind of thing (I've had the same reaction trying to playing computer video games), but by the middle of TBWP I thought I'd have to leave the theater, I was feeling so nauseated. I tried to exercise some control by looking away from the screen but my eyes were drawn back there because I wanted to see what was going on! I thought that I might see something that the characters didn't. Considering that I knew the premise beforehand, I was astounded at how much of a rise the movie got out of me, and I must admit that I bought the whole thing. Even their continuing to film after they were scared seemed acceptable as an attempt on the characters' part to maintain some kind of distance and control. Bravos all around.","8"
"Whymselee","Not a bad idea for a film school project, but","19 November 1999","it should never have been released as a major motion picture.

It was a small, albeit creative, idea that through hype and manipulation was unleashed on an unsuspecting public. This film isn't masterful for its horror or suspense, but for its manipulation of the public at large. It's important for its ""scam"" effect.

The most that can be said of this movie is that it is a boring, obscenity laden, story of 3 nitwits lost in the woods. That's it! And it was never truly scary, although it did have a creepy moment or two in it.

The characters were completely unlikable and unsympathetic, and I kept hoping the witch would get them sooner, rather then later.

For masterful suspense, try Hitchcock. If you want to feel ripped-off and a victim of a great hype machine, see this film instead.","1"
"BloodLust_X","Worst movie ever made","2 June 2002","This has to be the worst movie I have ever seen in my life. I was not scary at all.

"ShrinkSteve","Simple, annoying, frightening!","6 September 2003","This was one hard to watch movie. I am a person who immerses myself in the story. I don't turn the movie on the first time and begin my critique as many here have done. First watch it, then, later, return and blast it if you must. I loved it. The idea is unique. The style is the annoying part, but, that is one of the things that makes this movie. I found myself so wrapped up in this thing that I was yelling at the stupid characters in the film. All they had to do was follow the creek down stream.. it is any woodsman's guaranteed method for getting ""un-lost"" (especially in slightly rural Maryland). What I enjoyed most was the intelligence of the director. He didn't play the Hollywood game of showing us the horrifying monster. Instead he let our minds do the work. If you have imagination, you'll be frightened to death. If you don't, you'll fall asleep or get motion sickness. This was so much fun that I made my own, cheaper yet, spoof, and mine is funny, at least to me! Enjoy and be brave.. not everything on screen has to be so glossy and predictable as a big budget Hollywood bore!",NA
"HeroOfTheDay666","Possibly The Scariest Movie I've Ever Seen","18 July 2010","When I heard about this movie, I had no idea what was so special about it. To me, it seemed like a cheesy low budget movie that had no scary elements to it. Just a bunch of teenagers running around with video cameras in the woods. The spoofs of this movie didn't help either. Last Halloween, I decided to rent this movie and watch it alone one night. I don't think I ever had such trouble sleeping as I did that night. This movie is defiantly one of the scariest movies I have ever seen. It's a rarity when a movie scares me at all, let alone follow me far after the screen is turned off. It's a shame to me that this movie is so underrated. It is unfortunate that people hate this movie because of its lack of special effects, music, and other elements of the modern horror movie (most of which i despise). Perhaps the reason most people did not enjoy this movie is because they actually need to use some brain power to grasp the true horror of this picture. Unlike most horror movies these days where producers use flashy gimmicks to distract viewers from a lack of plot or writing, the Blair Witch Project uses only reality and believable situations, leaving a raw, shocking experience for those intelligent enough to enjoy it. To me, the reason this movie is so successful is because of how real it feels, and that your imagination is left to do so much. The plot could easily of been based on a true story, and many people actually thought this movie was real at its release. Despite not being real or based on anything, it isn't preposterous to think something like this can happen. As you may of noticed, I haven't mentioned anything specific about the movie. This is because once you know the basic idea, thats all you need. Anything more is spoiler, and will ruin the experience. Just trust me, if you are sick of most horror movies, give this a shot. Watch it alone, at night, with the lights out. It's an experience you will never forget.","10"

""They wanted us to be hungry and tired, so they did the sleep deprivation, and they stopped feeding us... which is a great way to create animosity, for future reference."" Joshua Leonard, lead actor

""By applying the same physical and mental stresses to the actors - lack of food, lack of sleep, walking them around, f***ing with them at night -, we hoped by the time we really needed them to freak out, they would be able to tap into areas of their psyche they normally wouldn't be able to tap into.""

The actors are waking up - you could hear them talking. Then the guys begin to do footsteps in the leaves. Then, some of the guys go up and begin to violently shake the tent. The actors begin to scream and eventually run from the tent out into the woods. Their cameras rolling."" From the journal of Stefanie DeCassan, film crew member

""...and the tent started shaking and we heard babies crying outside, and so I think that all of our first reaction was 'I'm not getting up... this is not happening...'"" Joshua Leonard, lead actor

There's something about The Blair Witch Project most people fail to realize. This is not just a movie trying to pass as a documentary with great marketing outcomes. This is the one of the sickest, most daunting, barely legal human breaking experiments ever made in cinema.

Haxan and Artisan really went off their way trying to pass this as a true story until their premiere at the Sundance Festival. But co-directors Eduardo Sánchez and Daniel Myrick also pushed things to the limits while trying to give the acting and shooting a sense of creepy realism. For that purpose, they hired three inexperienced and unknown actors with high improvisational skills, gave them a crash course on the filming equipment, sent them to the woods in Seneca Creek State Park, Maryland, and directed them remotely, giving them no script dialogues and only a brief guideline of what was to come. The result is a genuinely terrifying experience which proves to be like no other, if you embrace it as it should be embraced. This is getting more and more difficult to achieve, as some parts of the movie have now been spoofed beyond maximum tolerance and without deserving that treatment. But giving it the proper personal investment, you will be dragged into the woods with three people. And you will feel confused, scared, exhausted, hunted, haunted, and on the verge of physical and mental collapse. All these were felt by the actors at some point. You stretch your physical and mental limits, and you will end up entering a different, unfamiliar reality, where nothing's certain or safe anymore. The most eerie and haunting fear of all is the fear of the unknown. If you end up being led by the darkest places of your imagination, you'll end up seeing the most frightening things under the dimmest light...

For all this, and because I can truly feel that when I can create the right conditions upon viewing of this film, The Blair Witch Project stands in my book as the ultimate horror experience, side by side with the cult classics that gave me true nightmares when I was younger.

Top notch.","10"
"the-jerk","boring as hell","13 April 2005","This movie was a brilliant marketing gimmick. I give the gimmick a 10. I actually knew people who bought that it was based on a true story, that the footage was real. And for these people, the movie must have been terrifying. There's a difference between a real documentary and a fake one, and this looked almost like the real thing. But we forgive a real documentary for shoddy camera-work, boring dialogue, etc, because it's real. And if anything compelling had happened here, I would have forgiven this movie for those same faults too. But...

A brilliant movie it was not. It was, in fact, a terrible movie. The filmmakers just tried too hard to make it look real. As a result, we do get some decent acting, but if you're looking for a real plot, look elsewhere. The story just rambles along at an extremely slow pace. We get mysteries throughout, and a few minor shudders, and there was a spookiness to the cinematography, but the way it was shot was just too claustrophobic to be compelling. As far as the story, it was basically a standard ""kids lost in the woods"" movie with all the clichés attached. They lose the map! They're going around in circles! Ooh, there are scary things happening outside the tent while they're sleeping! And those weird twig things! By the end of the movie, we're hungry for some kind of explanation as to what is going on. We never get it. What we get is an extremely cryptic ending that is too esoteric to make sense. I thought the sequel was supposed to explain what was going on?!? The sequel just went in a completely different direction, and it didn't make any sense either! By the way, I thought this was supposed to be a trilogy. Where's the third movie? Like I said, the acting isn't bad, but it's not great either; they actually look like film students doing a bad student film. The dialogue is awful. The movie is boring. And it doesn't make any sense. I think a lot of people were lulled in by that cutting-edge marketing gimmick, and maybe ended up confusing the gimmick for the movie itself. That's the only explanation I can see for people liking this movie. In my opinion, it was a con, and should have been a bomb. Instead, it was one of the most successful independent movies of all time, and because no real care went into the making, possibly the most profitable. I'm not going to down you if you liked this movie; I felt like I wasted my time watching it, and would have actually been angry if I had paid to see it in the theater.","1"
"jeff-201","Wow.","2 August 1999","I honestly don't know what to say about this film. So why am I writing, you ask? Because this film is possibly the best one I have seen in years. It is confusing, jaded, jarring, thrilling, and mystifying. The acting is superb, the production even better. Even an experienced film student walks away from The Blair Witch Project unsure of the true nature of the images on the screen. The barrier between fiction and non-fiction is truly tampered and disguised. And after much debate with many skeptics and cynics and filmmakers, I can only say that the only conclusion we have reached is that if it is crafted fiction - it is a supreme example of how a filmmaker can control sight and sound. And, of course, if it is non-fiction...

"andy-227","The scariest film I have ever seen, or probably ever will see!","27 July 1999","First off, anyone who says this movie is okay, bad, or ""just plain sucked"", obviously is full of shit or needs serious psychiatric help! This film may not be the most memorable horror film ever made, but it doesn't have to be memorable to be scary. ""Frankenstein"" and ""Dracula"" were memorable, yes. But were those motherf*****s scary? I don't think so. I am delighted that I have seen this film, yet at the same time, enraged at the negative criticism people have wrote at the IMDB! Do you guys think you could make a better or scarier movie? I'll believe it when I see it. Anyway, on with my review of ""The Blair Witch Project"".

I honestly can't remember a time in my life where a film managed to scare me this deep into submission. What makes this film so scary? Well, for one thing, it's VERY realistic. As a matter of fact, the actors truly suffered. They were deprived of food, as well as the knowledge of the fact that the directors themselves, were making the ""Blair Witch"" noises at night. They were fooled, and the result was the capture of authentic reactions of fear on camera. The next stroke of genius was the camerawork. What you are seeing is supposed to be the unearthed footage of the doomed filmmakers. So, instead of paying for a cinematographer, why not give the actors the cameras. It's their story. They're the ones who shot the footage that was found. Sure the camerawork is shaky. But it's real, nonetheless. Also, this was the first horror film I've seen that could scare you to death, without the aid of gore, special effects, music, or even a monster. If you are deaf, or hard of hearing, then you won't be scared by ""The Blair Witch Project"" whatsoever. You never see the ""Blair Witch"", but you can hear it. There are moments in the film, where the lenscap is on, or it's just too dark to see anything, yet you can still hear, loud and clear, what is transpiring. I cannot describe the sounds heard by the three filmmakers. The first one is merely some twigs breaking, but the other ones are combinations of moaning and babies crying. Whatever it was, it managed to speed up my heart rate! Scarier still, there is little doubt in my mind that these events couldn't really happen! I think that is the heart of the nightmare, that it could happen to you! I've always been scared of woods, and I could've sworn on my last camping trip, that I heard something walking around outside my tent. ""The Blair Witch Project"" brings out that phobia of darkness and the woods out of every person that sees it. Even before I saw this film, I was scared to walk around outside my cottage at night(which is out in the country). Does this fear worsen? Unfortunately for the squeamish, yes! It builds up to an unbelievable climax until something hits the camera, and complete silence fills the woods. It's inconclusive, which is again, aiding the fright factor, because it makes you think and wonder, what did you just witness, and what happened to the three missing filmmakers? It's a terrifying ending, and it's one I'll never forget! I've had nightmares similar to this. Everybody does at one point in their lives. The directors knew that. They also knew that this kind of buildup of fear would give ""The Blair Witch Project"" it's life. You are not going to get anything else from this film. Not message, not euphoria, not sadness, nothing! Just a hardcore scare, that never leaves you! NEVER!","10"

It tried being a horror film, however the film was a horror show rather than horror film. one of the main reasons i dislike this film is because its one big anti climax and the concluding part of the film is laughable.

"savaovi","Quite unimpressive","21 June 2011","I'm disappointed. The plot and the characters really don't add up. They go into some huge woods with food for only 2 days? They only have a map and one of them kicks it into the creek??!! They p...s themselves in fear yet they keep filming? They follow south and though they only walk during the day they walk in a circle? What, the Sun makes circles in the sky? How dumb can you be? They are a group of teenagers with no survival experience so I guess it is normal that they behave like morons for most of the film, but where are their instincts? If there is something that can defeat fear, that is the auto-conservation instinct: that instinct can turn a damn coward into a hero. Something scares the s...t out of them every night and they don't bother to build anything that resembles a weapon?

I thought that was one of those movies that are completely boring until the end and then the final scare makes your skin boil with goosebumps and you think ""It was only one scare in the whole crappy movie, but it was a damn good scare"". I was wrong. The final scene was not scary at all (much like the whole movie). Where was the witch? Or was it a serial killer? Did the teenagers die? Well...I don't give a damn...and that is bad rating.","3"

"catalog","Truly Chilling","9 August 1999","This is the first movie in a long time to actually scare me. Any movie can go for cheap scares with things that jump out at you (Haunting remake), but thankfully Blair Witch doesn't do that. Instead, it created tension by NOT showing you what is terrorizing the main characters, and letting your imagination do the work. I found all of the actors very convincing, and the point-of-view camera work really puts you into the action. The last sequence, with its chilling final shot, is unequaled in all of movie history. This is truly a landmark film, something that must be seen in the theater, and shouldn't be missed by anyone.","9"
"Jackyl-8","Truly Original!!","2 August 1999","It's too bad that some people are calling this film the scariest movie ever. I didn't find it as scary as it was thought provoking and splendidly done. The film makers succeeded abundantly at making a film that was truly brilliant. It's too bad that Stanley Krubrick died, after ""Eyes Wide Shut"" he could have learned alot about film making from the makers of Blair Witch. The movie is so well done that when it was first shown the film makers had private investigators calling up and saying they wanted to re-open the case and find out what happened to the three film makers. They had to assure them that it was only fiction. I saw two films this weekend, Blair Witch and The Haunting, the former was brilliant, the latter was just another typical Hollywood formula film that depends on specail effects and computers to entertain.

If you answered yes to any of these questions, do NOT see this movie.

The Blair Witch Project is a rare film, perhaps the only one I've seen, that doesn't give you everything you want to hear. It will scare the pants off of you, but only if you let it. Seeing the website ahead of time works.

But if you're like me and didn't see the site, the very style of the movie will draw you in. It's a Real World-cum-documentary device that's used, and it's used to perfection. The point of view of the movie gives us an almost intrusive angle on the entire story. Instead of giving us detailed bios on the characters, the movie lets its own technique draw us in. Brilliant. (If you NEED detailed bios, or anything of the sort, see the site.)

The whole thing is eerie. The images from the film are with me a week after seeing it, and it scared me quite nicely. There are people who don't get it, don't understand it, or simply don't like the way the movie ""looked"". Great. Go see something flashy, then. (Heck, one guy I know complained that the film didn't take up the whole screen!) If you're looking for minor appearance details, you'll hate this film.

If, on the other hand, you want: a creative story that gives you enough but not too much, a set of characters you grow to bond and identify with, and a suspenseful ending, this is the one to see.

"darragh608","Original and under-appreciated","27 May 2013","This film currently on IMDb gets 6.3? It's funny how the same people that slated this film like Paranormal Activity. A movie that would never have come to be had Blair Witch not reworked the genre, yet a film that is cheap in comparison in strength of story, characters and realism. You cannot deny the impact this movie has had on others. The character development is intriguing and filled with mistrust. Heather is annoying but true to life, people are irritating and annoying at times:)The sound effects are subtle and create an isolation. The film gathers momentum and the fear of the dark really affect the viewer. The great thing about this movie is that it doesn't have a typical formula. It doesn't provide the viewer with any relief (cheap scares, cheap jokes that relieves the tension). Instead it constantly builds fear in the viewer with atmospheric sounds, visuals and the impending sense of tragedy. Nobody could honestly say they knew how this movie would play out. What sets this film apart from others are the empty surroundings. There have been many Horrors shot in woodland areas(mansions,cabins etc) but few entirely in the woods. The subject of witch craft was skillfully mastered. This film worked with a low budget where others would have failed.","10"
"realfan-3","NOT scary & NOT original","6 August 1999","I registered with IMDb purposely just to trash this film. I have never felt a movie so undeserving of praise than this one. I see no point as to why it was made or why people like it. If you liked it, good for you, I'm glad you enjoyed it. I however did not.

I take offense to the suggestion that people who don't like this movie are somehow less intelligent or imaginative than those who did. I guess it takes more to spark my imagination than a carefully-constructed hype campaign and the inability to make the audience suspend disbelief. I fully wanted and expected to be scared and be swept away into the story. Alas, there was nothing to be scared of, and no story: only 3 kids screaming obsenities at each other. At no time did these characters make me think they were real. To anyone who thought this was a real documentary for a microsecond, I truly feel sorry for you. Never have I believed more strongly than now that film critics are just a bunch of group-think cretins, who use their pony-tails as antennas for the brain police to download ideas into their empty heads. The critical response to this failure proves it.

I was going to give this film points for originality, but these charlatans of the cinema, Sanchez and Myrick, ripped off the concept itself from ""The Last Broadcast."" I should have known...","1"
"ScottAmundsen","Real Terror on a Shoestring Budget","24 October 2010","Alfred Hitchcock may well have been the first filmmaker to demonstrate (with 1960's PSYCHO) that one could make a truly scary horror film for very little money and without throwing a lot of special effects at the screen. Few directors have learned the lesson Hitchcock taught; Robert Wise's THE HAUNTING is perhaps the best example.

THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT, a true original, takes the lessons of PSYCHO and milks them for all they are worth. Writer/directors Daniel Myrick and Eduardo Sanchez, showing a real grasp of the concept that less is more, put virtually nothing on the screen and yet in the process scared the hell out of audiences all across the country, myself included.

By now, probably the whole world knows the plot: three college students disappeared in the woods surrounding a town called Blair while doing a documentary film about the legend of the Blair Witch. Their film was discovered, though they were never found. What follows is a jerky, often repetitive, deliberately amateurish-looking film, made completely with hand-held cameras, which documents the three kids' adventure in the woods.

Woods are scary places by nature. After all, how many of the fairy tales that we heard as kids involved getting lost in the woods? Which is exactly what happens to Our Three Heroes.

The genius of this film, and the thing that connects it most strongly to Wise's THE HAUNTING, is that almost nothing is actually shown on the screen, and what little is, is either in the corner of the shot, or the camera moves away before the mind can take in what it has seen. Like Wise and Hitchcock, the filmmakers here created a work of perfect audience manipulation. The camera work, which with its jerks and tilts threatens to make one seasick, adds to a feeling that everything is off balance.

The three young actors deliver serviceable performances. That is to say, they are perfect for this film. It does not demand greatness; in fact, the cheesiness of the production values and the okay-but-not-great acting in a way add to the impact of this film.

I went to see this when it first came out. I went alone. It left me with a case of the creeps that took me weeks to shake. There were moments during the film when I realized I was absolutely terrified yet nothing was actually going on on the screen. I cannot explain the visceral reaction that this movie invokes; it has to be experienced.

TBWP will be on my top ten list of great horror movies for a long time to come.","10"
"Kakueke","Literally vacuous movie","19 September 2001","I have often wondered whether I would have been more frightened if I had seen Silence of the Lambs on a full screen rather than on TV, but in any event I was somewhat scared by it (actually, more like shocked, not really frightened). And I was frightened by The Exorcist the first time I saw it, but sort of laughed later at some of the scenes, altho I think it was good. But I was not frightened by this idiotic, silly, and literally vacuous movie that I saw on a full screen.

One thing I do not like in a movie is for nothing to happen, and this is certainly in spades here. Those who are familiar with Cannibal Holocaust know the camera and no faces (and journey into woods/jungle) were not a new idea, and, still, in that movie that was only a partial effect and you saw most of the characters most of the time (I think faces and bodies -- at least some -- are important for a movie). Of course, the characters in Blair Witch were such idiots that it is hardly worth knowing them; the men were jerks and the woman was a complaining and screaming (pun intended) loser. All the interplay between the three was nothing but stupid; it is fitting they lost the map. And the character development was limited to what we had here?

My comment about nothing happening's being an albatross rings particularly true with a ""horror"" film. If I admit, having not been frightened by the tree etc. events throughout the movie, that I was slightly frightened at the end, so what? The movie is so bad it not only should have been on no magazine covers, it should never have been made.

Thanks to the unrelenting hype the movie is doing GREAT at the box office, but almost everyone hates it. Why? They were expecting a conventional horror movie with its quick fix of gore and shivers. BWP is a different thing:at first it left me completely cold. I liked the idea behind the project,but found it over-hyped. Then, a few hours later the full force of the film hit me like a bullet train. I was at a gig when I finally understood the final moments of the film:man, i felt goosebumps all over my body! And then, and then:other scenes,other moments jostle in my mind for attention since the day I saw this movie... watching the BWP is a very disturbing experience.

"nogodnomasters","I want to avoid any cheese","19 January 2018","I feel like I am the last person on the planet to have seen this film and I could have left it off my bucket list. This is the mother of the hand held genre with Heather Donahue being the cut off face that launched a 1,000 films. I found the premise to be interesting. The interviews with locals seemed extremely real and not boring. The internal conflict the group has in the woods was over done and was more grating than entertaining. Yes, I wanted to kick the crap out of Michael (Williams) too. It is iconic, so I watched it.

Utz chips and beer is indeed the meal of champions.

"fineanimal","The dark side of the film industry","29 July 2002","The Blair Witch Project is a crude, vulgar attempt to capitalize on Generation X's fascination with itself. Completely devoid of content and purpose, this is the film to watch when you have no stereotypically shallow teenagers around to swear at you and talk about getting drunk or stoned. It will fill that void for 90 minutes, while subtly creating a greater void in your appreciation of art that may haunt you for the rest of your life. Yes, this film terrified me, but not because it was a frightening horror film. It is an archetypical example of big business (in this case Artisan Entertainment) manufacturing social reality for profit. And that is truly terrifying.

I can only recommend The Blair Witch Project to psychologists and others who study the manufacture of social reality (research Artisan's marketing campaign first or you'll likely find the film itself excruciatingly tedious). In this regard alone does The Blair Witch Project offer any significance. May it quickly be forgotten, and may big business and government never learn the lessons it teaches.","1"
"Jeff G","Brilliant! Everything the remake of ""The Haunting"" isn't!","31 July 1999","This is a film that demands attention. It is a brilliant new approach to a tired genre that has issued forth from its withered loins such tiresome instances of schlock as the remake of ""The Haunting"" (the 1963 original was *amazing*, but the 1999 version was a joke) and ""I Still Know What You Did Last Summer"".

This film isn't perfect, and I only gave it an eight, but if I were to rate it on sheer inventiveness and outright chutzpah, I would give it a *twelve* on a scale from one to ten. While the movie doesn't exactly deliver on all the promises it makes, it delivers on quite a good number of them, yielding a raw, new, harrowing film ... so different from our usual movie-going experiences that it practically starts a whole new genre!

If I had to compare it to other films (and this is hard) I'd have to say that it most resembles ""The Evil Dead"" in its inventiveness and brutal paranoia, and ""Seven"" in its gritty ""this is real life"" feel.

Also worth mentioning is the clever ""is it real"" mythology that the marketing guys have built around this movie. Go to http://www.blairwitch.com to see ""actual interviews"" with family members and a chronology of the Blair Witch. Astonishing!

I whole-heartedly recommend this film, flaws and all. Hell, I wish I had made it myself! :)","8"

"pekinman","Excruciating... in ALL the wrong ways","13 February 2009","I watched 'The Blair Witch Project' for the first time this evening, almost 10 years after its theatrical release. I've read a lot about this film and many of the commentaries, especially on IMDb, were positive to the point of ecstatic. I wanted to be scared out of my wits, like the original 'Night of the Living Dead' caused me to be. Perhaps this expectation and hope is largely responsible for my deep disappointment.

It starts off fairly promisingly with interviews with the locals of the town on the edge of the haunted woods. There is humor and believability in these first minutes, then it all goes down the tube as soon as the three students enter the woods. The last hour of this movie is boring as can be and I found it very difficult to convince myself that these actors were really alone in the woods without some sort of pre-conceived guidance. How else could they have made their way to the house at the end?

And the bobbing and lurching cameras caused me to have to take a break in the middle to go lie down and relax my stiff neck. The feeling was very much like being in a small launch in the Gulf of Mexico in a 9 foot swell.

The best aspects of this film are the interesting folk art elements scattered around in the woods. Beyond that I give this effort a 4 out of 10 for chuzpah and little else.","4"

No thanks to the makers I'm afraid.......More like the giant movie distributers Mega idea of fooling the public and telling outright Lies to get them into the theatres. Young people these days take everything on face value and believe most things that people tell them......except what their parents tell them :-) I left the cinema thinking that I'd watched 20 re runs of NYPD Blue the famous ""Wobble Cam"" TV drama.

As it is, it appears - dare I say - slapped together.","1"
"jjones34","This movie stunk and is better only than its sequel","2 July 2005","This movie had horrible acting, unlikable characters, an amorphous plot line. Ten monkeys banging on a camera could have produced a better movie. Why would I care if any of these idiots died? Shouldn't at least ONE of the characters be likable, redeemable? Shaky cameras don't impress me. Undelivered monsters and undelivered explanations don't impress me. The least they could have done was actually show SOMETHING scary. Some sustained muted form, but this movie delivered nothing but two hours of gratuitous cursing and screaming and crying. I hated it more than sideways constipation.

This movie is an utter waste of time and falls way below the one star mark that any established movie house would crank out. Blairwitch was the first salvo in the ""cheap is better"" wars that brought us reality television. Thank God this lack of professionalism and creativity hasn't caught on in Hollywood the way it has caught on in network TV.

"Stinkytaco","I've seen types of rocks more interesting than this movie","1 October 2006","OK, I'll go step by step to tell you just how bad this thing really is.

Camera Work: Horrible! The camera shakes every second! It's so annoying and you can't really see what's going on. Most of the time you'll be skipping parts because of a black screen. You'll wonder: ""Is this important or can I just skip this part?""

Acting: The acting is just screaming and yelling and arguing and that kind of stuff. But do these people really need to put a swear word into almost every sentence?

Sound: What sound? There is no music except at the end and on the DVD. But it's so stupid. Seriously, the opening sound on the DVD sounds like someone turned up the volume of a keyboard as high as it would go and then sat on it. The music at the end sounds like a dog and a cat ran across the keyboard.

Story: OK, so there are 3 kids who go off into the woods to make a documentary about some witch or something. One of the kids gets lost or something. I don't really know what happens to him. So they spend some 3 days in the woods then they go to this house but then the one guy gets lost. The girl finds him like standing in a corner or something. What is he doing in the corner anyway? He's just standing there and the girl flips out and the camera lands on the ground. Wow....

Overall: I don't understand why people sometimes force themselves to watch bad movies. Most likely because they want to see if it's worth the 6-8 dollars they shelled out. In the case of the Blair Witch project: To stop watching this film should require as much strength and intelligence as breaking a potato chip. It's BAD. DO NOT WATCH IT. WATCH IT ONCE AND YOU WILL BE HAUNTED FOR LIFE BECAUSE OF HOW BAD IT IS!!!! How can a movie just be that bad? It's inhuman! Do not watch it if you value your eyes and ears.","1"
"Aaron1375","A camping trip gone bad!","8 November 2001","What happens when you send three student film makers into the woods to shoot a documentry about a witch? Well somehow they manage to get lost when the road can't be more than a mile away if that much. Perhaps, they should have taken some outdoor survival classes, because these clowns would probably get lost in someone's backyard. And guess what? We get to watch them complain, moan, and groan almost the entire movie and it is supposed to be scary. During all this they are been stalked by an unseen force or something, which is probably just someone camping who is sick of hearing them yell, scream, and cuss each other out. This force does scary things like shake the tent and make barely audible noises in the distance. It also makes arts and crafts and displays them...Oh how scary! Meanwhile, our ""woodsman"" keep walking around in circles like idiots instead of following the river which would have prevented them from going around in circles. This movie could have been really good. The beginning was alright where they interviewed those people and before they yelled at each other constantly, and the end was alright too. The middle, though, did not have enough in it. There should have been more hints at what might be out there. You don't have to show it so everyone knows what it is, but perhaps give peeks at something in the darkness. Hear noises that are a bit more distinct. This movie had potential, but wasted to much time showing the three argue.","4"
"Davo-CC","Simplicty, brillance, effectiveness - a deadly combination","3 November 2003","The Blair Witch Project is, in my humble opinion, a masterpiece of clever use of minimal resources, hype, selective leakage of information and superb disinformation that made a film that cost a pittance into a spectacular success. It did this not by trying to defy its humble origins but indeed it played on them in the most effective way; it used its amateur feel and low budget appearance to make it look all the more real and this was backed up by hyping people into believing that it was indeed real (at least for a time).

Even when they realised that they had been `duped' so to speak they were intrigued (as was I) to find how this had been done to so many people so effectively. The film came out very late in Australia (so we could cop the 2nd hand prints from the US) but I had purchased it on DVD from the US about two months before its theatrical release and had read a great deal about it and the hype surrounding it before even I saw it.

It was intriguing to note the trickle of broken information that made it even here, others had heard this or that about this new film and many even believed it to be real - the thing was everyone wanted to see it very badly.

Not everyone who saw it was effected by it - some didn't get it, some didn't like it, some weren't scared by it (one friend of mine borrowed the DVD and she watched it at midday with the lights all on and the windows open cuddled up with her border collie on the sofa; she deliberately tried to minimise the scare impact, I tend to show it with all the lights off and around midnight!).

Others had heard too much real information for the hype to have worked properly - but that's ok, I watched the film to see what they had tried to do and how they had tried to do it and I was enormously impressed by how someone took what they had and used simplicity and ingenuity to make something work so well.

This is a film that is special in many ways, like Orson Wells' radio play of `War of the Worlds' and even Ghostwatch (1992) on the BBC, this film can lull the viewer into a sense of what they are seeing is real and even if you know it isn't in the proper environment it can still send chills down one's spine and leave the shattered illusions in their mind for days afterwards. It works on a minimalist approach not widely seen for a long time and they do it very very well; indeed this was the first DVD I ever purchased and it is still one of my favourites.

Not only is it a different type of horror film - it's a different type of film all together (from almost everything else I've seen) and in this day and age of repetition that's quite an achievement.

It's a shame the sequel was just so bloody awful, it had none of the feeling or atmosphere of the original.","10"

"Piper-10","Clever cinematography; very clever marketing","3 September 1999","Okay, okay, so it's low-budget. Think about why (just for a second, though--the movie really isn't worth that much thought). Were these two cinema dilettantes millionaires? did they have slick access to millions? No. They had, what? Thirty grand. So they made a movie with what they had. To consider it a stroke of genius that they made something low-budget is to give the filmmakers too much respect; they did what they could with what they had. It was not a choice, but rather a necessity.

That aside, I would like to mention that although easily the most enticing part of the whole show, the pedestrian cinematography and is-it-real-or-is-it-not debate works as much against the movie as it does for it. I found myself picking the movie apart as it progressed, determining for myself the parts that showed it to be just a thirty-thousand pet project. Oh? Piles of stones? Hmmm...verdict? Cheesy! Of course this isn't real! But hey, she looks kinda scared...verdict? Cheesy! Who really swears that much when they really know what they want to say? Of course this movie's a fake! They're searching for their lines amidst massive quantities of vulgar expletives!

"Han-10","A new way in WITCH to see","8 August 1999","Ah, THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT.

A revolutionary film. It tells a story the way no film ever has. Presented as a edited version of found footage, the filmmakers successfully created reality cinema. Undoubtedly influenced (if even subconsciously) by ""Cops"" and the myriad other shows categorized as ""reality TV,"" BLAIR WITCH tells its story from a cameraman's perspective. In this case, the cameramen are more than just voyeurs; they are active participants in the unfolding action. We believe that they'd keep the cameras rolling to document their strange and terrifying predicament. We believe the characters are real as the superlative three actors never slip up and remind us that it's just a movie. We believe in the sounds coming from the woods, and we try to decipher them, to make sense of them. We do this in spite of the fact the most of us know through reading articles that it was just the film's producers making scary noises.

It's so easy to buy into THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT because it is a simulation of reality. No music, no cutaways, no special effects, no professional photography. No film conventions at all -- only ""home video"" conventions. It's a presentation of edited found footage left to us to determine what happened to this doomed threesome. Like it or not, BLAIR WITCH has introduced a new way to believe in the movies. And if you don't believe me, just ask someone from Burkittesville, MD.

We all know the plot. 3 campers get lost in the woods while making a documentary about the force that eventually kills them. With the minimal of money the makers, of this over-exposed movie, create a good deal of tension and raw excitement. Of course there are a few logic errors but I'm kind-hearted enough to see past that.

Although this film is shown on a 1.85:1 screen in the cinema the entire movie in is 1.33:1 because it is all shot on video. The photography may be jumpy but it didn't make me seasick like it did to some people. It is a little strange to film everything that is going on but if they didn't there would be no movie.

If Jaws made you feel afraid to go in the water The Blair Witch project will make afraid to go wandering in the woods.

And watching three people arguing over the fact that they are lost is very recognizable but after a while you start to think: oh for crying out loud pull yourself together!!. The only thing I liked was the last scene, but to sit trough the whole movie just for one scene, No I wouldn't recommend it, you'd better take a long walk through the woods by yourself at night and if you do, make sure to leave your camera at home...",NA

In Deliverance, Ned Beatty's character is physically sodomized.

In Blair Witch Project, we (the viewers) are monetarily and chronologically sodomized.","1"

However, the principals will get rich from it, which offers still further proof that life is not fair.

I don't care what critics have to say, but the story is so lame and pretentious that there is no ONE SCENE THAT WILL SCARE YOU. The plot is pretty straightforward but I'd say it was garbage!

Only Oren Peli could bring something good from this junk (Paranormal Activity). At least some scenes in that were scary. But, TBWP is not only slimy like what Josh had witnessed, it is also a gimmick, low- budget epic fail of the whole psychological genre. If you miss it, you probably will die a happy person!

"ONeill4797","A Chillingly Realistic Found Footage Movie","24 October 2019","What Blair Witch Project does so well, is create an unsettling, uncomfortable tone that lingers throughout the movie. There is a constant feeling of unease that takes place as soon as the three lead characters enter the woods.

The film does a great job of making a tale about witchcraft feel so realistic. This is primarily due to the incredibly believable performances of the cast, especially the main three, who we spent much of the runtime with. They always feel like real people, and their frustrations and fights with one another never feel forced but feel as if the oppressive atmosphere of the woods is influencing their actions.

The movie has an incredibly effective setup, with locals from the town telling stories of the Blair Witch legend. The fact that these stories feel like they're being told from the perspective of real people gives them a chilling quality.

The low quality, found-footage documentary style also adds to the grounded tone. It does not feel like a conventional movie due to the lack of a narrative structure or musical score. The occasional use of a 16mm black and white cameras is very effective in adding a chilling quality to the film, especially the daytime scenes in the woods.

The use of sounds in this film is incredible. A lot of this movie takes place at night with a blank black screen, where we can hear only distant noises. By not showing us anything, it allows the audience to imagine what is out there in the woods, which makes it even scarier. This also applies to the Blair Witch, who we never see throughout the movie at all. Our imagination is more terrifying than anything that could have been put on screen. Despite not appearing, her presence is felt throughout.

The final ten minutes of this movie is genuinely terrifying, with simple images such as children's handprints on the walls of the abandoned house in the woods, sticking with the viewer long after the film ends. And while it does end very abruptly, the final shot is very unsettling and gets under your skin.

While the sense of realism created by the filmmakers works so effectively throughout the movie, it also has its negatives. By creating such realistic and believable central characters, they become unremarkable and uninteresting with minimal characterisation. This is only a minor flaw, however in an otherwise excellent horror movie.","8"
"deanesposito","Slow burning masterpiece","14 November 2020","While it is pretty slow and not much happens

"survivor","Brilliantly contrived and utterly spooky","11 August 1999","In July of 1999, two aspiring filmmakers released a low-budget documentary-style horror film into theaters across North America. 87 minutes later, millions are afraid of the forest.

""The Blair Witch Project"" is supported by an absolutely ingenious concept: three college students set out to shoot a documentary on the Blair Witch, a local legend, and are never seen alive again. Well, not if you count the chilling peek the audience gets into their final days in the form of the footage shot by the filmmakers, as we watch with mounting suspense as they near their fates.

What is so frightening about ""The Blair Witch Project"" is not what we do see in the end but what we don't. So abstract are the final minutes of film that the imagination of the audience is forced to take over, and that is the stuff that sleepless nights are made of.

I can't guarantee that everyone will be scared or even amused by ""Blair,"" but I can tell you that I am not easily scared by a film, and this movie spooked me more than anything I have ever seen. I highly recommend it to people with an open mind and an appreciation for inventive filmmaking.",NA
"Thor-11","Yikes!","31 July 1999","Say what you will about this movie...for instance, say that watching shaky shots of leaves on the ground gave you that headache right behind your eye...but don't say it wasn't scary. That last image (you know the one I'm talking about) was burned into my brain for 24 hours after the film ended...brrrrr. Anyone who says this movie wasn't scary probably accidentally walked into ""Muppets from Space"" and only THOUGHT it was Blair Witch. Hmmm...maybe that's not so likely. Either way, see the movie, preferably on the small screen, definitely in the dark!",NA
"buffy-34","Creepy, so creepy","9 August 1999","This is not a horror movie about gore, despite the title it isn't even about the Blair Witch after their second day of filming. It's creepy because it deals with raw human emotion, paranoia that sets in after you can't take being scared anymore, people so afraid for their lives that the slightest crack of a twig sends the into a babbling rampage. This movie feels real, and that's why it's creepy.

I've read some comments here and I'm very surprised at other's ignorance. This movie is not supposed to be 35mm quality. It's supposed to look like 3 college students running through the woods with a camera turned on. Yes it's going to be shaky. It's supposed to look like a documentary, and it does. The scary part is not supposed to be the Blair Witch, so don't get disappointed when you don't see her. The movie is about the emotions and fears of the three students who desperately try to find there way out of the myriad of trees. Anyone who finds this movie dumb because it doesn't make you jump out of your seat, you don't get to see the Blair Witch, because it was shot on video, or just because you say it's dumb for these people to be running through the woods yelling for each other, I feel very sorry for you. Your ignorance has prevented your mind from realizing how truly creepy it is.

So much credit has to go to these actors. They all did such great jobs on conveying what it's really like to be scared to death. Their paranoia and hysteria added to the freakiness this film already had. I can only hope movie rolls come in quickly to these three. Hollywood could use a few more really talented people.

Finally, the last 10 minutes of the movie will forever be etched in my mind. Try going to sleep after seeing that. I know it took me forever just to be able to close my eyes last night!",NA
"cnreh","A waste of time and money","22 August 2002","This movie has the quality of a home video. It tries being special and fails. If you watch it in a cinema the only feeling you will have is sickness due to the uncontrolled movement of the camera. I was nearly bored to death and waited desperately for the film to end.

"jwb02","Funny, scary, really scary","31 July 1999","This movie was first funny. It was like a comedy for a good bit of the film. Then it was scary about midway through. And then, at the end, it was really scary. I was shocked, terrified, horrified, and every other word you can think of. At the end, my heart was pounding, and the hair on my arms was literally standing on end. I found out just how disturbing the film was, when I got home. I went upstairs to go to bed, and found myself leaving the hall light on that I usually turn off. Now I'm sure this is nothing you haven't heard already, but I would really like to recommend this wholeheartedly. Listen to the stories at the beginning, because you will not fully understand the film if you don't. If you do listen to the beginning, the ending will become clear, and horrify the f*** out of you! I give it a 10 out of 10.","7"
"Allen-31","A truly remarkable film","2 August 1999","Finally saw the movie after reading about it, hearing about it, and yes I knew it was fiction. It still sent my heart racing in several spots. I wouldn't call it the scariest movie I've ever seen, but it ranked higher than most. The tension was so raw, and the climax at the end was utterly convincing. Horror? Yes, but not the spoon-fed gimmicky horror of Scream or The Haunting.

I know there will be a lot of people who won't get it. People who haven't grown sick of Hollywood potty-training will not be able to appreciate something as inventive as this. Ironically, you could criticize the film for not having much of a plot and that the characters don't act logically. But the film perfectly emulates real life which isn't plotted and people frequently aren't logical under such stress. We can only make those criticisms because we are outside viewers. To enjoy this film, you have can't set yourself ""above"" it an expect to be entertained.

I saw the movie with a friend who found it plenty disturbing. His summary was ""the perfect example of how three inexperienced people who have NO business being in the woods in the first place royally screw themselves over."" I agree. I almost burst into tears along with the students when they encountered the log crossing they'd been at earlier in the day and realized they'd been going in circles. Witch legend or not, this should be a testament to anyone who wants to go jaunting off into the deep woods without any serious preparation or at least a local guide in an unfamiliar area.

As for whatever was stalking them, well that was the truly disturbing part. The ending was terrifying, and utterly confusing at the same time. Those who didn't like the ending well, the film said that these students disappeared and were never found. It didn't say that they died, although I'm certain that's what happened to them. People don't disappear and leave tidy explanations as to what happened to them. I found myself haunted by this film long after I left the theater, and I had anxiety dreams about it all night.

Bravo to Haxan Films. Maybe this will be a wake-up call to the Holly-hacks that have reduced the so-called ""horror genre"" to cheap scares, gore, CGI unbelievability, and gratuitous wise-cracks and laugh lines.","9"

Specially knowing that its real footage. And i never got scared befor in my life watching horror movie. But this movie i dont hv words. Watched it at 1:00 am in full volume. And yes it was real thriller and i scared little first time because of knowing its real.

This movie is stuck in my head cant get it out. Its real brilliance

And also i dont beleive on ratings, how could great horror movie of all time has only 6.4 rating because people who rate it doesn't like horror movie i think. So dont trust on rating.

"Phantasm01","Must be seen with your mind's eye","9 August 2006","To all of those folks out there that walked out of the theater wanting their money back because they didn't see a witch or blood or people being torn limb from limb, WAKE UP! In order for this movie to terrify you, you have to have an alert and productive mind. Remember Psycho? Did you actually see the lady in shower get stabbed? Did you see buckets of blood? Of course not but it scared you just the same.

The Blair Witch Project used the same tactics. Three people wander off to get film on a legend that they've heard. The town of Burketsville had an unusually high death rate of young children for a time. After interviwing some of the locals, the film crew decides to venture into the woods to find the shack that the so-called Blair Witch was using. The crew gets lost and has to spend the night in the woods where something appears to be following them. Trying to descibe this film any further than that just wouldn't be helpful to you at this time. It is a story that reveals itself in the visual, not just auditorially.

What could be scarier than being lost in the woods at night? The scariest things you can imagine are in your own mind. That's why kids are afraid of the dark. Their minds are young, fertile and active. They don't even know what they're afraid of, they just are. This film uses that same principle.

Our minds have become lazy from having everything being presented to it on a silver platter. No time to think, just keep feeding it images so it doesn't have to do any work on it's own! I don't think I've ever seen a more frightening movie and I've seen them all. I love horror and I'm always fascinated by the many different ways that Hollywood comes up with to scare us. Granted at this point, most horror these days is just is some madman running around slashing teenagers or weirdo cults worshipping Satan. No imagination. Get with it gang.

I'm not going to grade a film on degree of difficulty. I'm sure that ""Titanic"" was a very tough experience for the production crew. I don't care! It was a great movie because it had a great story and great characters and was really well put together. This movie didn't have any of those things.

The first time I saw this film I was watching it with a blanket up around my chin - and during the bit where 'something' was banging on their tent the blanket was in my mouth. My heart was beating like crazy. I was terrified! I was just thanking God that I didn't live near any woods.

Everything surrounding this film was fantastic - three unknown actors, shot documentary style, low budget, and the stories surfacing on the internet just made everyone believe what they were seeing, and therefore, be more scared. And it worked. By the time it got to the end, I just had to watch a not-so-scary film just to keep myself sane.",NA

This is THE scariest movie of them ALL! It starts slowly and thus fooling you to think it´s not so scary after all. Gradually it becomes more and more horrifying until you just can´t take it anymore! By the time the final shot comes and the movie releases you from it´s grasp you´re left with heart pounding, shocked to your core. The final shot keeps returning to your mind for days. It´s amazing how something so simple can be so overwhelmingly terrifying... How have they managed to come up with a movie this good with almost non-existent budget, unknown actors and simple script? The answer lies in many things, but most importantly in the actors and the style this movie was made. Together they create an experience which is totally convincing. Always before you could see the actors are faking it all and this and that was made by effects, film-editing etc. The documentary style guarantees the situations are portrayed realistically and all three actors seem like they aren´t acting at all, just as if they were really living it all. I would like to recommend an oscar for everybody responsible for this movie, it´s really that good and groundbreaking.","10"
"WilsonLau","What were they thinking?","3 November 1999","I don't understand why so many people liked this movie. This movie revolves arround 3 less then bright individuals that head out in the woods looking for the Blair Witch. First of all I'd like to say that a 15 year old can come up with a better storyline. So these three people go to the woods and basically through the entire movie they run arround and are confronted with the paralyzing fright of twigs! Its like watching three mice looking for the cheese at the end of a maze. If these three truly believe that there is an old hairy witch out to kill them wouldn't the obvious decision be to go after her? I mean there are 3 of you. Those are pretty good odds. Oh I forgot these three lack the intelligence of normal adults and so do anyone that enjoyed this joke of a movie.

"EvilEd","Great movie, but doesnt reinvent modern horror.","1 August 1999","SPOILER ALERT Not a bad movie at all, in fact its quite good, the only problem i had with it was that i wished they had shown some of the fake reaction footage that they had shot. They could have had it compiled before or after the film itself and explain the story in more detail. Instead, the only parts of the legend that we know is what the kids in the movie tell us. Seeing the footage of the parents putting up missing flyers and talking about the search, including where and how they found the footage, would've made it much more disturbing. I noticed that the people who thought it was real true enjoyed the movie much more, so don't go telling your friends that it is fake. There was some fairly good acting in it, unfortunately, the guy who plays mike isnt the best, and his facade falls through during the scene where he reveals what he did with the map. I wish the night scenes were longer, and a few of the jokes are obviously contrived, but still a great movie, just missing a beginning and an end.","9"

I suppose it's understandable that a certain amount of background information is necessary to get rolling on a movie like this, but be forewarned: you might find the first hour or so a little boring! (I certainly did...) That said, overall it's a damn good movie. The suspense building up to the ending is nothing short of intense. You are witness to the deterioration of these film students lost in the woods as they get more and more desperate to find their way back to civilization and an unknown presence that appears to be hunting them. The background information on the movie is fairly compelling, I saw a special on the Sci-Fi channel after I watched the movie that made it more interesting. It is very hard not to ultimately get drawn into this movie after the boring sections. You will be very surprised at the ending. You will also not want to be in the woods at night for a long time.

A movie that was complemented as a real video when it first was released, has got its average fans, and its got its haters. Me, I'm somewhere in the middle. The movie is nothing more then an independent success, and a true underdog movie story; but it just didn't go for me. Some value it as the scariest movie ever made, I don't think so. Sure it didn't have any music, and was recorded hand-free, like a real-life situation; but I didn't find that popular, and innovative scariness in this movie. It just felt like an ordinary horror. So, a ordinary horror; with bad screen work and no sound editing: its not a good movie, is it?

"somesunnyday","Nothing has ever come close to this","14 January 2008","As a world weary adult with a particular penchant for horror films, I've seen a lot of horror in my time. Of course being a horror fan means you're subjected to some of the most terrible attempts at film making ever put to celluloid and my estimate would calculate that probably 95% of horror is rubbish. However, as all you horror heads out there know, you put yourself through this to discover that 5% of gold that gets released so rarely.

The Blair Witch Project is a very welcome addition to that 5%. An ingenious idea well executed has produced one of the scariest experiences this 30 something year old has endured. Thanks to this film I am now officially scared of the dark and not ashamed to admit it.

The uneasiness began to creep in when the locals were telling their tales of the Blair Witch legend, particularly the crazy old lady with her ""fur"" story. The documentary style was maintained with absolute perfection and hats off to the film makers for showing discipline and sticking to their original idea throughout.

The woods are beautifully eerie, the soundtrack of indecipherable sounds, events that keep getting stranger and more terrifying as the film rolls on and the growing sense of desperation and hopelessness finally brings us to the perfect climax set in that run down house that is the stuff of my nightmares.

I truly don't believe I'll ever be able to re-create the real terror I felt at the first viewing of this film and now I'm doomed to walk the earth fruitlessly trying for the rest of my days.","10"

"Doogie-01","Thrilled I saw it","6 September 1999","Legally, I can't tell you that I saw this film in the woods - that would indicate (falsely, of course - ahem) that I had stumbled upon a bootleg CD copy.

If I HAD taken it to the woods on a camping trip, I would have expected to have been frightened. The running scene scared me a lot - I'll admit. The crying scene has been so horribly pillaged at this point that it did nothing for me. But overall, this didn't do for my blood pressure what I'd been looking for it to do for months.

The ending was awful. The video quality was shoddy, although this did add to the experience of the picture. The language led this viewer to believe that much of the dialogue was unscripted and unrehearsed. I'd give an 'A' in drama class, but the theater (or woods) experience gets a 'D.'

My dish: 4/10 but I couldn't have survived without seeing it. I'm glad I did.",NA
"joey-47","One of the scariest films I've ever seen","27 August 1999","What constitutes horror? Many people say it's blood and guts (Friday the 13th, Nightmare on Elm Street and so on). Others say it's movies that mess with your mind (The Shining,), and others will say it's how much a movie startles you and makes you jump to the ceiling (can't think of one off hand).

But real horror, is the type we cannot see. It's the type that we leave to our imagination because we know that there could be any number of possibilites, and some of those can be so horrific, it gives you chills just thinking about it. As is the case with The Blair Witch Project. I saw the film in a packed movie theater and I've never seen a film captivate a group of people this big the way it did. I'm talking about that everyone in the place was dead freakin' silent. My heart was up into my throat by the time the movie ended. I didn't jump, I didn't get grossed out, I just thought about the movie for hours after seeing it, and didn't sleep well at all that night. Any horror movie that scares the living daylights out of me the way The Blair Witch Project did, is an absolute 10 in my book. It's like not wanting to ride the rollercoaster, and then riding it and then saying you want to go on again.

Take dramamime before seeing it, or if not, just look away from the screen every so often because the herky-jerky home video style filming will make you a bit queasy. This movie deserves several mentions at the Academy Awards. If not, then chalk up another injustice in the film industry. If you happen to wait for home video to watch this, turn the lights off, and watch it by yourself. The full effect of this masterpiece will be felt all the more.","10"
"Nathanel","Inventive and original","2 August 1999","The Blair Witch Project had some pretty chilling moments. Some people in the theater were disappointed at the ending because the witch or whatever other horror was stalking the film students was never revealed. I thought the ending could have been a little better, but I liked the element of ambiguity and think that it adds to the terror of the movie. Being an avid woods man, I was annoyed with the stupidity of the students and how they handled their situation, but I guess it was necessary in order for the movie to work. Using the 16mm film added an incredible element of realism to the movie. This in my opinion was the movies strongest asset. The movie feels so believable that many people in the theater actually thought they were watching real, authentic footage. The Blair Witch Project was an interesting movie, and if one allows themselves to become one of the campers and accept what is happening on screen, the movie is pretty darn chilling.","6"

It is very long, very boring and has not a single scare. It has obnoxious characters screaming at either nothing or bundles of sticks. If they're not screaming, they're swearing, if they're not swearing, they're crying. This might have been a genuine scary experience for the actors, but it wasn't for me. I felt bored and irritated. I have a very good imagination, but this film did not inspire it at all. The only reason I watched to the end was to find out if anything justified the hype. But nothing did. I was just relieved that all the screams had been quenched. There are some films I am prepared to give a second chance to, but this isn't one of them.

"Pelrad","Blair is merely ""fair""","2 August 1999","I thought that ""The Blair Witch Project"" was overrated and not very scary. It is more about a bunch of incompetent university students swearing, yelling, and fighting than it was about a witch. While ""Patch Adams"" was much too polished a movie, this was much too raw. If they'd done a normal rather than documentary B-movie style and put in some more mature actors with cleaner dialogue who didn't spazz out every five minutes, it would have been much better.

Still, I liked the woods and the run-down house at the end.

"YellowTea","Minimalist Amateur Horror","3 February 2022","Basic premise, and one done very well with such a limited budget.

Where this movie succeeds is in creating a reliable build up of tension while maintaining mystery. You never actually see the witch, and for that reason it forces you to use your imagination (except for the sparse physical detail given here and there - hairy).

The actors were genuinely scared at many times according to the trivia, as the directors didn't tell them that they were filming and did their best to shake them up; this was a good tactic and paid dividends in the realism.

I at no point felt that I was watching a bunch of actors, which is a wondrous feat in and of itself. It really did feel like a ""found film"", except for it obviously being cobbled together and edited into a cohesive feature.

"sashank_kini-1","Such Experimentation, Such Capable Acting and Fine Editing, I'm Simply Baffled at the Hate for Blair Witch Project","24 August 2012","The most striking thing about The Blair Witch Project is that the ending strikes you two seconds later, when the end credits begin. For a moment, your mind reels back to the preceding events and you realize how terrific and terrifying the moment is. Paranormal Activity, released much later may have more jump scenes, but nothing in the movie, not even the spooky as hell climax is as intense as Blair Witch's last fifteen or so seconds. If you think I am going to say 'The ending is great but the rest isn't', you are incorrect. Comments such as 'The worst movie ever', 'I hated this film', 'Indie crap' are written as usual without much justification, and that some call the characters 'absolutely unlikeable' is a thing I find utterly baffling.

Three newcomers – one a Shakespearean actress (Heather Donahue), another an experienced independent director (Joshua Leonard) and the other a theater actor (Michael C. Williams) not just act but also film most of their scenes in an isolated forest area using a 16mm and handicam and not just that, the actors were not aware of what was to happen in the woods since the directors didn't tell them what would happen next in their scenes. In the director's commentary, one realizes how spontaneously the three amigos (not exactly 'amigos', just using it because it sounds sweet, sad and ironic) improvised their scenes in order to extract realistic performances. Donahue, who won the Razzie Award for Worst Actress for an act that should've clinched her a Golden Globe nomination, is believed to have modeled her character on a director with whom she had worked with. With such experimentation, such capable acting and such fine editing, I am simply astonished that the word 'worst' is attributed to The Blair Witch Project. 'Unlikable characters'? So if the characters were unlikable, then the reviewers should've loved the film since they 'got what they deserved' according to them – similar to the unlikable characters of Final Destination series. What is get from reading their reviews is plain contradiction – I think the moment they realized it was a shaky camera, they judged every other element superficially.

The plot is simple: Three student filmmakers begin making a documentary about the legend of the Blair Witch, and this leads them to the forest where the witch is believed to have existed. Things turn sour when they find stuff in the forest they aren't supposed to, which is ironic since these stuffs would've made their documentary even more credible. They realize that the Blair Witch is simply not a myth of the ignoramus past, and that this force would always work in a similar fashion: haunt at night, leave an after effect in the morning. They also have to maintain their sanity even when tensions and tempers are high. Shaky camera is probably the best aspect of Blair Witch Project. How close we are to the action, how much we anticipate like the actors about what's to happen, how much we are involved in the film because of this wonderful camera technique; it is something only a person who is ready to adjust to any film would understand. Remember Meryl Streep's line at the Oscars: 'When they called my name I had this feeling I could hear half of America going, ""oh, no!""', the same thing may apply to certain audience members when they sensed the shaky camera 'When they saw shaky camera, half of the audience members went 'Oh no!'. You have to look beyond that.

The camera work is crisp, highly engaging and very ingenious, even though the actors themselves didn't realize some of the best shot scenes by them were accidental. I never imagined Donahue's last message to her parents was an accidental stroke of greatness till I saw the director's commentary: Heather had thought the camera was recording her entire face while she shot the sequence. Also the interesting shot of Michael in one the bottom left corner of the screen while the rest of the frame is taken up by the tall, foreboding trees was accidental. Even the perfectly coordinated shot of Michael walking away at a distance while Donahue is talking to Joshua in front. Everything is raw, raging and unconventional.

Interviews with local townspeople are also very engaging, since some of the members were non-actors: Advice – don't miss the director's commentary if you have the DVD; you may find new love for the movie. Another advice: do not sleep during those things, considering them on trivial importance. Coming to the three main stars, Donahue is certainly the best, channeling so many emotions in the course of the film effortlessly. The scenes where she breaks down are absolutely powerful. Great support from the two guys, and again, you'll get to see 'Michael's Great Moment No 1,2' in the director's commentary. The DVD version does go for an overkill with the made for TV feature that seems silly and excessive – it reminded me of a silly animated movie we had made for a competition where we included dozens of additional attractions, including fake reviews for the film within the film.

I was in a full theatre to see this movie, and at the end, the audience was literally stunned to silence at how bad it was. I only heard one positive comment, and I think she thought she would be unfashionable if she didn't like the film.

"HBeachBabe","comments, pt. 2","23 August 1999","Having already posted one review which could be seen as being ""negative"" (although not as much as many of the reviews here) I have become rather resentful at those who not only praise the film (to each his own) but also offer their interpretation as to why the rest of don't like it - because it lacks special effects and relies on our imagination which therefore must be lacking.

As for the first, Sixth Sense was plenty scary without special effects. I can enjoy a non-effect movie as long as there is something compelling going on. Blair Witch was interesting but hardly compelling, and effects or not, there was *nothing* scary. Not a single solitary moment of the film caused me to jump in my seat, to look over my shoulder or to instill a fear in me that wasn't already there. Silence of the Lambs lacks special effects and except for a scene or two, doesn't have ""jump out at you"" scares yet is widely considered one of the scariest movies ever. Why? Because the audience is given just enough info to truly be frightened by the possibilities and the knowledge that something real is behind it all. Blair Witch gives some hints of things to be frightened of, but nothing to indicate that something truly malevolent is taking place.

As for the second. My imagination is fine. I'm a filmmaker myself. When I go to a film I go to become involved in the filmmaker's imagination. If the whole point of the film was simply to be scared by what I can imagine, why go to the movie? I can sit at home and imagine some pretty scary stuff without spending $4.50. ""Jaws"" left alot to the imagination but it also gave me enough to go on to fuel my imagination. Blair Witch gave me nothing. Not a hint, not a glimpse. For all I know, the whole thing was a practical joke played on them by Mike, the movie not only doesn't offer any explanations it doesn't even offer any clues (and yes I know what the ending was supposed to be and that was hardly enough to validate any explanation from aliens to a ticked-off hermit). I am left thinking that the filmmakers had nothing scary in mind... that it was their imagination that was lacking, not mine. That they couldn't think of something sufficiently scary to match the build up so instead of going for the big climax, they just end it and then say ""imagine something scary here"" That's not filmmaking genius, that's a cop-out. If Speilburg had *never* showed us the shark and instead left the possibility open that it wasn't a shark but perhaps a big p-o'd goldfish or maybe just a maniacal scuba diver or maybe (insert something you think is scary here) people would have been upset too. Movie scares require something concrete to scare me. There was nothing concrete in Blair Witch. The sticks & rocks set up a creepy atmosphere but are not scary by themselves.

I have no problem with a movie that doesn't draw a straight line for me, that doesn't make all the connections explicit (Eyes Wide Shut for instance which requires active thought on the part of viewer and was thus not understood by most people) but if I'm to be left to connect the dots myself, you'd better at least give me the dots.

If this film scared you, fine. But for me it didn't and the film's supporters attempts to explain why it didn't scare me (usually in an insulting manner) simply don't hold water.","4"
"Pierre_D","War of the Worlds for 1990s","25 July 2004","This film was excellently hyped. It is, in my mind, the same type of hype and drama that surrounded War of the Worlds so long ago.

The actors all played along so well, the film was amateurishly shot and you could feel a sense of claustrophobia surrounding it. After all, who hasn't been scared of being lost in the woods, even if it was with two friends? The campers go from carefree arrogance and fun to utter, total fear in a matter of hours of recounting.

The cabin, the symbols and dolls left outside were all quite eerie and the final chapter closes the movie abruptly and eerily. This and the Texas Chainsaw Massacre are the two movies that stopped me from sleeping for quite some time thereafter.

In hindsight, we know The Blair Witch Project was a cleverly executed hoax, but for its time and its effect, it achieved a great deal of attention.

"Marty L.","Hype Hurts a Decent But Unspectacular Film","25 July 1999","I applaud the unique, un-cliche-ridden approach that the filmmakers took with their ""Blair Witch Project"". It is very refreshing to see a horror film that doesn't breakdown into all the predictable and ridiculous situations (""Don't back into that dark room alone!!"") There is nothing particularly ORIGINAL about ""Blar Witch"", although it is an unusual approach and one that is rarely done, let alone done well.

However, the hype surrounding this movie leaves me baffled. For one, it really hurt to know certain details beforehand (these details have been crammed down our throats via TV and radio for a month or so, now). There are so few points in the movie where something creepy actually happens, that to know of them before the lights have even gone down strips them of any eeriness. But more than that, it created expectations for this film which were unrealistic. Is it a good film? Yes, if you can technically call it a ""film"". Is it a GREAT film? Not by a long shot.

The movie is more creepy to think about than it is scary to watch, and I don't regret seeing it. Just think twice before you join the mobs downtown who are waiting for hours to get in.","7"

But the plot and the film emptiness tell me another thing. This film is empty because the brain of this boys is empty too. They are the 90s Kings of minimalism cinema.

"sisyphus-8","One of the creepiest movies I've seen in a while","30 July 1999","The only real complaint I have about this movie is that there wasn't enough background. On the web site, in various specials, etc., an entire history of the Blair Witch is given that is left out of the movie. I think it would've helped if they built up the background story a little more.

That said, this isn't the scariest movie I've ever seen, but it ranks pretty high up there. And when I say ""scary,"" I mean that in the sense that a very tense, uneasy atmosphere is maintained throughout the whole film (well, once they get lost, at least). You know you're never going to see the ""monster"" like in most horror movies, but the mystery just adds to the chills. If you think movies like ""The Exorcist,"" ""Alien,"" or ""The Shining"" are good, you should like this. If you have no imagination, then this isn't for you.

In the words of H.P. Lovecraft, ""The oldest and strongest emotion of mankind is fear, and the oldest and strongest kind of fear is fear of the unknown."" The Blair Witch Project capitalizes on this.","7"

"jortegasa","Not great but still unnerving","29 May 2019","POSTED ON MAY 29, 2019 BY JORTEGASA78 POSTED IN MOVIE REVIEW TAGGED 1999, BLAIR WITCH, BLOG, DANIEL MYRICK, DOCUMENTARY, EDUARDO SANCHEZ, EVIL, FOLKLORE, HEATHER DONAHUE, HORROR, HORROR MOVIE, LORE, MOVIE, MOVIE OF THE DAY, MOVIE REVIEW, MYSTERY, WITCHES EDIT It was a bold movie that forever changed the way that movies were made. That's the line that we are often told about this movie and its mostly correct. It was somewhat bold, the idea of lost footage was not new, but it somehow caught the imagination of the public. It came out during a time when the genre of horror was starting to be reborn. The late 80's into the early 90's saw horror slip into one unforgettable trash movie after another. Then came Scream and everything changed. By the time this movie came around the public was ready for something new and they got it.

The movie honestly is not that great. It has a somewhat weak story that would make for a great book more then a great movie. Something is out in the forrest and a group of filmmakers go out to do a documentary about it. The acting is all around awful at times. We don't see much of anything and the ending left so many wanting more. And that I think is the key to this movie. It gave us just enough that left us hungry for more. We wanted it to be real. Sure it was not the first movie to have the idea, but it was a movie that tapped into the public's love for lore of the unknown. We knew that it was not real but what if.

I'm not sure if horror movies will ever go away. People love them and they make a lot of money for those in Hollywood. Scream night have awoken our current love of horror movies but it was in Blair Witch that it went from a killer with a knife to a force that you couldn't hide from.

So should you see this? Yes. At least once. It took me almost 20 years to watch it. Was it great? No but it was still creepy. I happen to love folklore and then ideas in this movie tapped beautifully into that idea that there are things we can not explain. Watch it and then go camping and tell me that it doesn't make you stay up all night.","8"

"jboothmillard","The Blair Witch Project","8 July 2005","This was marketed very well by the internet and word-of-mouth as ""found footage"", many people at first thought it was real, obviously this turned out to be untrue, it was a low-budget movie ($40,000) with no stars, no special effects and no gimmicks, but it proved a box office sensation. Basically in 1994, three student filmmakers, Heather Donahue, Joshua 'Josh' Leonard and Michael 'Mike' Williams (all using their own names) started a ""documentary"" interviewing the people of Burkittsville, Maryland, formerly named Blair, to hear their views and opinions of the local legend, of the ""Blair Witch"". They plan to travel to the woods and find evidence of the legend, they carry with them camping gear, a map and their video cameras. Soon after starting their trek however they get lost, they find themselves going around in circles, the map is lost, they hear strange noises in the dark, and in the daylight they find strange piles of rocks and wood symbols hanging in the trees. Josh is separated and disappears, Heather famously sobs (with lots of snot) about their impending doom, she and Mike realise that something is out there and tormenting or hunting them, and they both eventually meet their fate in a secluded and dilapidated house. All the footage and sound captured by the cameras was ""discovered"" in the woods a year later, this is what the viewer is watching. Away from the hype surrounding the film at the time, it proves that even the simplest of films, with improvised acting and action, shaky camera- work and no explicit material (you never see any monster), can become a cinema landmark. Cannibal Holocaust may have been the first ""found footage"" horror film, but this broke new ground, there would certainly be no Paranormal Activity or Cloverfield without this film, and it is genuinely freaky to watch, a terrific independent psychological horror. It was number 5 on The 100 Greatest Scary Moments. Very good!","8"

The camera work is horrible, and the story is confused and more or less unplanned. There is absolutely no horror in it until for maybe the last minute.

I am normally quite open to experimental film styles, and love to watch strange films.

"zainabnaqvi-69697","Best horror is the one left to imagination.","16 July 2021","The Blair Witch Project is an unconventionally good movie. Reason why so many hate it is because it's not exactly what's fed to us in this genre with haunted homes, bathtub scenes, exorcisms or occult. The film simply plays with your mind as it leaves the horror upto your imagination. That's what is special about this movie. What makes haunted creepy is the sheer imagination the mind conceives of it and you can't really put your finger on it. Just when fear is reduced to an evil physical entity it loses it charm ( like in the Conjuring 2 where an entity of the Nun with scary makeup haunts and even chases the lead). Physical manifestation of an evil being not only limits it's impact but also mars the aura of fear quotient. Nothing is left to the imagination. In the Blair witch project one never sees the witch or what really is behind the disappearances, there's no actual ending to the movie or the evil in it. But there's something in the woods and it's creepy and it stays there.",NA
"UncriticalThinker","Inventors of the Found Footage Horror","21 September 2023","I came into The Blair Witch Project without expecting much and came out of it quite satisfied; the film was everything I hoped it would be. Modern day internet horror has spoiled me and my taste for good scares and everyone has Blair Witch to thank for that. This movie started a new generation of horror movies, going from the 80's/90s slasher blockbuster to this new found footage format. But no movies that followed the trend really did Blair Witch any justice.

Now I want to explain what this film really is. It doesn't have jump scares, the antagonist isn't a monster or a typical Jason-Krueger-Predator slasher, we don't even see the 'supposed' witch or even anything supernatural, and it's horror relies on sound, disturbing visuals, the script, and the actor's performances to sell the situation. Everything that just so happens to absolutely make me defecate in my pants. This movie does everything perfectly and it's influence can be seen everywhere because of it.

This movie is criticized for it's low budget, short runtime, poor acting, and anti-climactic ending. I can't stress enough how wrong that idea is. This movie dared to be different and it pays off greatly. The acting isn't supposed to be dramatic, it's supposed to feel real, which it does astoundingly. The low budget contributes immensely to the fear of the unknown and conceals details that would otherwise make the film less mysterious and scary. It isn't a cryptic film either, it's plot is quite sensible, and it's length leaves you wanting more without boring the audience.

It never explains the events that unfold, it never shows you who's behind the curtain, nothing is explicitly supernatural or impossible, I could even believe it was real if it were on LiveLeak instead of theaters. This all makes The Blair Witch Project one of the greatest horror films ever. Revolutionary and effective in every way. Just watch it if you haven't already.","9"
"brainrippa","Unexpressable in words!","18 March 2000","Every year, there are one or two movies which I fall in love with, but in 1999 there was nothing like this until the end of November when BWP was released in Germany. This is definitely a masterpiece! It's fantastic, innovative and thrilling to the bone. The ending is one of the best ever. I was sitting in a nearly full theater and all the time there were jokes and comments on the film, but at the end you could hear a needle fall on the floor, it was total silence. Can't wait until it's available on video. 9.5/10","10"
"MagJ100","Not Scary at ALL","2 February 2023","I don't get the hype or the scare, I've tried to watch this twice it is so boring has no scare factor to me at all.

I don't like found footage films anyway. But not many films scare me anyway, not Jeepers creepers, not very many I will say silent Hill did a bit, the strangers definitely, but I just don't scare I guess.

I'll have to give this another try I watched it about 5 years ago, I'll rewatch it and then maybe I'll edit this one. I'm a horror buff I've watched thousands maybe I've gotten desensitized. It's my favorite genre horror, thriller, mystery, sci-fi, anything but romantic flick.","1"
"aaaa","Naysayers, get this for once..","4 September 1999","If you want to see a special effects horror movie like every other horror movie you've ever seen just because you're comfortable with the formula, there's a movie out called ""The Haunting."" Compare the two and enjoy.

First of all, let's straighten this out:

1. This is not a movie. It's a trip into your imagination. You don't watch ""actors"" and ""acting"" or monsters or gallons of blood. You immerse yourself into the environment. You pretend it's real, not because you have to, but because that's what any good movie does. It convinces you that this could happen in a given scenario, whether it be an action movie or a comedy.

2. See a doctor. If motion sickness bothers you that much, either you're either very feeble or couldn't handle even stepping into a Six Flags themepark anyway. In that case, why see a ""horror"" movie? Your personal problem has no bearing on the quality of a movie, just as my being thirsty because I didn't drink anything beforehand has no bearing on the movie.

3. You are, were, or will be a teenager. Teenagers act very much like this. They swear, they try to be entertaining, they rip each other's throats when their own personal ground is stepped on. If you aren't in highschool or college, at least imagine yourself to be. The same goes with any movie of a different age group, from ET to Message in a Bottle, you need to relate to the characters emotions based on your imagination, regardless of who you are. You are the characters. You see what they see. You go through all the trauma they go through.

4. The cameras have personalities. Remember the b&w camera is the 'documentary' camera, used for high quality shots. These scenes themselves are fine for an amatuer video. The color camera shown through most of the movie is the girl's own personal recording of the events. It's not supposed to be a convincing display of student filmmaking. It's her life as she sees it, and she can shake it, put it on the ground, and even p**s on it because it was never intended for you to see this. This is her personal footage and has no bearing over who sees it later in a theatre (looking from the character's point of view of course).

5. Forget the hype. Use your own personal judgement. Skip past the commercials if you can. Never expect anything better than your own imagination. Especially for this movie.

6. Forget the premise. The backstory that this is supposedly a true story is only meant to make clueless people wonder, which only makes the people who really know smile more. But don't expect yourself to fall for it. Just enjoy it. And remember you can look at the plot from either Mulder or Scully viewpoint. Mysticism or perverted human toying is up to you to decide. It can happen either way.

7. This is not a movie. It has no special effects. It has no top notch video camera with great angles and perfect lighting. It has no celebrities. This is not a Hollywood movie. You can rent plenty of Hollywood movies. This is a test of your thoughts and your emotions. So sit back and relax. And enjoy the dark for once.",NA
"pk19652001","Worse movie ever.","4 September 2011","Where do you begin. This is the worse movie i have viewed and on all levels. Just bad. Bad acting, bad camera work.

Like a college movie with a bunch of idiots go out into the Forest and make a stupid movie on purpose. The premise is good and thats about it. And enough with this modern day shaking camera syndrome. This isn't Saving Private Ryan. What happen to the days of steady camera work, even on the amateur level.

"nikolasttoner","THE Horror Movie","1 November 2022","First time watching this film and I'm pleasantly surprised. I've grown up hearing about it and I always thought it couldn't really be as creepy or impactful. Surely it was actually obviously fake. But I was wrong. The acting is so good and everything that happens and their reactions are realistic. It's not over the top but just right.

I would watch this once a year. I wanted a behind the scenes video after to get less scared but they don't exist because they were so dedicated to it being real.

If I was a movie seeing person at the time it came out I would have never left my house again. But alas. I have to leave my house.","7"
"sprogg-it","Shocking","2 December 2009","I probably would have appreciated this film a whole lot more if I had watched it before I watched Paranormal Activity, this is so poorly made in comparison. The scene at the end is the only bit that's even vaguely scary (and I scare easily, Coraline was pretty scary for me).

I think it would have been a whole lot more tense if I had more sympathy for the characters, but I just found them annoying, though this is more the result of a bad script than the actors fault, they did a pretty good job with what they were given. I think the real issue for me was that I just couldn't get into the story, I mean how can you get THAT lost when you have a map and compass. They walked for 15 hours and ended up where they started, how is that possible when you have a compass? They even decided to walk in a set direction, SOUTH, surely to end up in the same place there would have had to have been a point where they were looking at the compass and it was pointing NORTH usually a good indication your walking THE WRONG WAY.

I have two flat mates in their first semester of a media and broadcasting degree and in all honesty I've seen them produce more plausible, better edited material than this. For the last 20 minutes I couldn't wait for it to end.","1"
"azathothpwiggins","""I Want To Really Avoid Any Cheeeze!""...","7 September 2018","After many years, it was time to re-watch THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT.

First, for the two or three people who don't already know, THE STORY: Three college students- Heather Donahue, Joshua Leonard, and Michael Williams, take a trip into the deep woods of Maryland in search of the titular legend. Horror ensues.

THE EXECUTION: The preliminary / introductory footage is actually pretty good, including the interviews with the locals. Heather's narration is dramatic, but effective enough. Like all ""found footage"" films, the dilemma is how to make it appear realistic, and not like a phony documentary. To make it look as though the dialogue and the actions taken are NOT contrived.

Once the group settles into their journey through the woods, the interaction between the trio feels more ""natural"". They start finding various signs, symbols, etc., while agitation with each other and their situation sets in. When they decide to stop filming due to strange events, they have difficulty getting back out of the forest, and things grow more frenetic.

Not surprisingly, the scary stuff is reserved for nighttime, when the viewer's imagination can fill in any blanks. As they get more desperate, the question becomes, as with all similar movies, ""Why are they still filming?"". In a life or death struggle for survival, who the hell keeps the camera rolling? EXAMPLE: Heather screaming her head off while filming her yelling comrades. When more weird symbols are discovered, the group spends a terrifying night in and out of their tent. In utter chaos, running and screaming wildly, Heather, for reasons beyond all human understanding, films it all! Of course, this is explained by Heather's dedication to the project. Back in 1999 this was crazy talk. Today, with everyone glued to their smartphones, turning life itself into a video, it actually seems more believable.

THE FINALE: As the tension increases, and someone disappears, Heather keeps making her movie. Her big moment of screen-time terror comes into play, and the last roundup occurs.

THE VERDICT: This is a simple, enjoyable, supernatural yarn. When it was originally released, it was a victim of its own insane hype. Watching it now, having long forgotten most of the initial ads and ""audience reaction shots"", it's just a fairly frightening, low-budget horror movie. Not a total dud, but certainly nothing extraordinary...",NA
"Lone Wolf","The Blair Bitch Project!","30 May 2001","Boy... I don't know if I've ever seen so many mixed feelings towards a movie. Some people were so offended that they felt the need to post multiple comments here! If you have that many issues that you have to keep coming back and re-insulting this movie, then maybe it touched a nerve and you just don't want to admit it.

The Blair Witch Project is an experiment in fear. It gives the impression that three student filmmakers are going into the Maryland woods to film a documentary about a supposed witch that lived in the area many years ago. It is also insinuated that the witch influenced a serial killed in the '30s. Unfortunately for our clueless heroes, they get REALLY lost in the woods and spend a couple of days just wandering around. They have a compass, so it seems that the Witch is somehow causing them to walk in circles. As the intrepid trio travel through the woods, they find little ""gifts"" left behind by the Witch... piles of stones, little men made of sticks, and a rather nasty bundle with a soft, chewy center. A particularly scary part features an attack on the group's tent. Later, one of them vanishes in the night. The remaining two students finally end up at the house of the 30's serial killer...

No spoilers. You'll have to see what happens for yourself.

I'm not pretending that this is a major Hollywood release... less than $50,000 was spent on equipment and production. But this isn't meant to be high-budget. The movie looks exactly like it's supposed to... a student film that was edited together by people who found the ""lost"" footage after the students ""disappeared"". (I did think it was funny that some people thought this was real... the hype on the Sci Fi channel was great - it took quite a bit of convincing, plus video footage of the three actors alive and well on MTV, to show that they were still alive!)

I think some people are angry at this film because they were expecting the next Exorcist or Poltergeist. Unless you're blind, it's blatantly obvious from the previews that the movie is shot with shaky cameras in a very ""real"" environment. If you came to this movie expecting something else, then you deserve to lose your $7.50.

Also, I think people were really p***ed that they didn't get to see the Witch. In this age of CGI monstrosities and special effect-packed blockbusters, many movie-goers expect to see the monster all the time. If that's what you want, go rent The Haunting remake or Godzilla. I'd wager these same people would get upset at the original Haunting for not showing the ghosts.

Maybe some of the people who hate this movie really WERE scared and it bothered them so much that they decided to pan the flick. Either way, I think it's worth giving this movie a chance... don't take it too seriously, though... it's a much better ride if you sit back and try to watch it with an open mind. Be prepared, because the ""action"" doesn't really kick in until halfway into the movie, and there isn't a whole lot of it. This is more of a suspense movie, not a slasher flick or an action horror movie.

"heywood100","Truly Terrible","27 April 2003","Everything you've read is true - The Blair Witch Project is horrifying, is terror inducing, will chill you to the bone. For the last two minutes of its 90 minute running time. These last moments are shot at breakneck speed, with little dialogue and the green glow that comes from using a video camera at night. If this part of the film was made into a five minute short it would be looking at an eight or nine out of ten. As it is, the rest of the film is so mind-numbingly awful that it's one of the few films I've given a one.

This is not because of the cheapness of the film - cheap was the only real option for a film of this type, and picture quality should have no bearing on how good a film is. It's not because of the basic story - which is actually quite a good idea for a film. No, what really does The Blair Witch Project in is the terrible execution and annoying acting. During the day the three leads wander around a forest shouting at each other. At night they hear a tiny little sound then run around in the darkness screaming. And I'm talking complete and utter darkness. All there is consists of darkness and screaming. It's boring and not scary at all. And it goes on like this.

Do not, under any circumstances, pay to watch this film. Wait until it's next on television and just watch the last few minutes. It's for your own good. Because not everything you've read is true - there will be no screaming in the aisles; only from the speakers. For what will seem like an eternity.","1"

Be warned if you are of little imagination or don't like to use your brain very much then this movie won't be for you. For those who dislike this movie they can still go watch Friday the 13th part 26.

This movie rocked because it made you think. There wasn't anything in this movie that wasn't plausible, that's the true appeal of this movie I think. It's very easy to imagine camping in a dark wood and not truly knowing what is out there. Seriously this movie was able to chill you using sticks and stones. There wasn't a need for a few gallons of fake blood, a cheesy soundtrack and an axe.

I found myself dreading whenever night came. I truly felt for the people in this movie and wouldn't have exchanged places with them for anything. The ending was great and if you think back you truly still don't know what happened and you can actually hypothesize on different possibilities.","10"
"eboley99-984-39724","Popular opinion be damned, this is one of the scariest movies of all time.","16 May 2014","I was 8 years old when I first caught a glimpse of this movie. My older sister and her friends were watching it in the living room on Halloween night. I didn't know what the story was, but just the sounds, images, and EXTREMELY convincing acting was enough to make my hair stand up on end. A few years later I watched it for the first time and had trouble falling asleep for about 2 weeks after wards, and I definitely didn't wanna go camping!

So many friends have asked me why I think it's scary. I always hear ""It doesn't show us anything!"" ""You never even see the witch!"" Well... they just answered their own question. You never see the witch, or anything for that matter. Everything is left to your imagination. You don't know whether or not these kids are really being haunted by something, or if they're all simply losing their minds. That is real suspense. You can't re-create that feeling with bloody makeup and monster masks. The other huge factor that went into my fear for this movie was the marketing. As a kid, I genuinely believed it was real ""footage"" that was found in the woods. The actors are so convincing in their roles that it sucks you right in.

Everyone is going to have their opinion. Some people have certain standards for their horror films, and The Blair Witch Project might not meet some of those standards. Personally, I can't think of another film that has ever evoked that much raw fear out of me. Even now that I know it's just a movie with actors, writers, and directors. It still creeps me out to my inner core.","10"
"randyk","Good try... but not quite.","22 July 1999","I'll admit. Horror movies are not my thing in general. Growing up I cut my teeth on H.P. Lovecraft and early Stephen King stories, and the terror those writers could induce far outweighed virtually everything I ever could see in a film.

This movie was actually an excellent effort for first time film makers. I think that the acting was well done, and the basic idea was good (others here have given examples showing it's hardly a new idea, however). This was hardly a terrifying movie, though. Creepy? Sure. Spooky? You bet. Good movie making? Perhaps. Out and out scary? Sorry. I've spent a lot of time camping in some very out of the way places in the Appalachians, and I've seen some, to put it frankly, some ""whacked out s**t"" there. This movie speaks to those memes and gave me some chills, and in that regard, it worked.

Never before have I experienced a movie like this, I would recommend anyone to go see it. It is a new and inventive approach to movie making and very interesting.",NA

""The Blair Witch Project"" (1999) was a movie that started ""found footage"" genre way back in 1999. I remember watching this movie like 3 times upon its release on VHS, and every single time i was terrified of it. Many good and bad thing were said about this movie, so i won't repeat it, this is a great horror movie (skip negative reviews), which in a best horror movie traditions doesn't show you evil things (or does it?), but plays with viewers imagination with images, with sounds, with mood.

Overall, ""The Blair Witch Project"" is a true horror classic, which by this day is probably seen by everybody who loves this genre. Really looking forward to see this new sequel and will probably revisit this legendary movie one more time. Great movie.","9"
"vengeance20","Plain as drywall","15 August 2016","Really don't get the hype with this film, I really don't. There's simply nothing great about it yet it's extremely overrated!

To start, the biggest & main issue is... NOTHING & I mean NOTHING happens in this film! You don't see anything aside from 3 teens screaming, shouting & swearing at one another throughout the 85 minutes of this film! There's no entity you can actually SEE, because apparently of this film was to have an ""unseen"" entity or ""force"" tormenting the 3 teens!

I understand the scary idea of something you can't see or touch must be scary in real life, to just imagine it alone is scary but for it to be translated into a film for an audience behind a camera is boring! I want to SEE something not IMAGINE where's the use in that when you can easily say that ghosts don't exist? Hell you'd be better off watching an episode of Most Haunted with Yvette Fielding screaming & shouting at everything while here team also swear & curse at nothing it's that boring! That's this film in a nutshell!

Film's are meant to be entertaining & the idea for this film fails to attempt to have an unseen force chasing them, we don't see anything so what on earth is the point? I just simply don't get how that can be scary considering your watching this in the comfort of your own home/cinema! It just doesn't work unless it were a real life situation! Where then it WOULD be scary & worth bragging about on the net! This film doesn't cut it & is watered down enough as it is with the shaking cam, annoying dialogue, weak story line, thin plot, Jesus need I go on!?

The ending well... was crap, funnily enough better then the 85 minutes that was wasted! It was at this point, too little too late & only a 1 second bit of SOMETHING happening in the entire film! Just bad! REALLY bad!

A sequel titled Book of Shadows was released in 2000 a year later & by Christ is way way WAY better than this weak piece of trash! 1/10, ignore this film & watch Book of Shadows that has action, blood, gore & something ACTUALLY happening unlike this pathetic excuse of a film!","1"
"MJ1852","Scariest movie ever!!!","31 July 1999","Yes, this was definitely the most terrifying film I have ever seen. I had not even heard of it until my friends asked me to go last night (it was just released this weekend where I live). But now it's hard to stop thinking about it. The idea was brilliant and very original, and I love the fact that they could be so successful with such a low-budget film. I think that slasher movies like Halloween and Scream are scary, but they're different because you KNOW what it is you're afraid of. You sit on the edge of your seat while you wait for Michael Myers or some other guy in a mask w/ a knife to jump out of a dark shadow . . . but in BWP you just hear eerie noises and the thought that the three students can't find their way out of the woods, can't make their way to safety, creeps you out more than the slasher movies. The suspense, the anticipation of the unknown is the terrifying part about this movie. Although the jerkiness of the cameras gave me a little motion sickness, that was effective as well because it seemed more like you were really there than just watching a movie in a theater. I didn't know while I was watching it if it was real or not, but it didn't matter; it was scary either way. I felt for the characters: felt hopelessness, sympathy, terror, and even sadness for the way they were losing their minds and scared out of their wits. I'll admit that I was glad to find out it WASN'T real, but the movie was a real work of art. 10/10.

I'd also like to say, for anyone who implies that whoever thinks this movie is scary is stupid, you are being very closed-minded. It's okay to have your opinions, to say YOU weren't scared and you didn't like the idea for BWP, but obviously a lot of people WERE scared and DID think it was a good idea, so let others have their opinions too w/o bashing them.",NA
"PolybiusReviews","Something Unique!","26 December 2017","Is this movie scary? To be honest, no it isn't, not really. Does this mean the film is bad? No, quite the contrary really, the film is very good. It isn't typical horror by any means and it does take great risk in doing something new. But this attempt proved to be quiet effective.

Perhaps this film might have been more scary in the movie theaters but watching it at home creates a difficult environment to become scared in. There were never any moments that made me even the slightest bit startled, the film played more onto the realistic factor of horror, things that make you uncomfortable and nervous.

The acting in this film is outstanding, some of the best I've seen in a while, never stale, never artificial. I think that's what makes this movie so great. The ending could have had a bit more complexity to it but it does work out in the end.

Even though this film is not the newest addition to the horror collection of films out there I would say that it is indeed worth a watch.","10"
"Mendo","City Slickers","20 August 1999","For the first time in my life, I felt like a New Englander. While watching the students stroll around the woods, I couldn't really feel for them. First of all, they have all of these lights but they won't walk at night. I have been lost in the woods, and when you want to get home, you fight sleep and work to find your way. Also, whenever I am walking and am arguing with someone, I tend to walk faster; I don't stop, sit and pout like these babies did. Their constant stopping and camping seemed like the horror film cliche of the girl running upstairs rather than out the door.

This isn't to say that I didn't like the movie, it was OK (thanks to a great ending). And despite my complaints, Blair Witch deserved the hype and box office gross because it was something new. Unfortunately, knowing Hollywood, rather than seeing this as a desire for fresh, original ideas, they will decide that what we want to see is Blair Witch sequels.",NA
"emilhagberg-84632","One of the worst movies ever made!","6 December 2022","I've been a huge horror fan for over two decades now and I still just can't get enough of horror! I think I was 11 or 12 when I got to watch my first horror movie and it was the 1978 John Carpenter classic Halloween. Back then I mainly watched slashers and an occasional splatter. These days I enjoy watching all kinds of horror movies, even if the ""found footage"" subgenre isn't one of my favorites (but I do like a few of those as well).

Me and my family use to celebrate Halloween by put out decorations, wear costumes, eat candy and of course watch some horror films. In the year 2000 we decided to rent a couple of movies on VHS. One of them was The Blair Witch Project, which none of us had even heard of before. But it said on the cover it was one of the scariest movies ever made so we decided to give it a chance. So we got home and watched Blair Witch Project that night. My first thought was ""Is this a documentary? Wasn't this supposed to be a horror movie?"" To be noticed, I had no idea what found footage was back then.

We did watch the whole movie and when the end credits started rolling, I said: ""What the hell was that?!"" We started talking about the movie we'd just watched and not one of us understood what was supposed to be scary about this movie.

Now it's been over 20 years since I watched this movie and the other day I decided to give it a second chance since I've learned to appreciate the found footage genre. The fact is, I still can't understand what's supposed to be scary in this movie! Here in Sweden, there's an old kid's TV show from the 70's called Vilse i pannkakan (""Lost in the pancake"" in English) which is considered to have destroyed a whole generation because one of the characters was too scary - even the parts of that show with that character is way more scary than this movie even allows itself to be, and I don't even think that show is scary!

I don't even consider The Blair Witch Project being a horror movie whatsoever! This is just cringe! I think this movie deserves to be considered a high rank on the list of the worst movies ever made!","1"
"TrickyTheHorrorFreak","A unique study in terror that requires a little something from the viewer.","18 September 2006","I really wanted to love ""The Blair Witch Project"" when I went to see it at the cinemas. I'd read the Internet hype after it came out in the U.S. back when not everyone realized it was fake. The reviews called it ""the scariest movie since the Exorcist!"" and stories of people screaming and crying in the cinemas really brought my expectations up to an unattainable height. I'd talked it up to myself as well as to friends and colleagues, telling them all that they had to go see it when it came out. But by the time it actually hit our shores (I'm an Aussie), everyone had been made aware that it was fake and all the magic of early reports had been replaced by negativity and mocking. But I lined up, paid my cash and went in to find out what it was all about.

I must admit, that first sitting was the epitome of disappointment. The camera jumped all over the place and made me feel frustrated and a tad ill. The constant fighting of the characters got on my nerves more than a reality TV show. But the worst part of it was that I didn't find it at all to be scary. Here was this so-called holy grail of scary movies and people were actually laughing in the cinema rather than screaming. I walked out feeling completely let down after months of looking forward to the event.

A couple of years later I decided to watch the movie on DVD. I picked a cold, dark night, turned all the lights out, took the phone off the hook and sat down on the couch. I'd made the decision that I was going to watch ""The Blair Witch Project"" the way the first viewers had seen it. Forgetting everything I'd ever heard about it, I would delve into it with a clean slate. I'm really glad I did! While I didn't completely freak out and lose my lunch in fear, I certainly found a new appreciation for it. In fact, if the viewer simply allows themselves to become involved in the situation on screen, it can become quite psychologically jarring. I really believe one of the reasons that so many hated the film, myself included, was due to both expectations and an inability to actually put themselves in the place of the actors. To actually experience the movie! It certainly didn't help that the audience I saw it with was laughing. If you can take that step, then ""The Blair Witch Project"" is a very effective and clever film. So the question is, is it OK to ask the audience to commit so much of themselves to a film for them to be able to have an emotional reaction (other than boredom). The more I think about it, the more I think the answer is yes. The problem has been created over an extended period of time, with more and more blockbuster movies that require nothing of the audience whatsoever. No thought, no belief, no experiencenothing! That being the case, when a movie such as this one comes around, it's understandable that people may just find it boring as they have lost the ability to actually ""experience"" it or in some cases, simply choose not to let themselves.

No, I haven't done a complete turn around and gone from a Blair Witch basher to a Blair Witch lover. It's not a perfect film by any stretch of the imagination. The epileptic camera movements still make it hard to watch, the inability to hear what's going on in the forest and some of the bickering still gets on my nerves. But I must admit it all makes it far more realistic and it's all very intentional to get the desired effect. The acting is actually pretty damn good. The fact is that in all likeliness, normal people would fight and cry and scream and carry on exactly the same way these guys do. There are moments of absolute terror in their voices and sheer emotion on their faces which is a credit to the actors. I can't say there's anything I could suggest they should have done differently that would make it any more realistic than it is and for that reason alone I consider the movie to be a success. It is a movie to be experienced alone in the dark though. Nothing else would do it justice.","7"
"hillalbens","A masterpiece. The whole movie is as you would've found it if they truly went missing","2 August 2019","A masterpiece, to put it simply, and one of the most influential and iconic horror movies of all time. It's a disturbing film without any violence or any monsters.

The naturalism of the actors is unrivaled. It's impossible to overstate how compelling each performance is. Our main character is a joy to behold in every scene, with the perfect tone and expression to accompany every word of dialog. Every minute she wasn't in frame speaking into the camera was a minute I wished she were. I could not imagine a better performance.

The recurring sense of ""dread"" as each night falls, and the slow escalation of the threat, followed by the sudden release of tension at dawn, puts the viewer through an ordeal that you share with the characters. The film perfectly captures the feeling of being lost in the woods. The panic, the anxiety, and how easy it is to get turned around. On one of the final nights as the sun is setting, you can hear the desperation in Heather's voice as they know what's coming and are powerless to stop it.

There couldn't have been a better ending. It's the stuff you don't see that makes this film so scary. Your own imagination is always more terrifying than anything on screen.

The movie had perfect timing and excellent marketing. Came out when the internet was still the Wild Wild West. It was pretty difficult to prove or disprove anything quickly and search engines were still pretty primitive. The studio took advantage of this and as a result the movie had a lot of buildup. I dont' think anyone will ever be able to recreate that type of marketing again. If you tried that today you would have blog posts, articles, videos, tweets, tearing every aspect apart.","10"
"eshaines_zuke","Fifteen Years Later: Not Terrible for a 60K Budget","5 June 2014","I'm not sure what it is about this film that makes it interesting. By all accounts, it should be quite dull: much of it is shot in motion or out of focus by hand-held cameras, the dialogue is petty and tedious, there's an absence of sexual tension between the main characters, and much of what is feared throughout the film, while eerie, is merely suggestive of horror. Perhaps I am spoiled by modern day horror and suspense films, which are less understated, follow an explicit plot, and don't leave me wanting in terms of visual access. The ""agenda"" of this film is still fear —we are to believe that even after one or two centuries, the so-called ""Blair Witch"" still lives in those woods and is still out to kill, as evidenced by the eerie ending.

An obscurity that doesn't ever quite seem resolved for me, and there is more than one, is what one man at the beginning of the ""documentary"" tells the filmmakers: that a man was found guilty of killing some children and confessed to the crime—are we to think that the witch possessed this killer? Or were these unrelated crimes that just happened to be occurring in the same geographical area?

It also seems to me that all of the folklore and mythology surrounding the Blair Witch deaths pertain to attacks on children—with the one exception of the men tortured on that rock whose bodies later mysteriously disappear—why would the witch go after children for so many years but then in the modern day attack these three grown adults? It is a possible statement that these three filmmakers were so consumed by naiveté and child-like curiosity for the macabre, or a rather dumb, stop-at-nothing passion for art, that they were mistaken for children by the witch, or at least considered to be one in the same. Because really, what thinking, rational adult would so discredit a history of serial killings—just for the reason that its roots were non- scientifically explained—to put themselves in what would potentially be harm's way? Aren't there a million other things to explore and about which to write and direct films? Ridiculous.

This is the second time I've seen this film, the first time being early in high school, for me about thirteen or fourteen years ago. I watched it the first time at night, at a friend's house, and when the movie was over and I had nearly peed myself in fear, never having seen any movie quite like it, she insisted we go to the local woodsy lake area to light some fireworks—naturally I was petrified, tried to convince everyone it was a bad idea, but ended up ignored, and went. That was the first night I forced myself, for my own sanity, to make a distinction between film-based fear projected onto reality, and reality itself. Why would a witch come out of the woods in the middle of Dallas, TX, where I was at the time, when the witch in this film haunts a forest in Maryland, I asked myself. And so I found my firmer footing. It is only now, thirteen years later, in revisiting the movie to see if I still found it as scary, that I have decided to reevaluate it.

I guess I could've done without the foul-mouthed protagonist—why on earth would I empathize with this woman who doesn't know how to speak without dropping an 'f-bomb' every other word? Not that I have a big problem with cursing to convey a certain amount of anger or frustration—but to hear it constantly, it was as if she were beating me over the head with it. Her male counterparts were far better behaved and easier to stomach as characters.

I think that what works about the film is the gradual decay in the lead characters' morale. They begin their adventure peppy, excited, naive, almost cocky—and by the end of the film disintegrate into panic, rage, fear, cynicism, and desperation. I still get a kick out of seeing that extreme close-up of the leading lady in her beanie, only half of her face visible, welling up with tears, whispering: ""I'm afraid to close my eyes, I'm afraid to open them...."" I think it's the first time in the movie one can really feel the film's trademark desperation and isolation these characters must have been internalizing as their project progressed.

The movie's not perfect; there are some things I would've done differently: fewer, but more focused, less scattered interviews with locals (when in doubt, simplify, don't obscure your characters' motivations), interspersing steady cam shots with the hand-held, blurry ones—purely for palatability to the audience (you are trying to achieve the effect of a realistic out-in-the- woods experience, but isn't filmmaking just as much about satisfying an audience as pleasing the filmmaker?); some more clues as to what happened to Josh; and maybe, if the steady cam shots were included, when Mike drops the camera at the end, there would be a way to show the climax of the film without the girl having to pick up the camera herself and film—it is simply not believable that, in this state of panic, after having formally apologized to her and her colleagues' parents for her stubborn will to make this film, she would still want to film what was at that point a very desperate and unpleasant situation. For a budget of $60,000, I think they did a great job, though.

Needless to say, I still won't be going on a hike in the unpaved, unmarked woods any time soon. In that regard, hats off to the writers and directors of this movie. Fifteen years later, and it still has that effect!","7"
"myrkeyjones","A True classic of psychological horror","9 March 2007","Out of every horror film ever made, nothing has dug itself into my personal fears, to such and extent, as The Blair Witch Project. upon my first viewing i was aware that this documentary style horror film was entirely fiction, yet that didn't stop me from being genuinely frightened. It is a criminally underrated film, often critically snapped for being a giant cheap gimmick or scare tactic, also, the rather grim, terrifying and unrevealing conclusion left some disappointed. Yet having the mystery unrevealed is what makes this titles so compelling, what is hunting down these characters and why, what form does the presence take, what is the meaning of all these signs, rocks and symbols, it is this confusion that creates the claustrophobia and fear. that feeling of impending doom is maintained throughout the piece. The amateur actors are simply fantastic, applying Stanislavski method acting techniques to give their performances vivid realism. This film really has to be seen to be believed, just don't expect a blood bath, or an all out scare fest, this one is a pressure cooker of suspense, tension and claustrophobia, its a slow builder and requires a patient viewer.

"MissSimonetta","Scarier than more elaborate horror spectacles","31 October 2022","Stories of the supernatural operate best within trappings of the mundane. After all, what makes the supernatural unnerving is how it deviates from normal reality. The best supernatural horror movies get this and that's why I cannot dismiss THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT as many have been eager to do in the years since it made a sensation in 1999.

The film actually resembles amateur footage and the imperfections of the presentation sell a sense of shaggy reality unlike later, slicker found footage movies. You can feel the cold and damp of the woods, and the fatigue of the characters as they lose their way. This loss of direction is an obvious, relatable source of terror anyone can relate to, so when the supernatural starts rearing its ugly head, the atmosphere quickly turns uncanny.

It's easy to mock this film-- to joke that it's big scary moments involve piles of rocks and a man standing in the corner-- but it does get under your skin. About the only issue I have with it is that maybe this would have been a better short film than a feature. But still, this is a fascinating, simple little horror story, seemingly quaint in the wake of bigger, more spectacular horror films that aren't half as chilling.","9"
"fernandoschiavi","The film is made almost entirely without resources. It is the result of an idea well conceived and developed with a creativity rarely seen and not so common in Hollywood","13 November 2021","If we talk about an innovative idea and profitable, we can speak of The Blair Witch Project. A film that still causes arguments, controversies, mainly curiosity and fear in those who watch it. The two directors, American Daniel Myrick and Cuban Eduardo Sanchez, practically in their debuts in the cinema produced the film with only $40 thousand dollars and had the highest cost-effective as possible for a film, grossing over $240 million globally, and U. S. $ 140 million in the U. S. alone. No doubt this is and I think always will be the most cost-effective for a film in cinema history.

At the time the film was released in 1999, the internet was still far from being as it is today. It was still very dark and that the world was surrounded by uncertainty about where sources of information to trust and identify if certain facts were real. Often a rumor spread and it was taken for granted. And that's exactly what happened with The Blair Witch Project. The directors and the studio created something really innovative in a marketing propaganda never before seen over the internet by creating a website that promoted the whole story of the movie was real. Many people who watched the film at Sundance in 1999, just thought it was a documentary, and seeing the film were frightened by the images and the lack of information about the project, starting to think that the actors were actually killed. To the IMDB, the largest database of world cinema, announced the death of the actors on their website as being the day that the tape recordings was found in the movie, as said just at its beginning. Of course shortly after the error has been corrected.

From this information and the word of mouth caused by extraordinary who would see the film, which were clearly in doubt if the film was real or not, their popularity was unimaginable, especially among young people. Curious is the same as the production was held. The directors wanted the same fear and dread were genuine and direction method here is really innovative, more like a lesson in film school, with few resources and money and creativity to spare. Filmmakers invited three unknown actors who entered the project without knowing virtually nothing of the plot and what would happen to them, they only learned scene after scene. The three actors were left in the woods and they just GPS so they could be located and obviously the cameras. The actors had to spend a few days camping in the swamp, while being followed and submitted to the producer of the movie scares. When they arrived at locations determined by the team, received tickets to individual instructions and could not be shown to others, letting the actions of others realistic, even more all being hungry, sleep and physical and mental fatigue. Therefore, in many discussions of the actors, it was really happening by factors.

This method of shooting further increased the realism, the tension between the actors, which added to the editing done well (also made by the directors) in perfect weather and dry (86 minutes), are leaving the movie so terrifying. To improve everything, no other artifice, like blood, monsters and caused by sound effects, was used. The dialogue between the actors totally improvised are also critical for everything to work, so that naturally appear. The absence of sound, letting the sound of the forest without editing only enhances the idea of documentary realism and that many felt when first seeing the film.

The plot could not be simpler, showing three film students who traveled to the town of Burkittsville, in the state of Maryland, in order to film a documentary about a local legend - the existence of Blair Witch Project, responsible for disappearances and killings woods around the site in the last 200 years, especially in the 40s where several children appeared dead on the spot. Confident that everything was just a legend, the young show no signs of concern until a series of unfortunate coincidences causes them to be lost, and various noises in the forest indicating that they cannot completely alone. A year later, the footage they found and the film is actually an edited tape by the local police from the tapes left by students. The images recorded by the trio gave clues about what happened to the young.

The film is divided into parts. In the first, shown students coming near the forest where they will make a documentary. They meet after chatting and interviewing locals who live nearby forest where there is the legend of the witch. After a good first day, with many testimonials they leave with a map into the woods. The second half hour of the plot shows the students fican lost after losing the map, and start walking in circles and despair. And also begin to hear noises and voices in the night, leaving them terrified. In the last minute, they end up coming to a hut, where the final frightening events happen.

The idea that they are not alone in that forest, and the noise can be anything from another human being, or an animal of the forest, mainly and most likely, a witch who supposedly lives there on the spot. Everything is in the speculative field and many questions are on our minds, especially at the end. The clues point even if there really is a witch in place, the voices they hear mostly just noise and not being listened to three. But when they enter the cabin, the witch is really exists? What evidence we have, besides the voices screaming in the woods for help? Where Mike looked in the final moments of the film? Who dropped the camera and the students themselves? The end could not be better, since throughout its duration, is the question whether the witch really exists or not. In the end, the question is maintained and the ending was wisely left open.

The Blair Witch Project is slow, images taken with handheld cameras, always shaky. You do not have a single drop of blood the whole movie. The film cannot just be treated as a horror movie. He is also a documentary well done and a drama full of despair and conflict. One of the scenes that mix horror and drama is the poster for the film, which shows precisely this tense and dramatic moment is when Heather Donahue apologizes to the family of your friends by having them brought up there with her. A remarkable scene in cinema history.

The film is made almost entirely without resources and has no feature technical perfection. It is rather the result of an idea well-conceived and developed with a creativity rarely seen and not so common in Hollywood.","7"

"EdgarST","A Treat for Film Students","25 November 1999","There is nothing worse than watching a movie with film students. They not only complain about technical aspects, but they usually think of the way they would have shot the same script. For four years working at the Havana Film and Television School, I went through this, and I suppose I caught some of their ""disease."" The consequences of this ""film alphabetization"" came to the forum while watching ""The Blair Witch Project."" I remembered the students' approval of something good, as well as their loud reactions, their laughter and booing. At the same time I was questioning the film during the whole projection. This does not mean I did not find it an interesting film experience (I saw it in a theater, and I was the only customer). Quite the contrary: it is an original cinematic concept, an intelligent reflection on fear, and a good definition of horror as nothing but a state of mind, related to ignorance and darkness. However in too many occasions more than I can remember right now-- the situations were barely credible on technical and dramatic grounds: for example, would you believe someone lost in the woods (Heather) would keep on taping images while discovering that another person (Mike) has thrown their only connection to civilization --a map-- to the river? Well, Heather shouts at Mike like hell but she never stops gazing through the visor of her video camera! She is one of the most obnoxious characters ever to appear on a film (see during the first part, how she does not let her interviewees finish their sentences), not only for her bully ways but also for her obsessive recording of a ""documentary."" She is not a filmmaker; she is just a student working on a project, because of which her life is in danger. Before the resolution, there is a brief moment when Heather and Mike are alone in the darkness, inside the tent, when it seems improbable that the recorder would be registering sounds. And on top of that, we are not told that this is the edited and Dolby version of the found footage, a fact that predisposes the ""film alphabetized"" viewer to distance himself/herself from the film, and smile at the naïve opening title. But it is a remarkable film nonetheless, although the overrating affects the objective appreciation of the filmmakers' good work.","6"

Supremely tense, definitely, particularly in the scenes without light; and when reflecting on it afterwards the full impact of its chilling nature hit me more. It doesn't provide the shockfest that horror audiences want the most, though. However, I found it excellent as a psychological thriller. We get to watch as three ordinary people, complete with ordinary flaws that make them all the more believable, are exposed to extreme stress with inevitable consequences. Watching them break down, culminating in an incredible monologue by Heather, is a fascinating experience. The realism is also top notch; while others might decry the lack of any kind of polish, I reckon it's just that that makes it so intriguing. It could easily be real life that's being filmed, a premise aided by the very natural acting of the three main characters. Eerie, unsettling and very effective in its subtlety, this ranks as one of my favourite films and well worth watching.","10"

Okay, that said, I see no value in this film....but if folks out there ""like"" it...whatever...fine. But if you are gonna tell me that THIS actually SCARED you?....then I suggest you stay in your house for the rest of your life, cause crossing against the light on a DESERTED STREET is SCARIER than this junk. If yelling, out of control, CONSTANTLY SWEARING and telling each other to ""shut the camera"" THROUGHOUT the movie is for you, then God Bless. However, if you WANT to be spooked, I suggest checking out The St. Francisville Experiment for REAL CHILLS, and an attempt at a mock documentary of what it may actually be like investigating a REAL haunted house. (No the house aint really haunted, but the film is MUCH better) Did it borrow the idea from Blair Witch?...sure did...they even ask in the film if anyone seen ""BWP""...but so what...it not only borrowed the idea...it SURPASSED it....and please, for the love of God, do yourself a favor and see 'The Last Broadcast'...the film that BWP went to and ""borrowed"" from.","1"
"Tornado_Sam","The Power of Suggestion","8 January 2023","The found footage genre is one that I acknowledge to be largely underappreciated, especially after having seen this film. In many ways, creating something like this is far more realistic and works far better than anything Hollywood could come up with. Of course, I understand the jerky camerawork and the unpolished feel of the found footage film is not for everyone, but it can and does work particularly in the case of ""The Blair Witch Project"".

The film starts off like someone's home movie, which is basically what it is. What follows is what appears to be a very realistic story of three student filmmakers who go into a forest in Maryland to investigate the local Blair Witch legend, who overtime find themselves completely lost and by the end, desperate to escape. If you're used to seeing slasher films that are there purposefully to stay with you the rest of your life, this film won't deliver that but it will do something that is arguably better: scare by the power of suggestion. After the film ends, you know just enough to be able to imagine what really happened but not enough to spoil the possible speculation. Which is really what carries the film, as with no special effects whatsoever, there is no other plausible way to frighten the audience.

That aside, there are many other things that carry this film, most prominently the acting, which is brilliant. The film literally feels unscripted, with the interruption, carelessness, etc. Of real life dialogue. All of it really does help convey the hopelessness of being lost in the woods, and it really is as though you're watching a trio of filmmakers slowly losing it as they become more and more lost.

In conclusion, I can't call ""The Blair Witch Project"" a ""scary"" film per se, except by the power of suggestion. If you have a background on witchcraft and understand the implications of the found footage, this could absolutely be terrifying. I personally found it mildly frightening for a horror film and recommend it for its realism and suggestive qualities rather than its shock value. Definitely not a conventional horror film but a classic one nonetheless that holds up today despite not necessarily being a ""true"" horror.",NA
"moviewizguy","Unsettling and Tense","23 July 2008","Three film students travel to Maryland to make a student film about a local urban legend... The Blair Witch. The three went into the woods on a two day hike to find the Blair Witch, and never came back. One year later, the students film and video was found in the woods. The footage was compiled and made into a movie. The Blair Witch Project.

I finally saw this film since it came out in 1999 because I was waiting to buy the DVD for a cheap price. Well, I bought it after I saw ""Cloverfield,"" ""Diary of the Dead,"" and ""Rec."" Fortunately, that didn't ruin the film for me.

This film accomplishes a feat: It shows very little in the film, yet the film is quite scary! Like I said, very little is shown in the film. There is quite little violence and blood in the film and it's best to say everything in the film is left up to the audience's imagination, which I liked.

This film doesn't need creepy make-up effects for monster. It doesn't need violence and gore. It doesn't even need a scary soundtrack. It works the way it is. The performances by the three leads were fantastic and realistic.

Apart from it being a scary film and the true definition of a horror film, I thought the humor in the film was funny. You know, the jokes. This movie is like terror unfolding. It doesn't seem scary at first but the film slowly and expertly raises the tension and scares within each scene.

Overall, this is what I think horror films should be. It successfully scared me without showing me anything at all, which is pretty amazing, in my opinion. It doesn't need high quality special effects for some scares and it didn't need a big budget. This film is a must see if you like horror movies.","8"
"blazesnakes9","An Experiment in Terror.","4 February 2011","Opening in 1999, The Blair Witch Project became a hit with critics and audiences. In my point of view, The Blair Witch Project is the most smartest and most frightening movie of all of the horror movies. In October 1994, three students go in the Maryland woods to shoot a documentary about the Blair Witch. But, what they don't know is that the Blair Witch is stalking them. Though the movie is filmed completely on a hand-held camera, it does do a good job keeping track of the suspense. The Blair Witch Project also has a ultimate touch on reality and technology. In one of the scenes, one of the students say that reality isn't really real anyway when you see it. That is a very excellent set up of the whole picture. To create the illusion of suspense just by seeing a unknown object that is terrifying and intimidating. The end of the movie is probably the creepiest scene of all. With good acting from the students and good writing, The Blair Witch Project is a good-natured horror movie. Thumbs Up. ★★★★ 4 stars.","10"
"kirk.wagstaff","Brilliant","1 January 2001","I saw this film a year after it came out, I have lost the love for modern horror movies, since the actual emphasis nowadays is on gruesome deaths and limbs flying all over the place. I've heard all the hype, and came to the assumption that this was another hyped up cash-in. When I saw this going as an ex-rental in the local video store, I decided to give it a go.

That teaches you never to take advice from Internet Know-It-All's. With all the bad reviews, and hype, I ignored all the bad press and sat down to watch it as if it were a new, unknown film. Well well well, what a surprise. I really enjoyed it. Instead of OTT acting, this is what we would really see if we were in this position. Life-like acting. Very realistic. We see it from their point of view, from the camera. For once, I didn't see people getting slashed to bits, or have to watch a poor sex scene added for ratings. However, one criticism could be given, the amount of bad language. ""F this"", ""F that"", ""F you you F-ing F-er. I'll F-ing F you up you F-ing F."" However, this is exactly what X-Gen students are like, so it only adds to the realism.

The last film I saw which scared me was John Carpenters Prince Of Darkness, it scared me more then The Exorcist ever did (speaking of which, was a over-hyped piece of garbage). The Blair Witch Project brings back those childhood memories of haunting myths, and legends, to life thanks to three students with cameras, investigating into the uncovered legend of the Blair Witch. What they uncover is extraordinary - but believable. The amateur camerawork brings their tale to life. That is the fact which makes this so chilling. No super-imposed rubbish like in other supernatural movies. No monsters or unconvincing special effects. The horror is in the unseen, the unspeakable. In the last 45 minutes, what you witness will send your imagination wild. What exactly went on in the night? What is in the dark? Who is the Blair Witch?

Thanks to all the hype, which has shed light on the film, viewers are prevented from enjoying the full experience. The less you know, the better. Thankfully, the Internet Know-It-All's didn't spoil the fun for me. To those who criticise the film for being low-budget, please answer me one question: What exactly is your criteria for a film? It seems like any film boasting huge special effects and explosions is an instant hit - BWP goes beyond this by providing the viewer with a chill-fest, a film which stretches the imagination and proves that the real horror is all in the mind. Films like Scream are putting the horror film genre into a rut - it's such a breath of fresh air to see a film like this which doesn't rely on big stars who take the actual emphasis of the horror film away.

The Blair Witch Project is the best horror film I've seen, in five years. That might not seem like a long time, but in those years, I've seen hundreds of horror flicks. Nothing in that time scale comes close to what the Blair Witch Project stands for. Originality isn't a common thing these days, and with the film industry focusing on rolling in the money with big special effects and death-fests, there won't be many films like this. 5/5.",NA

"MASK Agent 703","The true fear, is within ourselves","3 December 2001","""The Blair Witch Project"" is not about drenching the audience with blood and gore, of terrorizing them through the film. Well, okay, maybe the second one, but it's much more than a horror movie. It is a crude but tolerable display of an emotion that each one of us holds dear in our hearts...fear. Everyone fears something, no matter how big or small or important or insignificant it may be. This movie toys on that emotion to the fullest extent. You do not watch ""The Blair Witch Project"", you feel it. We live in a world that is fully dominated by technology, and money. With ""The Blair Witch Project"", that is not the case. It was made on a shoestring budget, and used some of the simplest filmaking techniques around. Yet, it shows us that no matter what we may see when it comes to horror, the greatest creator of fear is our own imaginations. And in a day and age where technology is king, queen, prince, and the rest of the dynasty, ""The Blair Witch Project"" proves that the stuff out there that really scares the pants off of us is what we don't see.","10"
"PCC0921","Embrace the screaming. You'll enjoy it more.","12 October 2020","With the popularity of video, slowly pushing its simulated, grubby mitts into films' domain in the 1980s and 1990s, it became clear that one day an actual use for video, in a movie, would finally arise. By the time this film came out, video, for all its cheap, easy uses, was still, for all practical purposes, a consumer medium. Good only for home movies and cheap television, it probably will never possess the color, glamour, tangibility and reality that film has to offer. My rule is to never use video in movies, unless it calls for video to be a part of the story and what we have here is a prime example.

The voyeuristic property of a video camera running around the woods, in the darkness, is gold. The Blair Witch Project is an amazing ""film"". It immediately establishes its right to be on video. We know from the start that this is a film/video crew searching for answers to the myth of the Blair Witch in southern Maryland. We are also immediately taken away by the prospects of watching this ""film"" unfold through a video or film camera. The acting is top notch, especially since the actors had to pass this off as being a documentary-type film however, 20 years later (repeat viewings), you can see the ""acting"" seeping out, especially with the two fishing guys in the beginning.

There was a lot of complaining back in 1999, when this film made its debut. The complaints about the main star, Heather Donahue, was that she was too annoying in her acting and it made it hard to enjoy the film. No! No! No! That is what makes the film great. If she isn't annoying, it doesn't jack up the shock and excitement more. If she isn't screaming and yelling than it sounds acted out, rehearsed and not what the film-makers wanted, which is realism. True, if I was being chased by a witch, I would drop the camera, run and not look back, but the need to keep the cameras rolling, no matter what, helped increase the determination expressed by the characters throughout the film and helps to increase the scene's shock and terror. This is great voyeuristic terror.

But like Paranormal activity, the movie never exactly scared me. Everyone thought that that was great. Me, well, I told people to take a pass on it. They disagreed. The Blair witch project was groundbreaking for scary movies. Just look at, for instance, Paranormal activity, and Cloverfeild, and Quarantine. They all are made in a similar sort of way.

The Blair witch project is a simple plot. It's about a group of college kids who go into a woods to see if The Blair witch actually existed. Along their trip, people start to go crazy and they all get really scared.

I know what you're thinking? How does that sound good at all? Well, at least this one is entertaining and creepy and disturbing. Paranormal activity wasn't that scary, occasionally creepy, and horribly repetitive. The Blair witch project may be a little overrated, but it doesn't matter. It's a chiller at it's best.

"moviemattb","My absolute favorite of the found footage genre","31 October 2014","""The Blair Witch Project"" is a found footage movie that documents the missing three student filmmakers for disappearing into the woods near at Burkittsville, Maryland as they were shooting a documentary about the Blair Witch as it appears to be a legend. A year later their footage was found. Everyone hated this movie because its not about how shaky the camera was, but how they were extremely disappointed that the movie was not real; they all thought this was for real when they were stuffs about the three missing students, and most of all the Blair Witch that does exist in our world. I understand this movie is not real, but did it need to be? No. It does not need to be real because if it did, then it might as well ended up as a snuff film and that is not good. No one wants to see a movie that happens to be real, where they get lost into the woods and ended up being killed. That is completely stupid! I have never seen a snuff film, and I am not sure if I want to see one. I might as well not want to. I enjoy this movie for what it is! It may look like real footage, but it is not real. With that said, ""The Blair Witch Project"" is one of the most effective horror movies ever made, and it is not only one of my favorite horror movies but it is my absolute favorite of the found footage genre. I do enjoy other found footage movies such as ""Cloverfield;"" ""Chronicle;"" ""Zero Day;"" and the ""Paranormal Activity"" movies. The majority of the movie works so well to not include any music as it makes it very effective. However, it does appear at the film's end credits where it plays that strange creepy soundtrack that plays with all of this creepy sound as you hear something unusual. Tony Cora did that music piece for the film's credits, I thought he did great job for creating something as what I said previously unusual. The three main actors Heather Donahue; Joshua Leonard; and Michael Williams all do a wonderful job for playing themselves in a fictional way as if they were filmmakers. When I watch this movie, I get a sense of feeling that I was actually with those three and did ending up with them for getting lost into the woods; it almost like virtual reality and you feel like that you are actually there. I give credit for both Daniel Myrick and Eduardo Sanchez for writing a great story, and directing for what they had envision it; as well as editing it. To those that hate this movie, I suggest that you should give this movie another shot, and maybe understand the movie better for what it is; also, to those that may have not seen the movie, I say check it out because it feels like an experience. I highly recommend ""The Blair Witch Project,"" and I give it a 10 out of 10.","10"

A year later, their interrupted video search is found. No trace of the trio; and now their disappearance becomes part of the mystery. Unknown actors make this thing more believable. Heather Donahue was pretty darn good. Joshua Leonard and Michael C. Williams were her partners. The final sequence and last ten seconds in particular left me scared as hell.

"baumer","A tense and frightening film. Completely original.","30 July 1999","I think I am going to be the reviewer in here that is somewhat down the middle with my assessment of the film. I have been reading reviews and comments about the film for about a month now, and most of the comments have been either a) it is the scariest film ever orat least since Halloween or b) it is absolute crap. Well if I had to lean one way it would be towards a). But even though this film is scary, it honestly could have been the scariest film ever made if only for one small thing, and I'll get into that in a moment.

As much as this film is a horror by definition, it is more of a psychological study of the human spirit. This movie asks the question "" How much can a human being take before we lose it?"" And on that level The Blair Witch Project is perfect. We see three people that start off with good intentions and ambitious spirits and then we watch them unravel as fear sets in. And all throughout this film I kept asking myself how would I react if I was in the same situation? And the answer that I came to was,probably the same way that these three did. When you have human beings in what is seemingly a dire problem and an impossible location, how does that affect you? Do you laugh about it? Do you freak out on each other? Do you look for blame? Are you frightened? The answer to those questions is ""Yes"". You do all of them. The characters in this film are real people and what we see them go through is real. And that is what makes this film as good as it is. We feel that we are watching this happen to three people that we know because the film actually gives us time to understand these characters. And that is good. But what could have made the film a level above any horror film made before it is that we should of had more time at night when everything is happening and less time during the day when they are starting to lose their minds. As I said, the way it is done is very good in it's execution, because we are watching realistic footage of how someone would be after five days of being lost in the wilderness with very little food, cold nights, and things going bump in the night. But could you just for one second imagine how the film would of been if it concentrated more on things that go bump in the night than the psychological elements that it also gives us? This would have been the personification of fear. Having said that, make no mistake about it, this film is scary. It is much more frightening than any film that has come out this decade. And what makes it scary is the fear of not knowing. No one knows what it is that they are hearing. No one knows what it is that you see in that bundle of wood. It's red and wet and looks like blood and enamel, but what exactly is it? Not knowing what it is that is scaring these three people is terrifying. I have been out of the theater for at least a half an hour now and my heart is still beating a little faster, it still hasn't recovered from all that this film put me through. But as scary as it was, it could have had more night time stuff and less day time lead up to what happens at night. The film established the fact that all the scary stuff happens when the sun sets, so why not give the audience what it came for? And the only reason I am saying this is because it's not like the movie ran out of ideas, it's too smart for that, but it's just that they gave us ( the audience ) a chance to catch our breath. And I like it when I can't breath from fear. I like it when I feel as helpless and as frightened as the people in this movie. And as much as I was, I wanted more. I thirsted for more.

To know all that this movie is, is to appreciate it. The fact that they went out and concentrated on scaring us and not on seeing how many special effects they could fit into one scene is refreshing. And it is wonderful. These guys know what the epitome of fear is. They must be fans of Texas Chainsaw Massacre and Halloween. It's just too bad that they couldn't keep us that scared for longer than they did.

Blair Witch is a very scary film. To say that it is a terrible film is to not understand the meaning of horror. To say that you didn't enjoy the film is another story. I admire this film for all that it is and all that it wanted to be and all that it came so close to being. If only it didn't stray off course as little as it did, if only..... Having said that, I really do like this film and it really did scare me. You should see this, no matter what anyone says to you. Give the guys a chance. They had the courage and the talent to go out on a limb and make this happen, it should at least be rewarded for that. And if you do want to see a scary film, you won't find one better in the last ten years. And that is all that really matters. Because even though it could have been scarier, there is no film that I've seen in recent years that can hold a candle to it. 8.5/10","10"
"baumer","All of our primal fears are lived vicariously through this movie","3 August 1999","The Blair Witch Project is the personification of fear. This is a film or rather an experience that knows what it is that scares the human soul. As one reviewer so perfectly stated, this film brings back what it is that scared us as kids. And what it is that scares us are things that are naturally frightful. When you are five or six years old we are not naturally afraid of men with masks that stalk babysitters or men with hockey masks that haunt horny campers. Those are things that are taught to us by the news or by watching enough scary movies. But what we are afraid of, even though we don't know why, is the dark, strange noises in the middle of the night and our own subconscious. We are afraid to go downstairs when the lights are off because we don't know what is waiting down there to get us. And the reason we are scared of these things is simply that it makes us think of death or extreme pain. The Blair Witch Project preys on those fears. And as long as it takes to get into those primal fears, the setup is worth the payoff. What we witness is three people that could be budds that we went to school with. They are not caked with makeup and set in the perfect light to make them Jennifer Love Hewitt or Joshua Jackson. They are three people that are tired, unshaven, hungry, cold, deprived and scared out of their minds. They are a microcosm of every single one of us put in the same situation. I have never seen a film like this one before and only a handful of times have I felt close to what I did watching this film. First there was Jaws, that made me afraid the water. Halloween made me afraid of the night and Nightmare On Elm Street made me afraid to go to sleep. There are a few others that made me feel similar to this, but no movie has ever made me feel exactly the way Blair Witch did. In here you feel like what is happening is real. 8mm cameras can do that. You are watching a home video and what you can't see scares the hell out of you. We hear what they hear, we feel what they feel and we are prone to curl up in a ball and wait for the inevitable. I have seen this movie twice now. The first time I saw it for myself, the second time I saw it to watch the reactions of the people in the audience. When the nights came and all the ruckus started, people ( audience ) curled up almost into fetal positions, they grabbed onto whatever arm was next to them and their breathing became a little heavier. Male or female it didn't matter. No matter if this film is fact or fiction, it attacks everything that makes us afraid and it exploits it like perhaps no other film has ever done or will ever do.

Now I have read the comments that dismiss this film as fluff and how it is not really scary, and that may be true for some people, but for the majority of the people that have seen this, it hits us with such force that it does cause you to keep the lights on at night. This is ingenius film making and even though it is not exactly what people would consider on par with say Citizen Kane ( only on a technical level ) you will not find a film that manipulates our senses and our primarily our fear more than this one, and on that level, this is one of the best films ever made.

I can't say enough about this film. It is a psychological trip through fear. It makes us feel lost and it keeps us fearing that these people will never get out alive. And it is true what people say: the last shot of this film will scare you more than any shot in the history of film. That is high praise coming from me, I grew up on horror films. You can take a shot of Michael Myers rising methodically in the background in the first Halloween, the opening death of Chrissie Watkins in Jaws, the dinner table scene in Texas Chainsaw Massacre, the shower scene from Psycho, the boiler room scene in Nightmare On Elm Street, the scene where Hicks discovers the aliens in the ceiling from Aliens or even any one of the rape scenes in Last House On The Left ( that is some pretty select company ) and still they will not surpass the raw emotion and primal fear that you will feel in the last five minutes of this film.

Blair Witch is pure fear. It should be seen by everyone at least once. If I could meet any of the five major players in this film ( the three ""actors"" and the two writer/directors ), I would thank them for showing me that someone hasn't forgotten how to make a scary film. This is what fear should be. Whoever makes the next ""Hollywood"" horror film has giant shoes to fill. Good luck.","10"

"Mister-6","A ""Witch"" to watch....","9 November 1999","Do I have to tell you what this one is about?

Anyone worth their salt knows about ""The Blair Witch Project"" and the descent of three documentarians into the woods, their own fears, madness and the fallacy of not listening to old wives tales.

But is it scary, you ask? Yes, I say!

This is one of the few horror films out in the world today that actually knows what works. It taps into our primordial fears (getting lost, the dark, distant noises, inexplicable symbolism) and exploits them out the ying-yang.

It is to the film's advantage that it was shot on camcorders; the constantly moving lens gives the film an urgent, breathless feel that makes it seem as if, yes, this is all actually taking place as we see it. Like we're there with these three crazy kids who go poking around where they shouldn't.

I have only one quibble about this film.

SPOILER -

Even anyone with a minute cache of survival skills knows to follow a stream as it flows and it will lead to a river, pond, lake or whatever. And there would be the most likely place you would find people, towns, cities, etc. So, why don't these green kids do that? Yeah, I know: because then the movie would be over and they'd never find that house in the middle of the woods. Just a small gripe in an otherwise fine horror flick.

END OF SPOILER


Okay, where was I? Oh yeah; great film. Earns every one of its scares and if any one film can trigger so much debate about whether it is real or not, you know these guys must have done something right.

At the very worst there is one jump and a couple of times where the hair on your neck might rise, but nothing ever happens. This was the handy work of a marketing genius and a filmmaking novice.

This is supposed to be a film made on a portable hand held camera by three students who set out to find out more about the story of the Blair Witch.Because it looks and feels so real the film is incredibly scary , you end up forgeting that it is a movie and start to believe it is real footage.For me this film makes the Exorsist look like Scooby Doo!Wonderfull stuff. 9 out of 10.","9"
"Boba_Fett1138","Great concept...average movie.","1 October 2005","The concept for ""The Blair Witch Project"" is a great and original one. The hand-held, amateur, documentary, camera-work must give the viewers a realistic view of the events and tend to make the viewer believe that all of this really happened. It makes ""The Blair Witch Project"" an highly original one of a kind movie. Never again will there be a movie like this one.

Most of the time the movie has a good realistic feeling and atmosphere. At times you really have the feeling that you're really present in the woods, together with the three main characters. Most of the lines and moments are obviously improvised however when scripted moments and lines occur, it becomes painfully obvious that none of the three main actors are good actors by any means. It takes away lots of the realism and because of that the good original concept is flawed. It's also flawed because it is highly unbelievable that the three main characters kept filming that much and even at the moments when they were in peril and scared.

I do applaud this movie for its originality but it simply was not as good as I expected and hoped it would be. To be honest I was even bored at times while watching this movie and it takes a lot to make me bored while watching a movie. It simply took forever at times for something to happen. And quite frankly, I wasn't scared once while watching this.

Worth seeing maybe once, due to its originality.

"aesgaard41","Not Based On A True Story !","5 January 2001","It was George Romero who set the standard for the stark realism in horror films, and this movie has also set more standards for creating a movie that has caused more tourists to settle upon the same sleepy little Maryland town than when Confederate troops stalked the same hills a hundred years ago. With a legend based loosely on Tennessee's Bell Witch and Rhode Island's Mercy Brown, this movie has a very simple if not slightly illogical premise: three college kids look for a ghost in the wilderness. I might have been the only one in my school to have taken such a feat and I'd bet even money that no one else would have joined me for the simple matter of having something better to do. While much of the movie's production baffles me, it does have more of a coming of age style that a horror flick; compare this with Rob Reiner's ""Stand By Me"" and you know what I mean. The movie doesn't really explain what happens to the three would-be film-makers, but such a point isn't important as long as the film hits it's mark and it sure did with me. when I saw the Sci-Fi's channel's documentary-style promo for the movie, I was already interested enough in the paranormal and freaked out enough to think this movie was true, but a lot of logical thinking and lateral research to look into the case set me straight. I don't understand the people condemning this movie who criticize it for not being scary. They just prove to me just how conditioned we are as a society to violence. Everyone I talk to just about agree what in the world does a chain-wielding serial killer in a hockey mask have to do with a haunted house! A true ghost story will always tap into the primal fears of terror in the human mind while the sensationalism of gore and violence always turns into little more than a pass the time schlock. To me, The Blair Witch Project starts out as a neat little ghost story that turns scary as you worry about the sanctity of these three campers who get lost while filming a documentary in the middle of no where. Yes, a pile of rocks is not very scary if you happen to be the one who put it there, but if you and two others are the only ones for miles and you keep coming across evidence that an unseen fourth person is leaving tell tale signs of their presence, then you may be a little unnerved. Again, it's the presence of what you don't know that scares you; not the presence of what you do know. What heightens the fear factory is the suggestion the movie originally intended by filming it as if it was a true story; the aspect that this movie was based on true incidents sure had me curious, but of course we all know now that that was the filmmaker's intent. The only things I find wrong with this movie are the slip-shod editing, the shaking cameras, the swearing and the endless droning on of some of the duologue, but in its execution, The Blair Witch Project really is one of the scariest films out there for serious horror fans and it will certainly go down as a milestone in true horror entertainment in the same way as Psycho and Night of The Living Dead !","9"
"BrianTBC","Mad scary","11 August 1999","Blair Witch is a very scary movie. It's inventive, creative and scarier than it's million-plus dollar counterparts. The Blair Witch Project is a minimalistic, yet originative approach at film-making. It's very frightening, and it adds to that with it's shakey camera angles and lengthy blackout periods. Although at some points it's tiresome and painfully slow, Blair Witch makes up for it with one of the most shocking and terrifying endings in movie history.",NA
"Chris-369","Frightening.","15 September 1999","What can be said about this film? If you are looking for instant scares (i.e. Scream, IKWYDLS) then this film is not for you.

The clever aspect of this movie is that it is not overly scary as you actually watch it. It is after the film has ended and you think back over what you have witnessed when it has its full effect. The Blair Witch Project may well have you scared to get up in the night for weeks.

The best way to describe this film would be to say that it does not offer you any relief from you fear.

In the majority of horror or scary films,the viewer sucks their breath in and curses at the stupid person who is cautiously going up the stairs to investigate the scary noise that came from up there moments ago. The viewer then breathes a sigh of relief when it is discovered that it was simple a cat knocking over a vase. TBWP does not offer you the chance to breathe that sigh of relief, you are simply left on edge because whatever is making the noise is left anonymous.

The idea of leaving so many questions unanswered is genius.

Look at it this way - when you wake up in the middle of the night and hear a strange noise you get scared, however you are relieved when you realise that it is simply your parents going to bed or the central heating going off. TBWP does not resolve your fear, you are left wondering what the noise was.

To summarise; the noises you hear in the night are always more frightening that whatever is actually making them.","9"

"ghoul-3","Oh the hype...the hype!","8 July 1999","I was looking forward to this evening like nothing I can remember. Myself and three friends were about to have the privilege of seeing a private screening of ""The Blair Witch Project,"" supposedly, and based on dozens of reviews, ""the scariest movie in a long time, if not the scariest movie ever made period."" I had read nearly 100 reviews of this film, from novice critics to established professionals, and all but about 7 declared ""Blair Witch"" to be a truly unsettling terrifying film experience.

I am 44 years old...have grown up with horror movies...loved horror movies since I was six...been part of horror movies...wrote and directed a documentary about what is probably the BEST horror movie ever...and have been a radio, newspaper and magazine film critic since 1980. Needless to say I know what a good horror movie is..should be...and was nervously looking forward to having the living hell scared out of me.

We waited until complete dark, then ran ""Blair Witch Project"" at 11:30 PM. 87 MInutes later we all sat around and stared at each other unable to speak. Finally I said it first ""uh...is that the same film we've heard so much about?...because if it is...I want to know what was supposed to be so scary...so terrifying...so creepy about it. For the next hour or so we analyzed and scrutinized ""Blair Witch,"" offering what we thought was good and the overpowering majority of what was bad.

We all agreed that it was an interesting idea, although heavily borrowed from ""Cannibal Holocaust."" We thought the 'you are there' style was good and the performances of the unknown leads was mostly very good.

The basic plot has a group of filmmakers, headed up by a loud-mouth bossy lady 'el direktor,' heading out to do a documentary on the legendary Blair witch that supposedly still haunts a certain area in Maryland. After interviewing some locals, and listening to some fairly creepy stories, the kids head into the very same 'haunted' woods to do some filming, video-taping and audio recording. Daytime is spent yelling, cussing and getting more and more lost. Night time is filled with sudden awakenings to creepy sounds and voices. Of course the camera and mike goes on every time to 'capture' this spooky stuff...and we know that things are only going to get worse for these movie makers. The movie history tells us that the group came up missing and all that was found was footage and audio tapes. The movie is an edited version of what was recovered. I'll stop right here with the description.

We all contended that a few elements were indeed creepy...but what was intended to be oh-so-scary was pretty banal when you got right down to it. You turn a light on and shine it in any part of the woods late at night and you'll get the creeps. If all around you are eerie voices and footsteps, you get the hell out of there, you don't run holding a heavy camera and keep on filming. That's done in ""Blair Witch Project"" more than once and it's simply silly and downright unbelievable, marring the 'supposed' REAL terror engulfing these people.

Admittedly the final twenty minutes of ""Blair Witch Project"" gets intense with the promise of something truly nightmarish to come. It never happens. The movie has no end..no explanation of any kind. The final image on the screen is puzzling and frustratingly vague but not provocative.

I fully agree that psychological terror is great and the more that is left to the imagination...the better...but ""Blair Witch Project"" leaves so much to the imagination, coupled with what is obviously improvisational 'play acting' and numerous contrivances, that it just doesn't work nearly as well as it should have, although the potential was certainly there. At a time when horror films are pretty much overrated teen-oriented soundtrack selling 'crap,' it would have been nice to have something original and frightening. I'm still waiting. ""Blair Witch Project"" is not that film and it doesn't come close to living up to all the hype.

We agreed that if we hadn't heard anything at all about this film in advance, at best it would be regarded as a direct-to-video film with an interesting concept that produces a few chills and tense moments, but nothing profound or overly effective. Keep in my mind, this is my opinion, and the opinions of my movie-loving buddies. If ""Blair Witch Project"" scared the hell out of you and you love it...great. You have a right to your opinion as well. Although I'm glad I got to see it, and I will probably see it more than once, it remains an interesting over-hyped colossal disappointment. On a 1-100 scale: 68.",NA
"Jackmaster","incredible. i've never been this scared during a movie","1 August 1999","To anyone who plans on seeing this astounding movie: this film WILL stick with you. Particularly the ending. Consider yourself forewarned. It's been over 24 hours since I got out of the theater, and the final images are still burned indelibly into my memory. This was easily the most shiver-inducing, all-out frightening movie I've ever seen. There are no jump-out-of-your-seat scares, no shots of a slimy, ugly alien or any other cheap scare tactics: all that exists while this film runs is FEAR, nauseating, jaw-clenching, stoop-down-in-your-seat fear. I went in to the theater afraid that the film had been overhyped, that I wouldn't like it as much as I hoped I would, and, after about 20 minutes or a half hour, I thought that my worries were coming true. Then I realized that I was hoping, really hoping, that the scene wouldn't shift to night again. That's when I realized just how afraid I really was. The big reason that this film is so frightening is it's realism. In most movies you have to make an attempt to identify with the characters; in TBWP you have no choice. You become basically the fourth person, and that prospect is what is truly scary: ""What if that was me up there?"" I shudder to think about it even now. I'm not even going to get started on the last 5-10 minutes of the film; I'll just leave it at the fact that I have never been as scared in a theater as I was at TBWP's conclusion. And I slept with the light on afterward. This is a brilliant, brilliant film.","9"
"EijnarAmadeus","Low-budget classic.","17 August 2007","THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT made a lot of controversy upon its release, the movie wasn't just the ultimate low-budget motion picture reaching 1# at the charts worldwide, but the production company lied about the fact that this was an actual amateur movie, and everything you saw had really happened! Shocking as it was the movie became a global blockbuster, and although the ""true story"" bullsh** was a smart pull-off, it did rightfully so deserve its success; this is a great horror flick.

Three students head out in the woods to make a documentary about a local witch who has been terrorizing people who've entered the woods, as the documentation goes relatively alright things soon starts getting creepy as they feel a certain hostility; without food, phone or money, they are now lost and the road back to the car seems so long...

Always keeping you on the edge about whether you will see anything or not as the hand-held camera bounces back and forth, the tension is especially high as the night comes creeping in and the camera turns black & white. Blair Witch, is absolutely a modern independent classic.","8"
"MoviDude","Very creepy","7 August 1999","I've seen BWP twice, and let me tell you, it is much, much creepier the second time around. What can I say that hasn't been already said? It's a very well-made film, very realistic, great performances(especially Heather Donahue; you can't even tell that she's acting, her performance is so realistic.). My heart was beating during the final five minutes. Wow! What an ending! My hat is off to all who contributed to the making of this film.","8"
"aschachte","Not a bad job considering the budget","25 November 2006","Spoilers First off, I applaud them for making lots of money with no real investment. A hoax like this can only be done once. There were a couple of nice touches in the movie, like them trying to follow a stream and winding up in the same spot. That's freaky. Also, good acting. But the effects were extremely cheesy, like the four guys beating the sides of tent. Was I really supposed to think it was anything else? Maybe it's because this movie never really ""took me there"". At least with the Ninth Gate, I could suspend disbelief long enough to accept the idea that the three books really are evil and the hero's life might have been in danger a few times, but not here. Also you never actually see the Blair Witch. It's kind of like making a song about a Teenage Wasteland and calling it Baba O'Reilly. Where is Baba O'Reilly? You might say the Witch is invisible to explain her pronounced absence. Ah, but then how did they have an old drawing of the Witch in that book? Hmn? Also the editing was impossible. If you're recording the same thing with two separate cameras, you will get the same action twice from two separate perspectives, not a smoothly-edited single thread of continuity. I especially chuckled when the one guy was talking into one camera and his voice carried over flawlessly into the footage of the other camera, all supposedly unedited. That was really obvious. By editing it professionally, it lost any credibility it might have had in my mind. And why did they go in that house anyway? How stupid was that? To make matters worse, they made a companion video for this movie (before Blair Witch 2) that you could rent, supposedly of ""newly-discovered"" video. At least they threw it in free when I rented Blair Witch. It was the one guy and the girl sitting in the tent saying things like, ""Wow, that was a lot of weird stuff that happened today, huh?"" ""Did you ever figure out what those twig figures were?"" ""No. I never saw nuthin' like that. Crazy, huh?"" This companion movie was obviously shot with a different camera than either of the ones used in making Blair Witch, making it an even more obvious fake, and it was twice as boring.

While we're at it, didn't they film the inside of the Witch's house? If real, the cameras should still be in there. Who discovered the film without getting killed by the Witch? There was absolutely no way for me to get into the illusion of this movie with so many flaws continually shouting at me that it was a hoax. They might as well have put that kid from The Last Action Hero in here saying over and over, ""It's just a movie. It's not real."" It astounds me to think that some people actually thought it was a true documentary. On the scary scale, 1 to 10, I give this a 2, only for the few freaky (but not really scary) scenes. This was tied with Batman as most over-hyped movie of the 90's.","2"
"Trans-2","Objective, comprehensive review of The Blair Witch Project","8 August 1999","Let me start by saying I've seen this movie twice and read at least one hundred user reviews to give me a perspective through other people's eyes. Quickly put, the idea of this movie is a low budget film where the three actors portray student film makers which also substitute as the camerapersons, while the two writer-directors are off eating lunch at Chi-Chi's (its a tough life). The dialog was all improvised with no real script, except for the two writer-directors leaving general instructions in film canisters at strategic locations in the woods. The acting was very good, although I don't know if you would call it ""acting"" per se (where everything is predetermined) as opposed to ""guided improvised method acting"" where the actors were more or less living the movie as it was happening (for instance, the writer-directors deliberately diminished their food supplies and made the scary noises at night, for the sake of realism). For those who were distressed by the lack of a plot, consider that if you ever get lost in the woods, you will probably not have a plot either.

I can see how people would view the acting as either fake or authentic; sometimes the characters seemed to be considerably more horrified of things than they should've been; however, the actual *manner* in which they acted horrified was quite authentic. This is most true of Heather, the narrator and main protagonist of the film. I believe the trick to enjoying this movie is to either A) believe the movie really happened, B) believe it is a mockumentary but see the acting as totally believable, or C) believe it is a mockumentary and forgive over-reactions when they occur. If you fall into categories A or B, you're off to a running start. If on the other hand you are a C person, to fully appreciate this movie you must willingly suspend your disbelief when Heather over-reacts, and assume that there was something really scary there instead of something not so scary. I believe this flaw could've been corrected by using, say, blood splattered on the trees or something else which would've more strongly implied imminent violence without actually portraying it; however this would have forsaken the movie's ""no-gore"" concept. The first time I watched it, I fell into the B category, but the second time I watched it I leaned towards C. Nevertheless, the movie had even more of an effect on me the second time around. Without my realizing it, my heart was pounding at the end, and that night my mind was irrationally convinced that the coat-hanger next to my bedroom door was a floating witch guarding the only exit so that I would not be able to escape. This movie flicked a switch somewhere in the back of my mind, convincing me despite my best rational efforts that evil things lurked in the dark recesses of my home.

Another thing that might put unsuspecting viewers off is its differences in production values and approach to horror. The most obvious are the ones afflicting all low budget movies: no money means unpolished lighting and camera work, cheap sets or costumes, no effects, etc. One main difference I was pleased with is no score. We had no music to take us by the hand and tell us when to feel what for who; our reactions to the events were thus more natural, a refreshing change. The acting was improvised in a mostly relaxed manner, so we were spared the often- excessive melodrama of Hollywood-type productions. The approach to horror was that of gradually increasing creepiness that gets under your skin, as opposed to ""Look!! I'm a scary monster!!"" and blood-and-guts scares.

Heather bears the most responsibility and delivers the most dialog, sometimes becoming overly talkative as she tries to fill in all silences with narrative commentary. I was also mildly annoyed at her occasional screech- screaming, but it was realistic and I would've been annoyed if I was there too. There is also one scene where I really, really, really wanted to hand her a Kleenex. As for comments about the level of swearing; I'm absolutely sure that neither of the three actors were even aware of their language until prudes pointed it out, since swearing profusely (especially in tense situations) is only natural for people this age.

All in all, I was quite pleased. I have heard that there are other similar indie productions (Cannibal Holocaust, The Last Broadcast, etc) that were made before this one, which are probably quite envious of this movie's success (this movie as it turns out is making thousands of times its cost in profit). Despite its qualities and successes, I hope there are no sequels or prequels. There is speculation as to if it will ignite a ""new"" style of horror film making. PS: After reading all those other reviews, I have started to wonder... why is it that the entire theater always either ""laughs at the whole movie"" or ""come out scared sh**less"".","8"

"Movie-12","One of the most scary and realistic films of 1999. ***1/2 out of ****","17 August 1999","THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT (1999) ***1/2

Starring: Heather Donehue, Michael Williams, and Joshua Leonard

Directors: Daniel Myrick and Eduardo Sanchez 80 minutes Rated R (for strong language)

By Blake French:

MICHAEL, JOSH, DO YOU HEAR THAT? ITS PROBABLY A DEAR OR SOMETHING. NO, ITS NOT. THE SOUNDS ARE COMMING FROM ALL AROUND US. WHAT IS THAT. OH MY GOD! ITS GETTING LOUDER! OH MY GOD! ITS COMMING CLOSER! OH MY GOD! WHAT IS THAT? WHAT IS THAT! OH MY GOD, ITS EVERYWHERE!

That is just a sample of how the new film by Daniel Myrick and Eduardo Sanchez, ""The Blair Witch Project,"" is able to scare the living daylights out of an audience without ever having to include scary music, graphic violence, or a gooey, slimy, bloodthirsty creature. The film is created with no special effects either and much of it takes place during the night, and being shot from a camcorder, there is only a black screen in front of us. We witness no one's death--although there are several murderous events that are implied heavily. ""The Blair Witch Project"" is one of the years best films.

The movie is more of a documentary than a regular horror thriller. It is based on a 1994 event in Maryland, where three film students, Heather, Josh, and Michael, all follow the idea of Heather to go out into the woods by themselves during the weekend and shot film on the legendary Blair Witch who is supposed to haunt an area nearby. They begin with interviewing people who have seen and or heard about the witch. Then they take one of their cars and drive into the supposedly haunted woods. All of this is being shot on one of two home video cameras held by either Heather or Mike, therefore we see all of the story through the eyes of the characters. What a novelty!

Their first day of shooting however, they begin to finds some very weird things. Like a pile of rocks staked in accordance to one of the interviewed witnesses' descriptions. Then what looks like big voodoo symbols carved in the sand and made out of sticks and twigs that appear everywhere. What could be doing this? One of the students believes someone is playing a joke on them. But Heather knows that nobody has any knowledge of their presence there. Therefore, it must be something else...

Then mysterious things begin to occur. First the crew discovers they seem to be lost in the woods and have somehow gone off the rout--but Heather insists otherwise. Then they notice the map carried by Heather has disappeared. Soon afterward they start to turn on one another going from being best friends to constantly fighting and bickering at each other. After that, they detected that they have been traveling in circles all day long--and have not covered an inch of ground. That night the crew hears strange noises coming from all around them--ones that sound like young children screaming in pain--but no body is out there with them? When Josh disappears the night afterward, and severed fingers are found the next day, things really begin to heat up.

""The Blair Witch Project"" is enlightening and intelligent from the very first scene, allowing us to participate in the characters discoveries, arguments and horrors. The opening is wonderfully crafted by detailing the interviews of the witnesses that not only arise our superstition, but also train our fantasy for what is prom to soon happen. The witnesses cleverly describe that the say ""something"" in the woods, not outright telling us it was a witch, giving us a gold mine for our imagination to feast upon. And by showing us next to nothing throughout the film, this lets us become seriously involved with the characters.

The movie's structure is perfection in itself--and original. The gradual increase in tension--how the crew stars out finding clues, then more and more things begin to happen like the sounds at night, the disappearance of Josh--is what makes this film so frightening. It also develops the character's feelings and emotions using this form of composition. My only complaint is that I think this movie lacks some true suspense, unlike the very well off completion ""The Sixth Sense."" ""The Blair Witch Project"" only went for all out terror without ever really getting into a build up. But given the structure use, it is perfectly understandable that this minor flaw is present.

""The Blair Witch Project"" is not a data movie in the least. When I attended this film's screening a sat in the back of a young twosome presumable on a date that were squirming in their seats during this movie. The girl was almost asleep and the boy was trying his hardest to please her; going out of the theater to get refills on popcorn, soda etc. I was thinking to myself that they were closed minded here, and were looking for some graphic action movie. As the movie ended in one of the most tense cliffhanger manors that I have ever seen, only to have them mutter ""finally, its over,"" I made a note to warn you in advance: if you are looking for an action packed, muscle mannered, explosive special effects extravaganza, ""The Blair Witch Project"" is not for you. If you are looking for a very different view at a scary subject dealing out its terror as psychological tension, and are willing to give the screen your imagination and involvement for 80 minutes, then go see this one. It may make you think twice about going out into the woods again.",NA
"hoernkeem","The Blair Witch Project (1999, Daniel Myrick & Eduardo Sanchez) Original, tense, scary film launched a lot of copycats and a lot of haters, but give credit where it is due!","4 May 2021","This is one of those seminal films and while it is not a film that I will sit and watch over and over again I do think it is one of the best and most original horror films ever. It is a good counterpoint to another scary movie, ""The Sixth Sense"", which was also released in 1999. That film is so meticulously composed and crafted whereas 'Blair Witch' is meant to look rough, raw and grainy. While not the first ""found footage"" style film this is really at the top of the list and entered into public consciousness with a bullet. It seems commonplace to disparage or downplay this film, and that is fine but I feel that is akin to a haters gonna hate type of mentality. If you give in a little bit and buy what they are selling here it is incredibly innovative and clever as well as scary without really doing a lot to be scary.

The first thing you have to remember is the derivation of this film. You have to go back to 1999 and remember the time. It is always tricky because you should not have to do a lot of research in order to enjoy a film and you don't have to for this, but I believe a solid understanding does enhance the viewing. The internet in 1999 was not what it is today but it was ramping up and this was one of the first movies to take advantage of that. In every aspect this movie has the look and feel of a real thing which is purposeful to try and enhance the tension and scare factor. It means more if you are out there really believing this is found camera footage. There was a website generated dedicated to the Blair Witch and more than a few at the time thought that this film was in some way a legit documentary thus when released it exploded on the scene in part due to the supposed true nature of the film. This is, however, a produced film from start to finish utilizing a gimmick to the utmost effect. Produced for under a million dollars it grossed over $250 million becoming one of the most successful independent films ever.

We start with the statement that three students went missing in the Maryland woods while working on a documentary about a local witch legend. A year later their footage is found and we watch that footage play out on screen. It starts innocuous enough with three college aged kids Ty, Heather and Mike heading out on a hike, interviewing some citizens, and filming pertinent locations regarding the legend of the Blair Witch. A key revelation is a story from a local regarding a hermit who killed kids because of the witch. He killed them in pairs and made one stand in the corner while he killed the other. They continue and find some small cairns built in the woods, and then steadily and more progressively things get scarier for the three. At first they just seem to be lost, but then they start hearing things and no matter what they cannot find their way out of the woods. They hear twigs snapping at night, and voices. At one point they return to their camp to find their belongs all torn apart and rifled through. One of the three goes missing and a torn part of his shirt is discovered with bloody bits in it. Eventually the two remaining hear their companion's screams and run to find him stumbling upon a house in the woods. They split up to search and when Heather reaches the basement she sees her remaining companion standing in the corner and you have a revelatory moment of what is happening right before an unseen entity attacks Heather, the camera drops, the footage ends and the credits roll. It is a brilliant ending to a very stark, simple, yet effective movie.

I feel a good percentage of people take an inordinate amount of pleasure in trashing this movie, but I think a lot of that stems from a generation that has seen this all done before and the novelty has lost its luster. If, however, you view this film from a more pure perspective and buy in to the novelty they are proposing it works on just about every level. The found footage doesn't feel forced. The three leads feel like real people going through this and not actors. The chronology does a good job of steadily escalating the tension and upping the ante which allows it to be scary without anything really that scary in it. Kind of like any novelty schtick I don't want to see a new genre spring up based on found footage scares but due to being the O. G. of this style of film 'The Blair Witch Project' stands up as a great example of this style of film while being incredibly canny from a business perspective and deserving of being labeled one of the best horror films of all time.

"yonko","Great ""Movie""","2 June 2003","The first mistake viewers make when they watch this movie is they treat it like a ""movie"". The Blair Witch Project is a movie but it wasn't filmed as a movie. It was filmed as live footage. It's a mocumentary.

Everytime this movie comes up in conversation people say the acting was bad, it was in black and white, the cinematography was non existant, you never saw the witch, and so on and so on. If any of those elements were different the movie wouldn't have been what it was supposed to be about. It would have ruined the entire production. The actors weren't actors. The shakey filming made the film seen more amateur. And you never saw the witch because how could you? The students filming the documentary had no idea what was after them. How could you know more than they knew? You watched the film through their eyes. There was no second or third party in this film. You only saw what they saw and that's it.

If there was a script, you saw the witch, and the film looked professional it would have been completely pointless.

This is a great little film. But no one watches it the way it was intended.","10"
"acedj","Never understood the draw","3 August 2020","I saw this in the theater when it came out, and the only thing I got out of it was a migraine. This movie deals with a local legend about a witch that haunts some woods and a group of people that try to find evidence of her. It was the first in the ""found footage"" genre, and that is about the only good thing that can be said about it.

I sat through the entire run of this waiting for something scary or even creepy to happen and it never did. In fact, just when the movie started to show promise it ended.

"alice liddell","A modern masterpiece: Blair's brilliance as much about filmmaking as terror. (possible spoilers)","27 October 1999","True story 1: When I was ten, I had a huge row with my mother, and hid out by dark in the local ramparts for six hours. I was so traumatised, I didn't go out again for nearly a year. True story 2: a couple of years later, out in the woods with some friends, we were shot at by the farmer on whose land we were trespassing. They may have been fake bullets, but we didn't know that then. True story 3: last June I was diagnosed for a cancerous tumour. It was treated successfully, but I was convinced I was going to die, and I'm only in my early twenties. True story 4: Two days before I saw THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT, I took my dogs out for a walk at midnight. I normally go with my wife, but she was tired. I don't know the area at all, and after a few minutes I was lost. It was foggy, with unlocatable voices everywhere, and I kept returning, with increasing panic, to the same place. This lasted about an hour, the longest of my life. No wonder BLAIR scared the living bejasus out of me.

Why, you may ask, is a total stranger telling me all this? Well, I've been trying to work out why a film everybody else considered boring or disappointing, truly, deeply terrified me into a dripping cold sweat, gauntly pale face, shaking, wrenching my fingernails. A film about uncovering the past has made me reappraise my own. Every day when I was in college, today in the streets, posters for Missing Persons, some missing for over six years. A young neighbour of mine a couple of years ago went on holiday with some friends and mysteriously drowned. I remember as a baby my dad would pretend to throw me off the ferry. Richie Edwards. I had never really given any of these events much thought. I can't stop now.

I wrote the above last night about 20 minutes after seeing the film. I'm a lot less hysterical now. Like Heather, I will take relative comfort in hiding behind the camera. Because the film is as much an investigation into filmmaking as it is an exercise in terror. It reveals the terrible fears behind the 'home' in home movie. It uses modern critical theorisation undermining the 'objectivity' and 'realism' of documentaries, by showing subjectivity pouring into its form with a vengeance.

BLAIR is obsessed with the nature of filmmaking. Barely a scene goes by without some reference to the camera. Some of this is rather obvious - e.g. the shots of the cameraperson in the mirror, or other camerapersons - but much of it is brilliant. In films, even in fiction, we are used to the camera being our detached guide to everything we see - watching it fail so badly, so rigorously, helplessly under attack is terrifying, which is why I think the film affects film buffs more than others - BLAIR is nothing less than an attack on the presumptions of the medium. The camera is as much a source of the fear as the unknown, as light reflected off the lens creates eerie, ghostly images.

Even what seemed to be flaws add to the terror. The continued attention drawn to the camera seemed contrived, but we needed it on for the film to continue. Through the camera we become sadistically party to the threesome's pains - we dread them turning it off. We are the watchers as much as whatever's out there. The perfect editing beggared belief, until you begin to ask who actually edited this? When Mike falls near the end, and Heather can be heard screaming in the distance, the camera moves again, and it's not Heather. Who is it? Mike said the witch models were too creative for rednecks. Isn't the implication horrifying? The well-documented manner of the film's creation actually increases the terror - the confusion over fixed authoriality mirrors the characters' bewilderment at who is the author in the film of the horrors.

As in most horror films, there seems to be a fundamental misogyny at play. As Heather herself notes, the Blair Witch project was her project. She is the Blair Witch. She takes two ordinary middle class guys out of their American homes, and subjects them to the most ghastly horrors. She controls every aspect of what they do>. Another reason for the panic, though, is the complete absence of sex. Only Josh refers to a partner, and he's the first to disappear. These are characters lost in the woods - that ancient metaphor for sexuality, especially female - and the subject never comes up. Yeah right. The camera never lies.

But, most importantly, this is a basically terrifying film. Three people, around my, and most of the audience's age, lost, without bearings, the reassuring signifiers of modern life, in a wilderness with threats both supernatural and primitive. It's not quite as mysterious as PICNIC AT HANGING ROCK - we do know there's something out there - but for a $150m+ film to deny explanations or closure is remarkable. The scene where Josh and Heather are suddenly awake, running after something in the distance, is probably the scariest thing I've ever seen in a movie, although the ending comes close. The film begins with the characters leaving home and ends with them finding one. Having been reduced to the most basic drives of humanity, parentless, lost, the pair rediscover childhood, in the form of bloody handprints. I don't even want to think about that one right now. Grrrgh. You probably won't want to see this movie - it's a different kind of scary.","9"
"Castor-30","Creepiest Movie I've ever seen","26 March 2000","The Blair Witch Project did not rely on what I call ""surprise only"" scares. ""Surprise only"" scares are cheap and last one instant and then go away for ever. The Blair Witch project actually still had me frightened when I went to sleep two days after I saw it for the first time. It doesn't make you jump when you see it, it actually scares you for some time after seeing it. Which no slasher film has ever done for me. This movie rules, and all horror fans should see it at least once.","10"
"Spinky McSpanky","Still giving me the chills......!!!","28 June 2000","I am such a complete wus! I'm a 32 year old male who's seen the lot - 'The Evil Deads', 'I spit on your Graveses', 'The Cannibal Shnannibal' schlock nonsense, but THIS FILM truly gives me the willies (that's an English expression). I cant explain it.

I saw it at the Edinburgh festival last August - its British premier. I had been to the web-site (which also freaked me out) and new the story and background. I was expecting it the be a whole heapin' lot scarier than it actually was. At the time.

As the months have gone by the intensity of the film has gnawed itself indelibly into my brain. Images and sounds around me constantly remind me of it - birds in trees, babies crying in echoing shopping centres, conversations on crackly mobile phones, playing Silent Hill on the playstation. And its all down to 5 minutes of film culminating in that terrifying final shot - that blurred, out of focus (nearly out of frame) image still sends shivers down my back.

It's a fear that what I can't see may actually be worse than what I can. Show me the full gore, give me traditional jumps and jolts, let rivers of blood run from the screen - just don't make me go into that basement again.","10"
"gray1937-1","If it's not a joke, it's a ripoff!","8 January 2005","This is a first rate scam and a classic example of using the internet to hype junk. The best thing about this whole deal is that it shows how easy it is for unethical advertising to influence people to part with their money. It's not scary and it's not funny. There is no acting, directing nor camera talent involved. Someone once noted that the character of a horror movie can be judged by how much you see of the monster. In this joke of a movie you never see the cause of (what passes for) the fright. The primary method used to instill tension is to bounce around with a hand held camera. Gosh, wish I'd thought of that technique! If you paid to see this, you've been had. At least I waited until it was on TV. I'm rating it a ""1"" because there is no ""0"".Go see ""The Attack of the Killer Tomatoes"". It's better.","1"
"Peach-2","Stunning.","31 July 1999","My intrest in film began in horror movies. More than any other genre, horror movies made me really feel something...real fear. I hadn't seen a really scary movie that stuck with me for a long time, then I heard about this film. No monsters or slashers seen on screen, no moody music, no over abundant amount of gore. I thought to myself this must be some kind of experiment. Being a huge movie buff, I had heard everyone on the net and in magazines talk about how scary this film was for them. So I went to see The Blair Witch Project last night and I was right about the experiment part, this film is an experiment in total fear. The film is shot on what looks like mostly video and is very low budget. I believe however that you will be scared. The film is basically a premise played to the highest degree, a premise that never once let up, not even at the end. I've never really seen a film like this and I advise everyone out there who loves to be scared to go see The Blair Witch Project. The last shot of this film will be stuck in my head for years to come and for the first time in many years I slept with the light on. Can you face your fears?","10"
"Desslok","Oh the humanity!","10 June 2001","First - I've been traumatized by every horror movie in the book. From Friday the 13th to Psycho, I've seen 'em all. That's why I was suckered into seeing this stinking pile of refuse laughingly called a movie. I was intrigued by the press the movie was getting, and it sounded like an interesting premise.

An hour and a half later, I was disgusted that I had paid 7 bucks for this train wreck. No - even worse, I had paid the highest price of them all: two hours of my life savagely ripped away from me that I will never get back.

Somewhere along the line, film goes have mistaken two hours of people on screen swearing at each other at the top of their lungs as character development, and running around in the woods non-stop as a plot. Half an hour of set up - and then an hour and a half of nothing - and then, the shock ending - where nothing happens. Have people's sensibilities been degraded by modern culture that they find this enjoyable?

No monster/witch at the end. No pay-off whatsoever, at all - zip, nada, zilch! Now, I by no means have to have a full blown million dollar CGI special effect to scare the ever-lovin crap out of me. In fact, less is more - the most scary movies I can think of are where they never show, they simply suggest. However, the viewer needs **SOMETHING** to hang their hats on - a fleeting shadow of a great white shark under the water, a dripping claw on the Nostromo, a long shot of a man in a black jumpsuit in Haddonfield - something. What does the Blair Witch do? Make scary noises in the woods at night. Ooooh - hold me! Oh - and don't forget about those scary sticks and piles of rocks? I find scarier things in my breakfast cereal.

Horror movies are frequently known for their plots - or lack of. Most of the time, this is true - a generic slasher flick often is a string of events loosely held together by a vague narrative. In the right mood, this can be even kind of fun, in a cheesy sort of way. However, the most cookie cutter Friday the 13th movie has more going for it in the coherent narrative department than this amateur attempt does. I was hoping for something more than ""Kids go into the woods to make a movie, kids get lost, kids run around for several days, kids die."" What the hell is that?!?

After seeing the film, the next day at work I was going off about it - and was instructed to go to blairwitch.com for the full back story. Surprise, surprise - guess what! There was indeed a full history on the legend, write ups on the characters, and more background information that I could hope for. If the creative (sic) team did all this work, then WHY THE HELL WAS NONE OF IT IN THE MOVIE?!?!? A viewer should not have to go do homework to get the complete story.

Illogical plot devices abound. They get lost in the wood because ""I threw the f'ing map away, you stupid &!^@#^"" - a plot crowbar if I've ever seen one. Or how about ignoring common sense - even I, a city boy to the core, would know that if you follow a river downstream, you will eventually wind up SOMEWHERE! Anywhere - a road, a farm, the freakin' ocean, for god sake! Yet this simple concept eludes the characters (and I use the term 'characters' very loosely.). Or - the best one yet: if I woke up in the middle of the night, with the forces of evil shaking my tent like Lucifer himself was outside, I sure as hell would **NOT** grab my camera and keep filming as I ran. I would haul ass as fast as my legs would go - buck naked if need be. Yet they have the presence of mind to keep the film rolling? And what about that survival book that the filmmakers take great pains to point out in the beginning of the movie - and yet never shows up again?

(Note to the creative (sic) team - next time, don't just make the movie up as you go. Take some time and formulate a dialogue and a story - maybe even write a script. I know it's a bold concept in this modern day and age, but your viewers will thank you for it.)

For those of you who seem to have forgotten what a *truly* frightening and/or movie is, let me bring you up to speed on required viewing: Exorcist (the creepiest movie ever), Jaws (a film that traumatizes an ENTIRE generation of people, keeping them off the beach for years, has something going for it), The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, The Shining, Halloween, Night of the Living Dead, Ring (a classic Japanese horror film proving that terror is not exclusive to North America), Alien, and of course the granddaddy of them all - Psycho. Of course, all the sad people who have bought into the hype of the movie will call me closed minded and an idiot for not falling to my knees and worshipping this movie. Fine - whatever. I'll just be over here watching

Bottom line - do not be suckered in by this movie. Go rent a good horror flick instead - you'll thank me for it.",NA

"TwistedContent","Remains an Impressive Feat All Around","14 December 2021","SPOOKTOBER chapter 7: Re-Watch of a Found-Footage Horror

This quintessential found-footage horror movie is one of the all-time favorites of mine - it scared me stiff as a kid, and truly impresses as a creative filmmaking feat today. If you will still respect it after two decades of great, but mostly significantly lesser copies, it'll still creep you out. This film is also likely the reason I'm a sucker for f-footage/mockumentary horror films, and would very much like to try and materialize one myself someday.

In 1998, directors Daniel Myrick and Eduardo Sanchez launched their own meticulously crafted mythology of the dark, ghostly and gruesome going-ons around Burkittsville online, when the web was still kind of new and relatively contained. A year later a 45 minute documentary aired introducing the story of 3 missing students and the legend of Blair Witch. A week later, this film came out, and fooled many more than just a few of the viewers. I'd recommend, if you're fan, to watch the two movie-accompanying documentaries as well, as they deepen the universe and even contain a couple deleted scenes. I'd also suggest scouring trivia on IMDb for some very interesting behind the scenes events and filmmaking techniques.

Besides terrific direction, the movie is effectively driven by the three main performances - relentless, authentic, and quite tense. In my opinion, this is a movie that serves as the finest example in regards of being scared by the unseen. Primal fears, humane terror, helplessness, distrust, panic, all perpetrated by a force completely out of reach. Except for the sounds... Hands down, one of the most eerie sound design ever. And it's almost ridiculous how they actually pulled all that off. All the ingredients of ""Blair Witch"" grease each other well, creating rather impenetrable atmosphere. Feel it even more in the darkness with earphones.

Not perfect, but damn effective, and today it's rightfully a classic horror film. If we only consider the genre at hand, ""The Blair Witch Project"" is an unspoken masterpiece. It wasn't the first of its kind, but it gave the sub-genre a glorious, powerful kick, and after 20 years, this niche is, however, asking for brazen innovations. My rating: 8/10.","8"
"katwrytr","The Absolute WORST Movie I've Ever Seen","26 July 2000","This film was a complete waste of my time! I almost fell asleep twice in the theatre and nearly walked out several times. I enjoy a good horror/thriller, but this certainly was not one. I'd heard a lot about the movie before my husband and I finally saw it and I was really excited - hoping it would live up to everything I'd heard and that it would actually be scary. HA! When the credits rolled I was still waiting to be scared. (And darn relieved that it was over!!!) The writers failed to create characters I cared about. F this and F that just doesn't cut it. It was totally stupid. And they failed to explain things at all. The idea behind the movie was a good one, yes - but they did not succeed in this modern piece of crap. Don't waste your time, it's not worth it.","1"
"SquigglyCrunch","An Atmospheric Horror Driven by Great Acting and Subtle Terror","9 February 2017","The Blair Witch Project follows a group of students who embark on a trip through the woods to make a documentary about the legend of the Blair Witch, and the horrors which ensue when they decide to do this.

For starters, the acting is all pretty fantastic. All three main actors are great, and in a role like this where they spend most of it beaten down and losing themselves, it really is impressive. Each one of surprisingly genuine, and it's clear that each actor was passionate about this project.

The characters they play are fleshed out and realistic. They talk like real people right from the get-go, and it makes it so much easier to relate to and get behind these characters as real students. Throughout the movie the characters are pushed, and they react in ways you'd expect most of the time. There is one scene where the movie creates unnecessary conflict for itself, where a certain fact would've been better left untold. Otherwise, the writing and characters are very well done.

There are several scenes where the camera is pointed right at the ground and we as the audience can do nothing but sit and listen to the characters. Being a found-footage film, this works very well. First of all, the characters aren't always going to be pointing their camera at whatever they are looking at. It just doesn't make sense, especially in this situation. It also adds a lot to the atmosphere, where we as the audience often live in silent, unknowing terror. We can't see anything, but we can hear the characters talking. While they don't really see much either, it still leaves a lot to the imagination with the limitation of the camera lens. In fact, the movie shows very little even when the characters are pointing the camera where they're looking, and again it creates great atmosphere. You never know what's going to happen next, and in the end you just kind of have to figure it out yourself. It becomes more terrifying without the full knowledge of what exactly is going on, and that is where this movie particularly excels.

Supposedly there was a scene where the camera was supposed to turn and see the Blair Witch standing on a hill, but whoever had the camera at the time didn't do that and it was kept in the final cut, which is in a way more terrifying. We don't know what they saw, and in that way it also leaves more up to the imagination and more to interpret.

Overall The Blair Witch Project is pretty terrifying, and yet it's well-acted, well-written, and just overall well made. I can count about one part where I really didn't like it, but it still makes some sense at least. In the end I would definitely recommend this movie.","8"

"Maxi-14","This isn't your typical horror movie, not by a long shot!","5 August 1999","The first thing that comes to my mind when I think of The Blair Witch Project is bone chilling, the second is amazingly creative. This isn't a slasher film full of blood guts and gore, it's something entirely different, it's frightening. This movie relies on building bone chilling suspense that your own imagination supplies for you, probably more frightening than anything the movie industry could supply you with. You see everything the three film makers in the movie see and you hear what they hear and no more. What you don't see is always more frightening than what you do. It's the unknown that is terrifying and all through this movie you have to contend with the unknown. You never know what is going to happen next. You know that something will but never what. The only contrived aspect of this movie is that these three kids would continue to film through everything that they are experiencing. The movie does try and qualify this by having them explain how it makes them feel better seeing things through the camera's eye. Regardless of that, this is a must see movie.","4"

"nimstic","One of the most frightening films ever","31 October 2013","This movie is serious business, very frightening experience to say the least. Since I am someone who always wanted to make a documentary of my own, I could relate to it more but I am pretty sure, all of us film ourselves during such expeditions these days. The film triumphs in two areas. One in consuming your entire attention span to travel with these three characters, the other in presenting it to you in a more believable, frightening manner (pieced through amateur footage) This movie is an influential work because it then spawned a slew of similarly made movies (although Cannibal Holocaust was made earlier, this seemed more real and entertaining to this day and age). I thoroughly enjoyed the horror aspect of this movie, and I am not someone who finds horror movies very shaking (Except for The Exorcist, of course) but this was quite scary. I felt mind- numbing frustration in situations when the main characters' spirit & tolerance started to decline, and slowly begin to realize how meek, insignificant we are if we are not part of our society or within our comfort zone or left it the dark with an unknown fear factor, with very crazy things happening around you but you can't see or tell what it is. The makers manage to infuse terror in a very natural way too, that's the main success feature of the film. I feel sorry for some viewers in this forum who couldn't enjoy the film because they were trying to make 'sense' out of the characters shooting such frightening situations, calling it unrealistic etc. Probably why IMDb has a low rating for this movie too. It never bothered me, my suggestion is either you don't notice it/disregard it OR you look at film as their passion, or something humans can do in hopeless situations (ie, if I know my fate is sealed in such a terrifying situation, I would consider filming myself so that the world gets to know what happened to me someday, now that I can't save myself anymore). Watch the early interviews with locals carefully (real people) for you to understand the ending very well. Excellent movie. Definitely goes down as one of my all favourites. Cannot think of a major flaw.","8"

"willcundallreview","Creepy stuff going on","16 December 2015","Horror is just one of those genres that get's a pretty bad wrap some days and it's not hard to see why, cruddy remakes, poor acting and sometimes they just feel so unreal they are horrible. Sometimes though horror's come along that not only satisfy those looking for a fright, but also those who watch all kind of films, The Blair Witch Project is exactly that. Of course it was applauded when it first came out for its new take on horror using the hand-held camera and also that it felt much more human than most horror movies that came out in the 90's. It's all about a legend that some kind of thing lives in the woods near Burkitsville (formerly Blair) in Maryland. A trio of students go to search the woods to make a documentary on the legend and well there footage was found a year later and the students have vanished.

The film is quite fantastic in the way it sets itself up, it doesn't try to jump into the end too fast and even with an 81 minute run time it never goes too quick. The plot is well crafted as well and the way in which it jumps between shots is good for the story to move along well and nicely, It can have it's periods where you might get frustrated at the pace but in general nearly overall it is timed well. Of course it isn't hard to get hand-held movies like this done on such a low budget and you can't expect much from this in terms of spectacular things but my word does it not need much of a budget. The creepy feel the people behind this give is spine tingling, never revealing anything properly and always the film uses the dark to great effect.

The people behind this are Daniel Myrick and Eduardo Sanchez who direct and write this and do a fine job, sure everyone especially when it came out heralded the hand-held camera which is great but also these two get things like sound, colour and just generally the whole feel of the movie is spot on. Myrick and Sanchez create a script that has some nice dialogue too, it's the kind of dialogue that most horror movies need the stuff that actually sounds normal and not cheesy or lines that are way over dramatic. The cast are pretty solid too and of course being unknown it has the element of realism in there, of course after leaving the town and heading to the woods you only really see these three characters so the people playing them had to be picked just right and they are, they are likable and at the same time can be unlikeable and that really shows how the characters change as the plot goes along.

The Blair Witch Project isn't something I think all horror fans will like with it's hand-held feel and not a lot of horror that's right in your face, but it works mostly in it's way that is leaves you quite literally in the dark at times. It's spooky and there aren't many more words to describe this movie than that, even when things going on aren't necessarily creepy, you still look around those woods as if something will come out at any moment. In fact watching this I even got to looking into the woods from the very first second they step foot in them, as if expecting some sort of weird thing to come out any second, but if you haven't seen this, you will see what happens.","8"
"seanmartin-97794","Authentic","15 May 2022","I've seen most (good) horror movies and become desensitised to most jumpscare fodder out there. However, Blair Witch remains authentically terrifying due to its unique constitution.

As it was made from so little, with nobody actors abs no major studio behind it, no other film could recreate how real this feels, as the Hollywood lenses are stripped and the footage looks like something you could shoot at your local woods.

This enhances the horror, as by being so grounded in reality, the anticipation of seeing the witch is so much higher as it feels more real, and therefore something that could exist in real life, only exacerbated by the richly cultiva d backstory.

Every jerk of the camera, every noise, every sudden silence only raises the tension. The minimalism of the threats they do encounter only make it feel realer, as instead of flying broomsticks or things to be dismissed as fiction, the clues the witch leave behind remain supernatural enough yet also real enough to play on your mindThis is the first movie to scare me in a long time, remaining in my mind long after the final unforgettable frames.

Best watched 12 at night in pitch black.","10"
"bob_meg","...And if it were released today, people would hate it even more","2 July 2011","How you'll respond to The Blair Witch Project depends on two factors, really. Firstly, if you like your horror movies filled with jump in your seat shocks, tangible glow-in-the-dark monsters, etc...this film is not for you. Also, if you missed it in 1999-2000 as the rock you were under was a tad too cozy, you'll find it to your benefit.

That's because, without overstatement, TBWP is really a publicity stunt wrapped around an urban legend. To say that it's ""of its time"" is a massive understatement, and Eduardo Sanchez and Daniel Myrick have got to be two of the luckiest punks to ever stagger down a pike --- the movie's marketing campaign, based around the at-the-time newly ""hot"" Internet phenom was packed with more elaborate detail and nuance than was the film.

No, what really sells TBWP and makes it somehow work are the performances of the three principals (Heather Donahue, Josh Leonard, and Mike Williams). They completely sell their snide cut-ups, bitch-biting arguments, and escalating tension and fear very well, and, believe me, they had very little to work with.

Although the filmmakers do an OK job at constructing creepy tableaux, it's only the reactions of the actors that send it home. There are absolutely NO effects here --- just three young people running for their lives, holding cameras. If they didn't do so good a job, it's doubtful so many people would have been fooled the first time around.

In ten years, audiences have gotten even more ADD-texting-Twittering crazed and the simple atmospherics of creep don't cut it. Personally, I prefer more psychological horror films, and TBWP takes a nicely creepy story (with some truly unsettling details) and realizes it in a nicely chilly, uncomfortably eerie backdrop.

There's a lot to like, if you look.",NA

Was there nothing more to it than this? I also heard other people comment on it, saying it wasn't that good.

The reaction that I had was not of being blown away but a sense of fear that I had really not felt ever in a movie theater. The film is being described as one of the scariest ever made, and I have to agree! I dont think that it belongs to the traditional horror movie genre, the fear that the filmakers achieve here is not cinematic, it is real, as if we are experiencing what the characters are. I felt like I was living their dilema. I felt nervous from the moment they arrived in the woods. This is the type of movie you experience not watch. Im sure that people are going to analyze this film for years, I honestly believe that there is nothing to analyse, this movie taps into our basic fears. there is one scene in the film that literally is heart-wrenching. People will disect this movie, they will talk about technique and theorise about the filmakers intentions. I believe that their single intention was to scare the audience silly! With me at least, they have succeeded! I have the film's images and sounds floating around in my head. This is truly a unique film! DON'T SEE IT ALONE!!!","9"
"coughlinm","slackers lost in the woods.","22 August 2005","I saw this film when it was first released back in 1999. I will also admit that I was taken in by the enormous hype surrounding the film. In fact that was the main reason I went to see it, I wanted to see what all the fuss was about. So, as I left the Theadora 90 minutes later, I could not help to feel conflicted. Its not that I thought that The Blair Witch Project was a bad movie, Not at all. In fact there is some truly spooky things going on in this movie. The creepiness of the woods with all the wig snapping and such. The ""witch"" ramping up the psychological warfare on our three ""comrads""; this was quite effective movie making. I guess my problem with the movie was that I felt I wasted seven bucks on a fake documentary that pretends to be real that I already know is fake. Even If I didn't know this was a fake before hand, some of the acting is so over the top I could have figured it out easily. Is it just me or did Heather, Josh and Mike come off as thorougher unlikable? So much so that when they finally met they'r demise, my gut reaction was-""OH WELL."" I pariticulary found Heather a foul mouthed little snot. One more F bomb and I was going to reach into the screen and slap her face. All that said, this is still a not too bad movie. If you can get past the endlessly irritating ideologue, this film does have it moments.","5"
"Larry-17","A very good film that might have been better...","4 August 1999","Before anything else, let me say that I liked the film. Nice concept. Well executed. In particular, I appreciate that the film makers leave the central enigma of the movie intact. Peter Weir's in ""Picnic at Hanging Rock"" makes a similar choice. It takes strength of character and confidence to make this kind of choice. It speaks reams about their potential.

Already a thing of talk among independent filmfolk long before it hit theaters, BWP had poked itself into my consciousness a year or so ago. The buzz. The buzz! A website before it was a film. The website, itself, less a billboard than a computer game. The lore: Really cheaply made -- 60 grand, 25 grand, 10 grand! for crineoutloud -- the whole thing improved in the woods in eight wet and stinky days; they gave a trio of actors a couple of cameras and a DAT, led them on a scavenger hunt for clues, left sketchy notes and mind-screwed the cast into near-real fear and panic and late night woodland snipe-hunts. It was all so hip, so coolly generated, so clever. Forget that it had been done before. Forget ""Cannibal Holocaust,"" and others...this one had integrity and a kind of kick-ass honesty about it. Just following all the material about the film before it opened, you just knew that -- if successful -- it was going to be one of those demiurge filmevents that redefined the business and would spawn a thousand mini-urges flailing for a ride.

The buzz and hype! And it's all true. There it is: kind of lovely and clever. It HAS integrity. You like those three people. You buy their weaknesses and still you like them because they're weak like you are weak. They're jerks, but still you like them because they're jerks like all of us.

The actors are good, the self-revelatory stuff is honest -- forget how they did it. (John Ford gave Victor McLaglen the next day off and got him drunk as a skunk the night before the big trial scene in ""The Informer."" Crack of day the next day, Ford dragged McLaglen out of bed and shoved him in front of the camera. Sleep-stupid and whisky-blubbering, fuzz-gargling his lines, shaking all outside and in, McLaglen acted his way through the day and earned an Oscar for his hangover.)

So there! Who cares how they got there, they got there!

And there it was. The personal hype machine worked well for these guys, the short booking worked for them boosting their per screen opening to stratospheric levels. Great.

I still went in thinking the movie was going to be just okay. It was better. It was very good. They might have done a little more with the sound. They might have built the tension a little more. They might have paced it better. They might have... They could have-should have...

Well. It worked.

I will say: I came out of the theater not frightened but moved. I left the theater more impressed with the film makers than their film. Ah, phooey! It was a good night out.

It is, finally, a very good film that could have been better.","8"
"higherall7","Found Objects in the woods...","31 January 2014","Divine Intervention has been known to visit me every now and once in awhile. Spiritual epiphanies have come about from running away to the local Theater Troupe known as Concept East on what used to be Adams Street. There I realized through reading their books that Black People could represent all the Gods there are just as well as the Greeks and the Romans. I was at home sketching Debra Jo Fondren off the cover of Playboy magazine onto a sheet of Newsprint and found I could draw much better thereafter and with more satisfaction and enjoyment. This was a kind of deliverance to me. Idly dropping off the Livernois bus to visit Doctor Curtis' Museum of Black History while unemployed and having time on my hands, I discovered, much to my astonishment, and contrary to what was to be seen on The Science Channel and 'Through The Wormhole', that Black Folks invented as much new technology and made things better for the future as much as anyone else. Besides that, you could trace their accomplishments back through time thousands upon thousands of years.

On top of that, a voice came out of nowhere one day and asked me what my Top Ten Favorite movies of all time were and to list them. I did what the voice bid me to do. At that time the voice asked me what was the common denominator to all these films that I liked so much. This took me a considerable amount of thought before I could formulate a reasonable answer.

When the answer dawned upon me, I marveled at my discovery. The films that I treasured the most in my hearts of hearts despite their subject matter all contained the least amount or no Sex and Violence at all in them! I went over the list again and again, thinking this couldn't possibly be the case for such a random selection of films.

But, for me, it was true.

It was from this that I was able to formulate my hard and fast rule about storytelling.

Sex and Violence are substitutes for Character and Plot development.

That brings us to THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT. There is no romantic relationship or love triangle between the female lead Heather Donahue or the other male characters. There are no scenes of physical conflict between any of the leads. Therefore, a very interesting question comes to mind.

How could a film made for twentynine thousand dollars plus thirty thousand dollars for promotion costs with no apparent Sex and Violence to embroider its narrative yet go on to gross over a hundred and forty million dollars worldwide? Could it be the focus of the film is on storytelling? This is a great film for Independent Filmmakers to study and treasure. THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT, according to my lights, is the film that truly and substantially changed the landscape of Cinema. The simplicity of the idea, the method acting techniques used to prepare the actors to improvise their lines and reactions with sophomoric verisimilitude and sincerity in carefully crafted and yet somewhat open ended situations suggests anyone could have made this film.

Even you.

Sure why not? Anyone could pack their gear and cameras for two or three days of hiking to some place nearby like Seneca Creek State Park to investigate the local Bogeyman legend that's supposed to have happened in the woods somewhere out there. Just take a map and mark your destination so that you don't end up off the beaten track or right back where you started and make a careful record of any suspicious items or objects found on your journey. Hopefully, curiosity won't lead you screaming and running through the woods in the dark fleeing from mysterious sounds in the night. God forbid that all the footage you shoot should end up among the found objects involved with The Blair Witch Legend; that you should end up missing and never heard from again.What a bummer, huh? But it really could happen to anyone.

Even you.

Sure, why not?","9"

A film made to look like a documentary made by 3 college students about an urban legend.

All I will say is this: If you haven't seen it yet, watch it by yourself at night, and tell me you don't feel goosebumps, particularly during the last 5 minutes of the film. I hadn't seen it in a couple of years, literally just finished watching it... I know what happens, and STILL it gives me chills.

There's no FX, no flashy camera work, no witch(!)... and yet it's the most genuinely scary movie I've ever seen. I don't mean you jump because a door bangs, I mean you actually feel the hairs on the back of your neck stand up because... you don't see a damn thing. That is a rare experience.

"Shadiest","A homespun masterpiece","3 August 1999","Simply a refresher course in American cinema, and not just within the horror genre. It meshes the traditional with the unconventional in the right amount, and the improvisation of our three filmmakers is shockingly accurate. The movie represents a triumph for minimalism with its rudimentary cinematography and sound, and a marketing coup of the highest order. ""The Blair Witch Project"" is far from a victim of its own massive hype, however. It represents an escape from the norm, and is a trenchant reminder of how stale feature films have become. In a word, brilliant. 9.5/10",NA
"Giacomo_De_Bello","8.5/10","30 September 2016","As one of the biggest pop culture phenomenons of the last twenty years it feels odd to give a synopsis for ""The Blair Witch Project"". The reason being is that two different versions could be given, one where you talk about a documentary one where you talk about a fictional found footage film. As twenty years have passed I think it's pretty safe to assume anyone who's reading knows this is a fictional film disguised as a documentary from three student filmmakers who go into the woods near the town of Burketsville to investigate the legend of the Blair Witch, believed to haunt the woods.

Even at seventeen years from its release, even to someone like me who didn't see the film until late in the game after having seen other found footage films that used the medium to great effect (""Paranormal Activity"", ""Rec"", Chronicle""), ""The Blair Witch Project"" remains a gem of the horror genre, one of the best ever made, indicative of the fact that what truly scares us is what we don't understand.

To talk about this film is also to talk about the many stories that surround its making which represent the brilliance and the inspiration these filmmakers had for the production. It is a film that, even after all of these years, remains original, fresh, unique and most of all terrifying. It is one of those movies where you just don't believe how they made it, how they came up with certain ideas and techniques, the one where you just keep asking yourself questions throughout the whole duration and one that still lets you enjoy the joy of filmmaking and directing without ever calling attention to itself.

At the heart of this creepy madness are three performances that live on as remarkable efforts of acting and actor's direction. There isn't a false beat in these performances, there isn't a dull moment, you full heartily believe in these three characters, you appreciate them as fully rounder, three dimensional real people which is what ultimately makes this film the more terrifying. Again the stories of how the directors pulled these performances from the actors are fascinating and indicate how truly inspiring, great filmmaking from two individuals that had a clear, beautiful vision for this picture.

The characters manage to feel so alive and real that is where almost all of the horror takes place. In reality what we have as set-pieces are a couple of sounds, one iconic imagery and a final set-piece. Yet it feels like so much more. That is because of how insanely close you manage to get with the characters. The found footage trope was used to extreme brilliance here, it was dictated by story and manages to bring us into the world of these people as no other medium could have ever had. I mean you feel every drop of sweat, every breath and insanity the characters are put through, it is absolutely harrowing.

Moreover, the film also manages to have a thematic line and delves deeply into the realms of starving, desperation, getting lost and confronting yourself with death. All of this subtext it what actually makes the film as tension filled and scary as it is. The raw portrayal of this wears you out by the end and you have just the same will of these characters to get the f**k out of the woods.

As a big horror fan, as a true film fan, as a lover of the art of filmmaking and as an adrenaline junkie I cannot recommend ""The Blair Witch Project"" enough, turn off all your lights, put away all other electronic devices, make sure the screen is the only source of light surrounding you and experience this film in all of its glory, you will have a blast, it lives on as one of the scariest films ever made.","8"
"glgioia","2 Words - Cell Phone!!","29 October 2002","Just kidding, its hard to believe this movie is only 3 years old...seems like I've been watching it for much longer. Regardless, the film takes place back in the dark ages of 1994, when cell phones weren't as yet handed out to all citizens at birth. I've seen this movie many many times, and it still chills me. Its become the ""Its a Wonderful Life"" of the Halloween season. It expertly exploits the lingering childhood fears of the woods after dark, and the haunted abandoned house. Once again if you keep the supernatural question unanswered, (pay attention Hollywood), it is still possible to scare the fertilizer out of audiences. Film makers are usually just not willing to work that hard. This film has no sex or violence, and only the smallest tiniest dollop of gore. Yet it smokes any movie for fright thats been made in the last 20 years. The performances and writing are brilliantly natural and completely believable, and pose an interesting sociological study on group behavior in crisis. The ""I would have done this"", and ""they are stupid, why didn't they just""...thoughts and debates are what makes the film a masterpiece. Horror films about the woods have been made before, but sadly rarely make use of the woods per se, as the cuplrit of fear. Pity, that fear is deep in our psyche, stamped in our makeup, and if you cleverly storytell, a nut with a hockey mask and chainsaw are hardly required to bring it to the surface.","9"

The film its really about three filmmakers who are lost in the woods, after that, a bunch of mysterious events happen. The best part of the film are the arguments these three assholes have with each other, tension rises as they get even more lost in the woods, you don't even need a witch to make this film unnerving.

For its style and techniques the film deserves all kinds of praise, I wont say that this is better than a big budget horror film, but its definitely worthy of recognition for the effort that these independent filmmakers put into the film.

Overall, the film may not be for everyone for its lack of real scares and explanation, but I don't think that it needs any more explanation, I think its better to leave it to the audience.","8"
"Hermit C-2","Succeeds on its own terms but let's hope it's not the wave of the future.","11 August 1999","When a film comes along with this much pre-release buzz it's difficult to go into the theatre without SOME kind of preconceived notion about what it is and what it's supposed to do. After seeing it, my feeling is that it was a very good film, using a concept that hasn't been done to death and one that served the filmmakers well. Let's hope, however, that this will not now become the cinematic wave of the future. We don't need every bunch of amateurs in the world running around with camcorders doing pseudo-cinema verite documentaries and foisting them on the public!

The appeal of 'BWP' to me was not as The World's Scariest Movie but rather as an examination of what stress and fear can do do people in adverse and extraordinary circumstances. Looking at it this way I think it succeeded admirably. One of my favorite moments in the film comes when the two young men almost get hysterical when they find they've been tramping through the woods all day and have arrived at the place they started. Heather, the filmmaker, repeatedly assures them that they haven't, then out of their hearing breaks down crying, confessing to herself that in fact they are back where they began.

The idea to suggest frightening sights rather than to show them was a good one that works well. There was one point, though, when Heather was running in fear and screams ""What the **** is that!"" that I thought they could have at least shown a shadowy suggestion of SOMETHING. But I can't criticize the direction the filmmakers took, because it worked. I think they made the film they set out to do. A masterful job was done of building suspense throughout the entire movie and the climax occurs right at the very last moment, like the best Edgar Allan Poe stories. Hype and expectations aside, I thought 'The Blair Witch Project' succeeded on its own terms.","8"
"mnpollio","A triumph of marketing genius over substance or style","9 May 2010","More than 10 years after its premiere and many who watch this film may well wonder what in the world the hubbub was about. The truth is that the marketing campaign for the film is a far more interesting topic than anything that appears in the film itself (more on that later). A relatively simple tale of three amateur documentary filmmakers who vanish into the Maryland woods while investigating the title phenomena is the center of this film. The amateur nature of the film-making in that everything we see is fairly badly shot through a jittery hand-held camcorder is supposed to add authenticity and accentuate the ""you are there"" atmosphere of the unknown a la Romero's Night of the Living Dead. Unfortunately, a glaring discrepancy is that Romero's film actually had a solid premise to hang its low-budget authenticity on and the Blair Witch Project has nothing of the kind. The opening moments which introduce us to three characters, played by Heather Donahue, Joshua Leonard and Michael Williams, are dreadfully uninteresting and fail to do much to ingratiate the leads, other than to emphasize that Donahue is a type-A control freak who micromanages the entire foray into the woods badly. If anyone can figure out what the ""legend"" is that is supposed to be so fascinating to inspire a documentary and propel this story forward, they are doing better than I. The mishmash of background provided by snippets of interviews with locals indicate that the legend may or may not have something to do with a witch, a ghost and/or an old male psycho who kidnaps people - the entire explanation is murky at best, which is a fatal flaw since we have no idea what exactly these people are searching for. While there would be some suspense to be mined from easily losing one's way in the wilderness, that quickly dissipates thanks to the ill-tempered characters basically shouting and cursing at other with dialog that is rather painfully made up on the fly. The supernatural elements are total misfires due to two issues: 1) for much of the time, when the characters claim to hear something ominous in the nighttime forest, the audio is so bad that we often cannot hear the same things, and 2) the reactions to the most minor of events are so hysterical as to induce unintentional laughter (ie., someone sees a pile of sticks in the forest, which results in screaming and running). Of the actors, Leonard makes little impact in his limited screen time, Donahue is shrill and annoying, and Williams hints that he might have been able to do something worthwhile within a better structured film. By the end, few if anyone will know what, why, where, how or who The Blair Witch is. It is truly a shame that some of the savvy poured into the marketing did not wend its way into the film. Over-hyped as the little film that came out of no where, such a claim was near laughable since the internet had been abuzz for months before its release laying the ground work for the film and deliberately confusing easily credulous viewers that it was true and what they were seeing was actually a video found abandoned in the woods rather than actors playing a badly written plot. Coupled with a front page Time Magazine article, ready-to-be-duped patrons flocked in droves to see the true story of the poor young victims obliterated by the supernatural, only to subsequently be disappointed in that they were conned and the production they were conned into seeing was a badly filmed, motion sickness inducing, amateurishly acted mess. Don't believe me? Seriously, try to find anyone in the physical world (not in the anonymity of the internet) who will actually admit to having been terrified or even marginally entertained by this film. It takes a really long search. And in the age of similarly filmed efforts like Cloverfield or Paranormal Activity, Blair Witch's fading star gets less notable with each passing year.","3"

"matthewreinink","A relic of its time that doesn't hold up","21 October 2022","This movie was a big deal when it came out. The way it was marketed as real, the found footage gimmick was relatively new, and the way it feels like something you shouldn't be watching pulled audiences in. But watching this without the hype of the time really dampens the viewing experience. While I think the actors do a great job, and the beginning of the movie before they enter the woods truly feels like a home video. That's about where the compliments end though.

This movie is incredibly boring, aside from the final 5 minutes of the movie. Unfortunately, the low budget really hurts this movie as the scares just aren't there to keep my attention.

"beetree","Very interesting, straight forward movie with some scares.","1 August 1999","Yes, the movie was over-hyped, however, it delivers an original thriller that does kinda get to you after a while.

The best concept film in a while; The movie takes a basic horror concept that has been around for centuries (a witch or witch like being) and combines it with simple, straight forward plot lines and dialog to make a very interesting film.

Probably the only thing really scary about the film is that it does not give you anything NOT to believe. There are no special effects or over-made monsters as the antithesis in the film. The location could be Anywhere, USA and the cast made you believe what was happening. All and all, you could almost believe that you were watching something that actually happened.

Unfortunately, ALMOST is the key word. The problem with the movie as a ""horror"" film is that you cannot suspend belief enough to really get scared. That is true in a sense of all horror films, but others have something PHYSICAL (like Michael Myers) that haunts you, even if you know it is not real. Blair Witch Project delivers as a thriller that makes you wonder what will happen as the movie progresses, but leaves you ultimately unfulfilled. It HAD to end the way it did, you just wish it didnt.

Overall, the film is worth seeing for the concept and as a good thriller... you may even get terrified if you can suspend your belief more than I. (7/10)","5"
"Elvis-Del-Valle","A revolutionary movie at the time, but not a very good movie","14 March 2023","As a horror film I must say that it is highly overrated since it is not really a very good film, in fact it is quite boring and the only reason why it has some support is because it was made in the form of a documentary, which it makes it look pretty real and a lot of people thought it was a real tape. On that side it is an interesting experiment, but only that could be rescued. It is not a film that anyone can see and it is understood that the way it was made at the time was revolutionary enough to create more films of this nature and that can be recognized, but many films that came later such as Paranormal Activity, VHS or Rec, are in a certain way superior to this film that originated this type of film. This film may now be a classic, but it is another era and it has aged in a different way that is not even scary and that is why as a film itself it is bad, as a horror film it is mediocre and I would only recommend it for those who are curious to want to explore a bit about how to do something independent with few resources since I see this film more as study material and not as a film itself. Personally I think the sequel is a little better and the third is undoubtedly the best of the trilogy because at least it's seriously scary. My rating for this movie is 6/10.","6"
"Gunnar_Runar_Ingibjargarson","Damn good horror movie!","18 June 2008","Anyone who has even the slightest trouble with insomnia after seeing a horror movie should stay away from The Blair Witch Project--this film will creep under your skin and stay there for days. Credit for the effectiveness of this mock documentary goes to filmmakers Daniel Myrick and Eduardo Sanchez, who armed three actors (Heather Donahue, Michael Williams, and Josh Leonard) with video equipment, camping supplies, and rough plot outlines. They then let the trio loose into the Maryland woods to improvise and shoot the entire film themselves as the filmmakers attempted to scare the crap out of them. Gimmicky, yes, but it worked--to the wildly successful tune of $130 million at the box office upon its initial release (the budget was a mere $40,000). For those of you who were under a rock when it first hit the theaters, The Blair Witch Project tracks the doomed quest of three film students shooting a documentary on the Burkittsville, Maryland, legend of the Blair Witch. After filming some local yokels (and providing only scant background on the witch herself), the three, led by Heather (something of a witch herself), head into the woods for some on-location shooting. They're never seen again. What we see is a reconstruction of their ""found"" footage, edited to make a barely coherent narrative. After losing their way in the forest, whining soon gives way to real terror as the three find themselves stalked by unknown forces that leave piles of rocks outside their campsite and stick-figure art projects in the woods. (As Michael succinctly puts it, ""No redneck is this clever!"") The masterstroke of the film is that you never actually see what's menacing them; everything is implied, and there's no terror worse than that of the unknown. If you can wade through the tedious arguing--and the shaky, motion-sickness-inducing camera-work--you'll be rewarded with an oppressively sinister atmosphere and one of the most frightening denouements in horror-film history. Even after you take away the monstrous hype, The Blair Witch Project remains a genuine, effective original.","7"
"hughbra","Might be the best horror flick ever made!","11 July 2000","This is a real winner of a horror film. Starting off slowly the suspense builds in an ever-increasing crescendo of terror until the final sequence, which is definitely not for the faint-of-heart. The film held the audience on the edge of their seats throughout, and it even translates well to video and DVD. Considering the budget, and the experience level of the filmmakers, this might very well be the best horror film ever made.","10"
"Rendanlovell","A great found footage horror flick","2 August 2016","Now that we are getting a second sequel this year I finally decided to watch the OG 'Blair Witch Project'. Now that I've gotten around to it I'm glad I did. What's interesting about this film is that, even now, it remains one the most renowned horror movies ever. Yet, it's also the same movie that accrued a Razzie nomination for worst picture of the year. So which is it? Is it one of the greatest exercises in horror or one of the worst? In my humble opinion it's one the best. Although I wouldn't necessarily call it a horror. For my taste it's more of a thriller than anything. If you aren't aware, the film follows three young adults who venture into the woods in search of a story.

A story for their documentary. Which explains the reason for the found footage style. Before this movie there really wasn't anything like this. And with the viral marketing suggesting that it was a legit thing, people were genuinely frightened for the cast. Apparently sending letters to the cast families expressing their condolences for their losses.

Even with the excess of found footage films these days this one some how still feels fresh. This mainly has to do with the lack of gimmicks and clichés despite it revolutionizing a genre. There isn't any slow pan left and slow pan right followed by a jump scare. Nor is there the constant wonder as to why the characters have a camera at all times.

The reason it defined a genre is because it did it so well. And now all we have is overused troupes that intend on jumping their audience to death. The thing that genuinely shocked me while watching was how the film understood that less is more. There isn't a single jump scare that I remember and there isn't a single time that you actually see the antagonist.

The film understands that if it where to show the witch and sets rules for it that it would become vastly more difficult to scare you. By not having these rules set it can basically do what ever it wants without any one saying, ""That doesn't make sense."". It helps you as the audience feel and experience whats happening through the characters perspective. As more things start to happen and they start to question what is going to happen next, so do you.

This intentional lack of a monster or rules makes this incredibly unsettling to watch. It feels authentically supernatural. The performances by these three unknown actors really helped sell this even more. They aren't all that good honestly, but the writing and editing for the film made everything come across convincing and natural. Not everything here works though.

As I said, the performances can be quite shaky. They clearly aren't trained actors and some of their interactions can be rather cringy. But the biggest issue I have comes from some of the characters behavior. There are many times when they act so irrational that it's near impossible to not get frustrated at the film. Like when a character tosses a valuable object into a river just because he personally deemed it ""useless"".

However this film honestly shocked me. It blows me away how diversified its audience is when it comes to whether they liked it or not. It may not be that scary but it's incredibly unsettling. The film is unpredictable, natural, and uncommonly convincing. It isn't exactly a perfect horror experience due to some poor performances and questionable behavior, but it's such an interesting dive into human physique. Watching these people go completely bonkers was way more enjoyable, and unsettling than it should have been.","8"

"Cloud-20","Brilliant movie, but not as scary as I thought it was going to be","1 September 1999","*Contains Spoilers*

I went to go see Blair Witch project this past week. I've heard mixed reviews about it. Some people say it was ""Scary as hell."" I've heard other people say ""This movie is horrible."" I decided to go see it and make my own decision.

A friend and I went to a Matinee, there was about 4 or 5 other people in the theater. Throughout the 90's we've been exposed to some of the most god awful horror movies of our time, but this was a definent change of pace. This movie is a lot better than any horror I've seen in a long time. It doesn't take special fx to scare people, and this movie proves that. I really liked Blair Witch Project, but it didn't scare me much. The last 10mins or so was the only scary part of the movie. The final images in this movie will be in your head for days. Other than the last bit, I wasn't terribly frightened as some people have been. It was more of a thriller.

No one is going to enjoy this film if they didn't pay attention at the beginning when they were interviewing the towns people. If you didn't listen to the conversations you wouldn't understand what was going on in the woods (the piles of rocks, etc). The stupidist people in the world were sitting in front of me during this movie. Halfway through the movie when they come back to the same log they were at eariler, a person in front of us asked, ""Why is she crying? Is that the same log.""

This is a good movie and if your a fan of the horror genre go out and see this, but don't expect to be too terrified.",NA

There was some great one liners in here as well. The witch freaked me out even though you never saw her, also to get the ending you have to listen closer when they interview some locals from Blair.",NA
"cgearheart","It's the principle of the thing","17 July 2019","Nowadays, millennials will not find the original Blair Witch movie to be scary. That's because they know it's fake. However, people didn't know that 20 years ago. It was less about how well done the craft of the actual film was and more about how convincing the marketing, the producing, and behind the scenes tension was. It played so heavily into the film along with the marketing that it legit convinced people that there was an actual witch who was killing people. Almost like a modern radio broadcast of Orson Welles' War of the Worlds, The Blair Witch Project is an important piece of horror movie history,strictly for it's refreshing new take on horror: found footage.

"LV426","It's what you don't see that keeps you up at night","28 August 1999","This movie is perhaps the most intense I have ever seen. It's up there with ""The Shining"" as the most horrifying movie. This movie disturbed me on so many levels. First there was the hoax that it was real. Very clever. Then there was the uneasy feeling that you were watching a snuff film. Also very clever. Lastly they didn't show you ""the thing"" in the woods. If I saw an old lady flying through the woods I would have left the theatre. After all the human imagination is the most terrifying thing of all. This movie won't affect you until hours later when you're in bed and the lights go out.",NA
"eudoxus","Wait until you can rent it.","31 August 1999","I finally saw this film, after hearing much about it from my friends. Everyone I talked to loved the film, so I am afraid that my expectations were a little high.

If you've been told that the hand-held camera might cause motion sickness, believe it. I had a splitting headache by the end. If you tend to get motion sickness, you may wish to avoid this film.

The Blair Witch Project represents the maximum result with a minimum budget. Unlike many low-budget films, it stays within its means. The film could not have been improved by putting more money into it. The acting was likewise very good.

I'm not sure, however, that this was cut out to be a feature film. At 80 minutes it falls well short of full-length, but it felt more like 100 or 110 to me. The dialogue was repetitive, but little could be done to vary it. I would have enjoyed the film far more if it were 60 minutes. And maybe paired with another shorter film.

I would also recommend not viewing this in the theater. The picture is filmed completely on videotape and 16mm, so the wide screen gives you no advantage. Unlike most horror films, The Blair Witch Project uses no shocking visual effects to frighten the audience. I found it difficult to be frightened by pure suspense in a crowded theater. The imagination runs much more freely at home. I reserve final judgement on this one until I've seen it after midnight at a party with just a couple friends in a house in the middle of nowhere. . .","7"
"Jordan-36","Overrated but not bad","5 September 1999","I expected to be disappointed in the Blair Witch Project because there was no way any film could live up to the hype this project has received. I saw it last night and was pleasantly surprised. No, this isn't the greatest horror film ever made but it wasn't terrible. MINOR SPOILERS AHEAD While the actual night attacks weren't so much scary as just confusing, the finale in the shack was truly nerve-wracking. The house itself was a brilliant example of shooting in the exact right location. The acting was okay but the improvised nature of the performances had definite drawbacks -- for instance, the two guys tended to switch personalities from scene to scene. While it was obvious that Heather was ""acting"", it actually worked as evidence of her character's desire for everything to be a movie. The story behind the film is more interesting than the film itself but on the whole, the Blair Witch Project is neither the disaster nor the masterpiece that everyone else seems to be making it out to be. I doubt that directors will ever do anything else of note but they have nothing to be ashamed of with this project. As for the most frightening movie ever made (or at least the most frightening that I've ever seen), I'd have to go with the Shining. Its the only horror film I've ever seen where just thinking about some of the images can still make me jumpy.",NA
"tsf-1962","scary as hell","2 January 2007","Sometimes the best ideas are the simplest. Who would have thought three college kids being chased by an unseen ghost would have become one of the highest-grossing films of all time? The idea was so simple, almost quaint, I wish I'd thought of it. I'd be sitting in a hot tub in Aruba with Paris Hilton now . . . but that's a different story. This film struck a chord with the American public that's hard to identify. What did the Blair Witch represent? Was she nature, raped and despoiled by male-dominated American bourgeois society? Was she the Goddess of the Witches, Hecate, striking back for having been persecuted by Christianity? Or was the film itself an affirmation of Christian values, as so many horror films ironically are? Certainly the three student filmmakers come to grief after scoffing at the Bible-toting old woman's chilling tale of her own encounter with the Blair Witch. The film has obvious parallels with Stephen King's ""It"" and much of H.P. Lovecraft. Whatever. Anyone can make a movie, but not everyone can make a GOOD movie. ""The Blair Witch Project"" succeeded in part due to clever Internet hype, but largely due to the raw, cinema-verite film-making that imparted grisly authenticity to what otherwise might have been a cheesy exploitation film, and to the superb improvisational skills of three talented young character actors--Heather Donahue, Josh Leonard, and Mike Williams. We could identify with them thanks to their very ordinariness. They were everyone's son, daughter, boyfriend, brother, sister. Their plight reminded one of soldiers caught behind enemy lines in wartime . . . Ironically, the real Burkitville MD (yes, Virginia, there is a Burkitville) is close to the sight of some major Civil War battles. The bottom line is, it's a darn good film.","9"
"RichyB-3","I should have warned you!!!","11 November 1999","My apologies to all those Cinema goers in the rest of the world. I feel as though you should have been warned you that if you go to see this 'home video, you'll feel as though you've been hugely ripped off. I did! I saw BWP in my local cinema; a place where I have known people to stand and applaud at the end of a film (sad but true). The only reaction when this one finished was an audible groan and mutterings of 'was that it?'.

The best way to describe it is annoying. The jumpy, grainy picture is annoying. The constant bickering and profanity is annoying. The huge holes in the story (go downstream!!) are annoying and, above all, the totally unsatisfactory ending is annoying. I sat and watched past the credits just in case they'd snuck something in to explain what had been going on!

OK, having said all of the above, it does have one thing going for it. It's got people talking about films (at the time of typing, there are over 1900 other comments posted). It's provoked a reaction, be it good or bad, and there haven't been that many films recently that have done that. Unfortunately for me the reaction is negative, but I will remember the film.","1"

The movie is about three college students who go in the woods to film a documentary about the famed Blair witch who find out there is something wrong with that wood and they find out a little late for a persons liking. The film builds up to the conclusion extremely well and is the first movie that I have ever been so freaked out that I wanted to close my eyes in ( did not though as wanted to see end). Everone who enjoys watching horror movies will watch this movie and be proud that finally a movie can use its low budgetness to its advantage and still be generally scary.

The plot made no sense at all, none of the weird events are ever explained, and the way this movie ended really made me angry. It made no sense and it came too quickly. At the end the characters finally DO something, and then the movie finishes. What a rip-off! A lot of people went to see this movie in America and they all paid perfectly good money to see it. And this is what they got? I really feel sorry for them. They were robbed by two inept amateurish filmmakers. I'm happy i've seen it on DVD. At least i paid less.

One last thing: i just hate that stupid ""documentary""! It tries to convince you that it's all real, while it's just a movie and all the interviewees are actors. Everything they said was lies. And that just disgusted me, because you expect facts from a Documentary, not lies.",NA

"Brogan","This does to camping what JAWS did for swimming.","16 June 1999","1999 is quite a remarkable year for the cinema. With the comedy genre coming back strong with the brilliant ANALYZE THIS, now the horror genre is back in it's most chilling form with THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT. It seemed like that the horror genre was going downhill with such recent horror films as ""I KNOW WHAT YOU DID LAST SUMMER,"" ""URBAN LEGEND,"" ""BRIDE OF CHUCKY,"" ""WISHMASTER,"" and the idiotic and trendy ""SCREAM"" movies. The only recent films that were considered good horror films were ""EVENT HORIZON"" and ""JOHN CARPENTER'S VAMPIRES."" Now, just like 1978 with John Carpenter's ""HALLOWEEN"" the terror in films is brought back to a new figure. And sad to say, years from now, everybody is going to be copying this film. THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT is about three young student film-makers who go to the small town in Maryland formerly called ""Blair."" In this town they wish to uncover the mystery about the Blair Witch legend. With interviews with the town locals, they tell stories that range from typical bedtime stories to urban legends. Then the students wish to go out a seek this mysterous ""graveyard"" where some of these burials occur. As they go out into the woods looking for this graveyard, they begin to get deeper and deeper into a horrible and scary world that they never knew that they would be getting into. This is what I call a SCARY movie. It makes SCREAM and SCREAM 2 look like a Disney movie. What makes it scary? We can all relate to what these filmmakers are going through. 1.) Being lost: we all get lost, and when we get lost, we get paranoid, confused, and scared. These people getting lost in the woods can only cause them to not concentrate as much as they should. 2.) The scary noises in the dark: when we go outside at night, and you hear scary noises that make you wonder what that was. This film has plenty of those, enough to have your heart racing. 3.) Being the outsiders: these people don't know their way around, they don't know the people or the forrest that well. With this, they are like fish out of water which can also cause confusion. 4.) The terror that lurks: these people know that there is terror that lurks in the dark with them, and from time to time there will be some very terrifying and scary surprises. This is a horror film with no music soundtrack! There's no suspense music, no gory make-up, no silly looking person wearing a hockey mask. This is the kind of terror that is among us. The kind we think about when we are alone. This is without a doubt one of the best movies of 1999! This is going to be placed among Independent Film Hall of Fame along with PULP FICTION, CITIZEN RUTH, BOUND, TRAINSPOTTING, and LOCK STOCK & TWO SMOKING BARRELS. This is a excellent movie, and like the last movie that did this (SAVING PRIVATE RYAN) it makes you feel like that you are lost among these unfortunate souls. Writer/Directors Daniel Myrick and Eduardo Sanchez have a successful hit on their hands. They will more than likely be writing and directing some more movies for big studios in the future. And don't be surprised that the stars will be making television appearances just to alert the pubilc that this is a fictional movie. Or is it? A terrfying masterpiece! ***** (out of *****)","8"

If the fans of today expect a horror film like SCREAM (which is pretty pathetic), then of course they won't like this film. The audiences of today don't want to get involved in horror films, they don't want to think, it's sad but true! While watching this movie, you have to become involved with the movie, pay attention to everything, analyze the events that are happening, come to conclusions of your own. That is how you will really get scared. Let your imagination do the work or are you too lazy to do that?

The first time Heather dropped the Conversational F-bomb I did an internal uh-oh. When she ""interviewed"" the crazy lady she constantly interrupted her and completed her sentences... another nasty trait of the lead character.

The ""dialogue"" which I have now read was impromptu is non-existent. Because (mostly) SHE has sworn so much when she is not upset she is left with nothing more to say so she just yells bleepables louder. I gave up after 33 minutes and only stayed that long because I did not want to be mocked by my fellow viewers .. one of whom actually said .. ""That film was in pretty good condition for having been in the camera in the woods so long"" ... HE thinks it really IS a documentary.

Then we heard a few ""That was so stupid"", a couple ""That was okay"" and yes we saw one person actually shaking and had to sit down while walking out. I guess the scariest thing about it is what if it was real?",NA

The Blair Witch Project trod upon new ground in filmmaking in that it let the viewer's imagination fill in (some but not enough of) the voids left out of the actual film footage. Objectively speaking, this movie accurately portrayed increasing feelings of despair, fear, and hopelessness as experienced first hand. I experienced a true sense of fear and even dread a few times during some of the night sequences. I never knew what was going to materialize out of the darkness, and when the lights came on it was almost worse. The daytime sequences were too ""real"". Imagine shooting video while running through a wooded area looking through the viewfinder. My wife literally got nauseous. My advice? Borrow two expensive camcorders, give one to a friend and tape each other running aimlessly through a wooded area shouting the ""F"" word about once every 10 seconds or so. Be sure to include some too-close close ups and some night shots of nothing in particular. Continue until both cameras are broken. Now sit down together and figure out how you're going to explain the broken equipment. That's watching ""The Blair Witch Project"" in a nutshell, feelings and all.",NA

It was original and it was very very intelligent. Anyone really pay attention to the ending? Anyone pay attention to the point the whole movie makes? I doubt it no one seemed to listen to it, or really understand what it was trying to prove: Movies can be scary without gore, or seeing anything. Um did Chris Rock ever think about the 35,000 (not 60,000) all going to crew, cast and stuff? Get over it people Blair Witch is a new classic, and it cannot be classified as anything else but that!","10"

Weren't the people in the movie suppose to be film students so the first thing they would learn, is how to have a steady aim!","1"
"robastyk","Over-rated Schlock","17 January 2010","When this movie came out I listened to the hype for quite a while. I've loved horror movies most of my life though I gave up on them when they sank into special-effects gore-fests and expressions of very personal paranoia in the 1980s. I finally gave this film a try when it came to a second run house in my city that charged 99 cents per ticket. One can see anything for 99 cents. When I left, the manager asked what I'd thought of the movie. He knew that I was a regular and that I liked films generally. I told him I thought he owed me at least 98 cents.

In summary, a group of young people with video equipment wander out into the woods on the Maryland/West Virginia border. To characterize their combined I.Q.'s as ""super 8"" would be too generous. The area in which they get lost in the woods is rural but not the Amazonian rain forest or the wastes of Siberia. Walking for less than an hour in any direction would bring them to a road, a task that is far from impossible to accomplish. Still they get lost. Once they are lost they descend into fear and get, as if such a thing were possible, even stupider. In the end the alleged Blair Witch does us all the great service of removing these self-indulgent idiots from the gene pool. The really bad news is that the witch takes about 90 minutes to accomplish that removal. She's just too darned slow.

This movie does not have the utterly misguided and endearing incompetence that make Ed Wood's films like Plan 9 From Outer Space a guilty pleasure. It's not even worth renting for the pleasure of throwing popcorn at the screen.","1"
"JeffG.","Now THIS is a horror film!","2 August 1999","After the barrage of awful ""Scream"" clones that Hollywood has been force-feeding the public for the past several years, two unknown filmmakers have brought us a film that should show people what makes a truly effective horror film.

The acting from the three stars was in fine form and the ad-libbed dialogue was really impressive. It was totally convincing and never seemed fake or contrieved. It was interesting and rather unnerving seeing the them start out as cocky and full of gusto (especially Heather) and go on a slow, gradual emotional and psychological decline. How they gradually started getting more ditraught about their predicament and started turning on each other. Their ""discoveries"" in the woods and the sounds in the distance was creepy for the audience as well as the characters.

I was rather impressed at how they didn't use background music to cue the audience in on when to feel unnerved. The movie relied solely on the environment and the reactions of the characters to set the mood. I used to think that a movie with no music would never work but it looks like I was wrong.

The last ten minutes of the movie were especially creepy. I could actually feel my heart racing. And the ending blew me, and the rest of the audience, away.

It's nice to finally see someone make a horror movie the way it should be done. No cheap ""jump"" shots. No young, photogenic stars from the WB network. No hit alternative rock soundtrack. Just good old fashioned mood and atmosphere. Recommended.",NA
"eke826s","The public must get some taste!","17 August 1999","I read through articles and comments on The Blair Witch Project and it makes me sick. To think that some people actually are walking out on this movie. I mean it has to be one of the most original ideas ever put on the silver screen. Without even spending .1% of the money that Titanic did. The creators of Blair Witch created something much more enjoyable. Anyone who can't enjoy this movie needs to get some taste, and quit expecting a senseless form of entertainment.","10"
"zinemani","The best horror movie in the 90's...or is it ever?","4 January 2000","""The Blair Witch Project"" is a thruly amazing film, an effective machine of horror and despair, that, if you're willing to (because if you're not, it just doesn't work), it will disturb you. Great cast, specially the female lead (whose ""I'm so sorry"" sequence is unforgettable) and very expert and inteligent construction of fear. Final ten minutes are hell on earth, specially the ending bit where... Along with ""Texas Chain Shaw Massacre"" and ""John Carpenter's Halloween"", ""The Blair Witch Project"" is a must. Unfortunatly, it will be seen by too many people because of the publicity, and it will be stupidly hated, parodied, clones, imitated and...sequeled. No matter what people say to you, rent it or buy it (on DVD, because of the ""Curse of the Blair Witch"" documentary), see it alone, in the dark, in late night, and willing to enjoy it. It is worth it. If you've already seen it...just see it again!","10"
"drewinlove","I know it's a fake, but still scary.","12 October 2001","Before I saw ""the Blair witch project"", all of the mass media said that it was a fiction, more real than a non-fiction. I took it as a commercial thing, only to raise concern. They also recommended to go ad check the ""Blairwitch.com"", an official web site of the movie.( Later,I was aware of the fact that without the basic information of the movie, it isn't scary at all.) I took their recommend and saw the movie finally. At first, the trembling of the scenes and unfamiliar actors seemed to me that it was pretending to be a sort of documentaries. But as running of the movie, I found myself trembling with fear just like the actors doing at the scenes. Even the subject of the fear,like Freddy Kruger, appears enough. It just gives you the feelings that you are chased with something, and you can sleep peacefully no more. It's the beauty of the film. It's not that kind of bloody horror movie. Without lots of blood, screaming, and chopped body, the Blair witch project team made it a really scary movie. Except The Blair Witch Project and The Exorcist, no horror movie made it ""horror"" only with unidentified thing and people's fear and insanity ever. I know it's a fake, but still scary. Literally SCARY.","10"

I thought it must be well acted, to convince so many that it was real. Then when I saw it, I could not see how anyone would have believed it to be real. It looked more like, teens at a camp playing around video, than a movie. It was not scary. The only suspense was when would it end.

Proof that a low budget movie can be just as good as one with a lavish budget. The creators and directors must be geniuses. I'd like to see the footage they scrapped, too. Even the name ""Rustin Parr"" is too perfect! Can't think off hand on how this movie could be improved except I wish it was longer.","10"
"TheMovieDoctorful","""You gonna write us a happy ending, Heather?""","2 March 2019","I mentioned in my review of Mandy how some films transcend the boundaries of mere entertainment to become a true experience. The Blair Witch Project is one of those films. It never fails to re-capture the distant feeling of being a child growing up on the American East Coast during Halloween, when one could feel the aura of the supernatural in the air. When one had reason to be afraid to venture off into the woods. It's a film that grabs me by the head, looks me in the eye and says ""Yes. There is still some black magic left in this world."" No Horror movie has ever left me feeling more vulnerable or small than The Blair Witch Project has and it never fails to weave its frightening spell to this day. This is still the only film to ever give me nightmares.

The dark allure of The Blair Witch Project begins long before film students Heather, Josh and Mike begin shooting in the demonic Black Hills Woods. Even the casual interviews with friendly town folk have an ominous tone to them. There is an unspoken but widely acknowledged truth to the legend of the Blair Witch and the legacy of Rustin Parr that you can feel from their testimonies; something wicked is afoot in the Black Hills Woods, (""I don't go up there! I believe enough not to go up there!"") but acknowledging that such an evil entity could live in their midst would mean facing their own insignificance and helplessness to its whims. The only one willing to fully accept the terrible truth is the village idiot, Mary Brown. The crew's misunderstanding of town resident's vague responses as being full on denial of the occult evil that haunts Burkittsville will ultimately spell their doom.

It says a lot about the performances of these actors that they deceived an entire country into believing they had watched a snuff film. Heather Donahue perfectly embodies the strength, confidence and absent minded genius of her on-screen counterpart. Her enthusiasm and passion for filmmaking are inspiring, even as we watch her ambition, the shadow of her arrogance, become her ultimate undoing. Her screams of horror and cries of hysteria are some of the most chilling and convincing in film history. Joshua Leonard very easily could have just been the annoying stoner type, but his subtle, heightened aggression and descent into madness over the course of the film really helps to benefit the tension that Daniel Myrick and Eduardo Sanchez are trying to build with this trio. Mike Williams is deeply sympathetic as perhaps the most emotionally vulnerable member of the team, retaining a sense of innocence and naivety compared to his crew members that constantly had me rooting for him. And Lilith almighty, what a convincing screamer.

For a found footage film, the visual direction in The Blair Witch Project is among the best I've ever witnessed. The woods are shot in a way that we never quite get a feel for just how far they span; they could go on from anywhere between 5 and 500 miles. All we have to shape our judgment are the sky and the endless expanse of dying, decaying trees. The 16mm camera and Hi8 camcorder give the film a disturbingly personal and nostalgic feel. The horrifying events that befall the trio of film students could easily be home video tapes of relatives or friends. Because of this, footage like countless stick figures being hung in the trees miles deep into the woods feels far more real, and the off-putting, unnatural and macabre tone of it hits a lot harder. Forget ""putting yourself in the characters shoes"", The Blair Witch Project is perhaps the most interactive Horror movie ever made in terms of generating empathy from its audience through use of visual aesthetic. Shattering of the fourth wall is standard for the found footage genre, but no film has ever done it quite so effectively as this one.

Perhaps the greatest aspect of the film is its sound design. Much has been made of the film's focus on what you can't see, so a higher quality of sound design was not just important, but critical, for making The Blair Witch Project work. The sound design in The Blair Witch Project is equal parts unforgettable and nightmarish. From the all-encompassing marching of the Witch around camp to Josh's distant screams. Of course, the ""laughing children"" scene is by far the film's most terrifying and memorable use of sound to create terror, the sheer unnatural and almost perverted nature of it leaving me in an absolute frozen, chilled-to-the bone sense of fear with my mouth agape in shock every time I watch it. The slow buildup from a vague, undefined noise to clear, undeniable laughing is done absolutely wonderful, my mind (And the mind of the characters) becoming less and less capable of chalking things up to merely one's imagination. It's a haunting reminder of all the children whom the Witch has claimed, a kick in the teeth to the film's characters (And the audience, to an extent) of the dark and twisted power of legends and the reality of pure, supernatural and deadly evil. A reminder to the film students that their fate is to be nothing more than another footnote in the Blair Witch's legacy, yet another story to be told around campfires to keep the memory of the Blair Witch alive.

The Blair Witch Project is a journey, a seductive nightmare that never fails to captivate, enthrall and horrify me. Not only is it possibly one of the scariest films of all time, it is a massive achievement in film-making in general. A Halloween must watch that never fails to bring in emotions and feelings inside me I thought long dead, The Blair Witch Project is a bone chilling fever dream that speaks directly to my inner child and mortifies him to his core.","10"

Directors Ed Sanchez and Dan Myrick truly succeed in creating one of the most original films of this century. The horror is frightening. The emotion, unmistakably real.

"JM24","A superb film that blends the human spirit with good old-fashioned horror","1 August 1999","The Blair Witch Project creates a unique blend of the terrifying with the unknown. The audience is enticed to become part of the film-maker's world, to laugh along with the characters, to wonder what led to this, and almost to run in pure horror of the thing hunting them down.

It is obvious as the film progresses that the 3 are losing their heads, their very personalities working against them, their egos and self-pride dissolving as hopelessness sets in, their mind becoming that of an alone and fearful animal. They forget about their tedious social lives, instead the only thing that matters is finding their way out of a world they no longer have control of.

The Blair Witch project is not about the Blair Witch. It is about what can happen when humans are no longer the dominating force, and consequently what happens to the person's mind that is subjected to this horror. All of this build-up leads to an ending that not only is absolutely terrifying, but also leaves a huge mystery, a void that only the viewer can fill.",NA

I did not find it particularly frightening, but it was still very disturbing. Unlike most movies, scary or not, I found myself thinking and talking about it for weeks afterwards. The film has a number of unresolved and unexplained elements to it; while some people find these exasperating, I enjoy revisiting these little puzzles. This is perhaps one of the most true-to-life characteristics of ""Blair Witch"" - it is not artificially tidy and neat, but has that perplexing raggedness in the details that we recognize in real life.","7"

"corado-natalia","It is beyond my understanding","22 June 2011","OK, the concept is great, I have to admit it. But, the movie is a total waste of time if you're looking to be scared, like many said. I am really not able to understand how many of my favorite critics rated this film 4 stars and up. I agree we cannot reduce any movie to only a number, but in this case I'm really perplexed. First of all, the characters are undoubtedly annoying! I didn't like them in any way. It just seemed they used the whole swearing thing to look more real, but it ended up sounding artificial and nothing more than that. Analyzing them, I noticed Heather was the more developed one, though she was the most irritating. Josh and Mike had no definite personality, they kept changing from nice guys to completely pugnacious. During the day shots, all I was hoping for was to get dark quick and perhaps feel a bit frightened. However, the scenes at tent were also boring where the listened to inaudible (for us) sounds and overreacted to pretty much everything.

Even though, it's not anything like a good movie (in my opinion) I still encourage you to watch and draw your own conclusions. Like I once heard: we must see every single movie, even the bad, at least to know what not to do.","2"
"Lupercali","Unfairly maligned classic","12 October 2002","It's a great shame that The Blair Witch Project is probably going to go down in film history as an over-hyped gimmick, endlessly lampooned by all and sundry, and rejected by the horror fraternity.

I couldn't agree less. I loved it. It's very. very rare that a film will affects me physically, but even watching Blair Witch on video was an adrenalin rush for me. There were times when I felt like standing up and cheering. This is audacious movie-making, breaking all the conventions of the genre (and most conventions of any genre) and pulling it all off brilliantly. It seems hard to imagine just a few years down the track, but this was a trailblazer of a movie. I also believe it to one of the very best horror films ever made, and certainly the best in the last 25 years. Please note, I am not a horror movie buff. And herein lies the rub.

It quickly became apparent to me, after talking to many people who slagged off the film, that their predominant reasons for doing so were that it didn't have any special effects or gore, and that they were somehow offended by its low budget look. In other words, horror is about mindless violence, not psychological suspense. And apparently it isn't about waking up at 3 am the next morning with you heart in your mouth, because you suddenly understood what that last scene actually meant.

Maybe two or three times a decade a film comes along that changes the course of filmaking. In the 90's, the first two which spring to mind for me are Pulp Fiction and Blair Witch. Bravo.

"rosspatrick-26-445640","Only 90s kids will understand","20 April 2019","TBWP polarises people and rightly so. The ""cheapness"" of the movie captures the tech available at the time and this shouldn't be a problem except it is to a generation of kids growing up with HD quality everything. Also to truly 'get' this movie you had to watch the movie around the time of release, there was a lot of really good fake promo plugging the film under the guise of news reports and documentary shorts. This was before the era of fake news, so it worked. So before watching this movie you really need to appreciate the time, the tech and the mentality of a 90s kid going in to see this. The Internet was just about working end of the 90s and there wasn't a great deal you were doing back then apart from sports, shopping and exploring places. This is why Blair witch hits home, for 90s kids all we had was exploring stuff and we couldn't even take decent pictures of it. I'm a pretty hardened horror fan but that end scene of the movie messed me up. It was great everything surrounding the movie was great, so before trying to pull this to pieces on an intellectual movie scholar level just remember if you aren't from that era you just aren't gonna get it.","10"

"Cazziewaffle","That was meant to be one of the scariest films ever?? I don't think so!","7 January 2006","Three teenagers disappear in the woods of Burkittesville, Maryland whilst filming a documentary about the legend of the ""Blair Witch"". A year later their footage is found.

It's hard to know how to review this film, because the only reason it was thought to be so unbelievably scary is the great advertising idea advertise it as if it was real! If I had watched it believing it was real, I would have been freakin terrified. I would have felt the terror of the actors; I would have felt the frustration and the anger; I would have heard every tiny noise they heard and I'd have probably been hoping that they got out there alive, even though I knew they had been missing for a year, so it wasn't really likely and I would have loved (well, be left wondering by) the ending!

But I didn't. I saw it knowing it was false and I felt.. not much. From the beginning the characters were already annoying me, and they just got worse as the film went so it was hard to feel anything for them; I laughed in disbelief at the ridiculous things they did (One of them purposefully kicked the map into the river when they were already lost (???)); and the repetition of them running around the woods screaming at each other and then sitting in the tents terrified of the noises they could hear outside, yet still trying to capture what it was on film, got a little tiring.

And then there is the famous ending not so great after all! But again, would have been effective if you believed it.

The only thing that still works though is the use of the idea that it's scarier when you can't see what is out there. This was used to good effect... up to a point. There are a lot of shots where it's all just pitch black and all you can hear is their frantic whispering about what the hell it is that is out there, or, in some cases, just silence and you're just waiting to see if something passes by, but this is used to often and it got too routine by the end.

And I have to say I loved the hand held camera style of filming, very effective and I have to give credit to the actors they were great! I would have believed them!

But it doesn't leave any real affect on you, so my advice: don't watch it expecting much.","4"

I didn't find it the least bit scary, namely because everything looked fake and the acting was remarkably bad. It was obvious from the start that the film wasn't ""real"" because most people would have genuine believable fear and sadness when faced with death.

People say that the fear generated came from not seeing what the horrific things were. This just made it vague: the characters are frightened by disembodied voices and scary images that you can't hear and never see--it's confusing, not terrifying. I was bored to death and kept looking at my watch. That ain't good, cause it's less than an hour and a half.

""Blair Witch Project"" was all hype and not good. But unlike it's hype-brother ""Phantom Menace,"" ""Blair Witch"" had no redeeming qualities. ""Cool As Ice"" was better than this load of garbage.","1"

It's not often I get bored at the cinema, but this and the hughly overrated English Patient managed that. I never bought in to the stupid hype surrounding the movie. Hats of for brilliant marketing, you made a movie for a penny and raked in millions. And I'm not alone. I still remember in the cinema, when that girl was crying her snot out to the lens, people around me started laughing. It's filled with boring, bland characters, poor execution, and endless footage of trees. I actually lost it in the end, with that guy standing in a corner. This is so corny, it's a comedy.","2"

They hyped this movie so much that it generated huge publicity, but they hyped it the wrong way. It's not the scariest movie of all time, it's the best scary movie!(understand?) This movie is about the journey three kids take from being cocky film students, to whimpering, naive, and terrrified little children lost within a dark woods and becoming the prey of an urban legend. Don't expect a witch or gross-looking pyschotic killer to jump out because this movie isn't a slasher flick, it's better than that. Go to this movie well-educated about its plot and ideas. Have an open mind and let your imagination run wild. The back of you neck will tingle, your palms will sweat, and your heart will race during the last 15 minutes of the film, and I'm not telling you why!

"slvrquee","A Test in True Human Imagination","12 September 1999","I see everyone here falls into the catagory of film goer where you have to be spoon fed special effects and essentric acting in order to enjoy the movie. This movie proves that all you need is a good imagination to enjoy a film. If you don't then of course, you aren't going to like it.

And quit complaining about the camera movement. You are supposed to be veiwing everything through a camera that the girl carries around with her so OF COURSE IT IS GOING TO BOUNCE FOR GODS SAKE!! That's part of the fun!

Hollywood has breastfed its viewers for so long that you cannot use your own imaginations anymore. What's scary is not what you see, it's what you don't see.

I would also like to see anyone in Hollywood attempt to act as well as Miss Heather. Bravo girl! She wasn't over dramatic, she was just plain scared and convincingly at that. Imagine some Hollywood starlet playing that part, the movie would have taken a nose dive. Bravo to the guys too!

The film is indy brillance. If you can't take it, go see Star Wars and be breastfed again.",NA
"AvionPrince16","Disappointed and bored!","18 August 2021","The movie if we watch this in 2021 is pretty boring and we already seen it a dozen times. But for the year that was released, the way they did was like a revolution and other way to make horror movies. But the only scary moment is the end but thats it. Most of the times we followed three lost students that put the fault to be lost to each other and it can be frustrating, annoying and stupid. But it can be more believable like this, like it was reality because the director when released the movie tell that the movie was a real footage of three student lost in the woods. And thats way it can be more believable. If thats why the movie had some success? Because i clearly dont understand why now.","5"
"Ben-162","Prepare to be disturbed","1 January 2000","The Blair Witch is one of those rare occurances in cinema which manage to be much more than the sum of its parts. A low budget film, shot by the actors on less-than-a-shoe-string managed to be one (after The Phantom Menace) of the most talked about films of the year. This film is not flawless, however. The arguments, although adding to the believability of the characters, do tend to grate after the first hour. The loosing of the map incident seemed a very unlikely occurence considering the circumstances. The main flaw however has to be the fact that filming is not a natural human response to extreme psycological trauma, and, although the film would be lacking somewhat if during moments of terror the camera was shut off, it would make more sense. The ending it a major example of this which verges on the unbeleivable, even if one beleives that it is a way for the characters to psycologically distance themselves from their reality.

However, on the whole, the good points outweigh the bad. The level of emmersion is unsurpassed - there has seldom been a film that (figurativly speaking, of course) skewers you, puts you in its mouth, chews thoughtfully and finally spits you out as well as this one - leaving you only with haunting images that stay with you for weeks, and the silent promise not to go camping again. It deftly sidesteps the ironical slasher movie formula, and delivers its message not through flashy script or ""cheap"" shock tactics, but by getting inside your head and whispering; and by giving you icons and symbols (such as the wood itself - which it taken as a symbol life, and then stripped of it (like the children themselves) - no birds sing, no leaves grow.

The Blair Witch is a fantastic movie, but, the fact that it is more disturbing than scary, means that the audience has to be able to let the Blair Witch work its voodoo without putting the brain onto automatic and expecting to be entertained; you are, unfortunatly (although it is a rarity in modern Cinema) required to watch it on a deeper level.","10"

"FrightMeter","Flawless...Intelligent..Terrifying!","2 August 1999","The Blair Witch Project is perhaps the most terrifying film ever to hit the big screen. This film will only make sense or be enjoyable to you if you have the intelligence to allow it to. If you are expecting the overdone stalk and slash, blood and guts genre, then please look elsewhere. The Blair Witch Project is an Oscar worthy film that explores the inner fears of the viewer and tugs at them like a freight train. The final scene of the film is without a doubt the most disturbing ever filmed...Please pay attention to the interviews (specifically the one about the guy who slaughtered the kids in his cabin) or it will not have the same effect.

"Kashmirgrey","Genius!","26 February 2008","I seem to be in the minority when it comes to my fondness for ""The Blair Witch Project"". However, it is the pure genius of it that I admire. The film makers, on a beer budget, produced and marketed a gold mine. Very few films prior had utilized the first-person-shooter aspect and I can think of no other film that successfully delivers the scare factor without any gore or ever showing any villains.

I guess what it comes down to is which Horror camp you're in. Blood and gore camp, this is not your film. Scary monsters, nope, skip it. Psychological thrillers, then like me, you might wanna' check this one out.","9"
"matoolz2","at least we got ""The Bare Wench Project"" out of it...","22 June 2001","People either love this movie and proclaim it as the scariest movie ever made or hate it, there is no in between. Personally, I thought it was a piece of garbage. I looked forward to seeing this movie for months (they did a great job of promoting this film, to bad they did`nt deliver) and went to see it 3 days after it opened. What a disappointment, I saw absolutely nothing in this turkey that was frightening in the least. Three students, making a documentary in the woods get lost and hear noises at night outside their tent at which point they take off running through the woods screaming (whoo...that`s really scary). I think the guy 2 rows behind me, at the theater, summed it up pretty well when he said, after the movie was over, ""I thought this was supposed to be scary"". If they were giving this movie away at my local video store, I would`nt touch it with a ten foot pole.","1"
"Poe-17","Unique and an acquired taste, like exotic food","15 August 1999","Negative comments about this film interest me, amuse me. In most of them the errors are blatant, their diet of large budgets and pyrotechnic technology clearly shows, even when they steadfastly deny that influence. I find myself wondering what books they've read, in their past, where they garnered their sense of theme and character and plot regarding fiction in any medium. TBWP is a ground breaker on so many levels it's difficult to watch the film fairly if you are an informed viewer. ""Scary as Hell"" means many things depending on your trip from then to now. Yes, it is scary, it is terrifying, if you can shred your way through the current standards of ""horror"" and film making. This isn't our usual drummer. This is a gut raw excursion into a piece of our collective psyche some of us have glibly missed as we moved from kid to adult. This movie may pass and be damn near absent from video shelves in a few years but I'll bet it will hold its timeless spell, that, like ""Night of the Living Dead"", most video stores will keep a copy or two because the movie has tapped something that might be difficult for words to keep but lingers in those secret and dark niches of ourselves. One mistake in the whole phenomena is the hype seemed to pitch a movie over ""there"", when the film was quite seriously anchored right ""here"". That, I think, was simply a marketing move. When people ask me if I've seen it, I say ""yes, twice so far"". When they ask me if I recommend it I tell them I have embraced it in the ""top 5"" of my horror film closet but that I don't recommend it to anyone because there is nothing to compare it to. There's no way to prep a first time viewer of the film. I think those having to decide how to market the film faced the same dilemma. Horror, languishing and withering in our full speed ahead culture, has snagged an unseen claw in the fabric of our times and gained a foothold. How history regards Blair Witch is up for grabs, but Hollywood, media, consumers and our culture will adjust their trajectory because of an obscure film made on a laughable budget that reminds us the first tale ever spun around a campfire was undoubtably a ghost story. We have reached the beginning of the end of the color splashed, audibly thunderous and visually garrish ""BOO!"". We happily swap it for a precisely and perfectly timed "" ... boo..."" Some may miss the point, find it benign rather that frightening, wrestle over the first person, real time excursion and cast its ""less is more"" philosophy against the current ""everything isn't enough"" cinematic appetites. But I find much solace knowing that this tiny film has settled itself into movie history, already a truth, alredy becoming an influence. Horror has turned a long overdue corner. Neat! How often is something to fear such a cause to smile.",NA
"HojPoj","Definitely worth seeing...one time is enough..It stays w/you","31 July 1999","I saw this movie the week before the nation wide release. With the SciFi Channel and the www.blairwitch.com giving the background to the Blair Witch, it is easy to mistake this move as non-fiction. Even after I knew it was fictional, I was still enthralled with the movie. I left it forgetting that it was fake.

The shaking of the camera is not that bad, kind of like hearing traffic outside the door...you tend to phase it out. There are times, however, that I got a smirk at something that was supposed to be scary....AND there are times that something trivial scares the heebie jeebies out of me.

I definitely recommend viewing the www.blairwitch.com or the SciFi special before watching the movie. You will enjoy it more.

Overall I give this movie a lot of credit for its originality.","7"
"matlefebvre20","It works because it's real","28 July 2006","The horror film market is probably one of the most popular these days in cinema. The main reason is that today's moviegoers and people in general always want to get more and more thrills and experiences that makes adrenaline climbing. Well, you might say that it's not really new, but others things are changing in today's film industry.

I'd say that moviegoers aren't really sensitive to whether the movie is good or not, because they simply want the thrills. That's the reason why ridiculous horror/slasher films are created, such as ""Final Destination"" (and its sequels), ""Child's Play"" (and its sequels), and so on.

However, major exceptions still exist and ""The Blair Witch Project"" is one of them. ""Blair Witch"" is far from being an ordinary horror B-movie, or any parody of any genre. It's simply a pseudo-documentary about three film students who want to shoot their own documentary about the legend of the Blair Witch, but they inadvertently become the subject of a movie that they never wanted to shoot.

The main reason that ""Blair Witch"" succeeds is because of its terrifying reality. The 'actors' aren't from Hollywood and they always seem to be playing the game during the 70 minutes that we see them. Heather, Josh and Michael are fairly convincing and not only in their scares. Yeah, the scary moments are the main part of the film and it's always great, but the interesting parts don't begin there. Just before they leave to the woods, we clearly see that they're real human beings. They have their own pre-shooting rituals (Heather drinks scotch because she's the director) and they have their own jokes, which do we might admit, are typical of people of their age.

And when they notice that they 'lost' themselves, their reaction, their anger and their frustration don't leave any doubt about their sincerity. It's clearly evident when you see Josh fights Michael, because he let go the map and when Heather angers with Michael while she's taping, causing the image to muddle and shake.

The way that this movie is shot is perhaps the most fascinating aspect of it. It's not in 35mm like in most of today's movies. It's shot alternatively between Hi-8 video and 16mm, which make the scenes even more real. We never see any of the events entirely from an external point of view, because we either switch from one of the students to another. This shooting process makes the movie even scarier and there's no let-down 'till the abrupt final scenes (before it switches to today's footage).

Also a thumbs-up for the sound effects. Sometimes, we don't even see anything (because the camera light is off) and we're still scared, simply because of the sounds we hear. And that's maybe what's the scariest: the sounds. Just hearing the characters crying and shaking, the external cries of unknown people outside the tent and the sounds of the mysterious person who follow them in the night make the viewer shake as well.

Hollywood filmmakers should learn a lesson here. When independent filmmakers shoot a $35,000-budget project that becomes a $150-million hit, there's definitely something to learn. It's not the budget that counts, it's the substance. Just do something that works and the moviegoers will come. And that's what ""Blair Witch"" producers understood. And it's the reason why it became one of the best horror films of the late 20th century. Along with ""The Shining"", ""Blair Witch"" is one of my all-time favorites.","9"
"MyJenny","Ignore the hype and enjoy the movie","30 August 1999","Just to get it out of the way, this movie was NOT the scariest thing I've ever seen, the footage WAS nauseating to watch at times, and the dialogue was often limited.

That being said, Blair Witch is a very creative movie, with the ability to get the adrenaline pumping as you watch it. The tagline gives away the ending - after all, only the footage was found, right? - but I was still at the edge of my seat wondering what was going to happen next.

Many of the people leaving the theatre were complaining that it was boring, and that they expected a real ""horror"" film. If what you're looking for is ""Scream,"" this isn't it. Instead, it relies on creating a mood for the audience that encourages you to try to imagine yourself in the characters' places.

As for the dialogue, I thought it was extremely realistic, if not terribly original. The acting was superb. I found myself getting angry with Heather as she pranced around with her camera, and during the scene where they start to lose it at Mike, I could REALLY imagine the feelings they were having.

If you haven't seen Blair Witch but plan to, just sit back and let the movie take you, and you'll probably enjoy it. Just ignore the hype, as it really is overblown.","8"

"darkjosh","Groundbreaking horror film that was done-in by overhyping","31 October 2000","The Blair Witch Project is an inventive, often genuinely terrifying, and overall very effective documentary-like horror film about a group of student filmmakers who venture into the woods to explore the legend of the Blair Witch, which tells the story of a witch who lured children into her home and killed them.

So, how does Blair Witch, a film with a very meager budget and a cast of three unknowns succeed in delivering a scarefest? It very skillfully uses the documentary feel, its amateur camerawork, and its sense of reality to plunge the viewer into its deep, dank woods. The audience doesn't feel as if they're watching another contrived slasher flick that's been churned out by some Hollywood gore factory to bring in profits: instead, what we feel is genuineness, reality, and uncertainty as the three students' sanity unravels in the depths of the unknown.

Heather Donahue, Joshua Leonard, and Mike Williams all do exceptional jobs of showing their terror onscreen, especially during the nightly ritualistic assaults around their campground. Donahue, however, is the best of the group, and her final apology certainly makes chills run up and down your spine when she breathes, ""I'm scared to close my eyes. I'm scared to open them."" Blair Witch accomplishes a feat that has become almost extinct in horror films: it makes us care about its characters and also offers some truly terrifying moments.

When first released, there was so much hype regarding the fact that it was extremely unnerving and very scary - appetites whetted, audiences were expecting to see something totally mind-blowing, utterly terrifying, and completely overwhelming, but ultimately familiar horror film. They weren't prepared to never see any onscreen presence of evil, and when the film came to a close, many complained about its abruptness and what they viewed as an ultimately eventless, ""boring"" movie.

Blair Witch, however, is a thoroughly original, effective psychological mind trip that plays on the greatest fear we all have: the fear of the unknown. With little gore and no onscreen presence of the 'monster', we feel more of The Blair Witch Project than we watch it.

The plot of the movie itself interested me so much that I decided to watch it. The movie is about three young documentary makers who venture into the deadly woods in search of a local legend called ""The Blair Witch"". Before the start of the movie, a note appears which asserts to the viewer that the 3 students have disappeared in the woods and after one year, their video footage is received which is the movie itself.

Since the entire movie is like an amateur video footage, it gives us a feel of the friendly videos we sometimes take with our friends with no camera focus, angles, lighting etc. The actors too had to be at their natural best, and they succeed in just playing ""lost"" rather than acting. Hence all expressions of anger, frustration, fear etc look very much real rather than made up. The ending of the movie is like a half-baked cake, it does not fully satisfy the viewer. Overall, it is surely a one time watch for an entire different take on film making

All anyone ever complains about is that this movie didn't live up to the hype and all that - well, the hype was half the fun! I saw the Blair Witch show on the SciFi Channel and I got so scared that I actually started to cry (at the time I thought it was all real).

Half the reason people say this movie is ""stupid"" is because they don't understand it (boy am I gonna get it for that one). They went into the theater expecting something like ""Scream"" or ""Urban Legends"" - you know, with a jump every minute & enough gore to make it an anatomy lesson.

Not relying on the typical horror scare tactics, director Dan Myrick and Eduard Sanchez have not only created an amazing psychological terror, but a complex character on the deterioration of three regular people.

"Arkansas_Jedi","Unique, claustrophobic and the best scare in several years.","1 August 1999","Certainly one of the coolest movie premises in a while. The supposed raw video and audio footage from three missing film students who were lost in the woods while making a documentary about a Maryland witch.

The first-person style -- we see only through the sometimes blurry, sometimes shaking camera lens -- adds to the rising terror of the three college students. It also makes the view almost claustrophobic as the trees always seem to be closing in -- especially at night.

The movie beautifully builds the sense of dread and impending doom. We know what is going to happen; we just don't know when or how. Plus, we watch as three seemingly intelligent people basically fall apart.

The film really kicks in during the final 30 minutes to the dizzying climax and haunting last scene.

A must-see for fans of horror and suspense; also for movie fans who want to see something new and different. A campfire story for the home video generation. For outdoor types who see this, I guarantee it will cross their minds on their next camping trip whenever they hear a strange noise at night.","8"

"begob","Lost in unreality","17 June 2020","A documentary crew enter the woods to investigate the legend of a local witch, but find themselves in uncharted territory ...

Just about my favourite horror. There have been plenty of thoughtful reviews, so I'll leave one idea that I've grown to appreciate over the years.

There is a meta theme, raised when the documentary director is challenged for hiding behind the camera: she uses it to filter reality. This is reinforced with her handling of the map even as the crew becomes hopelessly lost. The thought that springs to mind: ""The map is not the territory"" - life is not what you expected. Even in the final scene the theme comes through, where the camera belongs to the director, yet her voice is distant - who is behind the camera? That gap within reality gives us a dark and spooky depth.

A final point - the tension is largely created by the distress in the voices of the victims. Not once do we hear the voice of the witch. Just victims.

"Zbigniew_Krycsiwiki","A late '90s relic, which doesn't hold up well","16 September 2016","While this film not only single handedly created an entire genre (found footage) and largely ushered viral marketing, and while I was happy that an ultra low-budget horror was getting as much attention as this did upon its release, in retrospect, the film has little to recommend it.

There is a degree of fear and dread, as we learn of this supposed mystery of a backwoods witch, before seemingly becoming lost in those very same woods, but the film can never give us any character or situation to invest in, as I found the trio of leads to be unlikeable, and as their own fear grows as they turn on each other, they became even more unlikeable and unsympathetic.

I'm not going to recommend this for those reasons, but if you're a fan of found footage, and you can tolerant the characters, give it a go, because it does have an effectively lonely, slightly creepy (at times) feel, but I just couldn't stand the characters, or the film itself, after a while.","4"

At night they are hearing weird sounds some of which sound like feet. This happens every night and each day the characters begin to breakdown. The scary thing about the movie is the fact at night we hear sounds but see nothing. The movie successfully keeps your heart pounding especially during the moments where the characters are panicking. The feel of the movie is real very real and that's what's also scary about it. The camera technology is cheap and that gives the film it's real life look. A great movie with a frightening ending. I give this movie 5/5. A very scary movie that is definitely worth checking out. Don't Go Into The Woods.","10"

"chas77","A lot of people are missing the point...","16 August 1999","I think that a lot of the dissatisfied viewers are missing the point here. It's really quite a simple, effective movie. Not simple as ""for simpletons"" or stupid people, but simple in that its whole set up relies on its minimalist structure.

It's easy for a lot of people to say, ""why didn't they read the survival book, bring a cel phone, etc."" The point is, they didn't think they needed these items. These were cocky filmmakers who weren't worried. It was just going to be a weekend trip. If any of you have been camping before, I'm sure you can relate. As for the cel phone, did anyone think that maybe they couldn't afford one?

As a guy who was a student filmmaker at one time, I can DEFINITELY relate to this. When you are in a film crew for a class you don't always have the luxury of knowing your crew-mates that well. You can't predict their responses to certain circumstances. I found the acting very realistic in this case. I thought back to my own film crew in jaded L.A. I honestly don't think that we would have fared much better. Maybe the smug types who think otherwise could watch a *realistic* movie like ""The Haunting"" if they have such a hard time with this...","8"
"baumer","My final comment about Blair Witch","12 August 1999","Warning may be some spoilers

Okay, by now I think many have seen the film and there seems to be quite the split about how great it is. I for one loved this film. I love that it was original ( and I say that knowing there are films out there like Cannibal Hollocaust and the Last Broadcast ), I love that it was documentary style, I love that it made you use your imagination and I loved the three actors in it. But I do have a few comments to make regarding the criticism.

First off, the Blair Witch Project was a small film that like El Mariachi and Clerks was just hoping to get a video deal or perhaps a cable deal to recoup there budget. So to say that this was film was over-hyped is a bit of a fallacy. To me over hype is when a studio comes out and says a film that has been out for a few days ( take any Disney animated film ) is already a classic. That is hype. But when a film that no one really thought much of takes the film world by storm and it is us, the paying audience that gives it the kudos that it deserves, that is not hype, that is word of mouth. So to say that this is a bad film because it was over hyped is just rubbish. These two guys ( Sanchez and Myrick ) at the very least had an innovative idea and took what they remember as being scary from the classic horror films, and they combined it all into one scary-as-hell-play-with-your-mind-psychologically-tormenting-movie. So it is not over hyped.

Secondly) I can understand why some people don't like this film. I know it is not for every taste. But please stop and listen to yourselves when you do criticize it. The majority of the people that don't like it say the same thing. ""Where's the witch?"" ""The only thing scary about this is that I spent 10 bucks on it."" "" Borrrrring."" Well if that is how you feel, then that is how you feel, but the least you could do is try to elaborate why it is that you feel the way you do about this film. And also try to realize that perhaps the reason you are not scared or at least tense in the film is not because it isn't well made, it is just probably that you don't fear the same things that some of the rest of us do. This film relies solely on playing with people's minds, and it did a hell of a job with mine.

Finally, I love this film. I love everything about it. I think it is the best film that I have seen this summer and I admire the two directors for doing what they did. To make a film that concentrates on atmosphere and mind games instead of blood and gore is a true testament to how much they must love the genre. Think of classic Carpenter and Hitchcock. They did much of the same thing. There was hardly any blood in the shower scene in Psycho and very little in Halloween. Blair Witch also has but one scene with blood in it, and yet it is one of the most effective scenes in the film because you are shocked by it.

To people that don't enjoy this film, I honestly have pity for you, and I do not mean that in a pretentious ""I'm better than you"" kind of way. I know we all have different tastes in horror films and that is okay, but if you could just feel the raw fear and experience that strange sensation when your heart races at the end of the film, or to actually go camping and stare into the darkness and wonder what that snapping twig is about ten feet away from you, you would really thank the guys for making this. I love that this film could do that to me. I love that it could get inside me like that. And it's too bad that those of you that didn't feel that way, could, just for one moment. That to me, is the power of film making. To manipulate somone's emotions the way this film does is a treasure unto itself.

Psycho had people in their generation always looking out of the shower. Jaws kept us out of the water. Halloween kept us afraid of the night. Nightmare on Elm Street kept some of us from falling asleep. Blair Witch will give you a paranoia about camping, for those of you that like the film that is. My humble opinion, this is a 10/10. When people ask me what the scariest horror films I've ever seen are, I will respond with Halloween, Jaws, Nightmare On Elm Street, Texas Chainsaw Massacre, Aliens, Angel Heart, Last House On The Left, Evil Dead, Amittyville Horror and the newest entry, The Blair Witch Project. To me, and to many others, it is the epitome of fear. And I love to be scared.","10"
"jb_campo","Terrible - Don't believe the hype","16 January 2023","I rented this from my library because I'd heard it was a good movie. I was utterly disappointed because this is a terrible movie.

The story premise is fine, but it falls short from so many elements. The acting is so so. The lead woman is a whiner who flips from one side to the other. The other two main characters sleep walk thru.

Emotionally, the film is NOT scary. It's just not. There is intimated this and intimated that, but mostly I kept thinking of how stupid these kids were. Things happen that are just stupid. It's like that commercial where the kids have a running car to escape in and they hide behind the chainsaws. That level of stupidity.

The film uses the camera shaking effect and following people around. Ok, been there seen that. The audio was not good. The brightness was not good, so you couldn't see well, just like Transformers movies where you can't see who is fighting.

There was no build up of tension. It's one day, then it's another day. The kids are yelling. Then something happens, and suddenly it's the end and I'm like, what? Is that it? Just bad all around,

Not worth your time. I started to fast forward thru, which is always an indicator to me of a flawed film.

I recommend you pass on this one. Not worth the time and def does not meet the hype.","3"

We drove to downtown Cambridge to watch it at the Kendall Square Cinema. This is before the hype went out of control and when people were seriously confused if it was real or not. To those people, to this day, I still shake my head.

The Blair Witch Project is a movie that will go down in history as a classic. It's a time-less film that has aged very well. It's arguably one of the creepiest and most frightening movies of the past decade, and possibly all-time. It's a rare movie, that uses silence and barely any blood to get it's message across. I can't even remember the last movie to scare the masses in such a simple way.

My biggest gripe with Blair Project was and still is the movie not showing even a hint of the Blair Witch. Watching the movie yesterday, I knew the ending so I was never really scared. But the movie still conjured up a few chills due to the dark woods and frantic situations. Just a glimpse would have made this movie so much more a hit. That is by far the biggest gripe about this movie. People feel cheated when things are happening, but nothing is really delivered. A glimpse at the end of feet floating across the camera on the ground, would have done wonders. But oh well.

The Blair Witch Project is a wonder of sorts. Only costing pocket change but making millions. Having unknown producers and actors, but still having the movie come off as real footage. Sure there are people who hated this movie, but overall the Blair Witch Project is a feat in the film industry that can never be denied. It's a film all horror fans should see and most likely all will sometime or another.","8"
"jason_13","Worst serious horror movie of the 90s","14 February 2006","I'll start with saying that I am really big horror fan with capital B and as I have heard Blair Witch Project is one of the scariest horror movies ever. This is hilarious. I can't believe somebody really get scared by such a crappy movie. The movie of course has the usual ""true story"" sign, but this time we are brought the story itself as a footage. Yeah, what we see had really happened from what I understood. And the worst thing is that people had believe it 7 years ago and I still read posts about Blair Witch Project being an example of a really scary movie. There are even people who don't find it scary, but they like it. Otherwise, I can't explain that ending, this popularity and its sequel which I haven't seen and I don't intend to do it in this life. And the really really worst of all, is that people had believed it as I said. I guess that if I believed in this, I would have liked it. It is similar to My Little Eye which is a really good horror movie that made me look behind my back. We have stupid teens overacting, camera looking like a home video and some interviews with people convincing the audience and the teens themselves that this curse or whatever it is, really exist. Oh, and we have no themes and songs, cause it is supposed to be happening for real and 5 years later this tape is a movie that is supposed to scare us.

This is basically The Blair Witch Project. I don't like the story, but I would have appreciated the try to be recreated with actors and normal camera with themes. It would have been stupid, but nothing stupid that tries to conquer the genre with its reality. This sucks. I got bored, I nearly fell asleep after 40 boring minutes and then I realized that whatever happens till the end of the movie, I would hate it and the movie I hate could be counted on the fingers of the persons involved with this story. And I can't give 1 to a movie, but The Blair Witch Projects is bad in any single aspect and believe me, I wanted to give it a try after thinking of worse horror movies. It didn't work.","6"

There wasn't even a payoff at the end after putting up with all that BS. If i'm missing something please enlighten me.

"parleon-thedon","TBWP - review: Absolute Horror or (Absolutely Horrible)","29 July 2016","""OK, here's your motivation. You're lost, you're angry in the woods, and no one is here to help you. There's a fu*king witch and she keeps leaving sh*t outside your door. There's no one here to help you! She left little trinkets, you fu*king took one of them, she ran after us. There's no one here to help you! We walked for 15 hours today, we ended up in the same place! There's no one here to help you, THAT'S your motivation! THAT'S YOUR MOTIVATION!"" - Josh Leonard (The Blair Witch Project)

I absolutely love this movie, I remember when I first saw it, I was 10 years old, I turned the lights off, I was terrified, and I couldn't get the movie out of my head.

This is a found footage movie (fake documentary) and you could say this one sparked the flame for how popular (depending on your perspective) they have become today. Ever since TBWP, I've been a sucker for found footage movies.

When the movie starts, it is a slow burner, and some people may become bored, however, everything you're seeing from the start is absolutely necessary. The movie builds the story slowly from the three main characters perspective, all they're doing is making a college documentary about a folklore in the small town of Burkittsville Maryland, they give the audience information (that is crucial later on) about the murders of 7 children, minimal info on The Blair Witch legend, the ritualistic murders at Coffin Rock, and the belief from the towns people that there's something evil lurking in the woods.

I enjoyed the three main characters performances, Heather Donahue, Joshua Leonard, and Michael C. Williams aren't just playing characters, they're projecting 90% of themselves into the movie. A majority of the actor's performances where real and genuine, they were really out there in the woods (not actually lost), they actually argued with each other, Heather shed real tears, and their fear was pretty legit.

My favorite scenes in the movie are: 1. Heather's Documentary Opening Cemetery Scene 2. The Interviewee's Story about the Rustin Parr murders 3. The description of the Coffin Rock Murders 4. Character's fighting about why the map was kicked into the creek 5. Discovery of Voodoo Stick Figures hanging on the trees 6. Night Time Chase 7. It's not the same log 8. Josh verbally abusing Heather 9. Cries for help heard in the distance during the night 10. Final Scene at Rustin Parr's house

TBWP is frightening, tense, haunting, eerie, and it builds and builds until the very last frame.

By the end, some people may feel disappointed because nothing is exactly clear, it's a bit ambiguous, and it's left up to people's interpretation. Clearly, there is something supernatural happening, but as an audience member, you don't find any real concrete evidence to support the fact that there is a ghostly or supernatural presence lurking in the woods, all of the happening can easily be debunked as, there are people screwing with them, and Josh did it; The Blair Witch is clearly the one responsible for the happenings, but you never see her, and that pisses a lot of people off.

I enjoy this movie because I get to use my imagination, I believe that the forces you can not see are the most threatening and entertaining for a horror movie. I love the abusive verbal behavior between the characters, it adds emotion, and empathy. The characters start off as happy go lucky individuals, they're very excited to go on this camping trip, but as the tension builds, they slowly start to verbally and physically tear each other apart, they break down and share real moments of fear, terror, turmoil, and sadness.

TBWP is not for everyone (clearly), but I enjoy it because it feels real, and the realer it feels, the scarier it becomes.

The movie could've been more of a character study mixed with horror, but I still enjoyed it for what it was, and that's pure unsympathetic non scripted non CGI-ed horror.

Final Grade: A","9"
"Ysman","If you didn't like it, you didn't understand the ending","2 August 1999","I have read the numerous reviews about the film. Let me preface this by saying I loved this movie. Very few films disturb me to the point where five days after viewing the movie I am still sleeping with the lights on. I think that the negative reviews of this film may have missed the point. One reviewer said the logic was flawed, that the campers should have just followed the stream to civilization. The point was the campers couldn't leave the woods no matter what they tried. They were directed by forces beyond their control. Unfortunately the ending was cryptic and therefore I feel a lot of the audience did not understand what they saw. If you listened carefully to the commentary of the people in the town, the ending was truly the best part of the film and what made me go to Walmart for a night light.","10"

Alas, but a year later, with the faddish word-of-mouth and website generated hoopla faded, what's left? A pretty ordinary looking experimental film which rather limps along unevenly, then builds up a bit of steam as it reaches its quizzical end.

Not much of a contribution to film history, this indie production must go down as a masterpiece of marketing and of latching onto public gossip. Faddish to a fault, it's really the ""cinematic pet rock"" which took advantage of its p/r potential, culminating with a Time Magazine cover story. More power to all participants in the BWP!","1"
"lucianomarzo92","Hmmmm..","9 September 2009","I saw this movie just yesterday. Wow. I had been wanting to see it for a while also. I appreciate the originality on the part of the filmmakers to shoot the movie with crude technology. I found that decision very creative on their part. It makes all of the footage seem real. It is probably the perfect way to film a movie like this, but I must say it kind of bothered me throughout the movie. The Blair Witch Project isn't exactly what you'd call a good horror movie. It lacks some of the qualities a lot of horror movies have, like jump scenes, a villain, and a dark atmosphere. It did have a moderately creepy atmosphere in some scenes, though. The Blair Witch Project is by no means a bad movie; it's just not exactly what you may expect. It's a little different. Most of the movie is centered around frustration and paranoia more than horror. The whole time I was watching the movie, I was waiting for something scary to happen. About 2/3 of the way through, I was thinking, ""Is this all? I thought this movie was supposed to be terrifying?"" The last 5 minutes kind of make up for the rest of it, though. The last few scenes may not be initially creepy like you might expect, but they are after you think about them for a while. Overall, I would say that this movie would be a little disappointing if you really wanted to watch something scary. There is not really anything that antagonizes the main characters except themselves. There isn't really a Blair witch. There are only stories of the Blair witch and encounters with things that may or may not be the Blair witch.","6"

The film that contributed to and help revitalize the genre for found footage/ first person films. Now in that aspect the film was truly trend-setting. Its story though original failed in many aspects. The film does a decent job in building tension as does its pacing, but for the most part this film only comes off as slightly creepy. A lot of the potential of this film is lost in its three amateur actors who do little but bicker, argue and fight throughout the length of the film. What made this film so immensely popular when it first came out was in its marketing. A lot of film goers at the time felt as though this film was actual true footage, when in turn it was just a low grade horror film. Though a nod has to be given to this film as it did create a new genre within film, that went on to span such films as Cloverfield and Chronicle. All in all for a horror film it misses its mark in some aspects but in others it does very well, which is in its pacing and its tension, but ultimately falls short, mostly in its conclusion, which leaves much to be desired.","5"

I had figured that I would constantly be looking over my shoulder, waiting for something to jump out at me. But, it never happened. Don't get me wrong, ""The Blair Witch Project"" is an enjoyable movie. The actors are fantastic, and although their sense of fear and desperation was never completely transferred to me, it was hard to tell that this was only fiction. I just did not find it as terrifying as so many folks have claimed it to be. However, I do find it effective in one area, which is perhaps the intended point: ""The Blair Witch Project"" will do for going into the woods what ""Jaws"" did for going into the water.","7"
"the-way-and-the-light","The scariest...","7 August 1999","As the lights in the theater went up, every single person immediately said something to the effect of ""Oh sh--."" Then playfull nervous laughing emerged. ""The Blair Witch Project"" is a movie that still affects me now. Like the people in the audience, I feel like I need to laugh it off, or say something like, ""Heather was so annoying."" The simple truth is, though, that the movie absolutely terrified me. Why exactly, I have few clues. A friend of mine who attended the movie made fun of my slacked jaw and tight grip on the armrests. He didn't think much of the movie(He likes ""Pet Cemetary."").

That is why it is hard to decide whether or not to recommend the film. Alot is made of things in the movie that go against typical ""lost in the middle of nowhere"" films. Maybe the movie's lack of standard cliches, and it's ""Spinal Tap"" innovative approach is what draws the critical acclaim. I guess horror, like humour, is subjective. Some people are scared of people in hockey masks with chainsaws. Some people are scared of things that go bump in the night. For me(and the young lady behind me who jolted loudly in her seat during the last 15 minutes), I think the scariest thing is the idea that strange things are out there, and there is absolutely nothing you or your friends can do about it.

Some things about the movie bothered me, technically. The camera's constant movement was perhaps too real, and I struggled frequently to make out some of the strange things that the group finds in the film. I was unclear about one particular detail towards the end involving a bundle of sticks(I will say no more to avoid any kind of spoiler).

The bottom line: The movie may scare the pants off you. You may find it silly. It could be just ""all right."" All anyone can do is say what they thought of it. I thought it was so scary, so suspensefull, and so primitively instinctively terrifying that I probably can't bear to watch it again. Then again, my friend I saw the movie with hasn't like cats in quite a while.","9"

Not even close. I kept waiting and waiting for something even remotely exciting to happen, and I never got it. If this is what passes for horror, then that's just a plain shame. Not only was it the most underwhelming horror movie I have ever seen, it was the most underwhelming movie I have ever seen.","2"

It stays with you for a few days. Your scared to even go somewhere in your house at night. This IS snuff. All the acting. The settings. Everything is so real. I guess that's why it's scarey. Halloween used to be my favorite horror movie. Not anymore. I just can't believe it. It's so real. I think it should at least nominated for best picture. If you don't think so than see it.

I have read too many posts from people who are only interested in BWP if it is ""true"" and insist that they will feel cheated or hoaxed if it turns out to be otherwise. To any such person I say: forget it. Put all that aside and just experience the film as it is presented to you, without worrying whether or not you're watching a ""real documentary"". What you *are* watching is one of the finest exercises in relentless fear and unspeakable mystery ever set on film, and whether or not it really happened or these kids were truly lost in the Maryland woods just doesn't matter to that experience.

However, I believe that The Blair Witch Project would be the worst movie to watch before breathing! I can't understand how anyone was terrified by this movie. The premise was good, and I can understand how a similar situation could be truly frightening. But what truly terrified me was that with an investment of way under $100,000, the movie has made multi-millions of dollars. Even walking in circles in Maryland, you'll come out somewhere that you'd recognize as civilization. I found it very unrealistic and tedious, and it did not stimulate my imagination except to imagine life when the movie ended.",NA

WHAT WAS THAT CRAP!! Scary? What? Are you people all retarded??!! There is absolutely nothing redeeming about Blair Witch, nothing! It's isn't even worth another viewing for it's camp value, because it isn't even campy! Just what, may I ask, was so damn scary about it? Was it the terrible camera work, the absence of logic?

"kannibalcorpsegrinder","Overblown and not really worthwhile","19 May 2015","Arriving in a small Maryland town, a group of students shooting a documentary on the legend of the Blair Witch head out to the woods where a series of events forces them to believe the urban legend is true and try to leave the woods alive.

There wasn't much, but this one here did have a few good moments. One of the better elements here is the fact that the woods themselves look incredibly intimidating and freaky which goes a long way towards making them feel much more mysterious and imposing than normally expected. There's a really well-done attempt to make it seem like there's a real presence just beyond the eye-range, and it makes the terror and suspense of the scenes that much more powerful. Among the better sequences is when they come upon the Wiccan ceremonial site which is creepy, disturbing and a little unnerving, and it stands up as one of the best scenes in the film. There's also the fantastic scene where they come upon a specific site in the forest after leaving it behind earlier and their disbelief at it is really accomplished well. The film's best accomplishment is that it really makes it seem like a supernatural force is behind it all, and this is mostly done with just noises, yells or screams that indicate something is amiss and it just seems all the more realistic that something is causing it even without showing the actual witch here. When the small artifacts turn up or the camping equipment goes missing during the night, it just makes it far more creepy and realistic. While its' slam-bang ending ends the film in the right manner, there's quite a few flaws to it that manage to hold it down. The main one is the seemingly aggravating and annoying camera-work throughout here, as the entire purpose is ruined with the shaking-camera gimmick. Granted, it's supposed to be through their lenses as they're out in the woods and is handled well in that regard, but you still want to be able to see exactly what you're shooting. There's no way it should've featured the scenes of them running through the woods still shooting, since the shaking camera makes it nearly impossible to see what's being attempted, and there's really nothing in there that needed to be seen, making it quite confusing why that was being attempted. It's practically impossible to do so in some of the film's scenes in here, especially the second campground attack as it looks exactly like it's being shot through the wrong lens and is out-of-focus since there's no way it has to look as terrible as it does there, and a later shot of them wandering around in the woods is ruined due to the glare from the Sun in the background, and for a couple seconds it really looks like the entire scene has a tarp thrown over the area, darkening it to an unimaginable degree. The last big flaw is that this one has one of the most boring and dull set-ups ever. The early scenes of them filming their set-up for the shoot itself is just packed with nonsensical scenes that really could've been explored in a prologue introduction where they come upon research giving the same answers rather than the bland interviews here that don't move the film along any faster. The last half of the film is barely any better in that the constant yelling and screaming at each other is just impossible to sit through. It's not character-building, it's just aggravating to the audience to have to sit through them yelling and curse at each other for five minutes about moves that don't even matter at all, and each time it becomes harder to get through. Beyond these issues, there's not a whole lot to like here.

This might work if the characters were sympathetic and compelling but actually they are whiny, annoying, pathetic brats. They have gone out walking in an area of woods that they don't know and not a one of them can even read a map. They start whingeing and moaning right from the beginning, far before there is even a hint of any malevolent presence. They just bumble around directionless and snivelling without making any plan or discussing any interpersonal relationships or history that could constitute plot, context or back-story.

Frankly they are such terrible company to be in that you actually want them to die and the slow pace of the film just causes frustration when you find you are an hour in and they are still not dead yet.",NA
"Cobbler","Like A Punch In The Jaw","24 August 1999","Man, I'm never gonna forget this movie. I've seen it twice and will probably check it out again before it leaves theaters. I agree with the person who says it's more like a tragedy, not a horror movie. It reminded me of those news stories you hear about people disappearing and then turning up later, dead. I felt like this movie portrayed the hopelessness and fear that people in those situations must feel. There wasn't a moment that I didn't feel like I was there, along with the characters, feeling all their emotions. I thought the improvisational acting was outstanding, and I appreciated not being handed my ""scares"" on a platter; instead, the movie asks that you use your own imagination to make the movie work. This is by far the most original and unforgettable film I've seen all year.","10"
"horrormoviefan101","a film that truly redefined the horror genre","30 December 2010","Who would've thought that a movie filmed in grainy camera quality and by a completely unknown cast and crew would still be remembered and talked about to this day. Despite being eleven years old, this movie doesn't feel dated at all and remains incredibly horrifying. Everything about this movie hits the bullseye. The three actors are all magnificent, especially Heather Donahue, who's gut-wrenching (and often parodied) final confession to the camera is truly chilling. The shaky camera effects are poor quality, but that's what make this film so believable. And although this isn't the first time that a first-person perspective has been used, this is definitely the most well done version. The movie just feels so raw in its presentation and every little thing about it works in. But what really makes this film stand out (at least to me) is the fact that the audience is never given a view of the monster. In nearly every single horror film, we are given the chance to at least get a glimpse of the thing causing all of the death and destruction, however it's left entirely up to the imagination as to what's really going on. So many questions are left unanswered by the end and it's definitely for the better. ""Blair Witch"" is a movie that truly redefined the horror genre, opening the door for a wave of imitators and copycats. Even if you're not a horror fan, you should still at least check this wonderful piece of cinema out.","10"
"Wuchakk","Three amateur phukkin filmmakers stumbling around the phukkin woods of Maryland","26 August 2016","Released in the summer of 1999 three weeks after the mockumentary ""Curse of the Blair Witch"" debuted on TV, ""The Blair Witch Project"" is a found-footage film that covers the last days of three amateur filmmakers who wander around the woods of Maryland bickering and cussing.

I'm not a fan of found-footage films because they're not entertaining by their very nature. Since these types of movies are supposed to be ""found footage"" they come across as interesting as home movies of family/friends vacations, except that something weird or horrific is taking place. In this case, the three youths are baffled by the evidence of someone (or something) harassing them in the woods, which gets increasingly terrifying. It starts with mysterious piles of rocks and then stick figures; finally someone disappears and they later hear him/her torturously yelling in the distance.

The movie runs 81 minutes and that's just too long for the content. It could've easily been cut in half and would've been more effective for it, but they obviously had to make it ""feature length."" The Maryland woods and Heather Donahue's curvy butt can only maintain your attention for so long. The mockumentary ""Curse of the Blair Witch"" was a great set-up for this film and it's entertaining for what it is, but it's only like half as long. Watching three people stumble around the forest in home-movie quality footage cussing at each other is just tedious and unentertaining. For me, it's total dullsville; a snorefest.

A good example of a movie that takes the ""Blair Witch"" template and makes a vastly more entertaining movie is 2013's ""Another Kind,"" but that's mainly because it's an actual movie and not ""found footage.""

I knew the movie was fabricated going into this. I knew the hype on this movie. But I also knew that the movie was bought, they did not make it. A truely independant film, and a remerable horror film.

While you are watching this film you may think it is moving along rather slowly, but the deeper you get into the moment, the faster the movie goes, and has gone by.

One of the most amazing things about this film is the grip that it has on your mind. You have to listen to the movie, and the fact that you have to listen so hard to the background, that you may start to hear things that arent quite there.

The Blair Witch does feel the need to wrap everything up, it's part of the beauty. The movie does not end when the credits roll...you are still left thinking about it when you leave...it doesnt answer any questions, it doesnt want to answer any questions, in fact....it's the movie that is asking the questions and it is up to the audience to come up with it's own answers....","10"

But I am afraid this film crossed the line. While waiting in line to buy tickets for this movie, I asked a cinema staffer if they had been receiving any good reactions to this film. Her respsonse; ""People who go in thinking the film is real are disappointed, but I saw it the other day and LOVED it!"" So when I stumbled out of the theater, thoroughly scared, I had to think back to that comment and wonder what is WRONG WITH PEOPLE? Had I gone into that movie thinking it was authentic footage I would have come out physically ill. I don't know how to judge this movie. It was some of the most excellent acting I have ever seen...leading people to believe, I'm sure that it is real. And the dialogue was tremendous, the most realistic that I've ever been witness to...but does that mean I recommend it? I can't tell yet. I saw it over a week ago, but I'm still not sure how I feel. Yes, it is an incredible piece of work. But are we, as a society, crossing the line of voyeurism and taking it too far? What is the difference between this and a snuff film? Watching something you are led to believe is real, or in fact, is real...

Alot of the scares actually came from the film-makers reactions, feeling of hopelessness and dread of the dark. This film plays heavy on your fear of the dark, scaring you the way you used to scare yourself when you were 5 and in the dark. The last 20 minites totally steal the show in feelings of panic and dread. I highly recommend catching this flick when it goes wide release on the 30. Hell, some movie companies are maneuvering their releases so they don't have to compete with the wide release. Like Mystery Men and Deep Blue Sea.

I had never heard of this movie. Never saw any previews for it. I didn't know what to expect. What I got was an entertaining ride. I truly enjoyed this movie. It was creepy to see these people lost in the woods. The sounds and the way it was filmed is what makes this movie an excellent horror flick. The sounds are excellent. The movie was filmed bad (because the camera movies up and down as the person holding it walks) but that only makes it more realistic since the person filming the movie is supposed to be one of the kids who is filming the documentary. ( not a person trained on how to use a camera.) It all goes along with making it seem like it is a true story. This has to have been one of the best independent films I have seen since Halloween. It is a movie worth seeing and I give it 7 out of 10 stars.","7"
"TeaBunny","one of the best horror films of all time","13 October 1999","~spoilers~ Reasons why this movie is in my Top Five? The autumn woods, complete blackness, children laughing, branches cracking, the appearance of grave markers, dozens of stickmen in the trees, Mike screaming for Josh, crying, Josh howling in terror in the blackness, bloody teeth appearing out of nowhere, feeling alone, in the tent, dark, cold, hungry, what was that noise? We're gonna die out here.

For the naysayers: I find that most people who complain about elements of the film don't seem to understand said elements. Heather screaming was annoying? She only screamed at the end of the film. Too many curses? Every ""R"" rated movie has curses, and this is how people in this situation would talk. They were stupid, and didn't do the ""smart"" thing? Like what? The point of them hiking South all day and ending up in the same place was to show you that there were supernatural elements involved. They were not getting out of those woods no matter what they did. ""Running like hell"" would not have helped. (running? would that have REALLY made a difference?) They kept their supplies and tried to keep their wits about them. They could not FIND the car. That was the point. They went into the house because they thought Josh was in there. Scared of piles of rocks? Well, yes... they were grave markers and they appeared outside their tent! Heather found Josh's bloody teeth wrapped in his shirt! Scared? How foolish of them!

Originality, genuine creepiness, no need for traditional boring plot devices, no trendy Hollywood teens in tight shirts, no predictable writing. Just fresh original scares that will affect you for a long long time.

As the movie moves further along, the intensity will increase and keep increasing as if someone off screen were slowly turning a knob. It's hard to comment on this movie without giving to much away. As the film reached its climax, I was breathing hard and my heart felt like it was going to rip right out of my chest. When it was over, I was shaking all over, frightened out of my wits.

"L_Miller","Did you hear something?","8 July 1999","If that phrase makes your ears perk up and your heart pound a little, then you are a candidate for Blair Witch.

Lots of people have written, so just a couple of comments:

Don't expect Kubrick-esque composition or a Ry Cooder soundtrack; just a little story that touches most people in the small secret part of their brain that remembers when humans huddled around a fire and hoped those noises in the distance would pass them by. Let's just say nobody's going to put the Blair Witch on a Taco Bell cup.


Try and avoid the coverage before you see the movie. Particularly avoid film reviews and the '60 second movie' outfits of the world. You can still enjoy the film if you do read about it first (I did), but for maximum fear walk in with a blank slate.


The JumpyCam[tm] is distracting, but necessary. Those who complain that the film 'looks cheap' should remember that it IS cheap; it was shot with rented equipment by three college kids stumbling around in the dark scared out of their minds.


Before you do too many ""oh, well that's stupid"" comments about what these three kids do, remember that you're sitting in a nice warm theater and not out there alone in the dark. Who doesn't know someone (or is someone) who goes outside with a flashlight to check out a strange noise? They make some mistakes, but ask yourself what you would do in that situation if you _didn't_ know your legacy was going to wind up buried under a cabin in the woods.


I've heard talk of a sequel. Please, please don't do this. Don't ruin this little gem by trying to make it into a 'franchise'. Let it be a horrifying little slice of Americana and let it go at that. Please.


Be careful about seeing this movie, because it is not easily forgotten. My wife and I saw a preview the day before we moved into a new home; let me tell you, those first nights with the new sounds and the new silence got mighty long.","7"

You people that put 'The Blair Witch Project' Down are obviously nothing but stupid... You have no arguments... WOW so it didnt show a witch.. have u ever thought that that isnt what the movie is about?... ITS NOT! its about the fear of the unknown if u want to go see villans all the time rent another movie... and by all means if u know that you dont like these kinds of movies... DONT go see it... we (the people who liked it) dont want to hear your ignorance!

Its different thats for sure and it might just be the reason it scared people off... or the fact that you acually (and dont lie to yourself) go in the theather knowing you are gonna come out hating it reguardless... ONLY because of the hype... well a HYPE doesnt mean it is going to be a bad movie AT ALL ( see Titanic... haha).

Never has such a film been soon brillant and shocking all at once... as this film I must say... Cleverness was the key in making this... because it is and feels true, pure and horrifing... you know that you will never go into the woods again at night without having in the back of your mind some part of this movie... why denie it? ... you know you liked this movie... because there is no way you couldnt.. cause there was nothing wrong with it....(and for the record the actors were superb... how else could you explain acting like a 'real' person the whole way through)

All I am going to say is that if u didnt like this movie... get your head checked... cause u are missing out on acually having the privilege to say...

It manages to spook you with no gore, violence or things jumping out at you. It just uses darkness and other things (I don't want to give anything away). The acting is realistic and the dialogue sounds realistic (hard to believe it was all improvised). However, there's one HUGE problem with the film. It's the jerky hand-held camera work. By the end of the film, I was on the verge of throwing up! Imagine being on a rocking ship for an hour and a half straight...not a pleasant sensation. The camera work does work for the film, but it's just very difficult to sit through without getting severe stomach cramps. Well worth seeing (the final sequence can give you nightmares) but see it on an EMPTY stomach!",NA
"ScaryBoy","The best horror movie ever made","1 August 1999","The above statement is no lie. The Blair Witch Project was absolutely magnificent from start to finish. It replaces Scream as my favorite horror movie, even though they are too totally different to compare to one another. The performances in Blair Witch are totally convincing and amazing. I have always heard the phrase ""Just keep telling yourself it's only a movie . .."", but I never really knew what that felt like -- until now. Seeing the looks on the actors' faces, it felt like you were there with them and you could totally identify with them. The three actors were excellent, with emotions ranging from humor to sorrow to sadness to fear to utmost horror. Heather Donahue especially does well with her character undergoing the most significant change, but Mike Williams and Josh Leonard are good too. The scares are more subtle in this film than in your usual thriller - there is no clanging musical score to let you know when the scares are coming. The uneasiness starts off slow, with the film throwing us off-balance early on with a great deal of humor. But gradually the terror becomes more and more apparent, and you feel more and more like grabbing hold of the nearest person and not letting go until it's all over. And what an ending - several people have said it's not clear enough what happens, but I disagree. I think it is good just the way it is. By the finale you are totally run ragged, and it ends perfectly. I think everyone should see this movie. Forget about the cliches of I Still Know What You Did Last Summer; the real deal in horror movies is this amazing film. 11/10","10"

"Kukkanen","Utterly unfrightening amateur crap...","1 November 1999","This movie should be retitled in the name of Psychology. I suggest a name change from 'The Blair Witch Project' to 'The Effects of What a pseudo-Documentary of Three Bickering, Swearing, Sleep, Food and Cigarette Deprived American 20-Somethings With Over-Active Imaginations Due to Emotional Instability the lack of the afore mentioned] Can Have have not!] on a typical American audience.' Doubtlessly that title would be a burden for cinema-listings, but seriously! This movie seemed over-long, yet it couldn't have been more than a little over an hour long. I couldn't help yawning. Maybe I'm not impressionable enough, maybe I've seen too many cheap-thrill type shockers to get the subtlies... maybe the home-films shot by my parents of my siblings and I frolicking in our garden are more inspired. Lets face it, this 'film' just defies any logical explanation of a plot, a purpose or a reason. Furthermore, it has been way overhyped. The short trailer featuring a snippet of the Heather character's desperate soliloquy to the camera was actually scarier out of context on the t.v. screen. But that's the price you pay for creating false impressions--some are driven home in individuals willing and possessing the trait of being conned by hype; others just end up having their illusions shattered. Just between you and me, I knew deep down I wouldn't be scared, cause that's just not my personality, but I needed to verify it. Perhaps that's the other attraction of such movies... they make us doubt our senses and our convictions. But only temporarily. The moral of this story is that the real scares we have to experience ourselves. I don't believe such badly filmed footage can recreate in the audience any feelings of the terror felt by the actors.","1"

"mlraymond","Potentially scary film ends up annoying viewers, not frightening them","22 October 2006","I did not see the fake documentary on TV that was shown before the movie was exhibited in theaters, so I went on what I had read about it.It seemed to have some real potential, but there was a pitfall built in from the beginning: The reported determination of the producers not to show any monsters or maniacs; nothing that the three students couldn't have filmed themselves. This might have been an interesting concept, but it just does not work in the actual movie. I found it really annoying that not once in the entire film does anyone, either townspeople or students, say anything remotely serious or believable about the alleged Blair Witch. The closest it gets to that is when a man is being interviewed and he recounts the true story of the hermit who had murdered some children right at the start of World War Two. But even this seemingly promising thread goes nowhere, as it's never connected to the Blair Witch. Heather stands before a couple of locations, including a cemetery and Coffin Rock, and makes dramatic pronouncements about what happened at these places,without ever giving us a clue as to what she's referring to.The one eerie part that might have really worked up to a genuinely frightening conclusion was the disappearance of the one student, body parts being found, and terrible screams and then his voice calling to the other two for help. I toyed with the idea that a possible explanation is that he went crazy and ran off, hid out, and then murdered the other two. But we are never given any kind of real explanation for the ending. One can only assume that the remaining two students are about to be killed by someone or something, but we have no idea who or what it might be. The audience needs to be shown something, however small or insignificant it might seem. Val Lewton understood this with his RKO Studios horror pictures of the Forties. He and his crew used sounds and shadows and darkness to scare the audience by suggesting something evil was lurking nearby, or something terrible was about to happen.The Lewton pictures show just enough, without overdoing it. Best example: The Leopard Man, 1943. In a small town where an escaped leopard is prowling, a young girl has to go out alone in the dark of night to the store. She has to pass under a railroad bridge. As she starts forward fearfully into the blackness, two glowing eyes stare at her from high up and then disappear. The audience wonders if we actually saw something. A train suddenly hurtles overhead with a terrifying noise and flash of light. As we recover from this fright, there is a closeup of the roaring panther as it attacks the girl! She runs home screaming and begs to be let in, but her mother refuses to open the door. Terrible growls and screams are heard and then a pool of blood slowly puddles under the door. Now, THAT is scaring the audience with very little! There is more fright in five minutes of that film than all tedious 87 minutes of The Blair Witch Project. If only the producers had put one tenth of the imagination into the actual movie as the marketing campaign, they might have really given us a memorable horror film. As it is, The Blair Witch Project is basically nothing more than a clever idea, badly realized.","3"
"paul_mampilly","It is all in the imagination","16 October 2000","This movie is probably one of the most original movies that I have seen. It is about three adventrous students, who wants to investigate the infamous Blair Witch. But it all goes horribly wrong when strange and werid things happen. Strange formations of rocks and twigs and shadows of an unidentified being. The best thing about the movie is that is done in a Dogma style.

So it seems to be so real. Also it gives the movie a more atmospheric feel to it. And it does not show what the Blair witch is. For all we know it could be a tabby cat or a sadistic maniac killer wanting to kill fresh faced students. This movie is a breath of fresh air to all the other type of ""slasher type"" horror movies.

"mrb0775","Fraudulent Movie Reviews Conned People Into Paying Money To See This Crap!","8 September 2019","In the summer of 1999, after reading a couple over zealous (to say the least) film reviews, which heaped much praise on ""The Blair Witch Project"", while helping to bring more public attention to the flick, such publicity, unfortunately, led my wife and I to become victims of being suckered into wasting some of our hard earned money to buy tickets to one of the top frauds ever pulled on unwary moviegoers.

Certainly, low budget horror films, such as the original ""Night of the Living Dead"", and ""Henry: Portrait Of A Serial Killer"", to give just 2 examples, have proven that genuine chills and suspense can be generated by some very modestly produced film efforts. But for my Mrs and I, the only reactions that ""Blair Witch"" was able to create in us were tedium, as well as my wife becoming nauseous from the constantly jerky camera movement, which was the major defining feature of the movie's purely amateurish photography. I wouldn't dignify that ""camerawork"" by calling it cinematography.

Some people who tend to overrate ""Blair Witch"", try to claim that in order for audience members to be able to perceive the supposedly authentic horror and terror of the flick, those viewers must be able to effectively use their own imaginations to fully appreciate the film. But that's just pure BS, folks! Because with ""Blair Witch's"" middle school level of overacting, and its crude photographic technique, in order for my imagination (which is quite good) to really succeed at helping the movie create an actual sense of terror, I'd have to work as hard at exercising my imagination, as would be required for me imagining that Megan Fox is actually treating me to some nice oral sex, right now!

BTW, without me presenting any specific spoilers here, let me quote an actually HONEST professional review of ""The Blair Witch Project"" that comes directly from the 1651 page ""2007 DVD & Video Guide"", by Mick Martin and Marsha Porter. Here's their entire capsule review of ""The Blair Witch Project"", as it appears on page 114 of that handy & informative volume, about movies available on video. ""A fiendishly clever publicity campaign fueled the release of this ultra-low budget quickie, which turned out to be one of the biggest swindles ever perpetrated on unsuspecting movie audiences. This ""faux documentary"" about three young filmmakers who meet an uncertain fate while investigating an old legend in the Maryland woods, fails to deliver, on all counts.""

So, as many readers will have already surmised, from the description of ""The Blair Witch Project"", provided in that DVD/movie guide, the authors of that book gave ""Blair Witch"" their LOWEST rating, which is their classification of TURKEY, that's reserved for really poor movies. And honestly, if IMDb's ratings included a ZERO STAR rating, that's precisely what I'd assign to crap like ""The Blair Witch Project""!!","1"
"planzing","Deserves an Oscar for ""Hype of the Year""...","27 July 1999","The pre-release publicity campaign for Blair Witch was truly awesome in its success at building anticipation, from the teen-target word of mouth stage right through the SciFi Channel hourlong trailer that set the movie up very effectively for its limited release in major US cities. It's been many a full moon since this filmlover has seen an audience so charged up that they literally were running into the theatre to grab a good seat. We were going to see something new, something different. Above all, we were going to experience a film which was ""Scary as Hell!""

Instead, we got faux cinema verite with just a hint of Tobe Hooper. Instead of shock we got a crock. The cinematography, let's face it, was just plain poor. The vaunted ""performances"" of the three leads were adequate acting-class improv. The ending simply did nothing with the basic premise except to close it within the acceptable minimum running time. As a fear-inducing entertainment, Blair Witch is dead on arrival. When it opens wide this weekend, many an exhibitor will be deluged with demands for return of the ticket price. Those reviewers and fans who suffer from the Emporer's New Clothes Complex (I believe this will be great, therefore it is!) are in for a mighty repudiation from the American filmgoing public, and Artisan, which artfully managed the hype-machine on this little movie, will be forced to pull the plug on any notion of mass-market success with this TBWP.

This said, Blair Witch does work really well on one level. As a metaphor for the ignorance and ineptitude of the American media covering any story of real importance, the film is, in fact, a powerful indictment. I do suspect this was the real intent of the filmakers, so blatant is this theme as the movie unreels. But as a fearsome chiller-thriller of the psychological variety? Please.

For real films of this type, I refer the interested reader to Polanski's The Tenant, to Cronenberg's Videodrome, to M, Peeping Tom, or The (original) Haunting. Blair Witch is worth seeing, but for none of the reasons put forth by its publicity campaign. Filmgoers not conditioned to believe everything they hear will feel ripped off by Artisan, the Sundance crowd, and the filmakers themselves.

Many people will watch this film without giving it their full attention, and will come away saying, 'it's boring, you don't see anything.' no, you don't see anything, but these people are also the same people that will ask why the girl was standing in the corner at the end... paid no attention to the film.

The actual cast were apparently kept awake all night by the film crew, so when they look tired and fed up, they really are. Also most of the script was improvised.

Also, the film crew made up the legend of the Blair witch, so in the film, when they ask the town folk about the blair witch (and they are real town folk), they just lie, and say that they have heard of her, and she lives in the woods.","9"
"Criz","Not Scary, But Definitely Intriguing","6 August 1999","First of all, let me say I did NOT find this film scary. A few kids in the woods jumping around when they hear noises does not send me shrieking to the concession counter for something to calm my nerves. This film is definitely tense, grating and suspenseful, but not scary. The problem is, of course, that the premise is nonsensical. Those of us over 7, who realize witches do not exist outside campus sororities, will not be alarmed at a few tree branches rustling outside a tent.

On the other hand, your girlfriend will probably go bananas watching this film. Five minutes of tension and she'll be clinging to you like you're the last donut at a policeman's ball. (That might not be a bad thing...)

Despite the inherent silliness of the plot, top marks go to Heather Donahue. Not since Pamela Lee's plastic surgeon has anyone done do much with so little. Donahue is an incredibly talented actress, who deserves to win an Oscar for this role (yes, you read right..she's that good) and she would, if the Academy didn't keep dishing out the hardware for drivel like ""Shakespeare in Love.""

In conclusion, do see this film. Ignore the jiggly camera, the bizarre lenswork and the overacting of Heather's male co-stars. Introduce yourself to Miss Donahue. This lady is something special.",NA

"Jacques98","A very intense movie for people who can appreciate what it tries to accomplish.","10 October 2008","Something that so much of the horror genre lacks is realism. While ""classics"" like A Nightmare on Elm Street do nothing but bash you over the head with a block of cheese, they get positive reviews because they follow the same tired, safe formula that make the horror fans go in their pants due to nostalgia. The majority of the horror genre isn't really scary, and it never was. When The Blair Witch Project first came out it was the only movie to break these rules and delve into true, realistic terror. It didn't follow a formula. It tried to recreate the terror of someone lost in the woods on film, without the cheese or eye candy. I think that is why it captivated me. I've seen thousands of movies in my life, the majority horror movies, and maybe less than 5% really scared me. I'm not sure The Blair Witch Project scared me, but, I can say I felt the terror in the characters and script more than the vast majority of the other horror movies I've seen combined.

But there is another factor it seems no one is mentioning in their reviews. If you've never been lost in the woods, as I've been many times, I'm not really sure you could appreciate or understand the fear that the characters were feeling. If you're not a camper, I really doubt you'd like this movie whatsoever. A lot of the negative reviews from people calling this ""stupid"" or ""boring"", I can understand if they've never been lost in the woods. This is NOT a film everyone will like, or should like, and that is something someone really needs to say.

Because I'm reviewing this in 2008, not 1999, I'm going to have to add that this movie is not like Cloverfield whatsoever. Cloverfield was a huge adventure caught on a small camera, while this is a small adventure caught on a small camera. If you liked Cloverfield (or vice versa) and are looking for a similar experience, this isn't it. They're both good movies, but for very different reasons.

The main flaw that a lot of people are having a problem with is the pacing, which is reasonably slow. The reason for this is because it is meant to echo real life, not bash you with an explosive beginning like is typical Hollywood. Some will find this boring. Some won't because they appreciate realism. I fit into the latter.

Overall, a very intense movie . . . if you know how to understand it. I found it very enjoyable and lacking of the typical horror cheese, which is something I can't say much anymore. Very much worth watching. You are not a real horror fan if you haven't at least viewed this once, because it's unlike anything that has ever been made before it.

"EVOL666","Don't Go See This One Drunk...","9 February 2006","I tend to like to sneak some liquor in when I go to the theater - makes me feel more like I'm watching it at home but on a bigger screen and usually makes the screening process more enjoyable...not so with THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT. This film had more shakes then a Tijuana hooker. I literally felt sea-sick from all the shaky camera-work (the cheap bourbon may have played a part too - but I doubt it...). I know this was a micro-budget film and that the ""real"" feel is supposed to be what makes this films so ""great"" - it just made my stomach hurt.

This one is about a group of kids who venture into the woods of Frederick County, Maryland (where I just so happen to reside...) in search of some mythical witch. There's also some side-story about a crazy old guy that abducts kids, but honestly, it's been so long since I've seen this one that I don't even remember what that whole thing was about. In fact, I've lived here for quite a while and have never heard anything about any Blair Witch in the first place, but that's another story. The kids go into the woods and they disappear, and the premise of the film is that what the audience sees is the ""found footage"" (much like the basic storyline of CANNIBAL HOLOCAUST)...

The same reason that I give this film credit is the very same reason that I hate it - MARKETING. This film had the most ingenious marketing techniques and ""hyping"" that I've ever personally witnessed for a theatrical release. The endless bombardment of commercials, the ""true"" documentaries - everything about how this film was marketed was absolutely brilliant. Which brings me to my major gripe with the film...It didn't live up to the hype. The first two-thirds of the film is boring footage of the three adventurers getting ready for their trip, and then walking in circles in the woods - all shot through a hand held camera that looks as though the person holding it has Parkinson's disease. The very end of the film is relatively ""creepy"", but I couldn't figure out how it tied in to the rest, and honestly don't care to bother trying to piece it together.

I give the filmmakers credit for pulling off such a hugely successful film with no budget, and I like the idea of an independent film being shown theatrically - but THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT just wasn't scary, and in my opinion is THE MOST over-hyped film I've ever seen. 3/10","3"

At a certain moment the first more or less scary moments occur, the lights turn on and the movie is over! Hitchcock knew how to bring suspense in a picture (like ""the Birds"" or ""Psycho""), a number of movies knew how to bring scary filth (like ""Evil dead"" or ""Hellraiser""), both being able to scare you in some way. This movie doesn't either of them. Together with the illogical behaviour of the 3 main characters to find a way out of the woods, I had to close my eyes many times: It was a slow, boring, illogical and bad movie.

Many people class this movie as boring. It is true, there is little ""action"" in at least the first half of the movie. However, this is not meant to bore the audience but merely get under the character's skins. The great thing about the characters in Blair Witch, is that they are gritty, flawed people. They are not glamorous, sometimes not that likeable, like real life. The writers do not make any attempt for you to like them. This emphasises the fact they are real people and respond in a violent manner to an all-too real siuation.

There is practically no gore in this movie. The script is very repetitive- but when does a 20th century young American talk like Macbeth? And the ""acting"" lacks dynamics. But these are what make it unforgettable- ultra-realistic, ultra-menacing nitemare inducing in the extreme.

About half way through, bored out of my mind, I not only was rooting for the witch, but feeling aggressive myself. If there had been ""kill Heather"" or ""kill Josh"" buttons to push on my VCR, I would have punched them without an ounce of regret.

The only good things going for Blair Witch is that it would be fairly creative for a high school class project (if it were one) and that it attempts to create suspense without all kinds of overblown special effects. Still, if the writers/directors/etc. had read an article or a book on how to create horror/suspense, they would have developed characters with which the audience could identify (I hate to think about who DOES identify with this bunch) and who have more of a personal stake in finding out about the legend of the witch.

"lenndogg","It's not what you see that's scary, it's what you DON'T see.","27 July 1999","Despite what some people say, slasher movies can deliver quite a jolt. It always gives a slight pulse-quickening when Jason drives a machete into his first victim. But for that extended grab-the-armrest-until-your-knuckles-turn-white fear, only three different themes do that for me: religious-based horror, clowns (don't ask), and dread, the feeling that things aren't right and the cause of it is just out of reach, but coming closer. All the best frighteners did it, from the two notes on the cello to denote the appearance of Jaws, to the silhouette of Ma Bates stalking up the stairs, to the wry grin of Vincent Price, to HAL telling his superior that he ""can't do that, Dave"". The latest addition to this is The Blair Witch Project, which does it so well that almost half the audience I saw it with had difficulty breathing.

The movie is shown as a documentary showing three film students, Heather, Josh, and Mike, preparing a documentary on a local legend known as the Blair Witch. They film their documentary, but also videotape their experiences, too. After interviewing a few locals, they learn, with the audience, that there was a disappearance of some children back in the 1940s in the woods surrounding the town, and that people have mysteriously dying all the way back for 300 years. They then go out into the woods to film some scenes at different sites of the killings, and during this time, they describe the design of twigs that would accompany the killings. Starting on the second day, they realize that they are lost and when they camp down for the night, they begin to hear voices and disturbances, and when they wake the next morning, they find three rock formations outside their tent. Josh and Mike begin to blame Heather for getting them lost, since she was the one who put the whole thing together, and never bothered to scout the area first. After the third night, they change from being a little worried to completely terrified. They frantically try to backtrack out of the woods, until they realize how lost they are....

First of all, I have to give kudos to the plot. Documentaries in documentaries have been done before, but it works very well here, as they are still taping themselves in hope that if they don't make it out alive, at least their film will. The premise of a local legend as the backdrop serves as an overarching fear. Many areas have that urban or backwoods legend like the Jersey Devil, and this will remind anyone who has ever went into the woods as a youth and tried to find the truth in the rumors. The whole trick is, you never actually see it, you just see what possibly is the outcome. The use of a simple black & white camera and a camcorder only heightens the worry, with the lower technology reinforcing the idea of just regular people. There is a scene near the end when Heather holds the camera up to her face and apologizes to Mike's, Josh's, and her parents as she is so overcome by terror she can't speak without crying hysterically and running her nose. The three of them show real fear as they face their own doom, and you can't help but feel slightly voyeuristic watching this.

The main question of movie is if this is real or not, so if this is pressing you, stick around for the end of the credits. This movie draws on the most primal fears we all have: the unknown, the things you can't explain, and the things that go bump in the night. Not seeing what is happening is what creates that feeling of dread. It's the watching of things unfolding and the anticipation that delivers the fear, i.e. the hunt being much more visceral than the actual kill. This delivers one hell of a scare and considering the lack of true horror movies of this decade, I would rank this up there with Jacob's Ladder and It (the whole clown thing) as the best fright-inducers of the decade. It's biggest flaw might be word-of-mouth hype, because if you don't allow yourself to taken into a horror movie as a viewer, then nothing would scare you. I also had to ask myself why would they bother to keep taping if they thought they were in such mortal danger, but obviously, the movie would fall apart if this aspect is noted. I rate this a 7 out of 10, (definitely worth the price of admission) because this is a great original concept executed with great results, not perfect, and it is certainly not the scariest movie ever made, but it does sparkle. This is a movie to see if you want to get a real pit in your stomach, and if you let it, it will. After seeing this, you might think twice before going out in the woods ever again.","7"

"FlashCallahan","ooooo, look a house....","22 March 2012","In October of 1994, three student filmmakers hike out to the woods of Blair, hoping to find evidence of a local legend ""The Blair Witch"".

At first, they find nothing except a pile of stones arranged by hand. As the sun goes down, they realise they are lost, but there is little panic.

They camp out, and in the middle of the night they see and hear things, things that are not normal.

When they awake, they find wooden dolls in cross-like formations. They were not there that night.

Then one of the students, Josh, is separated from the group.

The other two finally realise that they are in a very serious situation, and that they are being stalked, stalked by something that may be the very thing they were looking for...

I really do think that this is the mother of all found footage movies, and we wouldn't have films like 'Paranormal activity' and 'cloverfield' without it.

Yes, the last broadcast was made first, but which one has had the most recognition? which one pulled out all the stops in the marketing campaign? and most of all, which one is still as effective today as it was back then? The film works because it is simple. It's split in two, day and night. Daytime the audience is relatively safe because we just feel the despair of the group, but when the title card says 'night', thats when the dread kicks in and the film becomes something else.

Of course there are plot holes, such as 'when they lose the map, why don't they just rewind the footage because they have filmed the map?' or 'after all that time being lost, you come across a house, would you really go in?'.

These are all minor things, but other wise, this film is still as scary today as it was back in 1999, the performances are great, the sound is superb, and the overall feel of dread and despair etched on to the cast is excellent.","9"
"MartianOctocretr5","Flunked assignment","10 November 2007","We all know the laughable gimmick attached to this thing that was foisted when this came out. ""A camera with footage of three missing teens was found in the forest."" We were supposed to believe the three had been filming a documentary about the legendary Blair Witch haunting. The whole bit of trying to look like actual footage made by inexperienced camera operators was so contrived and overdone that its fake nature was almost insulting. How could they actually think this junk could fool anyone? ""Missing film makers?"" Right. It's no wonder anybody involved with this shoddy nonsense disappeared.

""Overdone"" is an understatement. Every two seconds, the view jostles around, and the camera is aimed at nothing while stuff goes on off screen. You get the corny cliché of fleeting, rapid panning movements that just show wild flashes. It reminded me of that hoax footage that was supposedly of a live Sasquatch taking an afternoon stroll through the forest. The pseudo-documentary approach looks more like a cheap reality show. ""Interviewees"" say dumb stuff, which tells nothing. Forget about any insights to the Witch herself. What you will see besides leaves on the ground is the endless f-bomb arguing of these mindless brats, culminating with the classic scene of a bad actress framed conveniently in the exact corner (accidentally, right, ha ha) as she sniffs her way through a meandering apology to everyone from her folks to her pet parakeet. I rooted for the witch to shut them all up.

Oh, and be on the lookout for the one of the greatest cop-out non-ending endings you'll ever see. Entertaining in its own way, this poorly executed gimmick ""project"" is one of the funniest things put on film.","4"

Jason jumps out from behind a tree and yells ""BOO!"", but scary in that disturbing way, that for the duration of the film, you have this sense of profound dread building up, the kind of terror that children who play in the woods at night and hear a scary sound feel for a brief while.

Sitting in the movie theater, the most honest feeling I had was ""I just want this to END"". Not because it was a bad film; I loved it. But because the terror of the charicters was almost tangible and spilling over into the audience.

"pat-89","The most original, inventive, & gripping film in ages","30 July 1999","Who ever thought you could make a movie like this and it would have turned out so well. I mean taking three unknown actors into the woods with shaky, handheld cameras and having them improvise most all the dialogue in a film that has an unseen villain and is almost completely absent of violence and gore. And somehow it is the scariest thing you will see for years to come.

Stellar horror films are few and far between. The only great ones in the last ten years were ""Seven"" and ""Silence of the Lambs"". But now ""The Blair Witch Project"" should be added to the list of horror classics, somewhere near the top. It does for camping what ""Psycho"" did for showering and ""Jaws"" did for swimming in the ocean.

As the three filmmakers get lost in the woods it becomes increasingly more evident with each passing night that someone or something is following them and has not taken a liking to their presence. The events that take place each night gradually become more and more drastic, making every evening more tense and frightening than the last. It continues to build until it reaches an ending of unbelievable intensity, and a final image that is as disturbing as it is perplexing.

The best thing about this movie is that it's seen entirely through the eyes of the victims. That is what makes it so damn scary. The fact that unknown actors were used also definitely makes it so much more real. When they use improvisation for dialogue they seem like normal people, and you can feel the anger, paranoia, and fear as it radiates off of them. They're great.

""The Blair Witch Project"" is a film that continues to haunt you long after the end credits have rolled. It stays with you. At night you may hear noises comparable to those in the movie. Just your imagination, right? This film is incredible. I loved it. Kudos to Eduardo Sanchez and Daniel Myrick. You guys are geniuses!",NA

I was queasy throughout from the horrible camera work (even if it was planned that way, it was disgusting!) and almost left from disgust several times through the movie.

Don't bother seeing this film! If ten of you pay 20¢ toward a $2.00 rental and plan to get drunk while watching it, you're STILL overpaying for it!

"Rerun-2","Supremely effective horror movie","21 July 1999","""The Blair Witch Project"" is one of the most terrifying and effective horror movies I have ever seen, hands-down. It is not scary because it throws lots of gory, expensive special effects at us, or had characters who do idiotic things like walk into a house occupied by a chainsaw-wielding madman or hide in the closet when a killer is stalking them. It is scary because of what it doesn't show us, because it knows that the things that make the noises in the night are never as frightening as the noises themselves.

I guess the term ""horror movie"" isn't quite right for this film. That is better reserved for the kind of movie I have described above. This is more like an experiment in fear, in tapping the nameless dread we feel when we hear...something...moving around in the darkness outside our flimsy tent. When you are lost, and just can't find your way back. Those are fears I can relate to. I think almost anyone can. ""Horror movies"" place characters in implausible situations, so we can distance ourselves from the action. ""Blair Witch"" draws us further in, so we are fascinated even as we can barely stand to watch.

The movie's setup involves three student filmmakers who gather in the little Maryland town of Burkittsville to shoot a documentary about a witch that used to live in the woods at its borders. They never return, and their footage is found a year later. The ""movie"" consists of the footage pieced together in chronological order to show what happened.

They interview several people about the witch; some are ambivalent, some disbelieving. The conversations are believable and not contrived; they are like something you would see in a documentary. They are also a warning, although the students do see it as such (one woman is asked if she believes in the Blair Witch, and she grins and replies ""I believe it enough not to go up there."")

They head into the woods to shoot footage of famous places in the witch legend, where unspeakable horrors were visited upon children and hunters. Gradually, things begin to get ominous. Strange piles of stone turn up outside their tent. At night, they can hear the noises of something moving around, something that refuses to show itself. At one point, they stumble across a grove filled with bizarre, frightening stick figures, which hang from trees, twisting silently in the breeze.

They plan to spend only a weekend there, but the map disappears, and they appear to be going in circles. They are out of food, and worse, cigarettes. Every night they are harrassed by whatever is stalking them. Heather, the project leader, tries to maintain order but the cameraman, Josh, and sound man, Mike, begin to question her ability to get them out of the woods, leading to gender struggles and a gradual breakdown of nerves. I have been in situations like this, although far less dire, and people generally behave as these students do.

This is not a movie where things jump out at them in from dark corners or where gore and slime drips all over the screen. It is presented as a documentary, in a simple, realistic fashion, but with the growing realization that the characters are being hunted by supernatural forces. At first they react by simply not believing it; they seek rational explanations (""Did you ever see 'Deliverance'?"" asks Josh, suggesting they are being preyed upon by unwelcoming locals). Soon scientific postulation gives in to fear, because they simply can't ignore the evidence.

A movie like this is deeply unsettling in its implications, but it is exhilarating in its boldness and message that lots of money and big name actors are not needed to make a scary film. It was shot on a shoestring budget by a little-known film company and directors. The characters are given the names of the actors. Everything is ""real"" as far as the movie is concerned, and that was real enough for me to decide I won't be camping again for awhile.",NA
"vip-danii","Could Be Worse...","28 March 2013","It's not one of the worst movies I've seen, but it really doesn't live up to the hype. Definitely overrated. Mildly entertaining at times, but also kind of boring on the whole.

Goes without saying that it's poorly-made, but that's to be expected from an independent film. Didn't really bother me anyway. ""Cloverfield"" was MUCH worse in that respect.

One good thing about it, was the fact that it's somewhat refreshing (if you compared it to your typical run-of-the-mill Hollywood slashers).

It was more or less suspenseful, I thought. I didn't find it one bit scary, but the suspense WAS present. There wasn't any gore or violence, which I appreciate. No cheap/stereotypical scares, either.

Another good thing, is what it wasn't predictable (unlike most Hollywood movies in this genre). You're not sure what's going to happen next and it keeps you watching. The movie kind of drags, but you're curious, which keeps you from falling asleep.

The acting was half-decent, but the girl was TERRIBLY annoying. She doesn't shut up for one second, and her obnoxious voice rings in your ears several hours after the movie has ended. Also, she over-acts (kind of like Sandra Bullock -- very annoying).

I think calling it a ""masterpiece"", as some people have, is a huge overstatement. It's very far from being a masterpiece, but it's definitely worth watching. There are LOTS of high-budget movies that are not half as good as this one.","8"
"bakers4","Ultimate - almost like Val Lewton on steroids does Gen-X","18 June 2013","Horror film has long faced a fork in its story-telling road, a choice of which way to go. Universal Studios went with fantasy as basis of horror, nightmarish monsters - visually striking makeup design and execution. Settings featured vaguely fictional European landscapes of a past century mostly, as imagined. At RKO, Val Lewton took the 'horror movie' idea into an opposite direction, with stories set in modern era, and often familiar non- fictional places (New York, etc). And as the source of fear and horror, the unseen - what might be lurking in shadows, things suggested without certainty, leaving doubt, room for the worst imaginings - namely, the stuff that scares us in real life.

BLAIR WITCH would make Val Lewton smile. It offers no 'monster' or visual spectacle involving effects. Instead, fear emerges in a progression from the psychological to the supernatural, and with marvelous dramatic credibility. The film slowly builds intensity, and pulls it off with superb subtlety, from merest undercurrents of tension between characters who (in the scenario) are only just meeting, and with no prior acquaintance, team up to take on more than any of them are prepared for. Its pure story-telling, and brilliant as such. The 'script' (improv-based, I understand), actors and director deserve awards.

If you've ever camped in woods, and heard the type sounds coming from various distances in the dark, you're well prepared for one level of scares in this film. But BLAIR WITCH hits its stride in a deepening progression of scare levels. It proceeds from frightening realities - (lost in the woods, a survival situation emerging) - to possibilities of harm to life and limb by human intent ('Deliverance'-style deep woods yokels suspected)) - to horror of supernatural scope and scale, undeniably evil and violent.

Throughout the story arc, an air of doom gathers with increasing loss of control over circumstances the protagonists encounter, some just bad luck, others self-fostered. Indeed, the dysfunctional nature of peer relations and communication, is a foundation of everything that happens to our unfortunate principles. I've wondered if this ties in with the intensely negative reaction this film evokes for some - rightly puzzled at by various reviewers here more, shall we say - appreciative (or perceptive)? BLAIR WITCH panders to no pretensions, such as seem to preoccupy some tastes, and perhaps prejudice or constrain some reviews. BLAIR WITCH is a film with richness and many story aspects. But its not about whether its characters are suitably 'likeable' (as TV show film critics sometimes seem to expect), or proper 'role models' for any children in the audience, or ... etc.

What this film does instead, is offer credible characters, whose tendencies we recognize from real life and don't necessarily admire. The movies is less about 'liking' its principals, than believing what we're seeing as shown and told. And instead of giving us cardboard 'good guys' or 'bad' it gives us people who seem very real, and for whom we're inclined to feel different things in turn. The film portrays its protagonists as neither reprehensible, nor charismatic, inviting us neither to love nor hate them - only to feel the terror they undergo, and without any distraction of 'not believable.' Indeed, there's a contagiously realistic emotional quality to Heather's loss of control when she screams, with neither her nor us knowing what it is she's facing. We don't have to know what's going on, to be scared by it - in fact, the greater the unknown factor, the more unleashed the imagination, the more bewildering the fear. This is an awesome movie for discriminating, mature, no-nonsense tastes in unique horror film approaches, to be savored and viewed over and again.

Never before has the ""Lewton"" method - using shadows, the unseen, imagination taken past bounds of what's known, believed, imaginable, in context of things hinted at, power of suggestion etc. - been taken to such heights, and with such overwhelming effect. One of the greatest and most common weaknesses or failures of horror film, in general, is the lack of mental breakdown and stress that would probably occur in real life, if one were faced with some supernatural evil. Horror films most often dramatize only minimal psychological impact on their characters, after encounters with insurmountable horrors. Among BLAIR WITCH PROJECT's most admirable triumphs is its realistic depiction, and harnessing as an energy source driving story - of the toll taken upon the characters by the traumatic nature of the experience, as it unfolds, of their encounter with implacable horror. No spoiler to say they don't come back the same, I hope ... heh heh.","10"
"barfly99","Flawed but clever, and provokes amusing criticism","30 May 2000","TBWP has many flaws - the implausibility of some of the characters' behaviour, the irritation factor of watching people bicker for an hour, and so on. That said, it is an interesting little film with some clever touches (the interviewee's child covering her mother's mouth; the handprints in the house etc.). Scary? Not really, but then that couldn't be more subjective could it? THE EXORCIST had some people vomiting in the aisles yet it doesn't scare me at all (but the reverse could be true of another film). Anyway I personally I give TBWP six out of ten. What I find hilarious is the nature of the criticism this film has received since its release, which is almost as OTT as the hype that preceded it.

Most of those people who insist that is the worst film ever made are as one-eyed as those who said a year ago that it was the best. I notice that the early comments on the IMDb were nearly all hysterically complimentary, and now they're nearly all hysterically savage. There's nothing like a good bandwagon to jump on is there? (Or did the film suddenly metamorphosize from a classic to a turkey sometime last autumn?) This isn't the worst film ever made; there are countless worse (see the IMDb's own ""100 worst"" list for some prime examples). Harbouring unfettered resentment at the film-makers because you've seen an over-hyped movie is hardly a platform for objective criticism. If anyone had seen a film of this standard on late night TV and not cared for it they'd have turned it off and forgotten about it, and certainly not worked themselves into a frenzy about how awful it was. I particularly enjoyed reading the comments of those BWP-haters on here who remarked upon the ""suckers"" and ""idiots"" who actually watched it (can you spot something of an own goal here?).

The oft-repeated refrain that this film is ""cheap"" and ""amateurish"" beggars belief. Since it was made cheaply by then-amateurs, was hyped as a cheap film made by amateurs, and purports to be a cheap documentary made by amateurs, I would have thought its cheapness and amateurishness was rather to be expected. Given that the protagonists are supposed to be making little more than a home movie, the complaint about the jerky camera movements in this context is especially absurd - or would you have Heather & Co. set up dollies, cranes, and so on as they flee through the woods? If you've automatically got it in for this style of film-making (and you'd have to have been on Mars not to have known how TBWP was shot) why go and see it?

THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT has actually gone up in my estimation because it's reminded me of the power of movies to provoke the audience, and the public reaction to this film has been priceless. My absolute favourite comment I keep reading is ""I could have made this!"" Well since it cost next to nothing and those who made it are now multi-millionaires, why the f*** didn't you?","6"
"rwduke","Brilliant and Scary...An Instant Horror Classic","31 July 1999","Blair Witch is an excellent and very original horror film.

"koohii","I'm supposed to be scared by THIS???","20 August 2003","I realize that this is one of those pop-culture movies that everyone is going to go see, just because. However, I can say that if you absolutely have to see this movie, pay as little as you possibly can to do so. Rent something else when you're at the video store, because chances are you're going to want to watch something else after about half an hour--maybe less.

It amazes me that so many artsy-fartsy types are running at the mouth to praise this thing. OK, it was an independent film made with next to zero budget. OK, the actors were working improv without a script. Neither of those make this a good movie, or even an interesting movie. And granted, I am biased in that documentary is my least favorite style of filming.

The premise is that three film students are trying to make a documentary and get lost in the woods. There after someone/thing starts playing psychwarfare with them. Well, I'm not a film student, but there are two things I know to do when making a movie: Look up, and focus the damn camera! I also know how to point the camera at my face without giving it a view of the inside of my nostrils. The astounding stupidity of these people makes the movie so much worse.

""Duh, we don't need a map!"" Anytime you're going camping off the main trails, the first thing you do is figure out exactly where you are going. Even if someone else is in charge, each individual should have a good idea of the geography.

Another film theory nuisance: Color or Black&White. Choose!

I see little of interest or value to justify the praise this film is garnishing. I am not impressed. I am not scared. I am not enthused. I am not engrossed. In the end, I'm glad when the film is over, not because of a good ending, just because it is over.","2"
"Mr.Angel","You will either love this movie or hate it","1 August 1999","*SPOILER WARNING*

Personally, I loved The Blair Witch Project. I had been waiting in anitcipation for it ever since I saw a preview back in April. I was happy to see that I wasn't disappointed. Rather than rely on expensive and cheesy specail effects a'la The Haunting, The Blair Witch Project used the views own imagination to scare you.You NEVER know what is out in those woods making those sounds, which I think is much scarier than an actor in bad make-up. Of course, if you have a poor imagination, this concept is kind of lost on you :) . I loved the freakish sounds the characters heard at night, as well as the bizarre discoveries during the day. But once Josh disappears, it really picks up. When Heather finds the body part in the bundle of sticks and the final shot......brrrrrrrrrrr......freaky, scary stuff. It was like an old campfire story that was filmed. My one copmplaint was that there was too much day footage and not enough night stuff. I liked watching the slow breakdown of the characters, but I would have much rather have scene more of the creepy night sounds and maybe even a glimpse of a shadowy figure or something. As much as I loved this movie, I can understand why people may hate it. It was INCREDIBLY over-hyped by the Internet and the media. Hype will kill anything good OR bad. As well, the first hour is rather uneventful (but NOT boring). Not to offend anyone, but I believe this is a ""smart person"" horror movie. If you have a good imagination, and a grip on what horror is, and are not expecting special effects you will love The Blair Witch Project. Just sit back, and try and put ypourself in Heather's shoes and I htink you will really enjoy it. But go in with an open mind and expect soemthing totally different. Side note, that one scene with Heather making the apologies was awesome! The terror in her eyes...especially when she heard that sound...the defining moment in the film!

By the way, don't sit in the first few rows. I had to leave the theatre in the middle of the movie because I thought I was going to puke! The jiggly camera effects made me sea sick!",NA
"arsonistheway","Gimicky","5 August 2014","Let me sum up the whole movie for you. Some kids go into the woods to shoot a documentary and they die. That is the whole movie. Now just because a movie has this plot does not mean it will be bad because most horror movies have fairly simplistic plots and I like good horror movies. I will get this out of the way right now, I am 15 and if you are going to be the d*ck head who will not take my review seriously simply based on my age just go away. First of all, this movie is not nearly as ""innovative"" as so many people say. Cannibal Holocaust, The Texas Chainsaw massacre, and every film from the Dogme '95 movement used this sort of camera work to give the films a realistic feel. The real brilliance came from the marketing campaign because at the time of the film's release many people believed that this was an actual documentary and IMDb even said that the actors were dead, so many moviegoers were obviously scared even before they went to the theaters. The main problem is actually that this feels too much like a realistic paranormal documentary because this means we don't get to know very much about the characters, so now that we know these aren't real people we don't have much reason to care about them. Finally my biggest gripe is that nothing happens. There are no scares until the end and the only build up we get are a few interesting (yes, I said something positive) interviews with the people of the town this takes place in, so we have very little reason to suspect that the Blair Witch is real. I realize that this was scary back in the day with all of the build up and I don't want to destroy your good memories or viewing experience if the effect still remains with you. I just want to explain that in all honesty this movie has aged poorly and is on my sh*t list.","1"
"BooFez","The Blair Witch has set a precedence for this type of genre that was fun and enjoyable to watch.","16 April 2013","Heather Donahue decides to do a documentary about the urban legend of The Blair Witch. She takes along two other film students, Joshua Leonard and Michael C. Williams, who are just as eager to do the project as she is. Their trip was planned to go to Maryland, interview some townsfolk, film some of the historic sites in the woods and return home. A year later their camera footage was found.

Directors Daniel Myrick and Eduardo Sánchez decided to break away from the traditional cinematography and go with a first person view of the events that take place. We actually watch the majority of the movie through Heather Donahue's eyes. It was pretty creative and went well with the story and the actors.

The Blair Witch is really a feeling movie. You have to pay a lot of attention to the film and really get into the mood the scenery and actors are trying to set. There isn't any monsters, no ghosts and no gore to be seen. You have to use your imagination and focus on the feelings of the actors.

Heather Donahue and the rest of the crew do some great acting to suck you in and make you really feel like you are there scared for your life right along with them. The story kinda stalls towards the end as it seemed like they added some scenes in to make the movie longer but not noticeable on your first watch through.

The Blair Witch has set a precedence for this type of genre that was fun and enjoyable to watch. I recommend The Blair Witch to any fan and look forward to more movies of this genre.","7"
"BroadswordCallinDannyBoy","Not just a good horror film...","7 January 2006","One summer in 1994 three student went on a trip to the Maryland woods to do a documentary about a local witch legend. After interviewing some people in the nearby town they head off into the woods and soon realize they got more than what they bargained for.

The film is shown completely through the character's cameras and you really get the feeling you are watching a documentary. The grainy images and shaky camera really make it seem like this is some amateur student project. Obviously the whole thing was made on a low budget, but hardly ever has a production so effectively exploited its own limitations to deliver a film. The first-person perspective puts you right out into the woods and you are essentially perceiving the horror unfold through a victim's eyes and ears. This is often annoying, as by the time the film is through you'll be craving for some answers to all the spooky goings on, but the cleverness of this film cannot be denied.

Also clever was the ad campaign for this film which made it seem like this was a real documentary or at least a recreation of real events. Many believed it for a time, I know, because I was one of those people. By the time I view the film I knew it was all a fake. A hoax as some would call it, but I believe that ""hoax"" is the wrong word here: ""phenomenon"" is much more suitable. More suitable, because that is what this production created, not just a horror film, but utter Blair Witch craze; from books on the ""legend"" to video games and even a modest budget sequel. I think many people felt cheated when they found out that the Blair Witch was all orchestrated and I did too, but I think it should be viewed as part of the fun and not some let down. Once again, there cleverness of this film is virtually undeniable.

Years back there were some infamous Italian horror films like the terrifying ""Cannibal Holocaust"" which also made use of the documentary look and orchestrated hype about ""this really happened."" Though Cannibal Holocaust was more convincing (the production team was arrested and had to prove in court that horrifying film was just a movie), this is still a very worthy addition the horror genre. Even if all the hype is set aside. 8/10

"LindaKay","Over hyped but good","1 August 1999","The reviews I read were mixed but mostly were in big favor of the BWP. In general the movie was pretty good. The acting was great and the story was good too, including the last ten minutes. I may have enjoyed the movie more if I had been closer to the screen. As with most movies plays etc., you get more out it if you are more focused and are not distracted by your surroundings. You need focus with this movie. It is meant to be a documentary so I had no problem with the shaky camcorder and 16mm footage(apparently the character students were not in senior year). The biggest problem I had with the movie is that if I were scared and fearful of my life the first thing I would do is drop the camera no matter how dedicated I was to my work. Although Heather did admit she was using the camera as a way of dealing with the fear.",NA
"johnboy-16","Go to this film knowing as little as possible","2 August 1999","I was disappointed with how little ""The Blair Witch Project"" scared me. I felt like they concentrated too much on the being lost parts rather than the being stalked parts (which were truly creepy). It woulda been cool if during the day, they could hear something following them but couldn't see anything. When they stop, it stops, if they reverse, it reverses. Something like that. It was a really good movie, though. Original to say the least. I'd put it on the scare-o-meter level with ""Jaws"" and ""Psycho"", but much lower than ""The Shining"", ""Halloween"" and ""Alien"". Hopefully the inevitable copycats to follow will be really good and old-school scary. I will say this; though, I think ""The Blair Witch Project"" has the scariest ending I've ever seen. On the other hand, the scariest beginning I've ever seen was ""The Hitcher"" which, after the first scene, was not a scary (or good) movie at all. The moral: A scary scene does not necessarily make a scary movie. One last word of advice: The less you know about this movie, the scarier it will be when you watch it. If I were you, I wouldn't read anymore user comments or reviews.",NA
"trmusson","No suspense","29 July 2007","I'd read a little bit about this movie beforehand. Just enough to get the general idea. I was pretty sure I'd like it.

So I was expecting the intentionally amateur-looking camera work. That didn't bother me at all. Actually, that aspect of the movie worked pretty well.

But I was also expecting a little suspense. Maybe a few frights or surprises along the way.

My only surprise came when the end credits appeared, and I realised... that was really it. Nothing scary, original, or even vaguely clever had happened.

The fact that none of the three main characters were in any way endearing didn't help matters. At no point did I feel anything resembling care or sympathy.","1"
"lefty-17","A Successful Experiment!","1 August 1999","_The Blair Witch Project_ is, indeed, a very frightening movie; more interestingly, it's a pretty successful experimental film, of a sort I can't recall having seen before. The directors performed an experiment in ""method film-making"" here, taking three actors, giving them cameras and basic instructions in their use, set them loose in the woods and (evidently) spent some time scaring the blue daylights out of them while they played with the cameras. The results are very effective, not least owing to the film's complete obstinacy in refusing to explain what it is you're seeing. This film is possibly better enjoyed if you've seen the ""teaser"" segment on the Sci-Fi channel: it provides some useful context in which to place the actual film.","8"
"piteco_e_thuga","Most creepy and disturbing movie I've ever seen. This movie is the reason why I hate horror movies.","19 May 2016","I watched ""The Blair Witch Project"" in 2000 when I was about 9 years old with my older cousins and I remember I was in the room with them, because I thought it was just another documentary on Discovery Channel. I really believed everything I was seeing was true. Just imagine the impact that this movie made in my mind at that time. Those final minutes of ""The Blair Witch Project"" was the truly hell and nightmare on screen. I had never experienced that feeling of dread before. After I understood it was just a movie, but by then it was late. The scenes and disturbing sounds stuck in my mind for weeks and I take weeks sleeping with the light on to recover. I grew up with the certainty that I'm not a fan of horror movies.

Every horror fan is naturally a masochist. It's the pure masochism to love being scared and distressed for hours, days and even weeks. This is not my case, so I always avoid to watch this film genre. But I need to give ten stars for Blair Witch, because this movie really was able to mess with my most instinctive fears without show in no time the witch's face, or whatever the hell was that thing that was chasing those adolescents. This movie was creepy because the fear that it brings is the fear of the dark, fear of being lost walking in circles, fear of unknown sounds at night. That alone is scary enough, but there was also the growing fear of someone or something is stalking you and that there is no escape. Today I think the most brilliant thing is that the movie does not deliver anything ready for you. The plot just forces you to imagine what really happened to the three teenagers - and every possibility is more sinister and darkness than the other. Thinking better, there are certain things that are better not be seen. No doubt, the most disturbing and creepy movie I've ever seen. Well, I'll never see it a second time, but if you are a horror fan, mainly psychological, then this movie is for you.","10"
"David_Niemann","I was so scared & disturbed it had me in tears...","25 August 2002","Three young people enter the woods to film a documentary on the myth of The Blair Witch. Does the myth have some truth in it, or is it just a scary story passed down over the years. Heather, Mike & Josh intend to find out. A year after their travel their footage was found, and the movie is their footage put together.

'The Blair Witch Project' is a creepy psychological horror film. Stepping away from hack 'em up slasher movies, Blair Witch is more of a 'what was that noise?!' kind of film. Your imagination plays host a lot of the time. The more wild your imagination runs the more scared you get.

And certainly it's not a 'jump out of your seat' scary film, its more of a 'jump out of your mind' film. During the film there were two scenes that were extremely creepy, but the ending is the best part (or worst depending on how you look at it!). Coming up to the end I was rather disturbed, but the final scenes tipped me over the edge. The final scene had me in tears I was so scared and disturbed, I was almost shaking.

And through all the scares it actually contains quite a bit of humour. I was impressed with the three leads, all conveying a sense of terror in their own way. Heather is a really nice character, I would have like to have seen more of her. The interviews with the locals at the beginning were also very interesting and well done.

A lot of horror films have made me scared or jump out of my seat, but none have ever made me so frightened I started to cry...

"TrevorG.","Not only are the actors lost in the woods, so is the film.","27 August 1999","The Blair Witch Project flounders helplessly without a cohesive script, stranded in the horror hierarchy just one notch above the story about the escaped mental patient with a claw for a hand. (And then... they found a hook dangling from the car door!)

The Blair Witch Project is a movie that is desperately, desperately in need of a script. It has a story, it even has a plot of sorts. But virtually every line of dialogue committed to film is ad-libbed, and it shows. Painfully. The basic story elements (creepy undefined horror in woods, cocky filmmakers go out to chase it, and the horrible clever ending which I won't reveal) float freely in a swampy morass of random noise from our 3 stars. And every third sentence, of course, invokes that sacred refrain of the indie film, the word 'f**k'.

Being a hard-core fan of H.P. Lovecraft, the basic premise of the Blair Witch Project sounded great to me. Three innocent kids go into the back woods of New England and are driven insane by an unspeakable eldritch horror. Groovy, right? The problem is, the horror is so unspeakable, and so eldritch, that it becomes unfilmable, too. The Blair Witch Project has absolutely zero explanation of the Witch's nature, and the viewer is left more confused than tantalized. I'm not suggesting that what was needed was footage of the actual Witch, but a sense of closure, provided more by the story than the action.

I realize people make a big stink about Blair's 'unorthodox' and 'refreshing' new style, but I prefer to think of it as cheap and insulting. I'm not saying I wanted to see CGI bursting from every frame (perish the thought), but some basic competence would have been nice. I realize the film makers are shooting for the pseudo-documentary look, but the results do not justify the premise. Heck, the movie would have been a lot more interesting if the witch was pitted against a professional documentary crew.

The fact that The Blair Witch Project is so believable actually stems from its greatest weakness: it looks exactly like what would happen if you and your buddies grabbed a camcorder and went off into the woods to hunt ghosts. In the end, what Blair Witch lacked wasn't a larger budget, or special effects, or computers, or big-name stars, but simple screenwriting. It's hard to believe that the directors of the Project had any directing to do; they just had to hunt through the actors' film and edit together a semi-coherent chunk of movie.",NA

This wasn't scary, creepy, or intriguing, the characters were irritating and moronic and generate no viewer sympathy towards them, and the story and its conclusion left those of us who haven't seen the website (which gives MUCH NEEDED background) scratching our heads in confusion.

If you're expecting a really classic, scary horror film, you're going to be really disappointed. And as exit polls are indicating, a lot of us are really disappointed (60 percent of the 600 polled who said they ""couldn't wait to see movie,"" ended up giving the film a C, and those who were just accompanying their friends, and who, presumably, had no strong interest in the film, gave it an F).

I was so anxious to see it, but I couldn't get anyone to see it with me. To satisfy my curiousity, I read everything I could get my hands on about it, particularly the user comments here on IMDb. More than once, I was advised not to learn anything more about it, to see the movie with as little knowledge about it as possible. I didn't listen to these warnings, and now that I've seen the movie, I regret learning about it first! I knew about almost everything that was going to happen, and I think it was for that reason that I wasn't as scared as I thought I would be (though that's not saying much - it still scared me more than any other horror movie I've seen to date - I tried to put my glasses back in their case and I had to wait a few minutes, because my hands were shaking so badly). So take my advice, if you're anything like me - DON'T READ THE SPOILERS. If you're willing to resist reading all the information out there, be as ignorant about The Blair Witch Project as you possibly can. It will make seeing it many times better, and scarier.",NA

It really seems as if this is a home movie. Nothing seems contrived. To really enjoy the movie, you must get into the characters and their situation.

Two young student filmmakers Heather Donahue & Joshua Leonard pick their friend Mike Williams up & set off for Burkitsville, Maryland to investigate & film a documentary on a local legend known as the 'Blair Witch'. To get their documentary going they interview various residents of Burkitsville who tell the tale of the Blair Witch, with the interview footage in the can the three set off into the nearby woods to carry on their documentary & try to delve a little deeper into the legend.

Their plight becomes desperate as they run low on food, morale, patience & are continually harassed by someone or something, someone or something evil...

Edited, written & directed by Daniel Myrick & Eduardo Sanchez The Blair Witch Project was apparently shot in a mere 8 days, was made for about $22,000 & made back $240,500,000 which is a ratio of $10,931 made for every $1 spent which ain't too bad, is it? Persoanlly I like certain aspects of it but dislike others. The script tries to keep it as real as possible with natural dialogue (I'm not sure who counted but apparently The Blair Witch Project contains 133 'F*cks') & most of the film looks improvised which I think it was. Everything is kept to a minimum & nothing is really explained which gives it a genuine creepiness at times, in this case less is more. We know what the characters know, which is pretty much nothing when I think about it. It can drag a bit, has only three character's & it does go round in circles while the lack of any sort of explanation for anything did annoy me & then there is the bizarre ending which will either please or disappoint you. The main area where The Blair Witch Project stands out is the way it is filmed just like a documentary & the film could indeed be made up of scraps of footage haphazardly spliced together as it alternates between colour & black and white & the cinematography has a real amateur hand held jerkiness about it to add to the supposed authenticity & we get lots of pointless (but psychologically important for the whole documentary effect) shots of people's backs, the ground & the sky, the entire film is shot first-person with a hand held camera usually operated by Heather & frankly this approach can become tedious & annoying at times. For those looking for sleek cinematography, cool camera angles & fancy special effects The Blair Witch Project is not for you, for those looking for something a little bit different & original then you could do a lot worse although it's hard to tell what any one person's reaction will be to a film such as this. There is no blood or gore or sex, just lots of bad language so don't expect anything like that. I must admit there is a certain eerie atmosphere & creepiness about The Blair Witch Project especially the scenes where the three students are attacked in the dead of night & are unable to see anything. The acting is pretty good throughout by a young & unknown (at the time) cast. The Blair Witch Project is certainly different although I'm not quite sure why it turned out to be such the huge commercial success that it was, I can still remember when it came out over here it was everywhere & everyone I knew wanted to see it but most were ultimately disappointed when they did. Definitely worth a watch especially for horror fans & considering it probably turns up on TV all the time it shouldn't be too hard to get the opportunity to see it & you should give it a go if you have a spare 85 odd minutes.","6"

So, the camera work was pretty much disturbing tho,that every time when something interesting suppose to happen, they just pulled the camera from the spot, and showed the ground or the edge of sthing. I know that in the story the kids were filming, and I did accept that all the camera job were shaky and my stomac went upside down even in front of my tv screen.

"DoctorJ-2","Sometimes tedious, but an ending which provides pure horror","2 August 1999","First off, I have to say that I am quite relieved that someone finally said that this movie draws inspiration from Cannibal Holocaust. I have been saying that ever since I learned the premise of the film. Some people also mentioned a little known recent movie called Final Broadcast or something like that...but it also draws from Deodatos Italian gore fest due to the same ""find dead persons film watch what happened to them"". That out of the way lets proceed to some analysis.

Regarding the camerawork, the camcorder is shaky at times...but its nothing that a t.v show like Cops doesn't have either..if anything the two creators should have shelled out an extra 100$ or so to give Heather some lessons in camerawork. The B&W 16mil camera is just fine.

As for the plot and pacing of the movie, the middle part of the movie does drag on sometimes, but there is at least one scene where they are in the tent that is very frightening. But the middle part of the movie can be summarized thus: get lost, argue, get more lost, stay in tent, get scared, get lost, argue some more etc. etc.

The acting is just fine and its one of the high points for me. Besides some of the secondary characters in the beginning of the movie (which are laughably bad actors and detract from the movie)the main characters themselves act very convincingly. I kept thinking if me and my friends did get in that situation that is exactly how we would act. Some criticism is aimed at how Heather keeps filming through all thats happened, critics claim it is too contrived. Well those critics have never seen any war footage or footage of riots were journalists keep filming while under fire or attack. This is the same situation: Heather and those journalists want to keep filming because thats what they do! They want to go down in history and get that amazing footage.

And as for the finale...it is pure visceral horror....",NA
"g-man-22","The Scariest Movie in over a Decade","25 May 1999","Some movies stick with you, difficult to shake for days, weeks, months afterwards. ""BW"" is one of those films. Directed by Eduardo Sanchez and Dan Myrick (a swell couple'a guys, from the mere moments I had to chat with them prior to screening the film) in a pseudo-documentary style that's unlike anything you've ever seen, this is the easily the scariest film I've ever seen in a movie theater. ""Aliens"" and ""Jaws"" remain my two fave fright films (as well as Craven's original ""Nightmare""), but having not screened any of those in their original theater releases, I felt something after seeing ""BW"" akin to what audiences must've felt upon exiting the theater back in the 70's following Friedkin's ""Exorcist."" The acting is top notch, save one argument scene by a river, and kudos in particular for Heather Donahue. This film is most effective if you grew up in the midwest/east coast and remember those ""tell me a scary story"" campfire tales. The film evokes an uncannily primal sense of fear through sparse visual trickery (none, really, which amounts to more style than any horror movie of the past decade, oddly enough). Despite some spots that might be considered draggy or slow to some, this was a pleasant surprise, given the overhyped nature of other indie genre fare (""PI,"" ""Cube"") and anyone with a degree of patience will be immediately sucked in the moment the 3 characters enter the dense Maryland woods to unlock the secrets of the fabled Blair Witch. Myrick and Sanchez are so good at scaring their audience with the most basic and rudimentary of aural/visual devices it's shocking nobody's thought of this sooner. When the final credits rolled after the numbing final scene, the hair on the back of my neck literally stood up and I felt a twinge at the base of my spine that still hasn't worked itself out.

"Asteri-Atypical","Freshman Film Making 101 (and still only a C+ in that class)","5 November 2001","This is one of the scariest movies I've seen.

Why?

It's scary that so many people thought this movie was everything from ""wonderful"" to ""brilliant"".

This is probably the most overrated movie I've ever beheld. It's somewhat decent for an amateur film festival film done by teenagers. However there is little ""brilliant"" or even ""original"" about it. Why it seemed so ground breaking was merely the fact an average student film was put on the big screen.

While I enjoy the concept of a horror story being told through the eyes of students, seeing the horror merely on the faces of the actors instead of special effects, shot with hand-cams and in ""raw documentary footage"" format, it was NOT executed well.

It is worth noting such a concept is NOT unique to student film festivals. It's only a departure from the ""typical"" Hollywood fare. It seems some promoter decided to take such a typical student film and promote it in the general cinema market, making it sound like it was something new and innovative. Sadly, the public bought it.

For a student film, this would have been more effective were it a lot shorter. It dragged. It would have been a cute short but the idea of making it a feature film is a poor one.

The characters were too sophomoric, pedestrian, foolish and inconsistent to be enjoyed. They acted foolish and dysfunctional (but not in an interesting way). One could not relate to what appeared to be them causing their own hysteria from childish bickering and overreaction. The dialogue was too pedestrian to be enjoyed. ""Dude, that's like... so not cool"" was typical of the level of dialogue. Who wants to watch undereducated ""Bill & Ted"" types come unglued? The whole film would have been much more enjoyable had the characters been more interesting. If you're going to build a film around the emotions of the characters, please don't make the characters Bill, Ted and Barbie.

There was not sufficient fodder for the imagination to evoke scary images. Make the fear either more mysterious or give us more imaginative scenarios. There was enough material to be interesting for perhaps 10 minutes. After that you need something more than a couple piles of rocks and some twigs.

The thing this film had going for it is that it illustrates the rut into which Hollywood has fallen in recent years. You don't need hundreds of millions to weave a basic tale. Stories can be told without the effects, sets, big names and music. Students have to resort to telling tales with what they have instead of falling back on the ""typical"" Hollywood style. The slightest departure from the norm is considered ""innovative"". Hollywood should learn something here. It also illustrates the point Hollywood doesn't have very intelligent stories, either, as Blair Witch, as shallow as it was, was able to compete.

In summary, if you're familiar with student or amateur film festival works, Blair Witch will give you nothing new. If you have never seen anything outside of Hollywood, it's good to see something different. Just don't make the mistake of thinking it's ""good"", however, just because it's ""not typical Hollywood"". All in all, it's a pretty typical example of ""Freshman Film Making 101"" (but I don't think we have the next Steven Spielberg in the class this semester)","1"
"Mickey-69","Three student filmmakers disappeared in the woods and no one cared.","21 August 1999","After all the excitment and hype I finally decided to go see the Blaire Witch Project. I found this to be a major disappointment. I applaud the film makers and Artistan for making so much money on a movie that anyone with their own video cam could have done better. This would have been a little better if Heather would have been the first to disappear since she is the most annoying of the bunch. I view this film as an education experience. How not to make a movie 101.

This was a mix of bad acting combined with constant swearing. The writers had a good idea but just couldn't convey it properly.",NA
"Chasuk","Vastly Over-rated","17 October 2000","I've loved horror films ever since I was a little boy. I adored anything which starred Bela Lugosi, Boris Karloff, Vincent Price, Peter Cushing, Christopher Lee, Basil Rathbone, Lon Chaney or Lon Chaney Jr., or any of the other horror greats from my childhood. I later loved Dark Shadows, Night Gallery, and Alfred Hitchcock. I've never enjoyed ""splatter"" films, although I consider the first Halloween to be a minor masterpiece.

However, I've seen only two films in my lifetime which actually scared me, and those were The 5,000 Fingers of Dr. T., and the Seven Faces of Dr. Lao. I don't know why they frightened my little-boy self, but they did.

Blair Witch was so unhorrifying that I thought at first that those who expressed fright were pulling my leg. I didn't need to be told that it was a fake; apart from the fact that the F.B.I. would have confiscated the film, and the murders would have been famous, the public outcry of a filmed murder would have been as enormous as if a snuff film had been released. That, and the fact that there are no witches, and never have been (the claims of wiccans and neo-pagans aside), totally devalues the film.

Remember that Dracula and Frankenstein were fictions that were presented as such, so the standards of judging them are different.

Okay, I'll confess that I found Jaws equally boring. No, I'm not jaded, but Blair Witch never once induced the willing suspension of disbelief necessary for a horror film (or any other) to work.

All in all, the biggest cinematic let-down I have ever experienced.",NA
"bubakar","Don't let the cynics fool you.","31 July 1999","After seeing this brilliant little piece of filmmaking I expected to see nothing but raves. Granted there are plenty, and I certainly realize that tastes vary. I just want to make it clear...I've seen well over 4000 movies in my fairly short life. This is not only the most terrifying film I've ever seen, it is one of the finest piecest of filmmaking I've ever seen. Is it a gimmick? Yeah. But gimmicks can be brilliantly used. You don't think ""Rosebud"" was gimmick? It was...and it was brilliantly used. Do I think that BWP was as good as Citizen Kane...I would never be so bold as to suggest that. But is it a great film? It is a great experience. Don't let all of the new ""irony"" and distance keep you from enjoying this movie. Give yourself over and you will be taken on a most terrifying ride.","9"
"Devndemn","""Blair Witch"" Revives Faith in Originality and Terror in Horror Films","31 July 1999","Sick of the recent wave tepid and trite horror to come from Hollywood, I am delighted to report that this film revives not only the genre itself...but filmmaking as a whole. This ""mockumentary"" follows three film students into the Maryland woods in search of the mythical Blair Witch. They disappear...and the footage found four months later details what terrifying occurences befell them. While knowing the film if ficticious, the viewer is still left with a feeling of uneasiness watching the slow and painful mental and physical breakdown of the central characters. The tears and sheer fright portrayed on screen by the actors, however, is real. With this in mind, certain scenes carry more impact and leave the viewer both frightened and quesy. The scene in which Heather apologizes to the families of her friends (and her own family) while crying is especially moving...she then closes with the line: ""I'm scared to close my eyes and I'm scared to open my eyes."" A few words summarizing her fear and anguish to emotional climax.

This film plays on the old ""things that go bump in the night"" scenario and puts it into a perspective where every sound heard becomes relentlessly horrifying. Every little thing that goes wrong becomes seemingly bigger and more engulfing. Here, the characters' panic becomes increasingly more profound and their fear paramount. By the end of the movie, they lapse into a state of total shock as things become more and more harrowing...and the final scenes show a blood-curdling glimpse of pure terror in the wake of an unbelievable nightmare.

""Blair Witch"" works on so many levels, and is by far the most orginal film to come along in many years. With no need for the Hollywood image of mainstream horror, it sets itself apart on the sole purpose of a horror film: the scare the audience. In this film, you will not find the typical, boring cliches of the slasher film...nor the trappings of FX-laden frighfares...no ""Buffy"", ""Party of Five"" bad actors/actresses...no ""hip"" teen music or look. What you will find is a well-made, well-conceived, and well-produced picture with exellnt casting and a feel that will linger with the viewer forever. This film challenges the viewer to use the imagination...and to think of the deep, dark horrors of our own minds in the darkness.",NA
"rookie-8","Stupid people don't like this movie","5 August 1999","This is not a popular thing to say, as everyone is entitled to their own opinion. I didn't like Titanic at all, but I am obviously in the minority in my feelings. If you don't like a film that is your perogative and it is what makes this country great. However, having read the reviews on this site I have come to the conclusion that most people who hated this movie really do sound stupid while trying to explain why the film is so bad.

Firstly, if you didn't like this film and you want to put your comments down, please do not start your summary off with "" The only thing scary about Blair is the price of admission"", or the even wittier "" Scary as hell!!!!!! That I paid 8 bucks to see it."" Almost everyone who did not like this movie started off with something of that nature, which was the first indication I had that people who hated this movie are, overall, stupid. If you do find it important to start off with comedy such as this, please also include you address and place of occupation so that I could find you and beat you. It is for your own good.

Secondly, if you have read anything about this film, ANYTHING AT ALL, you will know it is not a classic ""horror"" film. There are no ghouls or goblins to jump out after you. Jason isn't going to get you out by the Lake house and Freddy isn't going to come for you in dreams. This is a story that is scary because it is REAL!!!!! You can't see what is in the woods, you can't see what is stalking the students because THEY can't see what is stalking them. So many negative reviews have involved comments like ""I kept waiting to see the witch"" or ""how could it be scary when you never see anything."" One person even wrote, while commenting on how ""fake"" she believed the story was, that ""it made no sense for them to be screaming all the time."" If I was caught in the woods, or in my backyard for that matter, with something coming after me, I would scream all the time to. Just another ""stupid"" comment.

But what makes it very apparent to me that those who hated this movie are just not that bright is the fact that everyone who has loved this movie and written about it has talked about imagination. This film is about putting yourself right into the action, right with the characters, at all times. The bickering, the yelling and the screaming, are all things that, in a situation of that nature would actually happen. The day scenes, save for a few discoveries, showed the other side of terror and that was the mental breakdown of all these characters. They gave up hope, they gave up any idea of living through what was happening to them, and that comes across on screen. For those of us who were able to put ourselves in the shoes of Heather, Josh and Mike, that part of the movie was just as frightening as anything else. The night scenes are scary because you cannot see what is out there. The sounds and voices are freaky and make anyone who has ever been in a house alone at night and heard the pipes grumble a bit squirm in their seat. I DIDN'T want to see what was out there because then that would defeat the purpose of the whole movie. It would defeat the purpose of letting the audiences imaginations (those of us who have them) run wild for an hour and a half only to show them the witch, or whatever it was that was stalking the students, right at the end. Its greatness was in allowing for everyone to come away from the movie with a different interpretation of what happened.

Many will assume that this review, or comment more correctly, is the spawn of a stuck up elitest who takes pride in liking something that is not main stream. Nothing could be further from the truth, as most of the time I despise ARTS movies. I like big action, big explosions. Hell, one of my favorite nights during the week is when TNT does their ""Movies for Guys who Like movies"" thing, but this movie to me is a no brainer. (or maybe a brainer, as it seems those who have them love the film) The Exorcist, Alien, The Shining, and many other great horror movies fit into the Blair category. They scare you more with what is not seen than what is seen. They build tension, never letting up until the end, so the audience goes away just as scared as they were sitting in their seats. Movies like Scream or I Know What You Did Last Summer, the seemingly popular horror of today, put in their horror as almost an afterthought. There is no tension built, there is no breaking down of the characters, there is no squirming in seats, only gore and shock and jokes. That might be horror, but it is not GREAT horror, as Blair Witch is.

Those of you with imagination, go and be scared, be very scared. Those of you who fall into the category of ""nothing happened in this movie, it sucked so bad"", Freddy vs. Jason is in production and should be out next summer.","10"
"rookie-8","Intense, Intense, Intense!!!!!","31 July 1999","This movie is unsettling. The night scenes should have been longer and the sound could have been better, but that sense of impending doom is something that has carried over with me even the day after viewing the movie. The realism of the camera and the realism of the actors, who draw you into the woods with them and leave on you the dread so prevalent throughout the film, turns your stomach at times. A girl who viewed the movie right before I did vomited and had to leave. In fact, many people left the theatre before the end of the movie, right around the time Heather turned the camera on herself. This movie builds tension like none other I have ever seen. The beginning is funny and light hearted as the film makers interview locals, then it begins to turn around as the three go deeper and deeper into the woods without a real clue as to where they are going, then it just because disconcerting as the three realize the danger of the night. Anyone who has ever camped out will realize that this movie is the realization of all the horrors that cross your mind while pitching your tent. Walking out, I felt uneasy and the many pictures that will no doubt be talked about for years to come were running through my mind. (especially the last scene, which will go down in horror history as one of the classic scenes of all time)The two friends I went to go see it with left the theatre feeling disappointed, as they felt it just wasn't scary enough. The next day, both called me saying they couldn't sleep the night before, and all of a sudden the movie that had left them disappointed became, for them as it was for me, the first reason in a very long time to leave a light on at night. Don't get too into the hype so as to not allow yourself to appreciate the movie, but also don't listen to the negative reviews. I have found that 90% of those who hated the movie complained of not seeing the ""monster"", or that after viewing many a movie at film festivals (the red flag phrase for film students, or those who think they are film students) they weren't impressed at all. Those who like slasher movies will be bored and those who attend film school at NYU will be pissed they didn't think of it first.Those of us who still cringe when we see ""The Exorcist"", can barely watch the screen in ""Alien"", feel the chill on the back of our neck when the kid in ""The Shining"" recites RedRum over and over again, will love this movie. It will leave certain images in your head, certain ones that you will want to forget, and will leave you in your car, or in your house, realizing the truly freightening nature of this film. It is, in one word, intense.","10"
"Justin C","very chilling movie!!","1 August 1999","I saw ""The Blair Witch Project"" in Memphis yesterday, and let me tell you, you have to see this!! It is one of the creepiest movies ever made. The final 30 seconds of the movie is the best part, and it is one of the best endings I have ever seen in a movie, and definitely the best in a horror movie. The final scene is so creepy, it makes me scared just thinking about it. It's a totally original movie (well, almost). The atmosphere of the movie reminds me of ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre"", which, by the way, is my favorite horror movie. The movie has a lot of profanity in it, but it is worth watching again just to see the ending again. To fully understand the ending, you have to understand the stories at the beginning. I was actually scared last night before I went to bed, and it's been a long time since I was that scared after a movie.

I went into this movie thinking it was a true story, and I think this is the best way to approach the movie. I had a unique, unsettling experience unlike any I've had in watching a movie before. A warning: this movie will not work for you unless you use a lot of imagination during and after the movie.

After the movie, you are not likely to say, ""Wow, that was a really scary movie."" It is in the hours that follow after the movie when you think about the ending and the rest of the movie when the horror really sets in. This is no ""Scream"", ""Halloween"", or ""Friday the 13th."" It is a refreshing turn for the better for the horror genre after a recent raft of hip teen horror flicks like ""Scream"", ""I Know What you did"", and ""Carrie 2"".

It felt like an eternity) I felt like the film makers had lured me into the theater to kick me in the ass and steal my nine bucks.

And in ""The Blair Witch Project"", we sure as hell don't know what's out there. It's only the three filmmakers growing more and more scared. I will admit that I didn't find this movie to be as great as most people thought, but it does send a shiver down your spine, just because you don't know what's out there. I would never have wanted to go out into the woods alone to begin with, and now I really don't (although I don't believe these legends about spooks in the woods). Either way, this was an unprecedented movie when it came out - especially since it out-grossed flicks like ""Eyes Wide Shut"".","7"
"averjee","Terrifically creative, creepy","24 July 1999","Rarely has a movie left so much to the imagination of the viewer, and been content to show the audience so little on screen. The scariest minutes of the film are spent with nothing but darkened, blurry images on the screen, and the audience listening raptly to the noises on the audio: the scrambling of the protagonists, their frightened queries, or the ominous howling and cackling that haunts them.

the minimalist approach is devastatingly effective. The ending is a little weak, lacking the big payoff one expects after such a terrific build-up; nevertheless, this is indeed one of the most suspenseful, chilling and disturbing films you'll see in your lifetime.

"richferrara","Zzzzzzzzz...","26 July 2001","Okay. So we've got these three film-school kids -- Heather Donahue as Heather, Josh Leonard as Josh, and Mike Williams as ... um ... oh yeah, Mike. They go off into the woods to film a documentary about the Blair Witch (and if you haven't spent hours browsing the BWP website, you have absolutely no idea who the Blair Witch is or why anybody would be interested in her). Instead, they get lost. They wander around. They wander around some more. They scream, yell, and curse at each other. They act like idiots.

And, of course, they KEEP FILMING through all this, as I'm sure any three smart people would, because we all know that filming yourself getting lost is far more important than getting back to civilization.

Eventually some weird stuff happens. We don't know exactly what because nobody bothers to tell us. Is it scary? Well, I was kind of afraid that the herky-jerky camera motion would make me vomit in the theater, but other than that the film that TV promos called the ""scariest movie since The Exorcist"" didn't have one scary moment.

I've heard it said that the filmmakers wanted to scare us by purposely not showing us everything. Fine, but even if you don't show everything, you still have to show enough. Take the movie ""Seven"". You don't see the actual murders committed by John Doe, but by showing you the bodies and murder scenes, the director forces you to imagine their brutality. ""Blair Witch"" doesn't give you any clue what's going on. The only thing I was led to imagine during this movie was how else I could have spent 80 minutes.","1"

Please!

No movie is going to appeal to EVERYONE. Lesson number one, guys! Blair Witch is NOT meant to be conventional, or like your typical horror movie. There are no obvious and contrived jolts or scary moments to make you jump out of your seat. You want conventional, go see ""The Haunting"". The only thing that'll scare you about that movie is the money you wasted on it. Blair Witch is not about those silly little horror film conventions. It's not about a monster hunting three kids. It's all about psychological horror -- watching three people steadily go crazy and turn on each other for a time. It's about suspense and build up, not payoff. I thought the ending was brilliant. It left you asking questions.

The documentary style makes it much more personal and initimate than any horror film I've seen in a long time. I hadn't seen a good, disturbing horror since Silence of The Lambs and was openly complaining that they ""just don't make them anymore."" This film proves me wrong and will surely spawn more suspenseful, occult-based horror wannabes just as Scream spawns the Slasher comeback. If you liked The Shining, Poltergeist, and Jaws than I recommend Blair Witch.

When it started I first was pretty bored: Why the hell did I spent my money on that? But then the film started to work on my psyche. By the end I was glued to my seat, cold showers running down my back. THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT accomplishes all that without fancy special effects. In fact, you don't get to see anything scarier that an out-of-focus shot of blood stained teeth, and sometimes the screen simply goes blank for half a minute leaving only sound. The horror of the movie is created within your mind. And that's why it runs deeper than any violent splatter movie could ever do.

"kdnor2011","Very Realistic and Very Creepy","6 May 2010","Blair Witch certainly is one of the polorizing movies. There is almost no middle ground when it comes to this film, you either love it, or hate it. For me, I'm on the love side. It certainly isn't the scariest film I've ever seen, but I love it's creativity and atmosphere that I'm willing to overlook it's flaws.

This is not a jump scare type of horror film, it fact throughout most of the movie it doesn't really try to SCARE you really, it mostly tries to creep you out. So if you are not a patient person, and believe me, I'm not the most patient person in the world either, than you will hate this film. It can be very tedious at times, and kind of boring. Plus I think we needed at least one more day before the crew started going crazy, but maybe that's just me. And don't watch it with a headache, I did that and I wanted to vomit.

What it does do well it make a realistic atmosphere. There are people who still believe this was real, showing how realistic this movie is. The characters, aren't really characters, they're real people. No really, not only are all the actors using their real names, but the directors didn't really give them a full script, they told the actors that the legend was real and would actually make noises to freak them out to make this as realistic as possible. And because of that, I felt sympathy for these three even though they were all kind of a$$holes. Their not movie a$$holes, they're real people a$$holes, and yes there's a difference. And the film has a sense of humor to it, this is actually kind of personal as when something bad happens to me I will sometimes try to add a little humor to the situation to make it seem less bad.

The Blair Witch Project is not the scariest film ever made, it's more of a creepy film. What it does best is create a realistic atmosphere and characters that you can sympathise with, and leads to one of the best ending of all time, that leaves a bit up to the imagination. Plus, the backstory to this witch is very detailed and well thought out.

Of realising that once you step beyond the glow of the self-congratulatory campfire called human civilisation, you find yourself a shivering hominid a million years in the past confronting the Outer Dark, and all bets are off.

The impressively negative popular reaction to what, ironically, was an extremely popular film, says something about how comfortable, cynical, and amazingly unimaginative First-World humans really are nowadays. We live in the age where a gun isn't scary until it's pointed directly at you, if even then...so asking people to remember how to use their imaginations is probably a lost cause.

But that's unfortunate, because _The Blair Witch Project_ is in a class by itself in the Horror genre, and deserves to scare people paranoid. It's a work that translates the ""diary found in a cabin"" idea popular among writers like H.P. Lovecraft, to film. It demonstrates amply, despite all the jaded critique, how quickly the human mind breaks down outside of reassuring frames of reference. And it looks real.

This film cost me sleep, had me looking over my shoulder, distrusting curtains, groups of trees, and open dark doorways for days. It scared me silly, and it still does. Even writing this review scares me. It's one of those films, like John Carpenter's _The Thing_, or Kubrick's _The Shining_, that gets scarier the more often one perceives it, and the more thought one puts into the dilemma. If you're at all empathic, and if modern life hasn't dulled your sensitivity to the Unknown completely, you'll probably find this film disturbingly effective.","10"

The way that The Blair Witch Project scares you is nerve wracking and the way it creates suspense and horror is genius. You become terrified of what might be in this forest and an oppressive feeling fills your body as you watch these three young filmmakers wandering around in the pure terror of these woods. What you feel when watching this movie and how it gives you this feeling is very hard to express in words since it scares you in its very own way. Mostly it is the fear of the unknown which makes this movie so extremely scary for me.

I want to greatly recommend this movie to anybody who is even only in the slightest bit interested in horror, because The Blair Witch Project managed to give me a kind of fear that no other horror movie could give me yet. And if you watch it, you will never forget about the truly horrifying ending of this fantastic movie.","10"
"XxEthanHuntxX","The Blair Witch Project","28 May 2020","The film's main strength lies in its authenticity, in its impressive restraint and the actor's efforts, and how much intelligence and storytelling was hidden in a movie that looks so raw and authentic. Irritation slides over into fear and rising panic, slow-building tension and psychological melt-downs results in a painstakingly genuine filmmaking. But as an Horror picture, ""The Blair Witch Project"" rather suffer from a important problem, and that is that it is not very horrifying.","7"
"pgear83","Terrifying","24 July 2007","The horror genre is one that has long been prone to extremes without much real impact. From the excessive gory schlock of the 70's and 80's to the overused CGI effects of today and even to the new and disturbing ""torture porn"" sub-genre, it is a type of movie that has historically relied on quantity over quality.

The Blair Witch Project defies every bad cliché of the genre and as such is one of the few genuinely, viscerally frightening films. It relies less on its visuals than on the lack of visuals. The filmmakers understand and tap into the most primal of human fears - that of the unknown.

The film begins by setting up the fictional local folklore of the Blair Witch by 'interviewing' residents of the town. With their stories now in the minds of the characters (and the viewers) the films proceeds into the woods. The sense of isolation is tangible. The film is shot with hand-held cameras, either devoid of color or else in dreary, bleached out colors, adding to the atmosphere.

Isolated in the woods, seemingly simple things become terrifying. If you can suspend disbelief you will never be more frightened of a pile of rocks or stick figures hung in trees or strange sounds in the dark. The perspective is often in the first-person, allowing the audience to identify with the characters. Your senses become sharpened with fright as your eyes and ears strain to catch some fleeting glimpse of the ghoul that is haunting those woods.

The Blair Witch Project is perhaps the most profitable movie ever made and is a prime example of what can be done by skilled filmmakers who just keep it simple. 9/10","9"
"Sfpsycho415","Horrifyingly boring ---3/10","11 March 2004","I watched this movie because of the interesting premise and my love of mystery. But what i got was a boring, headache-inducing, unscary piece of crap. It takes an hour into the only 86 minute film for anything the least bit interesting to happen. The constantly shaking camera gave me a huge head-ache. There was nothing really scary about it. A couple of noises and the three idiots going around in circles is not scary. Speaking of the three idiots, the acting was weak and all they did was scream at each other and the darkness. They didn't die soon enough. the last few minutes were decent but not nearly enough to save this trash. The Blair Witch Project is a highly-overrated snore-o-rama that should have never come out of the woods.---3/10","3"
"mentalcritic","In case I didn't make it clear before...","30 May 2001","...this is a Nazi propaganda film masquerading as independent cinema. A blue-eyed, white skinned girl tells you as clandestinely as she can that all Wiccans are murderers guilty of infanticide, and people hail this piece of trash as an independent miracle. Adolf Hitler was more vague about calling for the murder of all those beside the Anglo-Saxon white Protestant male. Maybe you feel comfortable endorsing a film where the death of all non-Christians is called for, but when a film like this gets a ringing endorsement in a country like America, I feel chills of fear going through my body.

This is to say nothing of the fact that I could have made this film in my back yard for a dollar. Maybe people mistake the grinding, painful feeling associated with extreme boredom for suspense, but I am not fooled. Eighty minutes of waiting for some tangent of a plot that can be reported to a publisher does not equal suspense for me. It equals annoyance, boredom, and anger that such an absolute piece of trash can get such major recommendations. Here I am, struggling to make a career in writing, and the bozos who made this pile of garbage are on a gravy train from strapping a camera to the head of a dying seal. The only reason I haven't sued my previous editor for aggravated assault is because he warned me that this film was nothing but Nazi propaganda, and that he wanted me to report on this film so that a semblance of balance could be injected into the media.

Honestly, I am not bashing this film because of tall-poppy syndrome or any other such phenonemon. I am bashing it because I value my life, my liberty, and my ability to pursue happiness, and the fact that so many people have something vaguely positive to say about this film makes me fear for all three of those things. Since this film hit the shelves, other pieces of normalist propaganda like Wonderland have hit the shelves, too. Has anyone who praises this film as a masterwork actually gone to a real Wiccan and asked their opinion of this film? I thought we all had it bad when pieces of garbage like The Craft hit the shelves. If you really value the religious freedom granted us by the First Amendment of the US Constitution that little, then by all means, keep praising this film as a miracle of independent cinema.

All in all, I am giving this film a score of zero. It is not over my head, it is not something we misunderstand, it is a piece of Nazi propaganda masquerading as an independent production, pure and simple. Those of us who have understood the message in pro-liberterian cinema like the mini-series called V should all express disgust that this load of bollocks even got the green light, leave alone a sequel. Artisan should be hanging their heads in absolute shame. Bible-belt America has a lot to answer for.","1"

"divineangel","Great American Horror Film","8 June 2006","And my personal choice for scariest film of the past 20 years. I can see how some could be unafraid, but the subtltey and creativity of BWC cannot be denied. Marketing didn't make the film scary, the premise alone was enough. I was on that website for months before the film opened, and it scared me in my bright Austin office.

We saw it at midnight on opening day at the Dobie theater, and I could hear people wonder aloud why they hadn't heard of this case before...

Anyway, the film worked the audience over and later that night, unable to sleep, my girlfriend out of town, I had to relive the nightmare again...

Watching over six years later, the film still chills and I feel a tinge of sadness that the amazing performances of the leads weren't rewarded with the actors getting more work. Heather Donahue in particular nails a rarely-seen character: the female film geek.

There was something wonderful in the Austin Texas air during the summer of 1999...

"LeonardZelig","What scares us? This film knows.","6 August 1999","If I asked any horror film connoiseur what the single greatest moment of any horror film is, I would certainly hope the answer would, almost unanimously, be the infamous Shower Scene from ""Psycho,"" by Alfred Hitchcock. Why bring this up in a review of ""The Blair Witch Project, "" you ask? Because there is something that Hitchcock understood and is evident in everything he did, especially this particular scene. What this great genius of cinema understood (and many other filmmakers, such as Wes Craven, have forgotten) is that what is truly frightening on screen is not what is seen by the audience, but what is not seen.

I'd like to personally thank Daniel Myrick and Eduardo Sanchez for not only making a modern film masterpiece, but for helping movie-goers remember what it's truly like to be scared. Not just grossed out, mind you, but truly sincerely scared out of our minds. ""The Blair Witch Project"" has done just that, and has done so with startling originality and what I feel is true genius. While other films may garner more critical acclaim or Oscar nominations, I know of no other film that is as original or as creative as this masterpiece. Finally, somebody has remembered what Hitchcock learned, and has made this marvel out of it.

One truly sad thing about ""The Blair Witch Project"" is that it is much too simple and risky for Hollywood. This film could only have been made independently with first time directors and actors, people who are willing to try anything, and don't know any better.

It's the one and only movie that's ever scared the s*** out of me. There was a tv documentary about the Blair Witch that aired around the time the film came out to make the movie more believable. Brilliant film making. Perfect cast. So real. Sadly, the genre is saturated and the true horror of the first and best found footage film was a gift to gen x - like brain cells and saying s*** to someone's face instead of online and violent football and pretty much everything. That's a long enough review and I will end by saying I don't go anywhere near more than 3 trees in a group to this day bc of this movie.","8"
"Budd-5","A gem","29 October 1999","The directors of the Blair Witch Project possess a directing tool that most horror directors (and most cinema patrons these days) lack: patience. Most horror movies have a scare at the beginning that unsettle the audience. We see a glimpse of the murderer; we get an unsurprising shock; some famous actor gets killed off. We are then forced to sit through a number of requisite shocks before the unoriginal conclusion.

The Blair Witch Project opens with a smiling cast and a happy village. It delays its scares; instead it builds up the tension. What the directors are aiming to do is build up the tension to an extreme and then scare the pants off the audience by the finale. It works miraculously.

The three actors are enormously effective. Heather Donahue possibly the standout. They are not only acting but they are filming the entire footage and though their camerawork is shaky, the same cannot be said for the actors. We're told that they ad-libbed every line, well if that's the case they are not only wonderful actors, they are quite competent in the writing department. Heather's confession; Josh guilt-tripping Heather and Michael's slow but affecting character build up is tremendously effective.

But this is the director's show. They have said publicly that they were the Blair Witch. Though they never touched the cameras, they focused the storyline onto its gripping end.

I was surprised by the reaction leaving the cinema. Most people didn't like it. If you're expecting a shock a minute you will be disappointed but this is a gem of a film. I loved every second especially the kiss-off. I'm writing this review 4 hours later and my heart is still pounding.","9"
"MovieAddict2016","Interesting, but far from being very scary at all...","30 October 2003","Some of the best horror movies are those that imply rather than explode, hint at rather than expose. Fear is scarier than scariness itself--scary is just scary. Fear is fear. And fear induces all else that follows. Fear gets you on the edge of your seat; fear makes the hairs on your neck stand up. The scare comes afterwards.

The movie is false, but knowing that ruins the surprise of it all. Three amateur filmmakers--two guys and a girl (where's the pizza place?)--go into a Maryland wood, in hopes of uncovering the secret of the infamous Blair Witch, a legendary witch who is rumored to live in the woods. First they interview town folk and get their sworn testimonies. An old, apparently crazy woman insists that the Blair Witch appeared next to her in a lake once and was covered with beastly hair. (That sent chills up my spine.)

Then they embark into the woods, equipped with video cameras and recording everything. But soon they get lost--the map is pointless. They just keep going in circles. They walk around the woods for days, every night hearing strange sounds outside their tents and finding mysterious wooden ornaments hanging in a graveyard.

""The Blair Witch"" project is smart enough to know this, but that is about all I can credit the film for. It's that type of fear-inducing, thought-provoking horror movie not made since the likes of ""The Exorcist"" and ""The Omen,"" but when I was done watching it I realized that it hadn't really scared me at all. It had me thinking, yes, and it had me interested throughout, but it didn't scare me. After all the fear had settled there was no scare left. I viewed the film with all the lights in the room turned off, and yet it still didn't scare me. In fact, I found it to be rather ridiculous at times.

But it is an admirable horror film, one that uses ancient techniques as opposed to chainsaw-wielding villains with ski masks chasing groups of very, very stupid, mentally under-developed big-breasted teenage bimbos around a house for hours in the dark, jumping out at the camera whenever we've gone too long without a jolt. No, ""The Blair Witch Project"" is all about insinuations and the unknown. I'll admit that the film is pretty darn creepy, if ineffectively scary. At one point, a group of three teenagers are asleep inside a tent, lost outdoors in a Maryland woods, when loud screams start coming from somewhere out there.

They rush outside with the video cameras jolting about frantically. I was waiting any second for some ghostly pale figure to be seen far off in the woods.

Which is part of my disappointment in the film. To unexpectedly catch a glimpse of something--the witch, the ghost of the murderer, anyone and/or anything--would have been terrific. To expose something ever so briefly so that you think, What was that? and try to play back your videotape again to pause the image.

But the film doesn't ever really approach the Blair Witch. Furthermore, it never really explains anything by the end of the film. And I understand that this is the appeal of the film for most people. BUT...I'm not asking to show the Blair Witch chasing them around. All I would have liked to see was at least an ever-so-brief glimpse of some unintelligible being. That would have been far spookier, because eventually you get to the point while watching the film when you realize it isn't going to show you anything, and you start to lose interest.

This movie sent chills up my spine and made the hairs on my neck stand up at certain points. This is my kind of horror movie--I'm not into the slasher flicks, primarily because I do not find them very scary at all. I'd rather have the images of the attacker lurking in the dark left up to me, not jumping forward at the screen.

Am I contradicting myself? I say I do not want to see the Blair Witch, but yet moments later I say I do. No, what I want to see is some effervescent being illuminated in the dark ever so briefly; it would be the ultimate spine-tingler. Remember in ""Signs"" how M. Night Shyamalan showed the alien walking across the driveway at a birthday party? Remember how you weren't expecting it, how sudden it was? How quick? I would have liked something like that--just something very quick and very, very spooky. Not even as detailed as the alien--some far away being standing in the middle of the woods, who suddenly disappears with a shriek. (So that you never really see it at all, you just see the light and think, What was that?)

The craving of seeing the attacker is part of the fun. In this case, my craving was never fully satisfied.

Seriously they went all out to promote this movie and that's what i liked more then the movie its self. They made documentary's, police reports, missing posters and witness testimonials and a website with all the ""evidence"". Like audio logs, interviews and diary entry's from the characters you can literally watch it side by side to beef up the lore as you watch its great.

"Rforey","What a very original, very boring film.","19 May 2000","I fail to see how anyone can like this movie, let alone be scared by it.

The plot is uninteresting, the suspense is non-existent, the acting is neither good-nor-bad - in fact to me it was inconsequential. I simply couldn't have cared less about the characters.

I had hoped all the way through that something interesting would happen...it didn't. People say that while the film wasn't great, the last 5-minutes of the film were scary...they weren't. I am told that it was an original idea for a film...what good is an ""original"" film that bores you to tears?

My advice would be this: If you like suspense movies, don't see this film. If you like thrillers, don't see this film. If you like horror flicks, don't see this film. If you like films about a bunch of kids running around in the woods trying to be scared, throwing their maps away for no reason and making you wish they would just hurry up and die...don't see this film.",NA

This movie is completely different then any movie I have seen that was made in the past three decades. The way that the movie allowed me to understand the characters, and understand that they were not very unlike myself allowed myself to pulled deep into the story as it developed in front of me. I didn't realize how much I was into the movie until it started to build so much that I found my heart pounding even when nothing was currently happening.

Saying it was worth the wait is something of an understatement. The hype and myths surrounding this modern horror masterpiece are, for once, understandable and well-founded. I have often been downright terrified by watching horror films alone at home on video (Repulsion, Halloween, and The Haunting - the old one - are three that readily come to mind), but this was the first instance where I was absolutely terrified in an actual theatre. The pace of the film is masterful, letting us relax and laugh fairly often near the beginning, then slowly and inexorably tightening its grip until the absolutely terrifying final moments. A great big thumbs-up to its innovative and resourceful creators - here's wishing them a lot of luck on their next film!","9"

Rent it, turn out the lights, and let this film take you into one of the greatest ghost stories ever told on film!

*SPOILER* I refer to this as a ghost story, cause that's what it reminds me off. I can remember my father telling me a ghost story around a camp fire long ago, where the end of the story the teller grabs the arm of the person next to him, and yells ""GIVE ME BACK MY HANDS!"" the final sceen in this movie with the kid standing in the corner IS that part of the ghost story. And if you let the film absorb you so that you are in that room and see him there, its like a revisiting of the camp fire story and you just got grabbed by the teller, yelling ""GIVE ME BACK MY HANDS!""

"Vegas-6","Still Shaking...","1 August 1999","I've read some of the negative reviews for this film, and I can't believe they even exist. This is an incredible movie, perhaps the only movie to ever really /scare/ me. I'm a programmer by trade, and it is thus quite easy for me to dissociate myself from characters in a movie. I can look up there and see the characters of your average movie as fake. They appear to me as mere collections of pixels, slapped together on a piece of celluloid and displayed for my amusement. It was not this way with the Blair Witch Project. I saw this movie about 3 hours ago and I'm still scared senseless. I'm still shaking just a bit. I drank a couple shots of bourbon just to try to calm down. Nothing works. This movie is *that* scary. I don't know if it was faked or not, but if it was then I must say that it is a masterpiece. The characters are so afraid and their emotions are so real that even the most jaded among us can't help but empathize with them. And that, really, is the true power of this movie. It's not scary in the way that someone jumping from behind a door and saying 'BOO!' is scary. It's more the kind of scary you feel when you walk down a dark hallway and feel like someone is following you. Or the fear you feel while walking through an unfamiliar alley on a dark, cold night. It is primal fear, a fear which can't be shaken. A fear which is bred into you for your survival. That is the fear that this movie brings out in you. And that, good people, is one of the hardest fears to shake.","7"
"Bob_647","Pure, sheer terror that shackles the spirit from daring to look.","31 May 2020","What a concept. Instead of sitting there like the passive sponges most of us become when going to the movies we are actually expected be become involved. Take a leap of faith& belief and delve into this movie. With out the overpowering effects and music score most movies rely on to scare' you, if you still have an imagination left what is implied becomes a hundred times scarier than anything offered up by Hollywood in the last 30 years.

Filmed on video and 16mm black & white, this film is exactly what the horror genre needs in a time reminiscent of the early 1980s slasher onslaught. The Blair Witch Project has no knife wielding maniacs, no deoxyribonucleic acid altered monsters, and no real bloodshed onscreen. We see what the three film makers see as they make their way through the deep, dank woods in search of a legendary witch. A guaranteed cult classic, Blair Witch has Heather, Mike, and Josh heading off into the allegedly hexed woods of Maryland looking for the Blair Witch or whatever else may exist up in those hills. For most of the film, it is very unclear. The beginning excerpts ingeniously set up the three participants to believe they are experiencing the supernatural, being played like a fiddle by the suspicious townspeople, or just completely out of their minds.

If you are a seasoned veteran of the horror cinema, The Blair Witch Project may be less frightening than for someone who has not seen many scary movies. You will have to respect it's originality, and it's manipulation of our deepest fears. At times the film really makes you feel the sense of dread the film makers are experiencing.

Many have complained about the shaky camera, the cussing, how no scenes really happen, and that it's not scary. By and large, the camera is not that shaky, at least to the point where you can't understand why they are tromping through the woods and they are scared half to death. I must not get queasy very easily, as I had no problem with it. As for the cussing the lines were improvised, the actors are college age, and all three sound exactly like every American college student.

At a time when digital techniques can show us almost anything, ""The Blair Witch Project"" is a reminder that what really scares us is the stuff we can't see. The noise in the dark is almost always scarier than what makes the noise in the dark. Any kid can tell you that. Not that he believes it at the time.","9"

The only scary thing about this movie was the fact that it cost $9.50 to see it. Everyone who claims this is a masterpiece in horror needs to understand that their desperation to see a good horror movie has blinded their thought to think this was scary. We have been deprived of scary movies for too long and we are too eager to jump on the Blair Witch to get a quick fix.

Hey, don't get me wrong, this movie was brilliant, but not scary. I applaud Daniel Myrick and Eduardo Sanchez for creating an original and unique movie with such a limited budget and cast. They have proven that you don't need a billion dollars to make a good movie that makes a ton of money. If I were to compare the Haunting(newly released) and the Blair witch Project, I would have to say that the Blair Witch supersedes the Haunting in both its ability to scare and the entertainment factor. However, they are both two movies you don't want to waste your hard earned money on.

The Blair Witch was astounding in originality, the acting was great and believable, and the filming was superb except for the times when I got a headache trying to focus on a jumping screen. However, and this is a big however, they forgot to put in the scary parts. The story was great, but they forgot to put in the scary parts. I know they tried to add horror to this film but their attempts were feeble. This film could of been the classic everyone is talking about if they shot a little more film and realized they were shooting a horror film not a documentary",NA

I like the way the whole thing is handled. The scene sequences and how they're done work particularly well. The movie comes off in a very natural way. Its exactly what I would expect to happen if that sort of thing happened. Which makes its believable while you're into it. These folks set a standard here. Now no budget is no excuse for no quality.

"RobT-2","The filmmakers refuse to pay their dues...","3 November 1999","...so we, the viewers, have to pay them instead. That, I think, lies at the heart of the many chants of ""worst movie ever made"" from BWP's detractors. It's also one of the reasons the film will stay in the heads of its fans for days, and why those fans won't shut up about it.

The problem is that not everyone is used to art which doesn't readily explain itself, which makes the viewer work at interpreting it. Two practitioners of this type of art in other fields are the writer William S. Burroughs and the composer John Cage. Some famous movies which do the same kind of thing are ""L'Avventura"", ""Last Year at Marienbad"", ""8 1/2"", and ""Blow-Up"". Some people can't stand these films, others can't live without them. What they have in common with BWP is that they put the viewers' minds to work, filling in the deliberate gaps in the plot and unexplained areas. While a lot of people dote on films like this that ""make them think"", others don't appreciate being put to work when they've come to be entertained.

A better precedent for BWP is ""David Holzman's Diary"", which purports to be a young filmmaker's attempt to turn his life into a film (and which also aroused strong negative reactions from viewers who felt cheated by its not being ""real""). Some have asked why the students kept filming after losing all control over events. The answer is that, like David Holzman, they found the act of recording their experience on film was the only way to impose order and meaning upon the experience.

Alfred Hitchcock, I think, said something to the effect that drama was just real life ""with all the dull parts removed."" BWP does have some admittedly dull parts, and its detractors have seized upon these as proof of its badness. Others have cited the repetitive dialogue, and the arguments that run in as many circles as the students themselves. One could also argue, though, that these devices enhance the veracity of the film (at least on an emotional level--we all know it's not ""real"", right?). Along with the fact that almost all the shots are point-of-view, they give the impression of actually being inside the film while it's happening. This is another reason the film arouses so much enthusiasm.

While remarkable in its own way, too much has been made of BWP's Web-driven publicity campaign. If anything, the hype might have been too effective, in that it attracted (along with the curious film intellectuals) a number of people unsympathetic to this type of film. On the bright side, it seems to have swept in quite a few people who, without knowing it, have been waiting all their lives to see something like this. This is the kind of fan most likely to declare BWP their all-time favorite film, the best horror film since ""The Exorcist"", etc. One hopes they will get equal enjoyment out of Burroughs, Cage, and ""L'Avventura""!

For my part, I admit I don't see many regular horror films (though in retrospect I'm reminded that many landmarks of the genre, including ""Cat People"", ""Psycho"", ""Night of the Living Dead"", and ""The Texas Chain Saw Massacre"" were also made on low budgets, if not micro-budgets), but do enjoy art that makes the viewer work a little. I enjoyed BWP for all the reasons listed above, along with several images and sequences I expect to stay with me a long time. Like a dog trying to get the last bit of meat off a bone, my mind keeps worrying at these scenes, trying to impose meaning on it all.

This reminds me of how a conventionally-trained classical violinist tried out an avant-garde piece by Charles Ives and hated it, saying that if you swallowed something that disagreed with you, you could take something to get rid of it, but that he (the violinist) couldn't get these awful sounds out of his ears. I wonder if some of the negative reactions to BWP might come from people unwillingly carrying it in their heads for days, weeks, maybe even months.

BWP isn't my favorite film of all time, but I prefer it to all the other films I've seen so far this year. I can imagine seeing better films this year, but the filmmakers are going to have to work a little to please me. (Heh, heh.)","9"
"azaro666","If all that hype had never happened","28 January 2000","If all that hype had never happened and we had the privilege of watching this movie completely free of thought or conciusness. I envy my sister, she saw this movie not knowing anything of the hype. After she watched it she thought it was all real and was traumatised. I had not the pleasure but the brilliance of this film was still apparent. Sure this is a one-off movie which can never be bettered if imitated but this is without doubt the film of a generation. All those blood-scary movies we watched as kids where the thought of seeing Jason killing the women with a shovel are gone, the scare is in your mind not in your sight. It will never be bettered and doesn't deserve to be. Its like Hitchcock always said. Its not the bang that scares the audience, its the anticipation of it.

This film is the breathing metaphor of that statement.","8"
"Azric","""Scary as Hell""...I don't think so","19 September 2000","I don't think it gets much worse than this movie. The only scary thing about it is that someone could make a movie that is so bad. There are not words to describe how bad this movie is. I thought it looked like and interesting movie so I went to see it, and it is a very short movie (87 minutes I think) but while watching this movie it seems to go on for hours. This is the most boring movie I have ever seen. Heather felt she needed to tape everything they saw which got very annoying. I think I have only hated about 5 movies in my life but this is definitely one of them. I am not a person who saw it once and judged it, I saw it about 5 times and it gets worse every time. If you have seen this movie then I feel very sorry for you and if you haven't seen it I suggest forgetting it exists.","1"

Nosferatu the vampire is not very scary either, that's 1920s for you. Well, this is a historical mockumentary for you and think of it whatever you want. Doesn't make it worthless.","8"
"eibon04","Unmemorable Movie","10 March 2000","The makers of The Blair Witch Project have done a good job at pulling the wool over people's eyes making them think that this is actually good. Just because a film was made for little money does not make it a great movie(it's not how much you spend but how much you put into a film). This movie is inconclusive when judging the directors abilities as one horror movie hit does not make a great director. I believe that the two directors have to do more films before passing judgement on how good they how. I think it is silly to compare them with the likes of Wes Craven, John Carpenter, Tod Browning, and other great directors of horror films as The Blair Witch Project might be the only decent movie that they will ever make.

One problem I have with the movie is there is nothing to remember. There are no scenes or lines that stand out and make people remember it for. The movie was like a one and a half hour whale watch trip(the experience was similar to attending a whale watch as a person starts to feel sick). What I hate about this movie was that it seemed that the directors did not any artistic vision and this is the main problem of the film as I feel that nothing emotionlly was put into it(a bad thing is when two people direct as they have different styles while one director would use a style that the crew can get familar with). BWP is not a scary movie and anyone who says so is not a real horror movie fan who've seen real horror films but mostly Johnny come latelys. The success of this film worldwide proves that the human being are becoming more dumber and idiotic and that no one has any taste for great art anymore(we have mostly tase for art of mediocrity). The art of greatness is dead, but the art of mediocrity is alive.","1"
"Mercury-4","A seriously creepy movie","24 July 1999","Very few horror movies, in my opinion, are genuinely scary.

There are a lot of gross-outs, a lot of blood-baths, and a lot of attempts to push back the shock barrier (you know, ""I've never seen anything as gross as -that- before!""), but personally none of them really scare me particularly.

They just aren't believable, so all the buckets of blood and climactic gross-outs are just a waste of ketchup.

The people in them don't talk or behave the way real people talk, the premises are (mostly) unexplained and unbelievable.

Imagine you're in a car wreck on an untravelled road. One minute you're driving along, the next you're in shock lying on the side of the road, pinned under your car, horribly injured, dying.

Really, it's the scariest f___ing thing imaginable. Knowing there's nothing you can do, you're going to die.

The Blair Witch Project is scary like that; genuinely f___ing scary.","10"
"BigGuy","What's the Big Deal?","18 July 1999","There was so much hype about this movie, and I found it sadly lacking. As a matter of fact everyone in the theatre left saying ""that's it?"" The movie was well acted, and the actors appeared suitably freaked out by what was going on. But the ""camera work"" made it almost impossible to get into the movie. Instead of feeling scared with the characters I was laughing (with most everyone else) at them.

And don't look for a satisfying ending. Without giving it away, all I can say is that it is really the only ending that fits the style and story. But it is also very unfulfilling, and instead of salvaging a very long drawn out psycho-drama (it really wasn't scary) it left the movie on a flat note.","2"
"dynagirl","Hansel & Gretel revisited with terrifying realism","1 August 1999","The Blair Witch Project was, without a doubt, one of the most intense films produced in a very long time. It's documentary style not only gave it a real feel, but also allowed the audience to experience the entire story first hand. As the characters spiral into terror of unimaginable proportions, you take the journey right along with them.

Story and character development are superb and the acting is surprisingly realistic. You'll actually have to remind yourself that it isn't a true story. But the nicest thing about this creepy little film is how much is left to your own imagination. With the massive budgets of most commercial films, we're so used to ""seeing"" everything that nothing shocks the average movie goer anymore. In Blair Witch, it's what you DON'T see that really scares you.","10"
"salcedoalex","The blair witch project review","1 December 2017","The blair witch project in my opinion is more suspense than horror, maybe in the last of the film is horror but in general I think is more suspense. At the end of the film we can see that Mike is facing the wall because she or whatever can kill the person who is coming down the traps it is a trap. I think that is a very good movie because you feel into the film and the content is interesting but if this a horror film I think that maybe is a little bit over hyped because it has not made me very afraid.","7"

After watching a bunch of foul mouthed twenty something students walk around the woods with their camcorders, SUPPOSEDLY in search of a Witch, all we get is some running, screaming, and swearing. Where was the witch??? No witch. No witch? No witch. And the students are SUPPOSEDLY lost, walking in circles, unable to get out. Yeah... okay....how about following that damn river genius! Water flows out into a lake, perhaps? And then the ending. A boy is standing with his back turned, staring into the wall? The camera drops. Hahahhahahah.... So funny.

Why didn't they go back and watch the video of the map they recorded?

I first watched this movie in High School 1999. It was spooky but NOT scary. The ending was a abrupt and could have been left up to interpretation.

Now I've watched for the second time and I'm actually just as confused as I was 22 years ago. Several clips you can hear the low rumble of a plane in the background. Why didn't they follow the river down stream. Why not set the camera out in the woods and record while they slept.","6"
"kevdoggy","Genius at work here...","4 August 2001","This is a wonderfully-crafted film, and it shows how much (or little) money matters in filmmaking.

One way to tell how good a script is, is how UNSCRIPTED the dialogue sounds. I'm still not sure ""Blair Witch Project"" operated on much of a script; I do know that regardless, the story moved along masterfully.

I had heard that in early screenings, audiences who didn't know better really believed the film to be true, and were genuinely horrified.

The true genius of this film is THAT I KNEW IT WAS FAKE, AND WAS STILL TRULY FRIGHTENED BY IT. (I'm a grown man not usually affected by such things.)

After first seeing this film, I used it as a yardstick when judging people I had just met. I asked them if they had seen it, and asked them what they thought of it.

Those that saw it and enjoyed it on some level, I decided, had some imagination and were people I wanted to know. Those that disliked (or hated) it, were not the type I wanted to hang around with.

Maybe it's TV, maybe its technology, maybe it's the lack of reading and education in our country, but there's a real dearth of imaginative people in the U.S.

It's a shame.","9"
"mentalcritic","A celebration of Nazism that has been mislabelled a classic...","16 December 2000","Frankly, if I wanted to see a film in which outright lies were told about Wiccans, I would turn on my television and watch a Pat Robertson speech. Or dig up one of the propaganda movies comissioned by the German government during the mid-1930s. When I went and saw this tripe at the flicks (at the behest of a friend who publishes a magazine), I was simply appalled at the sort of Nazi-esque garbage that Republican America considers acceptable. Indeed, during one of the asinine speeches given by Heather, another member of the audience jumped up and screamed ""sieg heil"" in disgust. This comment got more applause and positive reaction than the film ever did. Indeed, by the time this appalling film was over, one patron near me was heard to remark ""you've got to be [expletive deleted] joking!"". This was the most positive comment I have heard about the film from a flesh-and-blood human to date. Indeed, when Heather is bawling her little eyes out for the camera in one of the film's last shots, another patron was heard to yell ""don't tell us your problems, Nazi bitch"". I think that just sums this entire film up.

Indeed, this film has inspired me. It has inspired me to commit to making a response of my own. One day I will make a film about a young woman in Europe during the Middle Ages who is kidnapped by Christian thugs and taken off to destinations unknown where she is repeatedly raped and tortured by ""men of the cloth"" before being burned alive, solely because she attracts the unwanted attention of a Nazi pig no different than those who made this film. Unlike this film, however, what I will be showing in my film project actually happened in Medieval Europe, Colonial America, and numerous other Christian blights on history - many times over. Indeed, the only reason why the makers of this film haven't been sued for slander is because the Christian menace still controls the political system of America.

It's a sad state of affairs when slanderous propaganda like this gets financial backing and then hailed as a classic by pond scum who don't know any better.","1"
"jcook56050","Documentary gives it a 3","11 August 2009","Honestly, at some age many of us are scared of going into the woods. But, for those of us who have been there at night with some preparation, it's really not that scary. The creatures come out to do what evolution and nature have given them the tools to do. In the winter, it's quiet, peaceful, and no senseless screaming. I kept watching and watching expecting someone in this acting group to calm down, look around them, assess their situation, and do something about saving what would have otherwise been a nice little outing. Alas, these bimbos kept whipping themselves into a self induced psychological frenzy; you know, the type that might get people killed. The real torture for me was trying to stay with the film until the end.

That said, I do recognize the elements of film making here that may have appealed to the, supposedly, young audience that fed the hype machine. ""The Blair Witch"" breaks several of the cardinal rules that ran Hollywood motion pictures since the early history of film. Yet, the fact that it hyped its way to a huge profit will be the only footnote listed in the history books. It just doesn't stand up to good storytelling.

Finally, one last observation. I gave this movie a 3 for one reason; I found the documentary about the Blair Witch Legend to be passable. However, for those of us from Tennessee, the parallels and similarity to our ""Bell Witch Legend"" is so obvious it's almost insulting. But, take heart. No one in Hollywood has yet made a passable film of our legend yet.

I read today that the producers have announced they may make a sequel to the film. Be careful when you go back into the woods guys. I hear that the Hollywood money machine still lurks in the dark.","3"

""Blair"" derives its best chills from those that everyone has experienced at some point in their lives -- and many will experience again. There is no fear like that of the unknown. Add in hopelessness, despair and an inability to instantly remove onesself from a situation, I really don't see what could be more frightening, nor could I imagine a film that portrays these feelings any better.","10"

I am glad that I didn't waste $8.00 by seeing it at the theatre. Not only was it incredibly boring (I nearly fell asleep) but I was also suffering from terrible motion sickness by the time it was over.

"MovieTex","Eerie and psychologically chilling","2 August 1999","If you're looking to see a trite, banal approach to the horror genre then you are aiming at the wrong film. This movie is chilling and disturbing, especially toward it's climax. The characters progress from ambitious, if not over-confident filmmakers into scared, hunted animals. This progression is one of the main points in the film since we get to view it in full detail. The scares are not of the ""jump-out-at-you"" variety but are more haunting since you must think about the film to really understand it's terrifying uniqueness. I would encourage anyone to go see this movie because it is so full of originality and it is certainly like no horror movie you have ever seen. I agree with most that say the final frame is one that is burned into your mind and stays there for a time after you have viewed the film. Truly a psychological scare in top form.",NA
"Quentin-12","Movies at there best!","2 August 1999","I walked out of this movie not knowing what to think, a few of my friends were quessy from the stedicam work and my mind played for a question of wiether or not I had enjoyed this film. It wasn't until this afternoon that I had an answer, I didn't like this film. I LOVED IT. There was so much to it - we saw it as a bad-camp video [you know what they are like] and we saw the characters as just that - real people as opposed to actors following a carefully monitered script. We saw real emotions and all of the people involved in the production need to be commended greatly. Not only is this the best horror/suspence film of our time it measures up as one of THEE best films in general. All of the horror that this movie had to offer was the build-up and your after-thoughts. The conclusion is perfect - see this movie as soon as you can. It is amazing. We should be seeing the name Blair Witch at the Oscars this year.",NA

If parents are reading this I recommend this movie to ages 13 and up. There is no gore or blood. Just language, and anyone under 13 that sees it would sleep in their parents bed for 3 weeks.

"jester-30","AN exceptional example of BRAVE filmmaking. Horror for the senses & Imagination, not cheap thrills.","1 August 1999","Without compare, this low-budget thriller is in a close run with THE EXORCIST in my ""scariest movies of all time,"" and the only reason it doesn't beat out THE EXORCIST is because imo it's not as ""real"" and disturbing spiritually.  It is, however, a terrifying experience which I think is sure to set a new precedent for Hollywood scare-fests (or atleast I hope so).

Simply, most of what happens with TBWP doesn't happen on the screen at all. I hate to burst your bubble, but if you go to this flick expecting to see some mean and evil looking ""witch,"" forget it.  The movie has barely anything to do with witches in the typical Hollywood sense of the word (nevermind the real sense of the word).  Neither will you find teenagers being axed to death during or after having sex, scantily clad cheerleaders fending off chainsaw welding maniacs wearing pig heads, psychotic transvestites with machetes bent on hacking apart those who jilted them, buckets of blood, HP Lovecraftian creatures lurking in shadows and beneath damp graveyards or any of the other stuff your USED to seeing on the silver screen these days being billed as ""horror.""  What you will discover is yourself immersed in the experience of the movie, like a cinematic funhouse where most of the horror is supplies by your imagination spurred by slight visual and mostly aural screen cues. 

For the most part, not much happens on the screen... but the suggestion that there's something exceptionally horrific and inherently diabolical will ignite your imagination to fill in the blanks with a host of horrors individually suited for each theatergoer.  Now those are some noteworthy special effects!

I won't give away any of the plot.  I won't tell you what finally happens at the end (?) of the film, suffice to say that I sat there with my jaw open staring at the screen in near shock.  And something else happened in the nearly 3/4 full theater which hasn't happened in a long time (and I'm a pretty regular theatergoer)... the audience was DEAD SILENT.  I could hear the breaths of those around me, sharp intakes, gasps, heart-pounding heavy inhales... this movie gripped the audience and held it quiet and interested.  There were some minor scenes where the tension was allowed to vent a bit, but for the most part it was a slow boil toward a crescendo which was unlike most any other movie I could mention to compare.

This film is innovative by design.  Everything from the actors to the presentation to the marketing was a refreshing wind to this summer's movie calender.  It's ironic that perhaps the lowest budget film I've seen thus far this summer is perhaps the best.  It is perhaps best successful because it really does draw the viewer into the picture like the best campfire ghost story.

"McFrogg","Scary, but meaningless.","18 April 2018","I'm not going to deny that The Blair Witch Project is one of the scariest horror movies out there. After all these years, I still have trouble walking through the woods at night because of this movie. Even during daytime, thinking about this movie in the middle of the woods makes my heart beat faster. But does that make the movie any good?

One of the positive things I can say about The Blair Witch Project is that it doesn't rely on jump scares, meaningless gore or silly characters like Freddy Krueger or Jason. It shows that it's possible to scare people without cheap tricks. There's also no unnecessary nudity, or any graphic sex scenes in it (the language is bad, though).

The worst thing about the movie is that it's meaningless. We're just watching a bunch of people get lost in the woods, where they are finally killed off by something supernatural. We're not left with any hope when the incredibly scary credits roll.

I guess the movie could serve as a terrifying warning against playing with the occult or paganism, but I can't really recommend it. There are better horror movies you could watch, like ""Whistle and I'll Come to You"" from 1968. Or even better; read the original story by M.R. James.","2"
"genius-15","Wasn't scary, Wasn't original, Surely wasn't worth my time","12 August 1999","Just so you all know, I only saw this foreseeably trashy flick because my old friends from Carmel forced me to. Its just another sad product from the amateur video camera trashcan, on the same level as Cops, The Real World, America's (un)Funniest Home Videos, and When Animals Attack. To call this film a ""mockumentary"" is being generous, since it doesnt even resemble a fake documentary. I thought Faces of Death looked more realistic. I don't really blame the filmmakers (forgive the misnomer), after all, they were just trying to find the same instant success that John Carpenter did back in 1978 when he made Halloween on a similar shoestring budget. And they may very well have, but it doesn't excuse the utter senselessness that viewers are forced to endure for 87 minutes.

Like most video programs which feature footchases, this movie has numerous dizzying scenes, with the camera spinning so fast that cinemagoers easily become nauseous. Even I, a veteran of numerous rollercoasters and spinning amusement park rides wanted to honk after the first 15 minutes. Thats about as exciting as it gets, the rest is a silly bore. I was laughing during many of the so called ""scary scenes,"" the screaming, crying, shaking characters, it was all a comical farce.

The shaky camera didn't bother me much, I got used to it. And I really did feel like I was in the woods with them, being frustrated and scared and the whole nine yards.

Christopher Walken) or maybe ""Halloween Six""(just because of Donald Pleasence). But some say there has not been a good horror film in theaters since ""Day of the Dead"". As far as ""The Blair Witch Project"" goes, it is a very well made indie film, that is truly scary. It's diffently not one of the thousand hip teen slasher flicks being released this(or last) year. It markes a return of the true horror film. Not the Hollywood horror formula films we have seen this decade. And yes no Jen Love Hewitt(sp), no rap music, and no Rob Zombie. Wow how different!

But if you're not careful and open-minded, you might not pick up on just how great this effort is.

The film has none of the Hollywood action cues, setups, or prompts that we're condidioned to respond to. The lazy viewer, thus unprompted, will miss out on the import of the action. There is no music to cue dramatic scenes. No sound effects to enforce the action. No sight or sound of the witch.

If you already know too much about this movie then you will not enjoy it. (*Those of you who already DO know too much, are already aware of it -- if not, then you MAY still enjoy it.)

DO NOT VISIT the Blair Witch Web page... I implore you. If you want to enjoy this film, then DO NOT RESEARCH any more on it.

There are NO spoilers in my review here.

However, for myself, I may as well have read the trans-script before seeing it, for all the research I did on it. I normally do not pursue movies like this, and now I know why. In fact, avoid EVERYTHING about this movie if you want to enjoy it... I cannot stress that enough... Up to and including the documentary on the Sci-fi Channel (or on ""Space"" in Canada).

I am not about to spoil this movie... but I want to say that a fresh mind and a clear perspective is required to get the full feeling. You can read my review safely, I won't reveal anything about it for you.

The ENTIRE picture is made from stock 8mm video tape, and 16mm black and white film... this material was actually filmed by the three people we see in the film. It was later edited and compiled, and transferred to 35mm film and transformed into the feature I am reviewing called ""The Blair Witch Project"".

Everything about this movie, that we see, is real. That much I can assure you. The footage we see is real, the noises we hear, and the emotions that Heather, Mike, and Josh display are real. I sense, however, that we are missing some footage that could have been added. The missing footage may not exist, but if additional conversations do exist on this stock material, or more personal emotions, or whatever, to bring the realism to the big screen, it should be added.

I couldn't feel for these people as much as I wanted... Maybe because this personal footage (if it exists) is not included. Or perhaps because I read too much on the movie and was expecting to see more... who knows.

I can see, if I went in with a fresh perspective, alert, and freshly virgin to the whole Blair Witch story, and completely unaware of what was to come... I would have enjoyed it more fully.

This film has a potential of becoming a classic cult piece... but only for those with a limited pre-knowledge of it. Otherwise, your perspective is twisted and possibly shattered.

Go see it, only if you know little about it. It will spook you... it will give you the creeps, and you will never go camping in unknown woods again.

"elcopy","The overrated witch project","19 July 1999","Seriously folks: Other than the clever idea of making this film look like a documentary, Blair Witch's story is as amateurish as the camera work. We spend a lot of time seeing the story building for the final moment when the filmmakers dissapear. When that moment finally arrives, it's just too vague to come to any conclusions or interpretations.

If you're the kind of person who doesn't scare very easily of the dark and weird noises, you'll find Blair Witch interesting, but not quite the stuff that makes you lose your sleep. The only thing I found scary about the movie was its publicity. Avoid the hype (if you can), if you want a better experience.","3"

Having seen it, I found myself glad to have gone, but not quite satisfied. It was a most clever idea and brilliantly executed. However (there's always one of those, huh?) didn't live up to the hype. Perhaps this is the fault of the producers .. wanting to ensure an audience, but then unable to deliver the promised product.","7"
"rolherr","Where is the plot?","2 July 2000","I went to see this movie because I have heard that I was ""the best horror movie ever made""; that, without a big budget with special effects, it really made you panic. WHAT A DISAPPOINTMENT! I kept looking at my watch all the time. This movie doesn´t have any plot at all, the actors spend half of the time crying and the rest of it blaming each other for their terrible luck and yelling each other. The worst thing is that they are ""playing"" with a home-video camera, and they don´t really know how to use it (they keep pointing at the ground, then at the sky, then at the ground again...without even focusing), so after 15 minutes you feel kind of dizzy.

I don´t know how this movie made so much money: probably, because they made a great web page, and everybody said ""Let´s go see it, they haven´t spent much money...""

If you don´t want to bore yourself, check for another movie.","1"
"Seamus-25","Truly the scariest film I have ever seen","4 November 1999","This, is the scariest film I have ever seen. The basic story deals with 3 students investigating an old legend. When something strange begins to happend we witness a slow disintegration of the characters as they try to deal with what is happening to them. I felt I would behave in exactly the same way as the characters in the film and this allowed me to be drawn into the story. This film does not have any soundtrack or traditional camera trickery used in typical movies. If you go in expecting The Exorcist you will be disappointed, but if you are prepared to forget that the story is not true and allow yourself to be drawn in then you begin to experience the terror I felt while watching this film.

I don't think it will stand up to too many repeated viewings as the film relies on suspense, more so than most films, and an element of that is always lost when you know what is going to happen.","10"

"Jinn","The Blair B!tch Project","1 February 2001","I had to psych myself up to see the movie, not an avid horror fan at all, they usually scare the smeg out of me! I saw it in the daytime on DVD :)

The movie was interestingly done, it's as though you're actually watching an amateur student film. (A tad scratchy and repetitive in parts though)

But honestly, again trust Hollywood to give Witches a bad name again ... When are they going to get it through their thick brick skulls that Witches and Pagans are Nature people that have always lived in Peace with Mother Earth? A movie about REAL witches is in order.

Also, I felt it was the students' own fear that kept them trapped in the forest. The 'Blair Witch' or whatever evil spirit (real or imagined)that was there was obviously feeding from their fears and that is why they were trapped and none of them had the good sense to figure it out.

A tad spooky in parts, but I was honestly more scared by ""Donald Duck's Halloween Special."" ...","1"
"folkie-imdb","lost in the woods at night","10 August 1999","Blair Witch is a great show that succeeds despite its problems.

Problems: The hand-held camera jostles irritatingly in the opening, but that allows you to better ignore the subdued bouncing that is often present later in the film. Probably the dumbest thing in the film is that the film-makers always keep shooting film or video. Personally, I would have been more impressed if most of the shots were less carefully framed, shot from the hip as it were, suggesting that the camera was being used more as a light source than as a recorder of events. While I was able to suspend disbelief *while I watched*, the thought of all that running around (without tripping) while a camera is plastered to one's eye boggles the mind. I was also p***ed that the trio mentioned following a stream but decided instead to completely rely on their obviously non-functional compass.

Succeeds: All that aside, I loved this show (nine out of ten). Woods don't scare me. Lost in the woods doesn't scare me. The woods at night doesn't scare me. But oooooo I'd be scared if it went on for days and nights and days and nights and something/someone maybe? was stalking me. I've been too tired to think straight. I can empathise. Ever see ""Things to do in Denver when you're Dead"" Remember the guy who decides to stay awake several days, waiting for the assassin? That's the last half hour of Blair Witch. I was expecting the trio to turn on each other at any moment. And Heather? Loved her acting. First time I can remember an actress allowing her voice to break while screaming -- it's bad for your voice, hurts, and pretty well nobody does it. But it sounds so much more authentic. That's the neat thing about this film -- it feels authentic. I believed in these people. I was glad when the film ended. I was tired of being scared.","9"
"twltzone","Disney's ""Escape From Witch Mountain"" was better.","30 July 1999","Trust me!!! This movie is not what you think it is. Interesting idea, but not scary or even suspenseful. However, I think they have created an entertaining film, but its just not scary.

The type of people who will think ""Blair Witch Project"" is scary are people who are afraid to watch programs that start off with: ""WARNING This program contains graphic images of a violent nature. It may not me suitable for all audiences.""

I'm a big fan of the ""less is more"" school of thought, but this just didn't do it for me. I'll stick to Hitchcock and Rod Serling for that inspiration.

Horror? NO WAY!!! Psychological Thriller? I think not! But entertaining: Yes. If you want to see an entertaining film then watch ""The Blair Witch Project."" However, if you want to see a scary movie then go rent Disney's ""Escape From Witch Mountain"" because its a lot scarier!!!","6"
"LogLady25","The Brilliant ""found footage"" Film","11 September 2015","The found footage stereotype doesn't apply here. A lot of people don't like this movie because the witch isn't shown. That's exactly why it's brilliant. If they had used special effects and shown the witch, this movie would be outdated and silly. Without the witch, there is just the idea of the witch. We know that they've gone in circles and we see them go crazy. The only confirmation of the witch that was needed was the ending. It's the story that they tell about the boys in the cabin. It's more of a psychological movie than it is a gory horror movie. The whole thing is about the idea of paranormal activity. It's the most terrifying movie I've ever seen.","9"

If you are anticipating a scary movie, you will be vastly disappointed. Except for the last 5 seconds, the movie was totally without anything scary. The movie spent a boring hour and a half building up for this final moment. Through this, some audience members were rewarded with motion sickness due to the actors inability to hold a camera without having violent shaking fits. These audience members did not only go home disappointed, but they had a whopping headache as well. Those of us who were lucky enough not to be affected by the shaking actors, got to enjoy watching 3 idiots wander around the woods because nary a one could read a compass or a map. The only remotely entertaining part of the movie was watching the actors argue over who is to blame for their situation.","1"
"lwjoslin","Fear itself","24 July 2002","""The Blair Witch Project"" is a horror movie about fear itself. Since fear is subjective, the movie is like a Rorschach ink-blot test: you'll either see something there or you won't. My brother and I disagreed as to whether it was boring or terrifying. We were both right: it bored him, and it terrified me.

In the late '50's, Robert Bloch, in an essay titled ""The Clown at Midnite"" [sic], generally lamenting the state of horror movies at the time, posed the rhetorical question, ""What is a horror movie?"" It is, he said, a movie whose content horrifies. Obvious, perhaps; but nonetheless, he said, studios had forgotten how to make them, opting instead for monster movies, sci-fi movies, big-bug movies, and mad-doctor movies, full of shock and ""gore"" moments (moments only, in those days), freighted with ""comic relief,"" saddled with the obligatory romantic subplot, and replete with ""latex false faces that wouldn't frighten a two-year-old."" He concluded that there simply was no such thing any more as a movie made just to scare the hell out of you.

Since then, there have been a few. ""The Haunting"" (the 1963 original, not the execrable 1999 remake) was one; so was the (original) ""Night of the Living Dead"" and the (original) ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre."" Three very different flicks, but all very frightening, and -- considering the red-meat subject matter of the last two -- quite restrained. NOTLD and TCM were also low-budget indies, which added to their gritty credibility.

Into the pantheon of low-budget/no-budget horror now goes ""The Blair Witch Project,"" a product of the thriving film industry of Maryland (which gave us the oeuvre of John Waters). Minimalism at its minimal-est, BWP (these low-budget creepers always have ""mouthful"" titles best reduced to initials) is presented as a pseudo-documentary. The premise is that, in October 1994, three student filmmakers set out into the Maryland woods to shoot a documentary about a local legend, the malefic Blair Witch, a Colonial-era miscreant said to haunt the woods still. (One is reminded of the Jersey Devil, the subject of a similar, slightly earlier, and even LOWER-budgeted movie, ""The Last Broadcast."") The three kids were never seen again, but a year later, their footage was found. And that is what we watch.

Heather, Josh and Mike (the names of the actors as well as the characters) set out on this weekend camping trip as a lark. But the fun dries up when they promptly get lost, and as the days drag on, are cold, hungry, tired, panic-stricken, getting on each other's nerves -- and stalked by an unseen presence. As in, say, ""Rear Window,"" we the viewers are trapped along with the protagonists; as in, say, NOTLD, they start turning on each other. And they learn too late that you can be young, hip, smart, and middle-class, living in a world of computers and fast food, and still -- when you're lost in a patch of woods you wouldn't have thought big enough to get lost in, in a part of the country long settled and urbanized, and just a few miles from DC -- find yourself prey to primal fears, mostly of the dark. This is, as I said, an essay about fear itself. No masked madman with a chainsaw is after these kids, no plague of flesh-eating zombies, no ghost -- maybe not even a witch. But SOMETHING is out there; the kids aren't just scaring themselves, as it becomes agonizingly clear.

Shot in color video and B&W 16mm film (the two cameras the kids lug with them), BWP is a technical oxymoron: credibly spontaneous (much of it was, in fact, ad-libbed), yet beautifully and effectively edited. The one false note comes early on: one of the locals, an eccentric woman whom claims to have seen the witch, totes a huge Bible and wears a rosary (incorrectly) as a necklace. She might as well wear a sign that says ""Religious Nutcase."" Pity she was rendered so stereotypically: in movies of this sort, with ill-advised questers heading into dangerous ground, there's usually a disreputable-looking eccentric warning them not to go. So while this character belonged here and her eccentricity is a given, it's too bad that, in a flick of otherwise great verisimilitude, her phony props distract from her acceptable performance.

The image that will long linger in mind comes near the film's end: Heather, taping herself in such closeup that we see her only from the nose up, whispers a panicky, tearful farewell and apology to her parents and those of her crewmates. ""I'm scared to close my eyes... I'm scared to open them... We're gonna die out here..."" Brrr! Fear itself.","9"

"Razor-18","Fun and determined to scare you, or else...","1 August 1999","I enjoyed the film as a whole and definitely felt the pull of despair that slowly swelled up out of the actors as time went on. This film had the uncanny knack of being able to keep you emotionally paced with the events at hand. Nothing particularly jumped out and scared me during it, but I was definitely feeling the uneasiness of the characters situation and that uneasiness rose with the characters as the film progressed. I don't think that this film corrects what has been going wrong with horror films over the last 20 years (i.e.: too many FX, not letting the audience imagine anything) but it is a good step in the right direction. The actors are uncanny in how believable they are and how they react to what is a formidable situation. Lost, inexperienced, hungry, in the throes of a nicotine fit and unaware of how each person in the group reacts to stress and the unknown or unseen. This film could be used to illuminate how humans deal with the unknown and fear. The fear, like I said, doesn't jump out and bite you....it simply puts you in its mouth and slowly swirls you around. Next thing you know you are nearly a participant, and you really don't want to be. Good film...hope this isn't a flash in the pan for these guys. Wake up Hollywood. We want you to use this as a horror platform from which to launch new horror from. BTW, don't sit too close to the screen...especially if you get motion sickness easy.","7"

They soon find themselves in odd situations and unable to escape the woods. That is all that I can say without giving away the entire plot.

"Sabrz","The Ultimate Suspense Thriller","31 May 2009","The Blair Witch Project is possibly the best horror movie in terms of suspense. It keeps your eyes glued to the screen as the suspense rarely lets up. It is truly a spectacular horror movie as it will definitely frighten you and at the same time keep you interested.

The Blair Witch Project is about 3 teens who go off into the woods searching for a legendary creature called the Blair Witch which is supposed to haunt the nearby woods. The students never come back. However a year after their disappearance, their footage is found. The movie is the entire footage that the 3 students shot.

There are many elements that make the film so great. The most obvious one is that the students become lost in the woods. Being lost in the woods is bad enough. But when you have unexplained elements plaguing you while you are lost that takes it to a whole new level.

Another element that increases the fear is the many things we do not know. We all have a fear of the unknown and this movie plays into that strongly. So many eerie things happen to the students that they are unable to explain. The fact that we never see the antagonist or the witch adds to the creepy sensation and builds up the fear.

The best element of the movie is the perspective the viewer sees it from. Since the entire movie is from the view of the camera the students carry, the viewer sees and experiences everything from the point of view of the characters. So in a sense we get to go through what the characters do.

Overall the movie keeps up the suspense as viewers never know what to expect. By day we follow the teens as they walk through the woods in an attempt to find civilization. Along the way they find more supernatural elements that challenge their sanity. At night unearthly sounds are heard beyond the light of their campfire.

The Blair Witch Project is not the typical horror movie in that it is all about suspense rather then being pursued by someone. There is no doubt someone or something is stalking the students. But unlike most horror movies this movie is more about agonizing suspense and the unexplained rather then stopping an antagonist or killer. It is that that makes it such a suspenseful and fantastic horror movie. The Blair Witch Project is one of the best horror movies and I enthusiastically recommend it to anyone regardless of whether you like horror movies or not. No matter your preference the movie will not disappoint you.","10"

The best way to watch this movie is to not know ANYTHING about it. If you see an interview on TV- don't watch it. Or an article in a newspaper- don't read it.

And the worst thing you can do is compare it with other horror films. Unless you are a movie buff wizard, you have never seen anything like this before.

Just go see this movie with no expectations other than you're going to be entertained.

"dalbuc","As good as Night of the Living Dead","18 July 1999","Some folks who I saw this film with left disappointed. It is not your typical horror film. There are no cheap scares or really jump out of your seats moments. Gore is almost totally nonexistent. Instead the movie is almost two stories. First, the story during the day about three college students who are lost in the woods and the dynamics as they slowly disintegrate as a group and as individuals. Second, the story at night where something is sitting just beyond the range of their cameras and lights hunting them. Blair Witch, like Night of the Living Dead, focuses more on the group dynamics than on the horror that lurks outside. It isn't clear which is more frightening- the unseen witch or the slow descent to madness of the individuals. The first person point of view created by viewing the ""documentary"" footage really puts you into the setting and leaves you straining to see what lies in the dark just like the characters do in the film. It is a startling vision and one very much worth watching if you are looking for horror along the lines of Night of the Living Dead, Psycho, or The Thing- horror that is more psychological than visual.","9"

The film looked like it was shot by an epileptic having a fit on a trampoling. Lesson to all aspiring filmakers - don't try to pass off incompetence as being all moody and atmospheric. In the words of The Who, I ""won't get fooled again""! A complete waste of time.",NA
"andionita","An Educational experience","15 September 2008","I got to see this film after my brother's room mate and his girlfriend remembered the occasion of seeing it at a Home cinema in a cabin. I had heard very much about the title. Even at a Media class at my university the professor mentioned 'Blair Witch project' for the hand-held camera view. Also one of my friends came into making some short movies about campus and stuff, and he was really into it, so one day he said: ''Rei, let's make a movie, I mean a real feel movie, OK - not quite as Blair Witch project- but still...

After all this I just couldn't stand missing out on a influential piece of culture. The film itself is just one hour and a quarter long, but I guarantee you would want it to end way before and have impulses to check your watch.

The footage found from three (probably cinema) students that wanted to make a documentary over the legend of the Blair Witch, and for the purpose they went into the woods of Maryland to find evidence.

I really liked this movie! As a horror film it is a favorite. All classic horror movies are just ""directed"", they build the tension through some events the director chooses and the actors behave as if wanting to get your chills going. Well, in Blair Witch all that happens is perfectly - and I mean it - normal.

Just remembering the decline the group suffers, that you might think the guys will resort to inhuman acts to survive (probably in a Hollywood movie this would have been sought - but here the mere idea of it is oh so creepy).

It is as if I were in the group. The movie tempts me: 'Rei, what would have you done in this situation?' That's why it's so great and I preferred it so much.

After seeing it for the evening of course I couldn't get to sleep. I actually myself got going in the genre, so I put some fragments of classics, The Exorcist and The Shinning. Apart from just scenes in which the scare is inevitable, these look like toy inventions: they want to find a better way of scaring you. They just pale in comparison...

I don't mean to ignorant, but 'Blair Witch' is something that gets a special place in one's memory. It's a story. It's not a directed story, the interesting facts in and cinematic achievement to be remarked. It's a story that gets you gripped and it has full effect. After watching it think about the 'educational experience part'! If somebody asked me about my scariest movie or horror films, I'll just suggest them to see 'The Blair Witch Project'. A mandatory experience, in my opinion.","9"
"M2b","The lamest movie not of this year but of the last ten years","27 August 1999","It's scary how really lame-brain movies such as American Pie and this awful Blair Witch film find audiences. I can only guess that ""lame"" is in at the turn of the millenium. Look at the recent Woodstock music festival.

There is no scariness or terror whatsoever in this flick. The lame script is perfect for three lamebrains taking a

walk in the woods. I was rooting for the witch, hoping that the characters would be killed off. An alternate title for this joke would be ""Mercy Killing."" I hope the co-producers, directors, writers of this claptrap take a weekend camp out trip in the deep woods of Maryland. Go get em Blair-baby.

I want my money back!

"dixichux","More like Formica than real wood","2 August 1999","Whatever you do, do not see this movie alone! Not because it is scary, but so you will have another perspective. While my movie partner was screaming in fear, I was screaming let me out of here! I was excited when it started, and ecstatic when it was over. This rates as one of the most tedious and boring movies I have seen in years. The effect,to me, was more like Formica, than real wood. It was pretending to be something real, but I was never able to believe it.

Three film students get lost in the woods on a quest for any truth behind local myths of witch evils, and ritual slayings. You know the ending from the very beginning, so how the story takes us there is the meat of the movie. Events start out fairly enough, introducing the players and effectively sharing their enthusiasm and naivete'. The filming process can be dizzying but is part of the premise. The first half of the movie lost my attention and was never strong enough to recapture it. As a result, I never felt their fear, or cared about their plight, but instead my mind wandered during the terror-like scenes to visions of the real film crew skipping happily through the woods gathering bundles of twigs and rocks, while others strung them into funky voodoo ornaments to hang in the trees. Lapses in logic became more noticeable due to my lost interest and the seriousness of the documentary pretense. If you find yourself in that position during this movie, you might wonder where they found the super-batteries to power their cameras?..why would someone waste flashlight power to sew in the dark when you might really need it to find the boogie-bitch later...why, if you are scared witless, hallucinating about mashed potatoes, inhumanly fatigued, and eating tree leaves, could you even consider hauling around a 70 pound back pack, much less, remain focused on filming??? While the script's depiction of bickering and likely conversations may have been one of the more accurate aspects of the movie, that too, became annoying due to its excessive reliance on the characters ""f**king"" limited vocabulary.

Many moviegoers will love this effort simply because it is different, not because it is good. That alone, reflects the sad state of big budget offerings. Hooray for the true indies and I'm happy for this group and their success. Maybe they can make the movie business better now.

There certainly seems to be no middle ground for personal or professional passions regarding this movie. You love it or you hate it. With that in mind, wait for the discount showing or video. It will be a bargain love fest, and not much lost for the other scenario (take a flashlight and a knitting project, just in case). But please, if you choose to see this move, bring a friend and plan for lively discussion afterward.",NA
"ian_bell","If you go down to the woods, PLEASE take more than one camera","30 May 2010","After seeing this film way back when it was released I came out of the theatre struck dumb and feeling rather nauseous. Not due to anything horrifying up on the screen - if only there had been - but simply down to the jerky and repetitive camera-work.

Blair Witch is an admirable idea, yet the directors stick too rigidly to their premise. By using one camera they induced seasickness in me, and no doubt a good many other people going by the comments at IMDb. To provoke fear you often have to create a sense of scale and movement - think Jaws, Texas Chainsaw Massacre and Psycho to name but three. Fear is just as much about open spaces and a sense of isolation as it is about dark corners and close-ups.

Clearly the premise of the film - three film students, missing for five years - demanded certain limits on the storytelling, yet sometimes you have more to play with than you realise. If the story is that compelling, and in fairness the Blair Witch idea was good, no matter what the vengeful critics say, then you wonder how much better this film might have been had suddenly a second camera appeared, tracking the threesome through the woods. Told lucidly enough, the audience would probably not even question it.

Some of the reviewers of this film have been harsh to put it mildly. No, it's not a great horror film, but it is an important one if for no other reason than it shows what can be done with basic equipment and a few thousand dollars.

As I write this review, some ten years or so after seeing Blair Witch for the first time, we are in the middle of a recession, yet what d'you know, James Cameron has just spent $300million making Avatar, some ten years after spending $180million to make Titanic.

Perhaps what's really bugged the film industry, and even some of the audience, is that two young film-makers found a way to dwarf the mega budget releases of Hollywood with a film that made more money than 90% of Hollywood, yet for no more than thirty thousand dollars.

Blair Witch is not great, but it does have something important to say; namely that you don't HAVE to have a $300million budget in order to make a hit film these days. That surely, is reason to be hopeful.","6"
"Archer-11","Who thought sticks could be so scary?","2 August 1999","The Blair Witch Project made me thank my lucky stars that I live in the big city where the worst that can happen to me is getting mugged or shot. This is a tight (albeit slightly nauseating) thriller that is as inventive and frightening as anything out there and probably more original than anything in decades. It stuck with me for days after seeing it and I think I even offered to personally give some people their money back if they didn't like the film (although I'm just going to say I was drunk if they come to collect). It's refreshing to see and be scared by a flick that sports a bundle of sticks and piles of rocks and snot as major special effects. If you don't like this movie you are simply too jaded to live or are lying.","9"
"blackberrybabe","Not that good","16 April 2004","I was really excited to see this movie in '99. Everyone was talking about it: 'Is it true or not?' Finally I went and saw it, and was disappointed. First of all, I did not like the characters. They were too cocky--I found myself rooting for the Blair Witch! The end did scare me, however. When Heather comes down the stairs and sees her friend standing in the corner, I gasped. That was the only scary part in this movie.

I recommend people to see this movie because the idea is ingenious. A major motion picture shot on a minor budget. The concept is great, the film (I believe is 8mm) is great, and the story is pretty good. It's the characters I couldn't stand.","2"

"paulo20","A Tale of Three Idiots or Why TBWP doesn't work...","11 August 1999","...at least for me. [WARNING: POST CONTAINS SPOILERS]

First, to be fair, I thought the three actors (Heather, Josh and Mike playing Heather, Josh and Mike) did well with what they had to work with (i.e. next to nothing); I honestly think they did the best they could. Yeah, they were grating with their constant bitching and cussing and whining, but they had to make up this s**t as they went along (and they only got $1000 bucks each), so I can't really find fault there. I also thought that the film did well in building up suspense... ...unfortunately, that's part of the reason the film doesn't work, because it doesn't pay off. I kept something really terrifying, but the film just didn't deliver. But more on that later...

The first and foremost reason why BWP doesn't work is that three students CONTINUED TO FILM TILL THE END. I mean, this should tip off anyone who might have thought this was real that it was,in fact,not real; at all. It shatters even the illusion of reality, and the characters' attempts to explain their continued filming don't hold water for me. No rational person would film running scared in the night or alleged bits of Josh or while fearing they are lost.

Which brings up the next reason why BWP fails: how could they possibly get lost in the first place? Like they themselves said, the woods aren't that big. They just walk in a straight line and eventually they'll get out. Yet they manage to walk around in circles. Does the film explain this? Not at all. We can only vaguely infer (and it's a long shot) that the ""witch"" is making them lose directions. But there's never any strong indication of this, unless those stick figures and rock piles are supposed to mean something. Plus they had that compass! Are we supposed to guess that maybe the witch threw their compass off? That seems, to me, to be a heck of a lot to ask from the viewers. So, anyway, the trio come round full circle to find that they've come upon the same log they'd already crossed over a creek(and they sure seem to cross a lot of them in this picture) in their southbound quest to get the heck out of the woods, which is in itself odd since you'd think they'd have recrossed it at some point and had some sense that they'd flipped directions. But the main thing is why not follow that damn creek out of the stupid woods? When Mike in a fit of semi-demented glee confesses he kicked that useless map (previously thought lost) into the creek, he unknowingly provided the clue to another ticket out of there. But, unfortunately, the three students are too unBELIEVABLY stupid to pick up on this (I have to believe that they are monumentally stupid, else I can't buy this at all). But I willingly overlook this in the hopes of some big scary payoff at the end.

Which brings me to the third reason why The Blair Witch Project is nothing more than a house of cards. That payoff never comes. It just doesn't happen. What we get is a shot of Mike in the corner taking a leak, or at least it looks that way. All that expectation I had building up got quickly deflated. What's that about imagination? I'm supposed to use my imagination? Come up with my own vision of the witch? Pfah, any schmoe can do that. Let's see, she's supposed to be this hairy ghost woman whose feet never touch the ground and in the middle of the night, she snags Josh in the middle of the night. Ooohh scary... but... what if it's not a witch. I most certainly did NOT see a witch. Not so much as one nose-wart. Did you see a witch? Then how the heck do you or I know it's a damned witch? What if it's aliens, who stake out the place, to observe the locals and notice three idiots stumbling about in the woods and decide to kidnap them for study or their own amusement. Hey! Maybe it was those aliens who screwed with their compass and made the poor fools lose their way. Stupid? Damn straight! But the filmmakers have left such gaping holes for the audience (the AUDIENCE!) to fill that I or anyone else can come up with some crazy BS to fill in those huge blanks. And no one can tell me I'm wrong because there is nothing to say that's so. NOTHING. If witches, why not aliens? Why not faeries from the magical land of Narnia? Hey, didn't you say to use my imagination? And I could go on, but man would it ever get stupid, but as it stands I'm left unsatisfied with the movie's conclusion.

Some good examples of leaving the imagination to the viewer? How about Jaws. Steven Spielberg knew the power of not showing the shark. We hardly see it, but we know it's there, because we've seen the damage it's done. Or take the Excorcist. Sure we see that a little girl doing all those ghastly things. But we never see the demon that possesses her, but we can only imagine what it would like if we could see it and it would no doubt scare the p**s out of us. Because we have something solid, something strongly visual on which to base our fears. That little packet that Heather found? What the hell was that? Looked like it could have been teeth and possibly a tongue, but it also could have bits of porcelain and a chicken gizzard (and very well could have been). It raises tension, but doesn't truly raise any hairs. It tells me almost nothing. It doesn't stack up against mangled corpses and little girls with heads that spin 360° . What you can't see has to be balanced with something you can, and BWP simply doesn't provide enough.

One last word on the theory that what you don't see is scarier that what you do. I'm reminded of a story I read somewhere: Some guy enters a graveyard to rob a grave or something. When he tries to leave, however, he finds something has grabbed his coat. In a superstitious frenzy, thinking the resident of the grave he just robbed has snagged his coat, he struggles to get free, never bothering to turn around. He ultimately dies of fright. Turns out what's snagged his coat is a sword stuck in the ground.

> Sometimes, that noise you hear in the night is some insect or bird, or maybe the wind flapping the shutters,10 or your cat screwing around in the basement. Sometimes what you don't see turns out to be a sword stuck point down in the ground. And sometimes what we do turns out to be some psycho trying to stick that sword between your ribs.

Well, that's it. I've said my piece. You can say I'm talking BS and send me e-mail illustrating the point, but I doubt very much if you can convince me to fear the sham that is The Blair Witch Project.","3"
"moviedude-72","A petrifying nightmare...","11 August 2006","PLOT: In October of 1994, three film students travel to Maryland to make a film about a local urban legend coined as the Blair Witch, equipped with a camera, tents and very little communication with the outside world. After days in the Maryland woods, things begin to appear outside their tent (i.e. stones and sticks) and strange noises occur during the cold nights. Eventually, they disappear, and a year later their footage is found, pieced together it becomes....The Blair Witch Project.

During the scariest of The Blair Witch Project moments we see nothing at all; the screen is pitch black. What we hear are the panicked voices of the film crew while outside their tent things go bump in the night. The combination of the distant noises and the raw fear in the voices will throw a chill into anyone's blood. The success of the film is not of blood, gore, nor is it special effects, but of the suggestion that something evil and supernatural occupies the dark shadows in the Maryland woods, and we can easily be terrified of them without ever having to see them. By using hand-held cameras and invigorating impromptu, there is a feeling of real life that accompanies these people on their journey, something sinister.

The directors, Daniel Myrick and Eduardo Sanchez are genuine and talented. And its even more perfect that they had a tight budget, because the poor camera work makes it all seem like a documentary, like its all real. (no wonder people are still asking questions like ""is this real?"") The cast does a credible job, more or less playing themselves. Heather Donahue is a strong and determine character, and gives the film's most powerful performance (particularly in the film's most intense scene towards the end, which will stick in your mind). However, there's little noticeable difference between Josh and Mike. Both actors manage to make their characters seem like real people...but they are real people we never know anything about.

Overall, the central question of any horror film is: Is the movie scary? With The Blair Witch Project, the answer is undoubtedly, yes! It's certainly a welcome departure from the modern horror film, which have all too often replaced terror with mere gore (not realizing that disgust makes a pitiful substitute for fear). The Blair Witch Project is atmospheric, creepy and very unsettling. It may start off slow (particularly for modern audiences who are use to non stop gore), but the movie becomes more unsettling the longer it goes on, and builds up to one terrifying, devastatingly effective climax.

Horsepucky.

One of the strongest reactions I had during The Blair Witch Project was a growing sense of disgust for almost every other recent horror film I've seen. Hey -- I went to school with plenty of people like Heather, obnoxious artiste types who blather about the Lacanian interpretation of the Flintstones over decaf espresso. Yes, she's annoying. But she's more recognizably human than the stock characters that usually pop up in horror films. I recognize her, and I wish she would shut up, but I care what happens to her. And I'm grateful to the filmmakers for giving us slightly annoying, unpredictable characters, who frequently don't do what you'd expect them to, or what they _ought_ to do to advance the plot.

I think one of the major reasons for the commercial and critical success of this movie is its complete rejection of formula. Marketing alone is not enough to ensure success! Think about it: who ever would have thought a virtually scriptless movie, shot by neophytes with hand-held cameras, could earn the acclaim (and revenues) it has? Yet here it is: with over a thousand comments, and some truly emotional responses pro and con.

At a time when Hollywood seems committed to remaking every film, TV show or SNL sketch, or adapting every novel ever written for the screen, here's little gem of a movie that doesn't do ANYTHING it's supposed to do. It doesn't play by the rules. Without professional cinematography, it still comes closer to a purely cinematic experience than anything you'll see this year...

"roaches_97","Underwhelming","19 September 2022","This movie is very much a product of its time. A lot of people who watched it when it came out say it's a horror classic, but I disagree. I really appreciate the realistic feel of the movie, apparently it was all ad libbed, but I jus don't think it's that great. I was bored through most of it, and I just didn't think it was very scary. The sequence when they find the house at the end is very intense and creepy, but I don't think it's a big enough payoff. I can't help but compare this to something like Evil Dead, another low budget horror movie from almost two decades earlier. I think the big difference between the two is the horror itself. Blair Witch doesn't really have any tension until about halfway through, whereas Evil Dead uses creative camera movements from the opening shot to add a feeling of these characters being watched. If you enjoy this movie, I totally see why, I just didn't really like it.","6"
"nick L","Pure psychological terror","24 November 1999","I have never been so drained, physically and mentally, than when walking out of the cinema after seeing this, surely a modern classic, and quite possibly an Exorcist' for the MTV generation. We all know now of the legend of the Blair Witch and how three young and arrogant students got lost in the woods, their only legacy being their footage. It is this knowledge of the film that has perhaps partially ruined the experience of this film for me and many others. I can only imagine how terrified I might of been had I believed that what I was seeing was real, as those who saw it at Sundance did. Yet the film holds together brilliantly despite, or maybe even because of, the hype that has surrounded it's entrance to the UK.

What the film does best is to build up the tension, almost silently, and allow one thing to go wrong after the other before dropping the crew (and us) in a living hell, within reach of all of us. It is hard to define the point at which they realise that they really are going to die, because it all builds up on different layers. The genius is that we are seeing this arrogant bunch do everything wrong, yet we know that we would do exactly the same thing in their position. We are annoyed with them, but we don't want them to die, even though we know they will.

Because we never see exactly what it is which is stalking them, we are left to imagine something far worse than CGI or animatronics could conjure up. The sound effects paint everything for us. The gore is minimal, but devastating. The design of the film (the stick figures, the house, the hand prints) is extremely effective. But what the film gives us more than anything is indescribable fear which oozes out of the film at every moment. The pace never lets up, and we are left every bit as exposed to the terror on the screen as the characters are, thanks to the ultra realism provided by the vérité style of the film. Thank God Hollywood didn't pick up on this, for it would have no doubt tainted the film with effects, music, gore and A-List actors. There is nothing intellectual or clever' about the film, but that is not the point, because this reduces the audience to a primal state, turning us into the closest we have ever become to cavemen.

I don't think that it was a fluke that this film was a success, and I fail to see how anyone could be less than terrified by it. I have noticed that those friends of mine not scared by it are not the most imaginative people I know, and if there is one thing that could have been added to this film, I think it would be a glimpse of the witch, and JUST a glimpse, for anything more than that would render the film dead. I believe it would have worked every bit as well as the gore did, for as I walked out of the foyer, the dialogue that was ringing around my head to that final, truly disturbing image was not Heather's now infamous monologue in the tent but rather the early description of the witch by a local. The key to this films success is really the fact that you are not once spoon-fed a CGI ghoul or witch, but are treated like an intellectual, educated filmgoer, who can imagine the witch perfectly well (although it would still have been nice to see it).",NA
"mycritic","Fear the dark! She is out there.","30 August 1999","Don't panic. I won't spoil the flick.

That would be cruel.

I just survived the new independent film, ""The Blair Witch Project."" If you haven't heard about this movie, and that is only possible if you have been living on a submarine for the last seven months, it focuses on three college film makers who, in the fall of 1995, trot off into the Maryland woods in search of the fabled ""Blair Witch."" Unfortunately, they never returned from their little jaunt in the forest. A group of anthropology students stumbles upon a duffel bag filled with their film canisters nearly a year after their disappearance.

The film is pieced together from their original footage by a film crew hired by the families of the three missing students. What results is a 120 minute spine chill. The chill originates when you realize that these three seemingly happy kids are going to come to their untimely demise at some point in the film. You have no clue how this is going to happen. You simply know that it IS going to happen. From there, the film, combined with your imagination, proceed to jar you repeatedly right up to the end credit. That is right. CREDIT. Exactly ONE credit. Less than they would have gotten for completing the film for their film class. That would probably be worth three credits.

Advice for when you see it. You will see it. I know. You won't be able to resist. You can feel it now. She is calling you. The Blair Witch. If you weren't working right now, you'd be at the cineplex. You might even be planning your own escapade with the kids into the woods for a nice family weekend. Don't. Don't do it. She's out there. I know it. Logically, I know that the film was shot in Maryland. I know that I live in Arizona. That just doesn't matter. She's out there. Oh... I was going to give some advice. Unless you are an avid operator of a small hand held video camera, and you walk around with this camera glued to your right eye 24 hours each day, you will feel ill as the camera jumps and hops around in the hands of these young film makers. Do you remember that feeling that you get when you are leaned back in a chair and you lean back just a hair too far? Do you remember the disorienting sensation of having to promptly right yourself lest you land on the floor? Good. Now magnify that feeling times 120 minutes. Take Dramamine. I nicknamed the camera in the hands of the girl (Heather) the ""Dram-a-cam."" I started to thank God every time she would steady the camera for more than two seconds. Don't eat a heavy meal before seeing this film, either.

Now, some advice for the parents out there. This film is rated R and then some. Not because of any real violence. In fact, the R is probably only for the kid's frequent use of the ""f"" word. Even that isn't so bad, really. I think that this film received its ""R"" for the fact that the rating panel was too shaken to write the letters ""PG-13."" They said, ""To heck with this. It ain't a G so I'm picking the only other one-letter rating and then I'm going home to hide under my bed."" This flick will give YOU nightmares. Don't even think of letting the cherished fruit of your union see this one. This is what you were put on this earth to protect them from.

With this set up, and the fact that I thought what I was watching was real this will always be one of the all-time best suspense filled movies ever made.

For such a small budget, the acting is brilliant and real. You feel the tension of all the characters and hope they come through the other side.

There have been few movies in subsequent years that have produced such a strong edge of your seat experience (Midsommer might be close) and as a staunch horror fan I don't know if anyone will be able to reproduce something that comes close to the class of this film.","10"

This film takes the whole concept of movie making and rips its head off and craps down its neck. The ""artistic"" use of camera technique is just a way to say we know nothing about the rules of filming and have no concept of when it is applicable to ignore them. And for those who say it was meant to look like a documentary then I say give me an example of any documentary that makes you feel dizzy and sick because they can't hold the camera steady?

I was just about to pack up and spend a weekend at Burkettsville hiking and looking for clues to the disappearances (carrying a gun, of course). In any event, it's a very realistic movie, if a little weird.

"SILVER ICE","Great suspense!","27 January 2000","I am disappointed that most of the people who have seen this movie did not like it. You all seem to be brainwashed by the special effects and blood and gore that modern movies today have to offer. This is just showing how much the media is exploiting violence and how one by one we are becoming immune to the extent that is portrayed. Blair Witch is a refreshing change from all the bulls**t trash that we devour every year. A film doesn't necessarily have to have a $100 million+ budget and an arrangement of machine guns to be a masterpiece. Blair Witch plays with the mind psychologically. It isn't a case of when the 'scary' moments are ( I am referring to several comments that other people have posted) but what the it is and what it will do next. The beauty of it was how it was made and set out. I am a 15 year old female so my opinion probably is of no value to you but I can tell you I seem to have understood more of this film than most of you.","10"

The photography is different and the tone of the picture is very effective, it truly is a student documentary that has been well edited.

"martin_lange","A student film project gone horribly wrong *** Contains Spoilers ***","6 November 2003","*** Contains spoilers *** Contains spoilers *** Contains spoilers ***

The Blair Witch project is arguably the first Internet marketed movie, and will be noted in history as the breaking new marketing grounds.

Therefore: 10/10 for innovative marketing, transforming this low budget flick into some kind of cult movie.

Unfortunately, `Blair Witch' itself is nothing more than a student film project gone terribly wrong. Bad acting, horrible camera work (OK, it is supposed to look authentic, but even by documentary standards it is bad), a story line that fits under a closed door and none-existing narration.

I cannot think of one redeeming feature that makes the `Blair Witch' worth watching.

I noted the `suspense' and `innovative plot' remarks in other user's comments.

Actually, while I appreciate other people's opinions, I personally don't even begin to understand where they are coming from.

For example - what was spooky, frightening or suspenseful about this movie???

OK - I've been in the Army and spent time deep in the bush . not just in a park like setting like the `Blair Witch' guys were strolling through. I have seen more frightening and intimidating things on Army training grounds like what's pictured in the movie. Does anyone really think that `witch' thing was frightening??? Well, I hope they never meet a drill sergeant in their lives . especially not in a forest!!!

Also, how could these guys possibly get lost? A road is a continuous line, which divides any given area. If you know in which direction the road is (these guys even had a compass), just hike in a straight line towards it. You cannot miss it. OK, these guys walked in circles (how you do this with a compass is a mystery (maybe the only one in `Blair Witch')). Why didn't they just walk up or down one of plentiful streams they passed?

Therefore, the summary of `Blair Witch' could be:

Three resource less idiots (played by abysmally bad actors) go into a forest looking for signs of witchcraft or a witch and get lost. They get scared, and even the little intelligence they displayed in the beginning evaporates. After that, they do everything wrong, bicker a lot with each other in the most senseless way and finally disappear is an abandoned house in the forest that may or may not have anything to do with the witch they were looking for.

The whole think is played out in about 80 tedious minutes, filmed with poorly handled handheld cameras, bad sound or no refinement commonly associated with film making.

Or, as a one-liner:

A student film project gone horribly wrong.

My opinion: 10/10 for the marketing, ***minus***5***/10 for the movie. Don't walk - run while you can!!!","1"
"sjbolton","A great movie but not an experience most people got or ever will.","5 January 2022","Firstly while this may be the first ""found footage"" film many hear about there was one at least back in the 50's 60's with found footage regarding a horror locked in Ice in the arctic or antarctic.

Secondly the real greatness of the Blair Witch Project was how was an internet experience which nobody will get to experience again. They had a ""News"" website with periodic reports and leaked footage and experiences from townsfolk building up this whole mystery and at the time it wasn't being presented as an upcoming movie release but as a true event unfolding there, leading up to the release of the movie as if it was a documentary presenting the facts as they were known. So if you hadn't experienced the website at the time the movie falls flat as many people see it, but in conjunction it delivered an amazing experience which nobody else has ever achieved. Many of the ""news reports of murders and locations we heard about on the website really connected the movie viewer to the locations when we reached them in the film. So we have a polarising result for the movie because most people now don't understand it outside the context of the leadup website, but for those of us who were there and a part of it it gave us a strong experience. Truly unique.","7"

The acting is almost impromptu which really adds to the greatness of this movie and gives it a genuine feel. The cameras that they used were used superbly and switching to a Black and White camera for night time usage was brilliant. There is no music in this movie which adds to the suspense of the evil chatterings that occur at night time. The ending of the film was amazing and the last 10 minutes or so will really scare the hell out of you. All in all a great film which everyone should watch. Its much better than the trashy horror thats out at the moment: ie Hostel! I still enjoy flicks like saw and saw 2 because they are a great concept but there not scary.

But don't let the poor production, direction, editing and such take away from the acting; it was awful as well.

"Hey_Sweden","A good & creepy modern fright flick.","9 February 2012","""The Blair Witch Project"" can be seen as a movie along the lines of 1978's ""Halloween"": it may not be original stuff (think ""Cannibal Holocaust"", made approximately two decades before this movie, in this case), but it certainly popularized its particular sub genre, the ""found footage"" sub genre, for better and for worse. This marvel of marketing deserves its props for one main reason, and that's the way it uses its low, low budget to its advantage, placing all of its horrors squarely inside the heads of its viewers, forcing them to use their imaginations to conjure up their own demons. The story hardly needs summarizing by this point, but suffice it to say that it presents itself as the ""real"" footage of three student filmmakers who get lost in the wilderness of Maryland while investigating a local legend. What this viewer has to say, in his own personal experience, is that repeat viewings have helped him to appreciate it more than he used to. A large part of the appeal is the *very* rural setting, and the idea of being lost in this setting and having no idea where to go, possibly ending up going in circles, which would be an extremely distressing thought. Now, the largely improvised dialogue is no great shakes, but it does offer a realistic enough account of the way that humans under extreme stress may very well speak, alternating between sniping at each other and trying to bolster each others' spirits. Our three protagonists, played by Heather Donahue, Joshua Leonard, and Michael Williams, aren't entirely unsympathetic. The directors slowly increase the sense of menace throughout, with the last act naturally registering as the creepiest. Interview sequences at the beginning are definitely amusing. The arts and crafts displayed by our unseen antagonist(s) are genuinely striking, and do lead to my favorite line in the film: ""Rednecks aren't this creative!"" Of course, the idea in this film of one character stubbornly insisting on documenting *everything* has already become a cliché; while of course we wouldn't have the movie if this person weren't doing so, it's all too easy to understand how this would annoy other people. Overall, I realize I have been under-rating this for years (watching it late at night or early in the morning with all the lights off would create the perfect effect) - it does have good atmosphere - although *that* scene has always cracked me up, and that was before I even saw ""Scary Movie"". In the end, it does appear that assessments of ""The Blair Witch Project"" usually do tend to rely on how one reacts - either it works for the viewer or it doesn't. Seven out of 10.","7"

This movie promised to be a classic suspense film, not a bloody horror show, but it was actually neither. The only suspense in it was waiting for something interesting to happen. By the time the ending credits rolled, I realized nothing interesting would happen. My husband and I both looked at each other and said, ""This is it?""

"zardoz-13","Hype surrounds ""The Blair Witch Project,"" but the payoff is a rip-off!","4 September 2008","First, ""Star Wars: Episode One: The Phantom Menace"" qualified as a good sci-fi thriller but a galactic letdown as a prequel to the original ""Star Wars."" First-rate special effects engulfed a predictable, pretentious plot with characters whose charisma rating never scored as highly as the originals. ""Star War: Episode One"" wasn't the only movie with too much hype. The second movie that generated almost as much hype in an even shorter space of time was ""The Blair Witch Project."" Independently produced on a broomstick budget for $22-thousand dollars, ""Blair Witch"" aroused all sorts of curiosity. Was it based on fact or fiction? Daniel Myrick and Eduardo Sanchez, who co-produced, wrote, and directed this phenomenally successful horror melodrama, have changed the way that Hollywood publicizes movies. Moreover, they may have touched off a trend that will revolutionize movies as well as movie-making. In the short time that ""Blair Witch"" has haunted movie houses, this game little thriller has generated over $240 million dollars! ""The Blair Witch Project"" concerns three student filmmakers who vanished into the stick near Burkitsville, Maryland, in October 1994. A year after their mysterious disappearance, their film and video footage was discovered, and ""Blair Witch"" reveals what happened to this ill-fated trio. The concept and the production of ""Blair Witch"" should inspire anybody with a video or film camera that has movie-making ambitions. Myrick and Sanchez didn't let a paltry budget or the lack of major studio support encumber their efforts. Anybody who studies cinema can see the resemblance between this little movie and the Italian Neo-realism movement in the late 1940s after World War II. Like the Neo-realists, Myrick and Sanchez filmed ""Blair Witch"" on authentic locations with no-name performers so that they film boasts more than a shred of authenticity. The lack of a budget transforms ""Blair Witch"" and makes it such a promising premise. If Myrick and Sanchez haven't been compared with famous Italian director Gillo Pontecorvo, who helmed the 1965 masterpiece ""The Battle of Algiers,"" they should be. The controversy raging over both movies is the superb way that the filmmakers give their subject matter an added boost by making it look like a documentary.

Sadly, all comparisons between Italian Neo-realism and Pontecorvo end when the lame storyline and the imbecilic characters in ""The Blair Witch Project"" are considered in retrospect. Media theorists will have a heyday writing about the symbolic implications of this movie for years, but dyed-in-the-wool horror fans will find ""Blair Witch"" less than satisfying. First, the storyline is predictable, lame, and improvised. Myrick and Sanchez get off to a bad start. ""Blair Witch"" takes too long, even for an 80-minute movie, to get itself cranked up. Of course, enthusiasts will argue that the filmmakers are setting up the characters and the situations.

Boo! These characters are as half-baked as their project. They plunge into the woods in their search for a spirited demon without any logistical support or back-up plan. Second, the characters themselves spend more time arguing than witch hunting. They aim their cameras at themselves more than at what they are searching for in the backwoods. They get themselves lost in the middle of nowhere and don't have enough sense to figure a way out. I'd have started a fire. These characters are every bit as stupid as the characters in major Hollywood epics, such as the ""Friday the 13th"" and ""Halloween"" franchises.

Sure, ""The Blair Witch Project"" stirs up considerable atmosphere, but the payoff is a rip-off. The witch is only hinted at through symbolic settings and off-camera hysterics. The constantly shaking cameras may induce motion sickness for some, but there is nothing in this movie that would scare anybody over age four. Indeed, ""The Blair Witch Project"" has subtlety working for it, but subtlety will only get a horror movie so far before you want to scream: Show me the Evil! The acting is not an issue, any more than the funky looking, pseudo-16mm format that gives ""Blair Witch"" a novel appearance. Daniel Myrick and Eduardo Sanchez have produced an interesting but deeply flawed movie that will be talked about for years. Hopefully, ""The Blair Witch Project"" will inspire a new generation of low-budget, independent filmmakers. Presumably, next time Myrick and Sanchez will contrive a story that matches their cinematic gifts.","6"

"I_Ailurophile","Modestly enjoyable","27 September 2022","It's not the first found footage movie, and it's not the best, but it is probably the most iconic. For good or for ill 'The Blair witch project' made a big splash when it was released in 1999, the subject of praise, criticism, and mockery in turn, and countless found footage flicks have followed in the years since. Between lack of interest or opportunity at varying points I've never actually seen it before, so even though I'm not watching with completely fresh eyes, it's high time that I saw it for myself. I do ultimately like it more than not, but it's a mixed bag.

All due credit for ingenuity in terms of all the work that went into cementing the manufactured footage as authentic; this was surely one of the very first movies to employ such a clandestine campaign. Modest as the concept is, I think it's pretty solid. There was good work put in here, and some really good ideas. At select points a scene is able to provide some earnest uneasy chills by virtue of what is left unseen, or audio faintly heard; simple crafts that heighten the characters' fear and anxiety; and the capable improvisational skills of the cast, Heather Donahue especially. At its best, this ably meet its goal as a horror film.

It's regrettable that the best value of 'The Blair witch project' is shuttled to the last twenty minutes of the feature. Before that the movie is a long slog of getting lost and arguing. Even as the characters sagely reflect that they should follow the creek to find their way - as basic as survival tips get - they pointedly fail to do so. Unsteady as the camerawork is, for the most part it's better than I expected, though there are absolutely instances where its' uselessly flailing like the worst criticism has long suggested. Meanwhile, after latching onto some creeping genre thrills in the last quarter, the picture ends rather limply. I fully understand the implications of the last scene, as it was plainly foreshadowed earlier - there's just not enough atmosphere or momentum for it to make the impression that's intended.

For the best strengths that this carries, and the effort that was put into it, I want to like 'The Blair witch project' more than I do. Those strengths are weighed down by too many shortcomings for the movie to stand especially tall, however, and it doesn't leave a huge mark in its wake. I commend all involved for their contributions, not least filmmakers Daniel Myrick and Eduardo Sánchez; when all is said and done I do think this is entertaining, and modestly worthwhile - just not altogether essential.","6"
"rolltide","The final summary of this film.........","11 September 1999","The Blair Witch project had without a doubt more suspense than any other film ever. However the ending was a huge letdown. Dont deny it folks, you know you were just like me gripping to the seat saying ""Oh god! Their not going to find......"" as the ending approached. It was weird though how the film made me feel. I knew it was fake yet because of the way they presented the film, it was like I instantly adjusted to it and felt that it was as real as ordinary life. It doesnt matter what I or you think about this film. Everyone who saw this film reacted differently and it will be appreciated by some and hated by some. So if you like it, great! If you didnt, sorry you were disappointed. It was amazing that when I saw it, my girlfriend told me afterwards how horrible it was, yet how come she turned her head and was trembling as the ending neared? Just wondering!","10"
"JaneDoe3","Excellent","17 August 1999","The filmmakers painted themselves into an intriguing but quite confining premise, having to abide by certain rules in order to succeed: The cast must be isolated and not allowed to escape, there must be a reason why these people would continue to record footage even after they've gone insane with fear, and there can't be any definitive resolution with regards to the antagonist. Despite having all these limitations to abide by, the film works.

The directors cover their bases with a few obligatory yet adequate explanations. No, it won't ""scare the hell out of you"" as some have claimed. The day scenes are basically ""MTV's Real World Gets Lost in the Woods"", as we watch our protagonists slowly start to dissolve into panic and then madness. The suspense arrives in the night scenes, where the danger is unknown and unseen. Watching (or often merely listening to) the events from the actor's POV makes for quite a powerful experience. The grainy, shaky footage adds an important element of mock authenticity. The performances are mostly solid all around, especially from Williams. Donohue does a good job of playing melodramatic during the so-called ""documentary"" sequences, making her ""normal"" performance seem that much more natural. Very effective.

Because this scenario is portrayed so realistically, a large segment of the audience seems to disallow the usual generosity normally given to a film's artistic license. Bruce Willis would never survive a fall from the top of an exploding skyscraper, of course, but we have to ignore that discrepancy in order to further the experience. It is a movie, after all. And even though BLAIR WITCH is supposed to be ""real"", we have to give it the same amount of latitude. Sure there are a few holes to contend with (why don't they just go to a stream and follow it?), and there's a little bit of overacting from Donohue towards the end. But the bottom line is that, aside from a few minor flaws, the limited concept could not have been executed any better.","9"
"anaconda-40658","Go Stand in the Corner!","1 May 2015","The Blair Witch Project (1999): Dir: Daniel Myrick, Eduardo Sanchez / Cast: Heather Donahue, Michael Williams, Joshua Leonard, Sandra Sanchez, Jim King: Independent horror film that received about the best marketing a film could ask for. Three students undergo a project on the legendary Blair Witch. Locals describe the Blair Witch killing several children in the deep woods. Filming begins with fun but each night grows darker until they awake with bizarre happenings. Great premise shot in camcorder so that viewers can experience the film as the characters do. Effective with tension building but the ending is too abrupt. Directed by Daniel Myrick and Eduardo Sanchez who give it a documentary appeal although the shaky camera movements are distracting. Absorbing performances by Heather Donahue, Michael Williams and Joshua Leonard. Donahue gives an emotional confession to the camera with that eerie flashlight. The locals being interviewed in the opening needed more screen time just based on humour. The ending leaves viewers a bit confused. One of the boys goes missing and the remaining two panic. When we finally do see him it is not clear what is happening. Upholds the idea of fear being something we cannot see. Some of the dark lighting could have been edited out particularly when it is pitch black and nothing is happening, but it is still shocking independent film work. Score: 7 ½ / 10","7"
"antide-42376","Do not believe the hype","29 June 2021","Finally got round to watching this. Amateurish in the extreme and yes, I know that is probably the intention but really, this is a poor movie all round. Nothing happens and I really do mean nothing. The girl is extremely annoying to absolute distraction. Also the ending is just funny, really funny.

The fantastic reviews on here are a puzzle and if there is a tag line to this it should be 'You can fool some of the people some time'. That is what the makers of this did and they made millions from it. I give it an extra star for the originality of the hand held camera but that trick has been overdone to hell now.","3"
"Antithesys","Watch it alone","9 September 2000","I saw this movie two weeks after it came out, when there were still rumors that the footage was ""real."" I saw it at night.

I saw it in an empty theater.

It wasn't completely empty. There were about five other people there, but no one was sitting next to each other so you couldn't really tell there was anyone else inside. So it was the perfect atmosphere to see a scary movie.

I don't think I have ever experienced anything more terrifying, more perfectly horrific than the Blair Witch Project. It was not only the scariest movie I've ever seen, but the scariest event of my life (I admit I've led a somewhat tame life). It felt like a three-hour movie; if it had gone on one more scene I would have walked out, that's how intense it was. It is a very different movie, what with the first-person style and hand-held cameras and four-letter words. People either loved this movie immensely, or hated it with a passion. I loved it, it was very effective for me. I think if you watch it in your living room with a bunch of your friends it's not going to work. You have to be able to lose yourself in it. If you can do that, it'll take ten years of your life away. Years from now Blair Witch will be a cult classic, mark my words.","9"

If only Heather Donahue had done her job, done some research, and known what the Blair Witch was. If only the movie makers had thought about plot development, and followed through on their beautiful premise. The only accident worth the hype this movie has gotten is a single scene of a terrified child trying to prevent her mother from speaking about the Blair Witch. If only the movie had lived up to that potential of terror.","1"
"ikaros-3","Not the scariest, but boy it's the creepiest!","22 June 2001","Fortunately, I saw this movie as an afternoon matinee rather than at night! The mix of film and video footage, the total lack of music, and more than anything else the slow, inexorable, and painfully believable decline of Heather, Mike and Josh from cocky filmmakers into hunted animals make this one to see.

Unlike recent movies which mistake splatters of gore for horror and suspense, the Blair Witch team remembered one simple fact of film making: fear is a very personal emotion. By not directly showing the Blair Witch (or *whatever* was creeping out the characters), they knew your mind would make up something worse than anything they would have shown.

Even Hitchcock would have been writhing uncomfortably in his sleep, and like most of the audience at the showing I went to, he probably would have probably gasped out loud at the ending.","9"
"Habibi-Universe","Do you believe in the ""Blair Witch""?","30 October 2020","Well... that was rather unsatisfying. 'The Blair Witch Project' (1999) was directed by Daniel Myrick and Eduardo Sánchez and it is about three film students vanishing after traveling into a Maryland forest to film a documentary on the local ""Blair Witch"" legend, leaving only their footage behind. This film basically started the whole ""found footage"" trend or at least popularized it as far as I know!

How is this film? First of all, what was really striking to me, was that the film's runtime is only about 80 minutes which is very short for a feature film. Having said that, I would have probably cut the film down to about an hour to make it a bit fresher and tighter!

A majority of this film takes place in the forest. I think it is very relatable that being in the forest while it's completely dark is a pretty scary and unsettling thought. One thing that I definitely need to commend this film for, is that the characters are very well written. Here we have a bunch of youngsters trying to make the next big thing happen, very quickly realize that they got themselves into a situation that they did not anticipate and therefore don't know how to deal with! If you think that there are not those kind of people out there, then you have way too much faith in the human race!

My big problem with this film is that, even though it is pretty entertaining, it is such an incredibly slow burn without anything really happening! This film lacks substance! In my opinion this horror picture doesn't do anything ground-breaking that I can appreciate. As far as the found footage usage is concerned, I can at least say that it makes the best possible use out of that specific film technique, a technique that I am generally speaking not a fan of.

Overall, 'The Blair Witch Project' (1999) is a horror film that only fans of that particular style will gravitate towards!","5"

Every 5 minutes thinking, just keep watching it must get scary soon. It has to have good reviews for a reason and boy was I wrong. Until the last 2 minutes the film was the dullest movie ive ever seen.

"CinemaSerf","The Blair Witch Project","28 August 2023","So three young folks go off into the wilderness in search of evidence to support the local Maryland legend of the ""Blair Witch"". Shortly afterwards, they lose their map, get lost - discover an old house; scream and cuss a lot.... A collection of three more odious folks I struggle to recollect seeing on screen. Directors Daniel Myrick and Eduardo Sánches substitute noise for suspense; and despite the fact that they spend several nights (more than planned) out in the woods without food, the batteries for their camera seems to endure remarkably well as they run around in the dark edging ever closer to whatever grizzly fate they well deserve. This is an huge triumph for hype over content and the marketeers have done a truly remarkable job. Though I would advocate that you watch it; it would only be because it has become a film of cult status - which, like so many others in that ""elite"" grouping, is a polite word for dross.","5"
"Red-Barracuda","The first internet event movie","2 February 2010","The Blair Witch Project was an internet phenomenon back in 1999. It was in fact probably the first movie to show that the World Wide Web could be a powerful tool to promote a film. Moreover, the BWP also showed that you could achieve huge financial cinematic success on an absolutely minimal budget. Love it or loathe it, The Blair Witch Project was truly a unique cinematic happening.

The film was marketed on the internet, via cyber-rumours, as a possibly-maybe real life documentary. This not only heightened expectations but also built a myth around the film similar to the fictional Blair Witch legend in the film itself. But this expectation also led many people to be somewhat underwhelmed by the Spartan nature of the final product. Many thought it was a non-movie and were annoyed to have been suckered in. While others conversely appreciated the original feeling of unease that the ultra-low budget documentary-style approach brought. These highly contrasting reactions have made The Blair Witch Project perhaps the ultimate Marmite movie. It's unusual to be truly indifferent about this film.

It has to be said that I am one of the latter group who actually liked the BWP. I think that the gonzo-style film-making approach does actually add to the fright-factor. At times it's easy to put yourself in the position of these people and feel the tension and fear. The night-time scenes especially are frightening affairs, with the weird cackling and children's laughter very disturbing indeed. The fact that we can barely hear these sounds because of the muffled sound on the amateur equipment only adds to the authentic feel and, therefore, the discomfort. All of the terror in the woods in set up quite nicely with some talking head interviews at the outset of the movie where some aspects of the witch and her legacy are discussed. The information is as fragmented, contradictory and ambiguous as old legends tend to be but sometimes, as in the case of the story about the direct encounter with the witch, it's eerie and disturbing; it nicely sets the scene for the journey into the woods.

If I had criticisms of the film I guess one would be that it does seem ridiculous that none of the participants think to follow the river downstream, I mean surely that's gonna be better than randomly trekking through the woods? And secondly, I feel that maybe showing just a little more would not have harmed the film at all. Perhaps the briefest flash of the witch at the end in the house? Also, even though I realize this is seriously low-budget, I would've thought they could have come up with something a little better than small piles of rocks as the portent of an evil presence.

But all in all, I mostly appreciate this flick. Its unique brand of horror was a welcome alternative for the genre. It admittedly was not the first film to use a pseudo-documentary approach but it nevertheless still has the feel of something quite unlike anything that had gone before.","8"

Let me just start by saying,I could'nt really review this movie properly,because near the end I had to leave the auditorium because I was.... well,I don't have to go into it.

Luckily,I only missed a little bit,but either way ,the producers get some diss points knocked off because of this slip up on my part.

From the most of it I saw though,was rather unique.There have been similar documentary type movies,but on those they somehow managed to hold the camera still a bit better.I was'nt exactly uplifted by all the juggling and throwing about.

The first unsettling part was the noises outside the camp.

Yet,I don't know,maybe it was because there was no tense music,but there was,strangely enough,less tension in seeing what was presumably the real thing on a hand held camera than seeing it in a fictitious hollywood production,whenever those scenes arouse.

I suppose the most revealing part about it was that it was a woman leading the expedition into the woods.Whether going up against nucular terrorists,going in the army,or losing it beyond the boundaries of the human soul in the woods,sisters are doing it for themselves in the movies more and more and more these days.

So,ultimately,not the scariest movie ever for me,then.And what on earth were they running and panting away from in the tent?Or were we just not meant to know to add to the suspense?***",NA

"emmet-2","Terribly, terribly overrated","3 November 2001","Maybe I've read and heard too much about this film before I finally got around to see it, because I have to say it really disappointed me. OK, so the actors were good and the film has an interesting premise, but I can honestly say I wasn't scared ONCE during the whole movie. On the contrary, I became more and more bored as the film progressed. By the end, I was glad I never wasted ticket money to see this in the cinema, but waited until it came on cable.

Here are a few of the reasons why I dislike the movie (WARNING - POSSIBLE SPOILERS):

All the ""scary"" parts take place in complete darkness, where you are unable to see anything at all. It's confusing and irritating.


You never see what stalks the three main characters in the woods - you only hear what I guess is supposed to be scary sounds in the background (but it sounds more like someone raking the lawn...)


No music whatsoever (to create a more scary ambiance).


This terribly overrated movie was a great disappointment to me. Maybe I don't scare easily, but this movie certainly could have made more of an effort to at least try to scare me...

Rated on a dice (from 1 to 6) I give this movie a 2.",NA
"Rich-99","The only thing scary about this film is the hyperbolic hype!","30 July 1999","""The Blair Witch Project"" according to some critics is one of the scariest movies ever made. Obviously we are dealing with a very low scare threshhold here as the only thing scary about this film is the sensationalized hype around it. What we basically have is a pretencious student film that thinks that jiggling the camera around and getting disjointed shots of the ground is scary and original. One can see this sort of thing nightly on reruns of America's Funniest Videos. The so called actors are obvious graduates of the MTV Real World School of Acting who feel that attitude and screaming constitutes acting. One could discuss the script if there was one but all appears to be made up as it goes along. The result is really a monumental bore that proves that the Hollywood Hype Machine is still running smoothly. If you want scary ""Abbot and Costello Meet Frankenstein"" or reruns of ""The Munsters"" fit the bill better than this home movie.","1"
"meryl-2","Allow yourself to be freaked....","19 July 1999","I saw this movie on the opening day at 1:45 in the afternoon in a sold-out theater in an audience of college film students. Okay...you know what? I was scared. Yes, I realize how some people could definitely be disappointed in this film. It's a low-budget movie with great ideas and minimal resources...but I thought that it was GREAT. It's a BRILLIANT concept. Now that the film is becoming more and more hyped, I KNOW that there is going to be some serious backlash about this film not being scary enough...but I've just got to say: ALLOW yourself to be sucked into the idea...you're lost in the middle of the woods...you hear voices and screaming outside of your tent...you get progressively more hungry, tired, and frantic as the days wear on and you lose hope...it's SCARY!!! I think that the best part of this film is the way in which we get to see these three characters just absolutely LOSE IT. Now, granted, sitting in a movie theater surrounded by tons of people, knowing that I would be able to go out into the bright sunlight when the movie was over....yes, that makes the movie less scary. But the point for me was just the fact that these three kids just completely lose their minds and their humanity in the middle of the woods. Just think about it...these three kids disappear and then a year later you find their footage: it's not about scary stick figures hanging in trees or creepy voices in the middle of the night. It's about three kids completely losing their humanity and desperately searching for ANYTHING to cling to. I thought that the ending was terrifying. And I thought that it was terrifying not only due to the creepy situation they find themselves in at the end of the movie...but even more so because these kids were just sick with terror and had lost all hope!!! It's great! Go see it! ALLOW yourself to be sucked in and THINK ABOUT IT!!! I give it 8 out of 10.","8"

"DigitalCowboy","I have never witnessed a more elaborated scam.","7 October 1999","This must be the biggest success ever according to me. I am certain that The Blair Witch Project is in fact a marketing test. Thought out carefully by some brilliant marketing manager who has made a bet amongst his friends that he could market anything with his skills.

They gave him the impossible mission. Market a lousy, boring, independent movie made over an week-end by some collage friends. This marketing genius sat many long nights thinking about how this would be done. Then it came clear to him... HYPE, hype the movie on the net. Start with some false rumors about how great this movie really is over the Internet and take it from there.

Obviously this worked far over all expectations. The movie became a super hit, almost as big as a Blockbuster and with only a 60 000 dollar budget. This movie really is something special, I have never seen a worse movie. And I have seen a lot of bad movies. The thing that bothers me the most is that people keep falling for the HYPE saying that it is so scary and well thought out. It is noting scary about Blair Witch except the HYPE. I can only draw comparison to Germany 1939. Everyone there fell for the HYPE.

This really shows only one thing. It could happen again.

Blair Witch is shot with a first person view through out the whole movie. It is shaky camera work, lousy acting, bad script and a boring result. The only persons that can be afraid of this movie must be 12 years old and never been out in the forest or in the cinema. The last 30 seconds of the movie have some excitement but that is all... and last time I checked that was not enough... but hey... maybe that changed too.

All the people that comes out from the cinema saying that they enjoyed the movie must have watched it with their eyes wide shut. Wake-up and smell the coffee. You have watch the HYPE FACTOR and you got crushed.

No one says it better than Chris Rock at the MTV music awards. - Someone is walking around with 59 000 dollars in their pocket. - I hope so, cause I could have made this movie with 1000 dollars and a free week-end, says I.","1"
"bigdaddydave","fantastic for those with imaginations","22 October 2002","(Spoilers)

I really cant stand the opinion that this film is ""boring"" or ""not scary"" However, I have a theory on this.

Everyone is familiar with the way films are now so ingrained in the public imagination that ""film conventions"" now provide basis for our reality, as opposed to reality. Examples including space ship ""explosions"" that would, in fact, be silent implosions.

The same is true of horror, people think to now be scared you must JUMP and have some tangible monster. This film completely goes against every corny horror film convention. It is the anti-horror film (though not a parody)

The genius of the film is that people are scared of walking through woods alone at night, and you don't know why. So this film relates it to your fears and then places you in the middle, its all consuming, and you definitely feel you are there.

Another criticism is of the ""whiney girl"" and the 2 students arguing. This was probably the most clever aspect. The fact is people are scared of the unknown, and after the third night visit they know they are going to die, but heather only admits this 5 minutes before the end of the film. They try to suppress their emotions (as real people would) and tensions fray. This is also the only film I have ever seen where I could truly believe the actors were tired hungry and scared.

I always argue with my friends about this film, , mainly about the action taken. ""I would follow the river and run"" Would you? Run alone through the woods? I wouldn't. ""i wouldn't go in the house"" so you would leave josh? who is still alive?

To summarise the film is scary genius, its simple tool is making it real to me, and every other imaginative person. Do you like special effects and crap films? MATRIX! do you like something different, and terrifying? Blair Witch it is.

"The-Sarkologist","A dark dose of Avant-Garde","22 October 2011","This is one of the most hyped movies of 1999 (along with Star Wars, which was more anticipated than this movie). One of the things that helped the movie a lot was the impressive webpage (which I will discuss later) and how it actually adds a lot of background to the movie itself.

The Blair Witch Project is what is called a Mockumentary. That is a fake documentary. A number have been done in the past, and the best ones are those that the viewer is left wondering if it is true or not. Man Bites Dog was incredibly disturbing while This is Spinal Tap left a lot of people wondering who this group was and where they could buy their albums. In fact, Spinal Tap was formed as a direct result of this movie.

The plot to the Blair Witch Project is simple. Three film students go into the woods looking for the infamous Blair Witch and become lost. They are then killed by the Blair Witch. There are a couple of subtle things in the movie, such as the guy at the beginning talking about how a murderer lived in the hills and will force one of his victims to stand in the corner while he killed the other, simply because he could not kill when somebody was watching him.

This is said to be a horror movie and pretty scary. I didn't find it scary, but it was very well made. The you never see the antagonist (except when he or she is running away) and strikes is a very intelligent manner. He strikes only at night, and then kidnaps one of them, yet keeps him alive forcing them to not only come after him, but come after him at night. They are lost but he knows the territory exceptionally well. The movie itself is a little sickening because of the motion of the camera. All of it is done using hand held, and people have been made quite sick with it. Some claim that it is because of the horror, but I don't think so.

In regards to the horror, some have said that it is bad because it is not traditional horror. I am not at all concerned about that, especially since I hate traditional horror. I myself prefer thrillers to horror, and find movies like the Haunting and Nightmare on Elm Street to be very bad.

This I saw not because of the horror or witchcraft, but because of the nature of the film. It is, I believe, one of the first mockumentaries to hit it big time. In fact it has made over $25,000,000US, and even though there might be criticisms about it, this figure is hard to ignore.

Now to the webpage. It is designed to add to the background of the movie. I won't go into it much because you can go there yourself. What I will say is that it forms the background to the movie as putting it in the movie itself would add too much to it and destroy the feel to it. In fact, the movie is just as watchable by itself, but reading the background gives much more to it.","5"
"jonasjobbar","""F-ing"" Scary... Maan""-best horror movie EVER","1 August 2003","This movie is scarier than the Texas Chain Saw Massacre, New York Ripper or the Hellraiser movies. At the same time it is blood and gore-less. It is the best horror movie ever (before Psycho and Texas...)

If you really ""enter"" the movie and take it for real- it's the scariest movie ever (I could not walk up or a down a staircase for 2 months without getting flashbacks of the ending), if you for some reason do not, this movie sucks...

"Reviews_of_the_Dead","Terrifying Look at What Could Happen","9 April 2019","This is a film that I still remember the first time that I saw it. My father rented it and as a family we all saw it. At the time of viewing it, I don't even know if I had the internet yet. It was so believable, my sister for years thought this really happened. The synopsis is three film students vanish after traveling into a Maryland forest to film a documentary on the local Blair Witch legend, leaving only their footage behind.

To get back into what I really liked about this film the first time is the realism. This isn't the first found-footage film, but it definitely helped revitalize the genre. It really does feel like a documentary. It is even better than the three leads all use their real names as their characters. The director and narrator of it is Heather Donahue. She worked with Joshua Leonard previously and he reached out to Michael Williams to do sound for it.

They get to Burkittsville and interview people in the town. One very interesting one is of Mary Brown (Patricia DeCou), an eccentric old woman. She claims to have seen a hairy woman whose feet didn't touch the ground. There is also a couple of the people who talk about a local legend of a child murderer named Rustin Parr.

The trio head into the woods looking first for Coffin Rock and then an old cemetery. Tensions start to run high when Mike doesn't believe that Heather knows where she is taking them and that she has gotten them lost in the woods. Noises at night outside of their tent make it even worse as they descend into frustration and terror.

As I said earlier, I did think this really happened for some time. Now that I know the truth behind the film, I have to say that the filmmakers did a great job at their campaign. They decided that they wanted everyone to believe that this film was real, even though it is fictional. This is genius to me, especially since they had such a low budget. If not for that, I don't believe this film would do as well as it did.

It is a premise though that we can connect with. The scary thing is that even today, with all of the technology we have, something like this could happen. We definitely could get lost in some of the woods in the country and never be found again. This film really is light on the supernatural, which makes those moments even scarier. I have to say, the scenes at night in the pitch black really get my tension going. The real life horror of exhaustion, lack of food and maybe never getting out is there as well.

The pacing and editing of this film is interesting. The realism is there and it does just feel like three college students trying to themselves out of the mess they are in. The basic story is simple and the footage is edited in a way where it feels like they would record for stretches and that is what we get. The longer they are lost, the more the tension builds. It can come from the interactions between characters as tempers flare and also from what happens at night. The film is actually written well as there are callbacks to things from earlier in the film, which I'm a sucker for. The ending is bleak and simple, but very effect.

I'm not sure this film would be as strong if not for the acting of the trio. Donahue, Leonard and Williams are really just playing themselves, but from what I've read, some of what they were doing wasn't really acting. They did stay out in the woods and writers/directors Daniel Myrick and Eduardo Sánchez really messed with them to get the most visceral reactions they could. It is kind of messed to hear, but it did make for a much better product. The interviewees were all great as well. There is such an amateur feel which helps with the realism.

There weren't really any effects in the film, but it didn't need them. I have read they wanted to actually have a witch. I'm glad this is something that didn't happen, especially with the budget they had. The little Tiki-men like figures were creepy. The setting is what really makes it and the old house as well.

Last thing to really cover would be the soundtrack. The film doesn't have anything that is not ambient. I'm glad they didn't use music, as that really would have broken the realism. The use of sounds while being in the foods was great. That is what drives quite a bit of the fear, especially at night. Something I noticed this time is that at the end, all of the sound is coming from the non-film camera. I bring this up because it is unnerving watching Heather's footage while she is upstairs. This was definitely used strategically.

Now with that said, this film is interesting. In the grand scheme of things, not happens. I can see that being an issue for some people. I think what makes it great is that they stick to the realism and it truly feels like a documentary. The true horror comes from being lost, exhaustion and being hungry. What happens to them at night really makes it even worse and build the tension. The acting seems real and even though there aren't a lot of effects, what we get is solid. The soundtrack of the film was used strategically as well. If you've never seen it, give it a viewing. I think this is a really good film and definitely helped spark the found-footage boom that happened again.","9"
"rookie-8","Needed the Lights on","2 August 1999","I grew up with scary movies. For some reason my parents, and my grandparents for that matter, thought it perfectly exceptable to show a young boy (I couldn't have been any older than 8 or 9 when I saw my first ""Friday the 13TH"" film) countless horror flicks that they were so engrossed in. By the time I saw ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" nothing was really all that scary. Yet, I have always found that the movies which leave the most fear behind are the ones with the least amount of gore and, more often than not, the least amount ""startle"" shots (Jason jumping out of the woods). The ""Exorcist"" is one of my favorite movies of all time, along with ""Alien"" and the ""Shining"" because of the sense of doom that each evoked in me. They were all terror driven movies, where the tension built and built without relief until the final, classic scenes. It wasn't about scaring someone for a moment, making them jump in there seat, but about truning a persons stomach inside out for more than an hour. Those movies caused people to squirm in their seat, to let out a soulful groan when a classic ""horror movie mistake"" was made, and to turn their face when the end was near because it was just to unsettling to see. That is why to me movies like the ones before mentioned, especially ""Exorcist"", are not merely horror classics but simply movie classics.

This film was billed as the ""best horror film since the Exorcist"" and, as you might have guessed that line sparked my interest. After reading several very positive reviews billing ""The Blair Witch Project"" as the scariest movie ever, and reading several posts from internet users concuring, my interest was further heightened. But then the phrases like ""overhyped"" began to be shot around and word that many user comments on well known, and trusted movie sites were planted by the studio or friends of the actors began to be spread, making me doubt the effect of this movie. I usually end up hating overhyped movies (Godzilla being the king of this genre) and am not easily scared to begin with, thanks to my families deliquent childhood pratices (sorry mom:). When time came to finally see this movie I entered it with very mixed emotions, most leaning towards the negative side of the spectrum. I WAS WRONG!!!!!!!

This movie is not only horrifying while watching it on the big screen, it is horrifying while driving home, walking to your home, looking out your window, or trying to go to sleep. It reaches you in so many different ways. I have read many people inferring to the ""unknown"" being the most frieghtening aspect of this film, and while I agree it is most unsettling, it is only a part of what makes this film work. The realism of the camera, which is shaky but does not draw away from what you are seeing, and the realism of the actors, who should all be nominated for Oscars, draw you into the woods. The instinctual fear of being lost in a foreign place without hope of being rescued quickly, the fear of unknown sounds and unknown forces at work all around you, the unsettling sight of people slowely losing their minds and their hope for survival, the nerve racking sound of people screaming and crying in absolute terror, and the fear of the dark all make this the most unsettling movie I have ever seen.

This is a squirm in your seat, look away from the screen, and tell me when it is over movie. The entire film held for me the intensity of the moment Tom Skerrits character went to go look for the alien in the vents, or when the little boy in ""The Shining"" kept reciting RedRum over and over, or when Chrissy Watkins is attacked by Jaws in the very opening scene. Many people felt the same way, as most did not leave their seat for a few minutes after the film had completed, and some clapped while others just let out a sigh of relief. My two friends, two of the more skeptical friends I have who are not easily impressed, had good reviews after the movie was over, but changed them to great reviews the day after as neither one could get to sleep that night. I myself, mister Jason is funny and Freddy is a comedian, had to sleep with a light on and closed blinds and found myself very happy to have my girlfriend sleeping over the next night for not the normal reasons:) Don't miss this movie. Don't wait for it to come on video. Don't wait for the spoilers to come out. Go see it now and get scared. I rate it a 9 1/2 out of 10, only because I thought the night scenes could have been longer.","10"
"jdiz115","The worst Horror film ever with the best marketing team ever","8 June 2020","Title pretty much says it all. It was marketed as being ""real"" and shills were HEAVILY involved with reviewing this film. Now this is the the worst Horror film and possibly one of the worst films ever made for 2 reasons. First, it's not a horror film. It's people walking in the woods who made a home video. Secondly, it spawned the worst trend ever in horror being the ""found footage"" subgenre. Now I admit found footage did land a few good films: Cloverfield probably the best of all, Chronicle, and as above so below to name a few. So this film is only ""good"" in the sense that actual competent filmmakers were able to raise the genre to its true potential. However, this genre became so commonplace because of the low cost of production and terrible filming being passed off as a ""film"". Thankfully this trend has pretty much died out and decent horror is being made again.","1"
"ehman1","A good idea, maybe a noble effort, that just didn't work","14 April 2005","I will try to stay as positive as I can with this. When I watched the film, what I saw was a movie about a few kids running around in the woods with video cameras being totally spontaneous trying to make a movie. They seemed to be making a movie about trying to make a movie. It didn't come across to me as a real film.

The Blair Witch folks may have had a good idea, I honestly don't know, Maybe in their hearts and souls they thought what they had was a good idea; but they simply didn't have the skills to pull it off or to execute it well.

As with any other art form, freedom and spontaneity are all good and well, but they must be tempered with skill, control and compromise. This involves some mastery of the craft; many years of study and experience. Maybe some day they will make a film I would like to watch.

Making money, being famous and getting over on people is not what it's all about. Be damn good at what you do; that's what really matters.","1"
"GiraffeDoor","Should have been edited to about half the run-time.","24 February 2019","I was born too late to get swept away with the hype and the particular way this movie was marketed.

Before seeing this movie I was sure it would be terrible. I'm not against found-footage on principle, but everything I read made this movie sound like it would be trash, especially the positive reviews.

I thought that it would just coast on its gimmick and marketing and do nothing but shake the camera and scream. Saying directly to the camera ""I'm so scared!"" isn't exactly following ""show don't tell"".

Maybe it's because of this that I was pleasantly surprised. I usually hate improvised stuff, it's insulting to the audience. But here they pull it off just right. The dialogue sounds spontaneous and believable.

This is an edit upon rewatching. I forgot just how much quarrelling is in it. You got three people berating each other and it just gets tiring really quickly. It's like a soap.

We move smoothly from the amateur documentary to frustrating situation to a bit of a nightmare. And irritating comments like ""this is creepy"" are just about enough to stop this being the slow burn it should have been.

I basically knew how the whole thing ends, not the exact end, just the gist of it, and I was still clutching Teddy when things really kicked off.

This is a polarizing movie for understandable reasons. I really get that.

It might help having low expectation like me but it's perfectly watchable if you're OK with people being obnoxious for for about 40 minutes. Better than Paranormal Activity 2, not as good as Creep 1 or 2.","5"
"insomniac_rod","You either love it or hate it; it either scares you or you laugh about it...","25 August 2004","""The Blair Witch Project"" was original on it's time, that is the late 90's. It's not the first time that a concept like this was used as ""Cannibal Holocaust"" (1978) has the exact same premise. The 19780's movie was too graphic (extreme gore) unlike the 1999 movie that attacks the audience with psychological terror (everything's in the imagination).

""The Blair Witch Project"" shines because it exercises the audience's capacity to create terror and feel it on their own way.

*** If you feel frightened or scared it's because you have a HIGH capacity to create terror in your mind. Depending on how much you get scared, the more pleasant the experience of the movie will be. If you get very scared then you've seen too many horror movies and you have a big capacity to create horror. That means you can feel horror. This is the best thing about ""Blair Witch"". ***

I can't say if it's whether or not a good movie, I see it more as an experiment to rate your capacity to be scared. Psychological terror is the most effective way to experience a horror movie. Texas Chainsaw Massacre succeeded in that field but it got aid from the graphical violence and the frightening characters. ""Blair Witch"" talks about a witch and spirits. How do you imagine witches and evil spirits? That depends on you. Now when the movie attacks you with the lead characters' P.O.V. you feel the uncertainty of not knowing what's going on and that's when your mind plays it's part by creating a whole different story in your mind. Also, the producers created a brilliant publicity campaign by saying that these are real life events. Before watching the movie that raises the scare factor and it's up to you if you believe or not the premise. The producers tried so hard in making a truly frightening movie and it worked for a big auditory. The movie has also many detractors and it's completely normal because ""Blair Witch"" can't awake everybody's capacity to create terror. I liked this movie very much mainly because I'm a die hard fan of horror movies and supernatural things.

The movie is OVERRATED because the critics and members of the ""Scream"" generation made it commercial. It's an independent film with minimal expectations that was viewed as an MTV type of movie and that's what affected the movie. Watch it as a part of horror movies history, it totally deserves the watch. ""The Blair Witch Project"" is as effective as ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" in the aspect that you have the chance to create horror in your mind.

Good effort! Better than today's horror movies... 8/10.","10"

"Candy-7","Less is not always more","13 November 1999","Being a life-long avid movie fan, I look forward to any movie which offers a new concept or approach to movie making. And, since many of the best recent movies are from the independent film makers, I always anticipate eagerly a new film which does not rely on the presence of a highly-paid superstar for its appeal. Having said that, I must say that, in my opinion, the money that I wasted to rent The Blair Witch Project did not anger me half as much as the precious time that I spent waiting for the moment that never came-the moment when I could say ""Aha, THIS is what scared all of those movie-goers I saw interviewed on television!"" That moment never came. Oh, I paid attention to the plot. I had seen the Sci Fi special previously, so I knew what was supposed to be happening. And I certainly do not subscribe to the theory that a movie must have explicitly visual gore in order to be frightening- in fact, when it comes to horror, the less is actually shown, the more frightening the effect. One's imagination holds more horrors than any movie scene can ever visually present. But this movie failed miserably in its attempt to frighten, for several reasons.

The primary reason for the failure of this movie is its inability to make the audience care for the victims. I was so glad that they got what they deserved that I never for an instant felt any empathy with their situation. I am not a prude, by any means, but the language in this movie was unnecessarily foul, and its only effect was to make the characters totally unloveable. By comparison, the repetitive use of the ""F"" word by Joe Pesci's character in Good Fellas contributed to the plot and character definition- not so with Blair Witch.

I did not think that the poor quality of the filming itself was a detraction-rather, it contributed to the premise of the movie. But the lack of character development, the poorly explained ""threat"" of the witch, the jerky, uneven plot- all combined to create one of the biggest wastes of my time in recent history. If it is not too late- do not waste your time and money.",NA
"jimbo-53-186511","It's all about mood and atmosphere with The Blair Witch Project","15 June 2023","Three film students set out into the woods in Maryland in search of the mythical Blair Witch. They document their journey via a video camera, but soon begin to regret ever venturing into the woods...

By now many of us know the formula for these type of films; students interview people on whatever local legend they are investigating, they set off and all is well to begin with, they argue, run into problems etc etc. What we have to remember is that The Blair Witch Project was the first of its kind in this respect and still remains the benchmark of this genre...

Although the idea of a bunch of students wondering round the woods filming trees, streams and each other doesn't sound like a great idea on paper in the Blair Witch Project it does actually work surprisingly well. There's a believability to the characters; I was sold on them being good friends and was sold on the peril that they find themselves in. As they get further into the woods, their friendships become tested as each look to blame the other for the predicament that they find themselves in.

The characters in this film do make some daft decisions (which normally would be problematic), but given the fact that they are clearly tired, hungry and thirsty it's not really surprising that they aren't thinking entirely straight; it's like that scene where they're all convinced that they've gone round in a circle and are back at the same log... was that really the case or did they simply believe that they were back in the same place? The likelihood is that they had gone back to the same place, but as I say the mind can play funny games if it's not properly rested and taken care of.

Those who are looking for a film with frequent jump scares may be a little disappointed with The Blair Witch Project as it really isn't that sort of film. It's more of a character-driven psychological affair which gets under your skin because you feel scared for the characters; they end up lost which is scary enough whether or not The Blair Witch actually exists. Having said that it certainly has its moments (many of the night-time scenes are pretty creepy and there's enough breaking of twigs and unexplainable noises to hold the interest). The grand finale in the house is also well-staged and well-shot with some good night cinematography.

The Blair Witch is a winner for me, but it's mostly down to the characters, the mood and the atmosphere. Whilst it only really has one or two truly nervy scenes when they do arrive they are effective. The only problem with The Blair Witch Project is that it paved the way for many inferior copy-cat films in the intervening years.

If you want to see how and where it all began then I'd strongly advise you check out The Blair Witch Project; it will also demonstrate how found-footage films should be made.","7"

"Mourn-2","Okay...the criticisms are valid, but its still very good.","17 July 1999","For those of you muddling through all the reviews of this movie, I am going to bottom-line it for you. It's better than most of the crap coming out of the major studios. It's better than about 80-90% of the films I've seen in the last few years. Yes, its hokey at some points (its impossible to believe anyone would keep filming in some of the circumstances meeting the crew later in the movie). It might be a stretch to call it brilliant, but if you try to avoid knowing TOO much about it, go sit in a dark theater and try not to over-analyze the little problems, it will scare you and it will leave you thinking about it.

Lastly, a quick commentary on the MPAA. If I've ever seen a movie that should have carried a rating (NC17) to absoluteley keep kids out of the theater...this is it. There is no specific shot or image or sound that would really even rate an R these days (except maybe for the excessive swearing). But the theme of the movie is raw and intense and horrifying, way too strong for kids. I sat next to a young girl, maybe 10 or 11 and she was visibly shaken by what she saw. The MPAA is a joke, we live in the only country in the world where Stanley Kubrick's final movie had to be edited to obscure some sex scenes to secure an R rating. Yet this film, which could be emotionally traumatizing to a child, falls through the cracks because there is nothing blatantly pornographic. Violence is much more damaging to the human mind than sex...wake up MPAA.

See the movie, leave the kids with the baby-sitter.",NA

When they don't scream and run around like lunatics, they yell and blame each other for mistakes they eventually make themselves. I will always be thankful to this movie for creating that awful sub-genre. Found footage. It is extremely unpleasant, and directors seem to be hiding behind close ups and pitch black shots, to create the cheapest effects too often. As far as Blair Witch is concerned, you never notice anything that proves the existence of supernatural forces. And mostly lean towards bad joke on and off screen. You can imagine anything but what is implied through the title. The sequel, as mediocre as it can be, tried to have a script and a plausible conclusion. This one lacked both. And all you're left with, is an unbelievable so called mysterious tape.

It may have been the audience in the theatre that ruined it for me. It's hard to be scared when the people in the theatre think that the whole thing is really funny, and the man sitting behind you specifically has a laugh like a braying donkey. I am sure that had I been alone I would have been scared senseless. As it is, the movie was damned creepy.

I think the one thing that creeped me out the most was that child at the beginning. The one that one of the people being interviewed is holding, remember her? I want to know if the child was supposed to be saying 'No!' and covering her mother's mouth like that. If so, get that kid into some classes immediately..she was a damned fine actress :)

Anyway, even if it isn't very scary, it is still excellent. A very good piece of independent filmaking.

"R1OT","An emotional roller coaster ride","30 July 1999","From all of the hype in the media concerning ""The Blair Witch Project"" (TBWP), I was hoping with all of my might that it just wasn't that ... hype.

It was a small crowd (I saw a very early show), but from the second the film began, you could hear a pin drop in the theatre. It's very uncommon nowadays to goto a movie and not hear anyone talking, murmuring, whispering. This was one of those times.

TBWP scared me. It was very easy to place myself in the woods with these kids, and to pretend I was one of their group. My emotions went from slight laughter to concern to sorrow to anger to betrayal to fear over and over again.

No movie has ever filled me with the suspense and the sheer fear of the dark like TBWP. From beginning to end, I found myself not able to move, in fear I may miss something.

When the film ended, everyone in the theatre just sat there; no one got up for at least 30 seconds. Families and couples and friends all walked out not uttering a word to each other; it was like everyone was at a funeral and everyone's best friend was in the casket.

I, myself, left the theatre in disbelief and somewhat mildly shocked. If you can put yourself up there on the screen with the kids, you can actually feel their pain. This film was WONDERFULLY done.

I can honestly rate TBWP as one of the greatest horror/suspense films of the decade. I will see it again; perhaps tonight. But I won't go to sleep in the woods. You can count on that.

Basic plot outline is that three student filmmakers go into remote woods to film a documentary on the local legend, The Blair Witch. Upon interviewing many of the locals, they discover that the supposed Blair Witch is a woman who was tied down in the forest and everyone thought she was dead, or something like that. Half the children from the town started to disappear, and then sightings of a woman covered in thick hair (hippie!). Hence the Blair Witch.

The last leg of the documentary is when the three friends go into the forest to hike, when they get lost and encounter their worst fear, the Blair Witch. They must now try to navigate themselves out of the forest and away from a terror no one can ever imagine...

"FZ-FX","All hype, no substance","23 May 2005","I have to admit that I too fell victim to the marketing hype around this film. It first stuck in my mind when I saw an ad for a special about the film on the SciFi channel (back when they didn't just run lame B-films). For those of you who are too young to remember the buzz around the theatrical release of ""The Blair Witch Project"", the film's marketing gave the impression that it was an actual documentary of three people becoming lost in the woods of Maryland and falling victim to a mysterious, supernatural power, local legend the Blair witch. It may seem a bit outlandish looking at it now, but the marketing was surprisingly convincing at selling this as an actual documentary, even going so far as to list the actors as missing. Through word of mouth and rumors, the film fascinated the public, who were left to wonder if the horrific events of the film had actually occurred. Even after it became widely known that the film was fictional, the hype surrounding the project and many positive reviews help the low budget B-film become one of the biggest hits of the year.

Before I begin, I'd like to say that I'm not a huge fan of the horror genre; but not because I don't like being scarred, but because I am very rarely frightened by movies. The key appeal of a horror movie to most people is it's ability to get them on the edge of their seat, and it very rarely does that for me. There are a couple that have rattled me (The Exorcist, Seven) and some I enjoy for their plots or directing (The Shining, Alien, Day of the Dead), but on a whole I don't get the genre, whether the film happens to be a teen slasher flick of the 1990's, a gore feast of yesteryear or even the classic Monster pictures of old Hollywood.

That said, ""The Blair Witch Project"" was an hour and a half of sheer boredom and sloppy camera-work. For those who haven't seen it, it revolves around a group of three film students who set out to make a documentary on the Blair Witch, a legendary figure supposedly living in the woods of Maryland. Seen from a hand-held camera, it shows the group as they go from being enthusiastic about what they think is going to be a two day camping trip to slightly distressed about being lost to utterly terrified at being pursued by what we are led to assume is the Blair witch. The film is careful to never actually show the witch. The ""scares"" come from the students terrified reactions to their increasingly dire predicament. As the become more and more lost, they begin seeing signs of the witch and of course begin to hear odd noises in the night. Some would argue that the film is scary because of what you don't see; I find that little is given to make us believe that their truly is something evil stalking the students. In order to make the terror seem real, the film mostly relies on one thing: screaming. There is rarely a minute in the ""Blair Witch"" where one of the kids isn't screaming their lungs out over something. Would real people react the same way in the same situation? Probably, but this doesn't make it interesting. The simple fact is that the movie lacks almost any tension what-so-ever, and rarely manages to surprise (the reasonably well scripted ending being the exception).

To its credit, the acting does lends to the documentary feel of the film well. Since the students aren't actually shooting their documentary most of the time, we see them acting like fairly normal college students, which means crude jokes, pot smoking and an abundance of profanity. The acting, while certainly not interesting by any means, is effecting in creating the illusion that these were real events. The characters seem like a trio of goof balls on a camping trip, and their reactions to their growing troubles are believable. The ""real"" acting can't change the fact that never once are we intrigued by a character's reaction to the horrors around them, as the reaction is almost always the same: running, screaming and talking about how scared they are into the camera.

I've got to hand it to the people who masterminded the ""Blair Witch"", because they certainly managed to do well; making well over $200 million dollars from a movie that cost just over twenty grand to produce. While arguably one of the biggest phenomena of 1999, ""The Blair Witch Project"" hasn't become the classic many people said it would become. This is all well with me, because despite the fact that it scarred a whole lot of people, the ""Blair Witch"" is a movie without a hint of substance, even by horror standards. I can remember very few other films that managed to bore me as much as this simple minded scream-fest. Perhapse I just don't get it, and I'm sure most people would be frightened by some of the film. Either way, I'm taking comfort in the fact that we probably will never see a movie like this again.","3"
"drownsoda90","Faux folklore; love it or hate it, it's still ingenious","17 January 2015","No other film made in my lifetime has stirred so much hullabaloo as ""The Blair Witch Project."" Granted, I was only ten years old when the film was released, but I remember its almost immediate absorption into the cultural lexicon; my fifth grade classmates told me stories about it, and how it was real, and how their teenage siblings had let them watch it with them when mom and dad went to bed.

Thanks to an expansive marketing campaign that touted the film as ""real footage,"" ""The Blair Witch Project"" fascinated and tantalized audiences in 1999. Despite the fact that the film is entirely fabricated, and that everybody knows it, it doesn't change the fact that it captures an unusual realism that enables it to get under our skin in spite of all presupposition.

The premise is simple: three college documentarians go into the woods to investigate the legend of a witch who has been said to be the source of various goings-on in a rural Maryland hamlet over the past century. What starts out as a hunky-dory camping trip slowly edges into a downward spiral of dread as the three find themselves helplessly lost and apparently hunted.

As I mentioned, few films made in my lifetime have stirred up such a hullabaloo as ""Blair Witch,"" and I think few films have also been so polarizing. While it is a true ""love it or hate it"" film, and oh, are there haters, there still is no arguing that it's incredibly unique. Looking backwards over fifteen years later, the film has spawned an army of found-footage imitators that are still, for the most part, unimpressively smearing their way across cinema screens well into the twenty-first century. Few, if any, are even remotely as unsettling, and most of them are disastrous.

The greatest thing about the film is that it dodges horror tropes in favor of character dynamic and vague suggestiveness. The filmmakers and actors portraying the characters ease potentialities into our heads from early on, interviewing locals about the folklore, relaying stories about purported murders and personal experiences that have been attributed to the witch; playing up the hype of the urban legend. What we don't realize as an audience, is that we very subtly become immersed in the allure and intrigue ourselves— and thus, by the time the characters find themselves at the mercy of nature and experiencing bumps-outside-the-tent-in-the-night, our psyches are impulsively running wild with the evocative power of the folklore that we have been provided. The possibilities of the nightmare here are endless, and that is the true power this film wields, even years later, and even when we know the truth. 9/10.","9"
"Chris_Docker","Scary little low budget movie, exceptionally well-made","28 October 1999","Scary little low budget film, very well made, about a group of people who go out into the woods and get lost and very scared. Documentary style and brilliant acting carry it through as the various ""happenings"" take them on the ever-descending spiral towards the sophisticatedly mind-crunching ending. Curiously, those who like mainstream horror should maybe forget it. The spin offs are becoming apocryphal. There is already a big-budget American comedy take-off ready for release.

Scariest bit for me was the fact that by the time I found the cinema (whilst abroad in the USA) I was totally lost. Somewhere in the outback where I paid two dollars for a seat and the usher adjusted the curtains at the side of the screen by hand. When I came out (around midnight, with a full moon shining between the trees) I realised that the difference between being lost and lost-and-scared is refusing to give in to sheer panic (ho, ho, thought he, as he drove through a red light) . . .",NA

"rysa","Well, this is perhaps the most original presentation of a horror/suspense movie that has been brought to market in as long as I can remember. I find only two flaws with the film.","30 July 1999","Well, this is perhaps the most original presentation of a horror/suspense movie that has been brought to market in as long as I can remember. I find only two flaws with the film:

1) To make the film have more of an impact, the filmmakers should not have revealed that it is not a true documentary, at least not until the movie had made an impact. The knowlege that there is actually nothing out there but a bunch of filmmakers making noise in the forest detracts from the ""feeling"" of the movie. I wanted to believe, and in a few scenes I did actually have goosebumps, but always in the back of my mind was the knowlege that it was all fake. The goosebumps were generated by the true emotion shown by the actors/actress on the screen. Their ""performances"" were great.

2) There needed to be more ""explanation"" of the events. While the ""raw tape"" shown was gritty and provided the ""feel"" needed to pull off the movie, I think that without a set-up there is definitely something missing. The two or three brief statements at the beginning of the film (the same statements that appear in the commercials and trailers) give the viewer a basic understanding of what they are about to see, but that's just it, a basic understanding. I walked into the theatre with almost four months of knowlege of the ""story"" under my belt and I enjoyed the movie more than my companion who had heard very little. If you haven't been reading the updates on the website and watching the special on Sci-Fi, you missed a great portion of the whole mystery and feeling that is the Blair Witch. A bit of an intro would have been appropriate, in my opinion.

In all, I enjoyed the movie. I recommend it. Don't expect Hollywood at all when you walk into the theatre...but expect to get some chills.",NA
"Talison","The Worst I've Ever Seen","1 August 1999","I went into this movie with great expectations. Truly, it was a wonderful idea and an amazing concept. The web sight and Sci-Fi Channel special helped build up a hype around this movie that I thought it deserved. I was scared before going in.

It's a shame that the actual movie captures none of the magic created by the hype. The movie is build up after build up without any sort of pay off. Not only was I never scared, but I was angry that nothing ever happened after an hour and a half of waiting.","1"

"funnycommentor","It's not ""Based on real events"", lol","14 September 2022","The plot of the movie was very interesting and I was so curious of watching that movie. Because, I thought it was based on real events. Eventually, it was entirely fake, lol. The storyline was kinda well-written. Actually, it's a very simple movie to understand. The characters weren't interesting, nor well-developed. The location of the movie was basic, just a dark, creepy forest. It was a kinda scary movie, however, there weren't any jumpscares. In my opinion, it's more of like a psychological-horror movie. The acting was really good and so believable. I have to admit, that it was really tiring and exhausting of watching a movie, through a video camera and the quality wasn't the best. The ending scene, was kinda expected. Overall, it was just a nice movie, very creepy and kinda overrated...","6"
"nvillesanti","Blair will never let you go","10 April 2012","I remember back in 1999, this film was marketed as a real event and that the events you were seeing were true and these people have actually disappeared. Of course, that wasn't the case but marketing it this way lured people to go see it, including me. Never have I seen such a film so original, that engaged me, and made me believe that what I was seeing was true since ""Cannibal Holocaust.""

It is set in 1994 when a group of three student filmmakers were filming a documentary on a legendary witch known as Blair in Burkittsville, Maryland. As they go deeper into the woods they get lost and every night they hear strange sounds coming from the woods but they can't make what it is or where it comes from. As the days go by, they succumb in desperation as they can't find a way out of the dense woods. But even more horrifying is that someone or something is hunting them.

After leaving the theater back in 1999, this movie would just not leave my mind for days. The acting was unbelievable, even more coming from unknown threesome of actors. It was shot in a first person point of view with the actors being the ones holding the camera giving it a new sense of realism, now this wasn't absolutely new style of filming. Cannibal Holocaust was filmed the same way but it hasn't been done in a long time. Also you never see what is hunting them; the movie forces the viewers to use their imagination and to fill in the gabs. Nowadays many movies try to copy the filming style of The Blair Witch but fall short. But what was even more amazing is that this little independent film, with a budget of nearly $30,000, earned over 240 million dollars at the box office. That is something you don't see every day.

This film don't have the eye candy and gore other horror films have or elaborate setting or big names, it is simple, creative and extremely effective and I would dare say it is up there with films such as ""The Exorcist"" and ""Rosemary's Baby."" This film is without a doubt a masterpiece of cinema and I strongly recommended it.","9"

It is not scary in the slightest, I actually paused it and went to sleep halfway through and then when I woke watched then other half and went back to sleep upon finishing it. It is the opposite of being scary, it is actually so boring it's sleep inducing. I'm not sure why it was called The Blair Witch Project when the only reverence to a witch was rumors about how their used to be a woman people found creepy, but the rumors didn't give any detail as to how she was creepy or why she was believed to be a witch. There were details to rumors about a man who killed children. The question raised by that story is if he killed children two at a time how is it he killed seven kids? If he killed children two at a time he would have killed an even number of children. I have gone hiking, and exploring abandoned buildings and checked out supposed haunted places, I've never taken a video camera to make a documentary but otherwise this movie was entirely relatable to me and my personal life and yet the movie is so poorly done I had no connection to the movie or felt drawn into any of the scenes or story.","1"

"Samiam3","A project unlike any other","17 September 2009","Next to Spinal Tap, The Blair Witch Project is probably the century's most memorable mockumentary. Usually that term is associated with comedy, but this film although starting out kind of amusing turns into everything but. What we see is the footage captured on a handicam from three kids who went out into the woods in search of an urban legend, the Blair witch, but their incompetence got them lost, which led to frustration, which led to anger, which led to fear, and then to... well lets just say careful what you which for, you might find it.

My first bit of advice for approaching The Blair Witch Project is this; take a gravol pill. The camera work which is intentionally shaky and awkward is nauseating, aside from that this is a wicked presentation (sometimes literally so) Cinema cannot get anymore subjective than this. On top of all that the film is actually pretty scary.

"RonB-4","It's so scary because it's so real","21 August 1999","""The Blair Witch Project"" is a damn scary movie! The premise: three student film makers go into the woods to shoot a documentary on a witch legend, then disappear. Their footage is found months later and this film consists entirely of that footage. The making of this movie is nearly as interesting as the movie itself. The two guys behind this film, made for just a few thousand bucks, didn't so much write and direct it as conceive it. They gave their three actors a broad outline of the story and two cameras, which the actors used to actually shoot all the footage themselves. The movie looks amateurish because it is, but that only adds to the horror. We see the three characters start out as cocky college kids, but wind up as terrified, cowering animals, hunted by something in the woods. What we never quite find out. In this day of computer generated monsters it's nice to see a horror movie where not everything is shown. The fact that we often must listen intently while looking at a dark screen or shaky, out-of-focus camera work only makes it more real. Our imaginations are engaged.

The only thing that could have made this movie scarier was if it really was real. It certainly did look real. The performances were quite believable, which gives me the impression that the actors really were that scared.

"Harvestr","A remarkably well done film","29 July 1999","Let me say one thing before I begin.. this was an remarkably well done film. Its reliance on acting skills and inventive story telling rather than the sordid showmanship of today's so called ""blockbusters"" was a refreshing reminder that the moviemakers of today still have a soul.

The Good Points: The acting was exceptional on all levels. Completely engaging and believable, you must keep reminding yourself that this is just' a movie. The production method was, in such few words, ingenious. The use of a non-fixed script method and the filming with standard camcorder equipment led to a more believable atmosphere and gave the film a realistic feeling'. It's ability to use your own imagination to create fear from something they do not even show you was simply amazing. It is a true thinking' movie.

The Bad Points: While I have few complaints about this movie, I can not conclude that it did not have its share of problems. I did find the pace of the movie slow at parts, with scenes seeming to repeat their general point over and over. The level of annoyance was a bit high at times, as the characters argued about camera usage for seemingly endless amounts of time. While this was credited by many as the `scariest movie of all time', I personally did not find that to be true at all.

Thus the frightening' effect was lessened. I found it hard to believe that someone would find themselves wanting to film under the circumstances presented in the story. The amount of humor in this movie far outweighed the actual sense of fear that it induced in me. But this is just my opinion. I noticed the level of pensive fear in most of the people around me during the movie, so be assured that not all feel this way.

Even with all of the bad points I have stated, the seemingly small amount of good points presented far outweighs them. Overall, the film was excellent. It is far from becoming one of my favorite' movies of all time, but I am sure other will definitely feel much more strongly about it. Go see it! You will no regret that you did. or will you?",NA
"Andyh74","Pseudo-Horror?","14 August 1999","I somewhat liked the film because, even though I read various things about the ""documentary,"" I still wanted to see it to see exactly what happened to Heather, Josh, and Mike on film. I watched with some anticipation, wondering if the title subject was going to appear so that there was some payoff to seeing something other that three lost people in the woods. It was enjoyable in that it's sort of cinema verite, kind of ""here it is, this is what happened, it doesn't have to make sense since we're out filming our first documentary,"" while at the same time it strives to be a horror film. It's caught between realism and fantasy, and I think that if one's imagination is tossed into the mix, then weird stuff comes out. At one point I started thinking that maybe Heather was annoying for a reason, and I started wondering if she was part of the myth, had something to do with the witch, and realizing it now I see what effect the film had. It presents itself as a documentary, but while watching it, I was thinking about one of the characters in terms of fantasy, that she (Heather) was in a fictional film, and so my imagination started posing questions that I felt would be answered if I kept watching. And that's how the film kept my attention. If the film had a noticeable plot, the plot would be evidence of someone else's imagination, and then our emotional response would be the only thing we would express--we wouldn't ask any questions about what will happen. However, this film just presents itself--with our understanding of how it ends--and makes our imaginations ask questions, which in turn force us to be attentive to the film to get answers for those questions. The film doesn't want us to take it seriously, because if we do, then we don't enjoy it out of dissatisfaction--we want to believe that it's either a film presenting itself as a documentary, or that it's a fictional film, that it can't be both. It is that dilemma that I feel makes ""The Blair Witch Project"" unique.",NA

"lemon_magic","If you go out in the woods today, you'll get a BIG SURPRISE...","7 January 2006","""Blair Witch Project"" has come under a lot of heavy criticism for its many shortcomings, for its over-hyped/overcooked viral marketing campaign, and for its length (some critics seem to think it would have been much better as a 30 minute short subject). Many of these criticisms have merit. However, once I saw it (on VHS, long after the hype had died down), I enjoyed it quite a bit.

The fact that I first saw it on VHS, on my living room television, may have had much to do with my positive reaction to it. Even though it is mostly set in the woods of Maryland, BWP's tiny cast and rough, grainy, under-lit feel lend it a curiously intimate quality, as of a ghost story told around a campfire at night...and I think this quality comes across better in a dark, silent living room than a large movie theater with dozens-to-hundreds of people in the place with you. I also think the grainy, cheap, hand-held feel translates better on the small screen. It's better than it deserves to be...you might think of it as one of those 'accidents' of film making like the original ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre"". In fact, I am pretty sure that the editors and the choices they made were what 'saved' this film from obscurity. Many slick film makers have tried to duplicate TCM, including its director, and no one has ever completely succeeded. I think the same is true here...the film makers got lucky and they knew it.

Mostly, I think I enjoy BWP because I have a understand the true impact of the phenomenon that rangers and outdoors-men refer to as 'woods shock' - the devastating impact of being REALLY LOST in the woods. Modern urban dwellers can easily underestimate this impact and dismiss it because we've never been truly 'lost' in our lives. But many fit, experienced hikers and campers actually given up, laid down, and died from the stress of being lost in the North American forests and mountain ranges, often less than a day's hike from civilization and with supplies and rations still in their packs. The original meaning of the term 'bewilder' is to take someone out in the woods and get them lost, and leave them there...and it was first coined hundreds of years ago, by people who were much more comfortable in forests than we are now.

So I think the basic story idea, of three callow film students going for a 'simple', ordinary overnight trip into the woods and stumbling into disaster makes for compelling viewing if it is handled right...and I feel that BWP use of the plot device of hand-held cameras (documenting their growing unease, bewilderment, and finally hopeless terror), is a brilliant stroke that sidesteps the issues of slick production work , professional sound work, 'good' acting, etc.

Yes, there are some contrived elements that don't hold up to serious examination (especially the 'editting' of the film found in the cameras, which is much more 'dramatically apt' than a simple presentation of what happened), but that's true of almost any ghost story or horror story told around a campfire at night (""And there, on the handle...was a HOOK!!!"", etc. ""Like, I am sooooo sure...""). But I found the casts' reactions to their growing predicament credible and enjoyed the way the plot kept turning the screws on them tighter and tighter. And while the payoff may have been annoyingly ambiguous, jumbled, and hard to decipher, it was plain that something Very Bad Indeed had happened to the film students. The glimpses provided of the walls of the house where everything comes to an end are the materials for good old fashioned nightmare fuel. What WERE those markings on the walls???

While the followup sequel was an unmitigated cinematic disaster, BWP succeeds as a nasty little ghost story and can be enjoyed on those terms.","7"
"STPFan","A new disturbing genre is born & Hollywood should be scared!","2 August 1999","""The Blair Witch Project"" is a masterpiece in its own right. The movie is laid out like a student documentary would be. The interaction between the characters is truly realistic from friendly exchanges to mild distress to pure fear. The mysterious disappearance of Josh induces a true array of human reactions in Heather and Mike. This movie leaves you with a chilling climax without the use of computer graphics or blood squibbs. In fact, the psychology of the last chilling schene is what scares you, not the visuals. In addition, every little detail has a significance and returns later in the film to provide a sense of closure.

Hollywood is full of the notion that higher budget will mean better box office results. Due to this, Hollywood is only interested in making movies with large budgets and famous stars. This movie had a miniscule budget and no-name actors and is turning heads left and right. I feel the quality of acting in this film is almost unparalleled with any other movie I have ever seen. I hope that Heather Donahue and Michael C. Williams are nominated for Best Actress and Actor. Joshua Leonard also deserves an Oscar nod for Best supporting Actor for his performance in this phenomenal film.

But this won't happen. There is too much Academy to entertain. They will take the latest realease from a major studio for consideration. This new type of ""real life"" motion picture should be a wake up call that big budget, action packed films are on their way out.

There are signs though that Hollywood is a little bit intimidated by BLAIR. Dream Works was afraid that their latest offering, ""The Haunting,"" would not be as popular due to its opening against BLAIR. Universal Pictures delayed the release of ""Mystery Men"" a week to prevent it from being slaughtered by BLAIR.

My only complaint lies with the theater where I saw this film. I sat 5 rows from the front and I got motion sickness and eye strain from the wobbly camera. I really can't complain about the camera because it did create the mood and tone for the picture. Please, if you see this film and plan to sit in the front, take some motion sickness patches!","9"
"Koth-3","Highly recommended, with one catch! (possible spoilers)","2 August 1999","I was completely impressed with this film. When I first began to hear the hype, I was one of the many persons who didn't realize that the footage was fiction. I am very glad I found out before going to see it, because the knowledge in the back of my mind that it was fiction was the only thing that kept me from freaking out completely. Simply stated: If this film doesn't win an Oscar or two, the folks that hand them out had better just pack it up and forget the whole thing. It has been a long time since any movie had done what this one has (neither financially or emotionally.) I have given it a 10 and would whole-heartedly recommend it for folks who are not normally plagued with nightmares after scary movies. If you are, do yourself a favor and skip it.

The Blair Witch Project was the first really popular ""found footage"" movie of my generation, and Cloverfield, Paranormal Activity, Quarantine, and other movies owe a lot of their success to this low-budget flick. If was mega-popular (though divisive) when it was released in 1999, but is it still chilling when watched today? For the most part, yes. 

What makes The Blair Witch Project effective is the great way that atmosphere and fear of the unknown are used, as well as how well the three actors sell their frustration, unease, and finally, terror. As the three amateur filmmakers get more and more lost in the woods, their anger and annoyance at one another and their situation does a great job of raising the tension. Add that to the local legends that they were exposed to before venturing out into the wilderness and the odd, disturbing events that start happening each night, and you've got a pretty creepy little film.

The key to enjoying movies like The Blair Witch Project is how easily you can suspend your sense of disbelief and just go with what you're seeing. If the movie can draw you in, you'll probably have a good time with it. I didn't have a hard time putting myself in the shoes of our trio, and I know that if I had been in their situation, I would have been well and properly freaked out. It had been probably five years since I last saw this, but It still gave me the creeps and I still love the ending. It's a fun movie for the right kind of horror fan.","7"
"Philantrop","This ""movie"" is definitely the worst I've ever seen...","20 May 2005","... and I have a habit of watching bad movies when I can't sleep at night. So I consider myself an expert for the few, select worst movies ever. And BWP tops them all.

(Spoiler begins here)

Three idiots stumble through a wood that wouldn't hardly even qualify as one in Europe. They argue and swear (I don't feel offended by strong words but this was simply swearing for its own sake) and the only reason they kind of break down is that they obviously can't stand each other. And I can't blame them. Any sane person would hate each of them. They reach some house, one of them stands in a corner (oh horror!) and that's it.

(Spoiler ends here)

In short: Don't watch this. BWP is the *real* ""Ring"" tape - it's just quicker, it takes only 86 minutes to kill you by boredom.

"Zorac","Jaws made America fear the ocean... Blair Witch, the woods.","2 August 1999","Every once in a while a movie will come along that will make America re-assess the way it looks at parts of life they encounter on an every day basis. For example, in the aftermath of such genius as the original ""Psycho"" (1960), America lay witness to an actual recorded drop in the amount of women who took showers instead of baths. After a movie like ""Jaws"" people were forced to think twice before entering the seemingly peaceful ocean. And now after viewing the shockingly original and very independent ""Blair Witch Project"" (it had a $75,000 budget)and after seeing its opening weekend figures I am positive that this movie will make the country if not the world afraid to enter the woods at night. The acting is so good that it borders on genuine and the idea is so original and successful because it shies away from the horror-genre cliches that would usually appear in a movie that takes place in a wooded setting. Not only is ""The Blair Witch Project"" one of the best summer movies ever, it is also scary enough to change the way horror movies are made in the future. God bless independent film.",NA
"enniodog","Original, yes, but WAY over-hyped","17 July 1999","I concede that 'The Blair Witch Project' is one the most original horror movies in modern cinema, yes, and that it is completely worthy of praise. What I can not understand though, is the overwhelming plethora of critical gushings such as that from 'Mr. Showbiz' calling it ""the scariest movie ever made."" Does the distributor Artisan Films have these people on the payroll??

Sans the thought-provoking conclusion I never got the sense of sheer terror I've experienced in such horror-fare as 'Halloween' or 'The Shining.' One ostensible source of the audiences' sense of doom in this film comes from the fact that the 3 documentarians can't find their way out of the Maryland woods and somehow every step leads them to where they were days before. Their surroundings begin to look alike. This would normally be effective in underground catacombs or in a haunted house where an evil force could conceivably manipulate the environment, but if you're in the woods there are some subtle clues which can be used to ensure you're not going in circles. Did it ever enter these peoples' minds to, say, oh I don't know, FOLLOW THE STREAM or USE THE SUN??

I shouldn't be too harsh even though it's probably too late. Given their $30,000 budget the filmmakers have created quite an achievement (the premise alone was brilliant) and given this economic allowance, the film is impressive. On a Sundance level I understand the excitement, but to say this ranks up there with the best of all time? I don't think so. Let's praise this for its originality and creativity. Not its ability to scare us.",NA
"PatrynXX","Second comment:","10 January 2000","Wanted to add a little something as I was reading down on the comments. 1. Thumbs up to the guy who said it was a comedy. Hey I agree with you. Though I thought the ending was a tad scary. That 5 minutes is probably scarier than anything in The Haunting. But I loved The Haunting far more because of that damn house. But the biggest problem with THAT movie is it's labeled as a Horror movie. Not as an adventure movie. I'd say it almost seems the same creative team behind The Mummy, also did The Haunting. (not a known fact). and 2. To the person who'll never be alone in the woods again. Hey you'll be missing alot. I remember once when I was young (88-89 somewhere ) That there was this place (private land, but we had permission) not far from a church out in the country near Lewiston, MN, that was named Ruprects (spelling?) Valley. We went into a cave , it being small, us guys went over a good pool, spiders and all, and we went way in there on our hands and knees. Since the girls couldn't make it across that pool, they had to call us back. (I was 1 of only 3 people who bothered to make it all the way in) But anyway... I and 2 girls bothered to get lost in the woods. We though managed to find our way out of that. Sure I we wound up go a hill at an 80% incline, but what the hell. This is the reason I have to laugh at this most unrealistic movie. It was shot very well (or should I say they were radical in doing so), but watching three people swear in the woods, isn't what I call scary as hell.....","6"
"PatrynXX","Excellently shot, but this isn't a horror movie. It's a comedy!!","21 November 1999","That's right. With a laugh at every turn. Anyone who was scared by this movie hadn't watch a horror movie (opinion only... not basis for fact). Now if you wanna be scared ____less, watch Evil Dead. I watched that one all the way through once. But every time I try to watch it.. I'm going no way.. But with Blair Witch the only possibly scary moment might have been the final 3 minutes. Otherwise it was a nice trip in the woods. We kinda got lost in the woods once. When I was young say in 7 or 8th grade. So this movie was a tad silly. I did like how it was shot though, as well as the square movie box look. 6 out of 10..","6"
"sme_no_densetsu","Among my favourite horror flicks but not for all tastes","14 February 2009","When ""The Blair Witch Project"" was released in 1999 it was a big hit and a breath of fresh air. It wasn't the first horror movie based on the supposed footage of ill-fated documentarians but mainstream audiences hadn't seen anything like it. The premise here is amply summed up by the film's tagline: 'In October of 1994 three student filmmakers disappeared in the woods near Burkittsville, Maryland, while shooting a documentary... A year later their footage was found.'

The story is a good example of 'less is more' storytelling. True, the plot does involve a fair amount of aimless wandering through the woods but those scenes are crucial in the give and take of suspense where each night could be their last. There were a couple of instances when I thought that the script could have benefited from just a little less information (thus ratcheting up the mystery) but the film still shows plenty of restraint and, consequently, skillfully manipulates our fear of the unknown.

Meanwhile, the cast of unknowns does a pretty good job of seeming like regular people rather than actors. There may be a few occasions whereby the emotions don't quite ring true but for the most part the actors are sufficiently convincing. They also perform double duty as cameramen, helping to enforce the film's sense of realism with mostly lo-fi visuals.

In the end, though, this is one of those films that most people will either love or hate. I think that it's definitely worthwhile but your mileage may vary. By the way, don't bother with the sequel; it's awful.","7"

"shorteze","Didn't do it for me","7 May 2005","I remember when this movie came out 6 years ago. All of the commercials and critic reviews made the movie sound like it was going to scare my pants off; how wrong I was.

To make my review short: nothing really happens. I think Family Guy summed up this movie best when Bryan is a seeing eye dog for a blind man and he narrates ""There in the woods...nothing happens...there still in the woods, a girl is crying...uhm...nothing happens"" I could make an easy fortune narrating this movie for people who can not see very well; I could just say that they're just in the woods and I would have done my job.

Some parts are a bit creepy...if you think that toilet paper roll ups hanging on a tree are the stuff of nightmares that is. Its so random, but not random in a good way like Monty Python. Typical scene ""Where we going?*camera off* I WANT TO GO HOME!"" The filming is creative but its just a bad concept

I remember being at the theater, sitting down, and the movie suddenly ends. Credits are rolling and I look around to see if anyone had left; most of the people were so utterly confused, they did not know what was going on. I thought maybe the credits were a trick. ""Ah,they're going to filter out the impatient ones since nothing has happened so far!"" oh how wrong I was...

"KUAlum26","Good movie,GREAT concept and promotional push","8 September 2010","Now somewhat expected in scary movies,around 1998 filmmakers Daniel Myrick and Eduardo Sanchez made the daring and clever move of not only creating a singular camera,FX-free horror film with unknown actors(which may've as much been the end product of being relative first-timers of movie making as it would be credited to being ingenious,to be sure)but also going to work promoting the film as if it were a real occurrence,replete with its own website,its own history,documentation,and plenty(and I mean PLENTY)of interviews and fake newscasts. By the time of it's running,thru a number or film festivals and word-of-mouth promotions thru the early part of 1999,the movie was a virtual dynamo of anticipation when it finally landed in commercial theaters a week or two after the 4th of July that year.

For the most part,it feels like a lot of invention and inspiration for a movie that,while inspired and effective enough,seems to be really challenging the viewer to love it or hate it. When I first saw it eleven years ago,I was much more in the ""love it"" camp. Upon re-watching it in full more recently,I'd more put it in the ""solid like"" category.

Treated,at its broad-frame as a sort of ""Super documentary"",it portends to show the film of an attempted documentary of three film students from Baltimore(Heather Donahue,Michael Williams and Joshua Leonard--all using their real names and not seemingly attempting to show any distinction that would give them away as actors)who go on the trail of the rural legend of the Blair Witch,an 18th century woman who was cast into the woods of post-colonial Maryland,only to disappear and somehow,foist curse on the locals in neighboring towns. After roughly eight days of being lost in the woods somehow,the three understandably lose their cools,rationale and eventually much more as their uncanny knack to be tracked by someone(or something)in the woods has them unable to think clearly and,ultimately,escape.

Plenty of ""cinema verite"" and improvisation(supposedly,the directors made the actors merely react to situations by leaving index cards along the woods telling them of what was happening next)made this simultaneously one of the more organic and unnerving films made.My lessening of enchantment of this movie is mostly from the passage of time,a chance to digest all the elements of the film/story and the re-evaluation of camera and filming tactics,which,while appreciable for their lack of excess and attention to more intangible fear and atmosphere,seem to be challenging the viewer in ways that threaten to break the viewing experience as well as enhance it.

Extras on the DVD are a real plus:getting to see much of the back-story attached to this show is a largely satisfying element(and also gives me some insight into a couple of less-than-flattering reviews)to accompany a film that may seem a bit thin or ""naked"" on its own. An inspiration for ensuing ""shocker"" movies to come(Cloverfield,Quarantine,Paranormal Activity,The Last Exocrcism come to mind),this movie is worth a look,though the cleavage of opinion on it is gonna be quite difficult to overcome.

After just watching Blair Witch Project, I wish to apologize to director Weir for even trying to make a comparison. The only commonality was the permanent disappearance of the actors in both films. The truly splendid ""Picnic at Hanging Rock"" was a small sensuous masterpiece with scenery and musical score that brought chills of emotion. ""Blair Witch"" was a non-masterpiece of hype. Tell everyone how frightening it is, so they will have to feel frightened. Tell everyone it is as scary as ""The Exorcist"" and they will feel guilty if they are not as scared. Tell everyone that this movie was made in only eight days, so they will think--""How incredible"" Enough said on that subject. As for hand held cameras, the producers and directors need to take a lesson from some of the Danish film producers who produced ""Mifune"" and are dedicated to the use of hand held cameras with a flair and verve that this film could never have.

Still, I was prety damn scared. I had checked out the Web site beforehand and I had seen the Sci Fi Channel's special, ""Curse of the Blair Witch,"" so I was pretty well versed on the background story.

The entire film consists of the footage (Hi 8 video, and B&W 16mm film) taken by three film students who entered the Black Hill woods in Maryland to find locations mentioned in the tales of the Blair Witch, a local legend blamed for many gruesome events over a period of 200 years.

Some people will see this movie thinking that it's for real. Let them believe it. The acting is so good that they'll be convinced.

The scares come from the inside, from the audience's empathy with three people who are being completely scared out of their minds by something or someone unknown and out of sight. You may not be as scared as you think you'll be, but if you're not pretty damn scared, then you need to work on your empathy.","9"

"emasterslake","As if you really were watching a home made video","19 November 2006","Blair Witch Project is a simple well made, thriller/horror flick.

Back in 1994, 3 student filmmakers both make a documentary on the legend of the Blair Witch. They interviewed some locals who were superstitious and religious on the subject of the Blair Witch. They say that numerous victims were killed by the witch if you trespass in her woods. So the 3 independent filmmakers go to those woods which is in the middle of no where.

They were enjoying their project during the first few days. But every night they hear the sounds of stones being tapped together. And it's as if it was coming from all directions. And the next morning they'd find something different near their camp site. They figure it was just a prank played by someone, but they didn't tell anyone on where they were going. And eventually they start to freak out and have suspicion that the curse of the Blair Witch is more than a legend.

Unlike the gory, overrated, and badly written flicks you'd see now and days. Blair Witch Project is unique and very well thought up. The cool thing is it's all filmed on student camera and video camera. Contains no visual effects, at all. It's so realistic, it'll make you think it really did happen. I won't give away the ending but it is one of those mysterious movies. And after you watch it, it'll make you think and imagine the whole movie and the student filmmakers experience.","8"

"Stampsfightclub","A classic showing of real horror","14 April 2009","3 filmmakers head into the woods to make a documentary about the Blair Witch, a legend that haunts the woods and murdered children.

Made almost 10 years ago, Daniel Myrick's picture is an unbelievable revolution into the horror genre. It was one of the first films to shoot completely digitally and showed 3 unknown actors the most terrifying part of their life by entering woods and told to improvise all of their work and create a revolutionary film, and they succeeded. Getting lost in the woods and unable to find your way out may sound conventional in this genre but this is so different from your average flick.

The Blair Witch Project feels real and therefore physiologically frightening. Shot with a shaky hand held camera and juxtaposed with all the method and improvised acting gives the film a highly soaked feeling of spontaneity, as if happening with you right there. You are sucked into the drastic turns of events as the trio encounter numerous difficulties and importantly for a horror film, this is open and appreciative of its target audience in regards to the legend, which will keep you hooked.

The opening shot shows added text stating that the footage of 3 filmmakers was found a year after their disappearance in the woods and therefore we ultimately think it to be true. What follows is the edited footage of their events including the build up before the woods and the heart stopping discoveries and events once inside. Simply stunning combination of real life and a depiction of a legend that will have you questioning everything once the film reaches its stunning climax.

At the time of my first watch I believed the story to be true and didn't even think to check the acting but looking back these are almost Oscar worthy. The feeling of hatred and undeniable concept of fear is there on every face. The rivalry and decisions reach high dramatic turns; none more so than Heather's close up confession to the camera.

Like the Shining this has a lot to offer with stunning direction and realism in context and performances Jack Nicholson would be proud of. Whereas not as sharp as Kubrick's masterpiece, you will certainly not think about anything else for the rest of the evening.

What perhaps is truly amazing that this was released the same year as The Matrix and American Beauty but this doesn't have star actors or special effects. It is not a mainstream hit but an almost indie classic that shows realism and terror in a new format","9"
"ashturner-79373","Worthy of respect, but not really a good film experience.","12 March 2019","There's something about this film that stops it working for me, and I think it's probably the pacing - let me clarify. I think the performances from Heather Donahue and Joshua Leonard are good (though Mike Williams relies a lot on pantomime stuff like rocking back and forth or laughing manically), and the interviews at the start all feel genuine aside from the fishermen. The premise of recovered footage (à la ""Cannibal Holocaust (1980)) from a student documentary about an urban legend is fine too.

But it's the way the plot unfolds as drama about getting lost in the woods that's the problem. There really isn't much variety in watching people argue about who lost the map, or why Heather is still filming, in between scenes of inane conversation about burgers and getting your shoes wet. It all comes down to people talking in the woods, except half the time it's filler dialogue and the other half it's just swearing and shouting.

I can at least respect it for being one of a few films to really treat the found footage style seriously. The audio seems to be recorded from one microphone, so half the dialogue is inaudible, and the camerawork is often shaky and imprecise. While these can be good ways of conveying that this is genuine, raw footage, they also limit your film, and a savvier FF film would find ways of working in spite of those limitations.

One way this film does at least accomplish that is via its filming style, in which the actors were given cameras and told to basically shoot the film themselves using a vague plot outline. It would've been better, though, if the plot were less padded and there were some variety in the visuals other than leaves, twigs and faces. Attempts at social commentary about Heather using a camera to distance herself from reality don't help.

For a film that's trying to look like real footage, the end product feels distinctly unnatural and messy, almost like it was just improvised by a bunch of people in the woods...

I mean, where were Brad Pitt, Gweneth Paltrow, and Kevin Spacey for God's sake! These guys wander off in the woods, cussing and swearing (I mean, who does this anymore?!) They're trapped in the woods for several days, hungry, tired, scared to death....but all they can do is complain and cry about it! I mean come on, give us a break! And this whole time that someone's ""there"" scaring them, nothing happened to make me jump out of my seat! I didn't even get gored out, considering no one even got chopped to bits! I really feel cheated, because I actually had to think with this movie! I actually had to use this crazy thing called an ""I-MAG-I-NA-TION"", and ponder what horrible fates these poor kids had. What a worthless hunk of garbage!!

"TOMASBBloodhound","Studio execs have to be pulling their hair out whenever this film is mentioned.","20 June 2005","Film-making can be quite an interesting business. Some would insist on calling it an art, and they would also be correct. But make no mistake: Making movies is a business. When you think about the mountain of money this little indie project made as opposed to the paltry sub-fifty thousand dollar budget it had, you almost have to laugh. Then consider some of the big budget bombs we've seen recently like Kingdom of Heaven, Alexander, and XXX State of the Union that have been nothing more than an epic waste of money. You'll see why sometimes a little originality can lead to a big payday.

The Blair Witch Project is essentially a bogus documentary about three young filmmakers who journey into the Maryland wilderness to investigate the legend of some gruesome goings-on. The group quickly finds themselves hopelessly lost, and at the mercy of god-knows what just past their line of vision in the surrounding foliage. The film is absolutely scary. You cannot deny that for one minute, but to think that anyone could have believed this is actual footage of three people meeting their demise is laughable. Apparently some people insist on believing it, though. You cannot deny the success of the technique. What we CANNOT see is often more scary than what is right in front of us in plain view.

What we have here is a triumph not of special effects and great casting, but a triumph of ideas and atmosphere. Why is it that almost every mainstream film in the past couple years has been a sequel, a remake, or something based on a comic book? Is it any wonder why the box office numbers have been down for 17 straight weeks??? To all studio execs out there: The public is tired of watching crap! We need more inspiration and more originality! And to the makers of The Blair Witch Project: This Hound solutes you! Great job! 8 of 10 stars.","8"

The effect is psychological, which, I think, is better than the standard slasher-type horror films we've been given in the past. You're never quite sure what is going on and this adds to the horror of the situation. Is it the witch? Is it a gang of rednecks? What is making the noise, and ultimately, leads to the disappearance of the three filmmakers? GO SEE IT NOW!","6"
"NEO_RAGE","Great movie!!!","1 August 1999","WOW!!! Great movie. Personally I did not find myself scared because I knew it was a movie but when we left the theatre last night their were about 10 traumatized girls their that could not even open their eyes to look at the credits so scared something else was going to happen. What makes this movie so good is that you do not have to see a skinny old one with a long nose to actually feel fear, the directors relied on letting your imagination create what the scary sounds were, unlike in the new ""the haunting"" were you saw all the scary things. The actors were great; they actual had emotions toward what was happening.

If you go and see this movie you can go in two ways in as viewing it. One this is just movie, there is never really anything out there that is going to hurt them and you know that this people are actual still alive at this very moment. Your result is a good movie that is quite interesting and intriguing. Viewing two going in thinking that this was real people put yourself in their place, believing that thing was happening to you and you end up with a movie that will probably scare the $#!^ out of you.

Closing analysis great movie worth the wait in live and worth the money. If you know that it is just a movie then it is not that scary if you can always keep that grip on reality then you are probably going to walk out crying clinging to a friends arm and stay up half the night wondering what that sound was coming from in the living room.

"itamarscomix","Mis-marketing in action","23 September 2011","The Blair Witch Project is an interesting mockumentary with an intriguing concept, that was the victim of many bad decisions, in the process of making it and especially of promoting it. The ambition, it seems, was to create an experimental art-house film that would appeal to mainstream audiences, and by marketing it as a 'horror' movie, create surprise and buzz. The attempt to bridge the gap between the two viewer groups was quite positive, but what it actually achieved is alienating both: the horror crowd was disappointed and annoyed, especially younger viewers who sneaked into an R rated movie expecting gore and heads-on horror; and the more sophisticated, avant garde crowd, turned off from day one by the film's promotion, didn't even bother to go see it.

A decade later, it's easier to put all that aside, as well as the internet-based hype generated by the producers at the time. The film can now be appraised as what it is, an exercise in experimental filmmaking, and an interesting one at that. It takes a lesson from the true great classics of horror - in that the fear of the unknown, the anxiety and anticipation of violence are much more effective than explicit violence in itself - and indeed, it's scarier than almost any horror movie created in the last twenty years, although the teenagers who usually go for that kind of movie will probably disagree. The Blair Witch Project creates tension and anxiety, and draws the viewer into the characters' world. And it doesn't matter one bit whether or not you think it might be real - in fact it's more impressive when you know that it's not.

Unfortunately, it doesn't achieve true greatness in that respect either. In its attempt to bridge between mainstream horror and experimental indie movie-making, the film reaches a sort of middle ground that isn't quite here nor there, not quite satisfying anybody. The Blair Witch Project is not a classic or a great film, nor will it ever be, but it should be watched by fans of independent and experimental cinema and of classic horror, and remembered as a brave and innovative experiment that didn't quite make it.","7"

I watched many people walk right out of the theater when it was released, and then when playing it for my family (they wanted to know what all the fuss was about) most quickly tired of it.

After having seen the trailer, I've been facinated by the movie and after having red a few things about it on the net, I was convinced that it would be the first movie ever to scare me up and the fitst horror movie to disturb me. Well, not at all. I don't think I've been scare more than ten seconds at all in the movie. But it's still a really great movie. I've been impressed by the cast performance, I felt the tension rising and I've loved all the dialogues, especially from Heather, witch provided pretty funny moments. However, I do get why people vomited in several teathers. It's not because of the emotional charge but because of the hand camera effets, always moving one side to the other, enought to give everybody who gets disturb in a simulator a nausea. Maybe that's what broke my trill. I was actually hoping the movie ends fast. I had to close my eyes every minutes for 10 seconds to make the nausea pass. Maybe it will be the first movie actually more trilling to watch on video.","8"
"MaggieAsh","Cool Movie, way out there","16 November 2006","I recently saw this movie and loved it solely because of the way it was filmed. I honestly don't think it was scary, except for the end which I SO won't tell, but if it had been filmed in another form besides with lousy cameras by a bunch of kids, the movie wouldn't have the same impact. It seemed so real because of that. I enjoyed it very much, but i think people have to look at it as a film acheivment rather than an actual motion picture.

People I know either laugh or shudder when I told them I was going to watch this movie, so I really didn't know what to expect. I had heard that it seemed so real from a few people that I really wanted to watch it. I don't scare easily, so I congratulate the makers of this movie for making me think and completely getting inside my head. Movies like this where you can not separate what is fake from what is really going on never cease to amaze me.

If you liked this movie, rent The Exorcist, too...the only other movie I've ever been scared of.","10"
"swilliky","Chilling, birthed a sub-genre of horror and made lots of dough","16 September 2016","The chilling faux documentary haunted me as a child and still spooked me today as a sequel opens up in theaters seventeen years from the original's release. The movie is filmed with hand-held cameras operated by three film students purported to have disappeared in the Maryland woods with only this footage to surface sometime later. Even though their fates are sealed viewers may fear the plight of the two young men and a woman who become lost rather fast and then are slowly driven insane by a stalking presence that visits them in the night and leaves horrifying gifts outside their tent.

Heather Donahue plays herself as the lead documentarian. She convinces Josh Leonard and Michael C. Wiliams to venture out into the woods after interviewing the locals and hearing all sorts of terrifying stories. Heather insists for some time that they are not lost though both Michael and Josh know they are. On the second night out in the woods all sorts of terrible sounds can be heard but the team can't capture any of it on film.

The horrors grow and the rough shaky angles of the camera only add to the confusion and terror. The dread increases to dramatic as the characters all grow more frustrated and turn on each other. Directors Daniel Myrick and Eduardo Sanchez know how to draw out the dread and only give viewers a glimpse of the strange occurrences, but a glimpse is all that is needed to generate the fear to make this movie a smashing success. On the tiny, for a film, budget of $60,000, it managed to gross $248.6 million.

"jordan-24","no sleep","4 August 1999","Overall I thought it was a good movie, different of course, and a brilliant concept of taking the three actors and putting them in a situation that they would have to basically improv. However, the thought was always in my mind that it was not real. If I had thought it was a true story, I never would have slept again! And I know I will think about this movie next time I am camping. But as I watched this movie, I would try to put myself in the students' shoes for a second, and I was scared out of my mind, especially at the end. I really enjoyed the beginning parts of the movie that lead up to the three kids going into the woods...not only were their funny parts but it seemed like it was real at the same time. The original idea of this movie is what I like the most about it. If you are a person that gets easily frightened whether it's a real story or not, expect to look over shoulder for a while after you see the Blair Witch Project. If you don't get easily frightened, even this movie will make you think twice about going into the woods again.",NA

Well-deserved kudos to all involved because it did truly frighten me. I went to see this BY MYSELF on my 1/2 day off from work and, as Paula O'Keefe says in her user comment, I was *NOT* breathing during the tremendous final ten minutes (quote/un-quote). I found myself holding my breath, seriously, during the whole last climax, which I believe was longer than ten minutes and I had to remind myself to physically breathe.

I found this film terrifying because it left everything up to my imagination. I do not consider myself creative, but when it comes to imagination for horror, I guess I have it! I must agree with Rick Peach's user comment of ""The last shot of this film will be stuck in my head for years to come"" because it will be; it truly will be. When I finally remembered the story and figured out why the last shot was done the way it was, BINGO ... I had trouble sleeping that night and I did have nightmares, I hate to admit!

"virek213","Horror And/Or Hype?","13 May 2003","THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT is one of those films that made history by shooting to the top of the box office while being made on a very paltry budget of just $40,000. It also benefitted from all the hype surrounding its story of a group of teens who venture into the desolate Maryland woods to find out if the legend of the Blair Witch is fact or fiction. As a result, this film went on to gross $130 million during the late summer of 1999.

But while the premise of the story and the inventive ""Shaky-Cam"" work of the filmmakers suggest a very chilling and suspenseful film, I am only able to give this film a '6' rating out of 10.

The reason? Even for $40,000, you think it would be easier for filmmakers Eduardo Myrick and Daniel Sanchez to come up with a better use of dialogue than you'd get in an average teen-slasher pic. The pacing of the film is unquestionably inventive, and the atmosphere, the further the teens venture into the woods, begins to resemble John Boorman's 1972 classic DELIVERANCE. The stick figures used as the signs of the Blair Witch's presence (the witch herself, in a thoroughly brilliant move, is never, ever seen) are also good; and the lack of explicit gore is quite refreshing. But the dialogue is so profanity-ridden that it gets tired after a while. It is worse than any of the screaming done by the film's lead heroine (Heather Donahue) or her ""I'm-so-scared""-by flashlight scene.

Unlike a lot of people, I wouldn't call THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT an overhyped low-budget disaster; in terms of premise, it more than lives up to the hype. Even the acting of this amateur group is worth sitting through. But unlike others, because of the dialogue (the one and ONLY reason this film has its 'R' rating at all), I can't quite call it a masterpiece. Still, it is a worthy film, if frustratingly uneven.","6"

""Yeah people are getting motion sickness because the camera work is shaky."" Whatever, I thought, some people are wimps. Until the movie started. Because the screen was so big and the image so jumpy I seriously had to concentrate to keep from vomiting. I had to take deep breaths like after I've drank too much. Anyway the movie had some scary moments, but nothing that made me believe all the hype......until the end, needless to say, my friends and I were all scared by the ending. It's

ambiguous, but it's so freaking cool. When I got home I was scared until I had all the lights on, and my friends were with me!!

However, as fear and paranoia grabbed a hold of the characters, these people became increasingly less interesting.

The acting was surprisingly good for a low-budget flick, and the story wasn't too bad, but there was nothing chilling or scary about this movie.

"raymond-15","Spmewhat scary as the tension builds","22 April 2002","In a forest near the village once called Blair there lived a witch, or so it was rumoured by the old folk. A young girl Heather decides to do a project on the subject and investigate the myth at close hand. Two guys Mike and Josh agree to join her and they set off in a car with backpacks and camping equipment, map, compass and all the necessary gear. It's going to be a load of fun out there in the forest...or so they thought.

According to the prologue the film we see has been put together from film footage found in their discarded cameras.

Admittedly the end product is a documentary with an original approach, but it does not prove or disprove anything. The jerky camera work does provide clues that something is going on...voices in the night...little heaps of stones appearing outside the tent which were not there the night before (or were they?)... rocks in a strange nest of twigs perched in a tree...strange mobiles fashioned out of tree branches swinging in the breeze...and is somebody watching them as they wander further in to the forest? A witch....maybe?

The scary atmosphere builds up after they lose their map and they decide to go south using only the compass. Cold, hungry...they seem to be going in circles...then Josh disappears into the blackness of the night!

The film is more about human relationships as in their desperation they squabble amongst themselves. Tension builds. They are all at screaming point. They are truly lost!

The whole film plays on the imagination of the viewer. If you are nervous and imaginative you are ready to accept the various perils that beset them. But all the dangers are suggested. We don't see any witch. There are no visible intruders. It's all in the mind.

When the writers ran out of ideas, they have Mike and Heather finding and exploring a broken down cottage. In a fit of hysteria their cameras are dropped and continue running until the batteries cut out. This brings the film to a sudden and abrupt ending.

But was there really a witch out there? That, dear viewer, is for you to decide!","7"

What caught my eye was not only the movie, but the audience members whom I sat next too. They were abosoltuely captivated by this movie. As I was. I haven't been this scared for a long time. Usually movies that are of the ""suspense"" genre are all to predictable. But Blair Witch Project had twist after twist. I felt so sorry for those three out in the middle of the Maryland woods, far from food, far from water, and from hope. I actually left the movie shaking after the climatic end, that in my opinion was perfectly written, and shot. I won't spoil anything thing for those of you that havent seen BWP, but I highly suggest this for those of you that loved to have your very soul scared by this movie.

Having heard both good and bad things about it, I didn't know what to expect when I finally watched it. I should have saved my money. This movie basically drops three obnoxious film students into the woods under the premise that they are going to solve the mystery of the legendary Blair witch. Heather, the only female in the group, was loud, obnoxious and very pushy-her major talent seemed to be screaming at the top of her lungs every time she heard a twig snap. The other two, particularly Josh, seem to be little more than stoners whose primary preoccupations are with smoking cigarettes and using one particularly charming expletive repeatedly.

There was lots of talk about this being actual thing that had really happened. Yeah. Right. But funny thing was, that some people really did buy that.

So, concept was in order and I even saw this in a theatre with a friend. It wasn't half as good as it was claimed to be. Acting was poor, writing was even worse and direction was non existing. It all was just stuff, that anyone, and I really mean anyone could film with their own home video cameras, as it actually was done with this. The basic difference here is, that someone succeeded in marketing this outside ""Americas Funniest Home Videos"".

So in summary, silly kids running around in ""woods"" while the scariness factor of the flick runs somewhere between ""Sesame Street"" and ""Winnie the Pooh""","3"
"AstroMan-3","Innovative, intelligent, and deeply disturbing.","2 August 1999","This movie is one of the few that I have seen which left me feeling unnerved. Many of the scenes and ideas in the movie will creep up on you as you are about to drift off to sleep in bed and jerk you into an alert frenzy to find a nightlight. This movie managed to keep things moving and slowly turn a hike in the woods into a life and death struggle with the unknown. You can be sure that after seeing it will generate a great deal of thought and discussion with your friends. One of my friends that I saw this movie with had to sit there until the ""All events in this movie are fictitious and any resemblance to real stuff is completely coincidental"" message appeared on the screen. She said eve though she new it wasn't real before she saw it, she had to make sure after seeing it because she couldn't go to sleep if it was real. I think that captures my feelings entirely. In conclusion... SEE THIS MOVIE!","10"
"jaschall-68083","One of my favorites!","6 November 2022","I feel that the people who gave this movie a 1 star review really missed some important things that tie the movie together. I was reading one review and they described the plot, ending with ""the last scene shows him trying to look scared into the camera.

One, the main character is a she? Two, evidently you weren't paying close attention. In the ending chaos, you can see one of her friends who supposedly disappeared standing in the corner in the basement, facing the wall. Then our main character drops the camera.

At the very beginning of the movie when they are interviewing locals, the old lady who seems to know the most about the legend tells a story that goes something like this. ""There used to be a serial killer up in the woods, who would kidnap and murder kids. People say that he would kidnap them in PAIRS, take them down to his BASEMENT, then make one of them face the WALL while he murdered the other. Supposedly, he couldn't bear to have them looking at him when he killed the other, because he felt their eyes watching him forever if he did.""

When the main characters are running through the house terrified and screaming, you can see hundreds of small, bloody handprints on the walls, suggesting this is the house where the killer lived. Now does it make more sense?","10"
"eibon09","Over-rated and Amateurish","28 February 2000","The Blair Witch Project was the worst movie and most hyped up film of 1999. The concept was original, but unfortunately the execution of this concept was badly done. One reason why I thought BWP was bad is that It seem as the movie was made for fun and that they weren't planning to be filmmakers at all. This change as soon as the film made money and this gave them the idea to direct again. The success of this movie reminds me of Mel Brooks's The Producers where a play(Spring Time For Hitler)became a surpise success. Another reason this wasn't good is the lack of artistic vision(that is it seems like there wasn't anything put into this film at all by the directors.

The shack at the end of the movie reminded me of the Freudstein House in The House by the Cemetery(maybe the three college kids were killed not by The Blair Witch but by Dr. Freudstein). The Blair Witch Project is not as scary as many people would lead others to believe, and it does not contain anything that is scary(rocks found in piles, Twigs formed in shapes, people arguing, and footage of people losing their mind is not my idea of a scary movie). The actors in the film behave as escapees from an Insane Asylum. I found that this movie is not as enjoyable as the supernatural thrillers of Mario Bava{The Mask of Satan(1960), Kill, Baby, Kill(1967), and The Whip and The Body(1966)], the surreal films of Dario Argento{Suspiria(1977), and Inferno(1980)], and the gothic/zombie epics of Lucio Fulci{Zombie(1979), The Gates of Hell(1980), The Beyond(1981), and The House by the Cemetery(1981)]. I prefer the cinema of Italian horror to The Blair Witch Project as they are filled with spectacular gore, great camera movement, interesting music, terrific atmosphere, and lots of pizzazz(Things that BWP completely lacks). What annoys me is that people have already start to compare the film-makers to Alfred Hitchcock which is silly as HE IS THE MASTER while they are the students.","3"

Worst movie I've ever saw!","31 October 2020","I spent about an hour and a half sitting around in my living room on halloween waiting for something...anything to happen. Just when I thought it was coming to the big climax at the end in the house, nothing happens....big surprise.

This movie is a complete waste of time..there is nothing scary about it unless you find filming shots of the woods, watching swearing teens, listening to a high pitched annoying girl voice (that was pretty scary), watching film from inside a tent with cheap sound effects playing outside, or watching a wobbly camera run through the woods at night (cant see anything), then you should skip this movie. If I was out in the middle of the woods, I too would decide to throw away my only way of finding my way around..my map. This movie had a weak, if any plot. This movie was one of the biggest let downs I have ever seen, and I've seen ""Batman and Robin.""

But what WAS scary about this film was the way that each of the characters gradually (and with much realism) got more frightened, and started to lose it (also the ending was scary-wow!). That was the scary aspect that the film was trying to show. But as I've realized, people either like this movie or hate it, which my friend did when we saw it. Plus, many of the people in the theater were also upset after the viewing of the movie. I'm just glad that other people agree with me that this film was a great one!!! 10/10","10"
"cameo-5","fantastic horror movie","20 July 1999","This is probably the best horror movie I have ever seen -- and I've seen quite a few. (In fact, a rewatched The Birds a few weeks ago, which, until now, was my favorite horror film.) The documentary style is clever; it moves the story along and helps us see things through the characters eyes. The tension builds from nothing to extreme. The fear it arouses comes entirely from that tension -- we never see what is out there, and there are no cheap scares from sudden surprises.

I found this film to be totally engrossing. My impression, moreover, is that everyone else in the full theater felt the same way. I don't know if I've ever been in a movie theater that was so quite during and after a film.

The only negative aspect of this experience for me (like someone else who posted comments here) is that it actually left me feeling queasy. I think that was because of the jerky cameras. But this is not intended to be criticism -- doing the film in fake, amateur style was great; it's just a warning that you might not want to eat a lot before or during the movie.","10"
"Oberly_1","Bleh","12 January 2015","There have been many other 'found footage' movies since BWP, some really good, most terrible and cheap, and perhaps BWP was exciting on first release. But all I can say, after seeing this recently for the first time, after seeing many better found footage movies, is that 'this movie blows'. It is so terrible and annoying that I had a difficult time sitting through it.

It may have been the 'first', but it does not hold up in any way to its descendants. And I found its narrator one of the most annoying characters in film history. I give it two stars, probably one more than it deserves.","2"

"TinnyPhilly","Kind of like getting lost while backpacking...","3 August 1999","Watching Blair Witch Project was kind of like getting lost while backpacking--a little creepy, but mostly frustrating and boring.

"Frag God","Best way to prepare yourself to watch this movie","4 August 1999","I saw this movie at the midnight show of opening night. Unfortunately, everyone else in town had heard of it too, so the theater was sold out. Although it was not actually ""scary"", I really enjoyed watching this movie. It was the most suspenseful film I have seen in a very long time... if not ever.

So anyway, here are some tips I believe would make the viewing of this film as enjoyable as possible.

1. Go when there are the fewest other people around. This probably involves going during the day or afternoon. The fewer people in the room with you to distract you by lauging/coughing/answering cell phones the better. The crowded theater effect does not help in this case, it hurts it. The feeling of isolation and being lost are what you're going for.

2. Try not to anticipate what is going to happen. Don't try to fit in the short clips from the previews and figure out where you think it's headed. Just let the movie lead you along.

3. Sit near the front of the theater. The sound only came out of the front row of speakers in the room I was in, so it was often hard to hear what was being said from where I was in the back. The volume is not very loud to begin with, because it is realisticly recorded from the videocamera's microphone.

4. Have an open mind. This is not a regular movie. There are absolutely no computer generated graphics to awe at. There are no giant explosions or shootouts. The greatness of this movie is in the realism of the scripting and the acting. Consider it a work of art, something that belongs in a film festival and somehow escaped.

5. Make it real in your mind. There seems to be much controversy over how much of this movie is based on real events. Most of the information available on the web indicates that it contains real footage. The disclaimer at the end of the credits states that it is entirely fiction, although probably for legal purposes. The bottom line is, the more real you make it in your head, the more intense and thus more entertaining it will be. Just get it in your head before the film starts that everything you see really happened/is happening as you watch it. You will have as much of a look of agony and fear on your face as the characters on the screen!

6. Go to the bathroom before you the movie starts. I don't know how long this movie is, but it seemed to fly by. This movie builds its suspense slowly and just keeps growing the longer it goes on. You don't want to be interrupted for anything.",NA
"Bogmeister","Here we go, a walkin' in the woods","22 July 2005","By now, everyone and their grandma has heard about this super-cheap project that ended up making millions upon millions in the summer of '99. Now it's out on video and that's where it really belongs: it was mostly shot on HI8 Video, with some 16mm film. Watching it, especially the beginning (before the 3 characters go into the woods), I am reminded of similar video footage I took on a couple of past road trips; you know what I mean? - stuff taken from a moving car; people walkin' around not really doing anything. The difference is, of course, I didn't make $140+ million off of my stuff. Silly me. As a film, it's a mixed bag. The 1st 20 or so minutes, as I mentioned, are nothing more than a boring home movie. But then, the tension starts to mount - and I'm not really sure why: is it the jerky hand-held camera movement? The 'real world' sound effects? After all, one is supposedly watching real stuff, not a make-believe reel movie. That was the whole hook of the project - the thing that drew so many people to it (I believe the technique is called 'cinema verite' - a French term for realism). And, true to form, the film doesn't really 'end' - it just stops. There are no spelled-out answers in the end, forcing audiences to make their own conclusions (I did). But, also in the end, I don't think this will take its place among classics such as Night of the Living Dead[68] or even The Evil Dead[81], because the thing's a triumph of marketing, not cult horror. It's clever, it's creepy, it's unique. But it's a manipulation designed to draw grosses, not gross out people in a new exciting way (the R rating is for foul language). OK, I bought the DVD.","6"
"TwzzlrFrk","Terrifying!","17 August 1999","""The Blair Witch Project"" is in an incredibly original film and extremely well done. It avoids the cheesiness of other horror movies yet maintains the great nightmarish elements. When I went to see it everyone in the audience moaned after the movie was finished, most likely disgusted with the ending. I'm sure this was only so because people have grown accustomed to blood and guts and goo - the physical aspects of horror. ""The Blair Witch Project"" doesn't bother to utilize the physical elements, but rather take a different approach which appears much classier and to me makes the film come out better than any other horror film could. If you would like to see a classy, extremely well done horror film that will leave you dreaming nightmares for a fortnight, you should definitely see this movie. If you want to view a cheesy, unintelligent, gruesome horror film that would basically have the same effect - stay away from this movie. The choice is yours. I give it an 8 out of 10.","8"
"famousgir1","Too Much Hype.","17 September 2001","When I first saw The Blair Witch Project, when it was released at the cinema, like most people out there, I was quite excited to see it. I'm a big movie lover and there was so much hype (Too much, I think.) about this movie, you just had to see it. Critics and audiences, loved it and there were articles about The Blair Witch everywhere. So, when I saw it, it was completely different to what I expected. I thought it was going to be this brilliant movie and it just wasn't. I would say it was original though, but not scary. Maybe, I would of enjoyed it more, if it wasn't so hyped up. Let's just say even the sequel was MUCH better this.",NA
"movieguy1021","The Blair Witch Project: 6/10","9 October 2002","When my brother was coming home from visiting relatives on an airplane, he overheard a college student who saw this movie. She said that afterwards, they were so scared nobody wanted to go out for gas. Well, the movie wasn't that scary.

Something that I liked is that they didn't need Conrad Baker or anyone to do the camera work, the three principal actors (Heather Donahue, Joshua Leonard, Michael Williams) did almost all of it themselves. Heather, Josh, and Michael (the actors's names are the same in the movie) team up for a documentary about a ""blair witch"", who supposadely haunts the woods in Burkettsville, Maryland. After intervewing townspeople, they get off to the woods.

It seems that what TBWP is more about is the three amateur directors and their relationships towards each other. They have ""cabin fever"", so to speak, from being around each other for so long. But, they do find mysterious things outside of their tent after each morning- piles of rocks, for instance. They hear things that go bump in the night and try chase whatever's making the noise.

Soon, the map is lost, in an obvious turn of events. They walk for 15 hours to end up in the same location. There was fear all throughout the movie; mild amount during the day (especially when they see the famous symbols), and moderate during the night. I was truly creeped at the end. I did see this before, on FX, and I was scared at the end. Although the ending is obvious, I do like that style of ending.

If you're looking for a horor film where bloody ghosts pop out and cut your head off, take another one. Nothing is seen here; a couple times, the screen is completly blank except for a couple camera lines at the bottom. The editing was very poor, but I guess they're excuse for that is because it's a ""home movie"". The actors were OK, but I understand why they haven't done anything else. So, if you want to be creeped out for most of the time, rent The Blair Witch Project.

My rating: 6/10

I am also surprised that the 3 leads haven't had more success. With such a big film behind them - the highest grossing in North American sales from the smallest budget, these 3 leads should have offers tripping over them.

"EmperorNortonII","Cult Classic Or Put-On?","24 April 2004","Not many movies have caused as much of a sensation as ""The Blair Witch Project."" Shot on a shoestring budget, this movie was supposedly a documentary shot by doomed film students. The movie spawned a huge number of parodies, especially since it was shot on video, making it easy for amateurs to produce their own spoof. Many filmgoers believed the story to be real! The filmmakers tried to carry on that belief, creating their own mythology and history. But personally, I was not impressed. I'd say this movie's not for everyone. You may see what all the fuss is about, or you may not. I'd say that as a cult classic, it's an acquired taste.","6"

"rasmus-9","Very original... (possible spoilers)","21 April 2000","Before I saw this, I heard that this movie was supposed to be one of the scariest movies ever. So when I sat down with the movie, I was expecting a pretty scary movie.

I think the movie is very original with the actors running around with the camera themselves and with no music of any kind.

If I didn't know this was movie, I would have thought that this was real.

In many ways this is truly a very scary movie. It's not shocking like your average Scream or Elm Street movie, but every minute of the movie has a very eerie feeling about it.

It's just a shame, that some of the things in the movie is down right stupid. Firstly, if they lost the map, why didn't they just look at the filmed material where they actually filmed the map, it was clearly enough so you could navigate around with it. And throwing away the map was pretty stupid too, but that's a whole other thing.

Secondly, the witch's (or whatever it was) ""spell"" couldn't possibly reach the whole forest. At some point they (if they hadn't changed directions, and stopped all the time) would have been far enough away to avoid the spell and get out of the forest.

And another thing, it's pretty odd that Heather kept filming every time something scary was happening (like when the children attacked their tent). If I were attacked by something in the middle of the night I think I would do something else than film the whole damn thing.

But apart from that, I think that this was a great movie. I really sat on the edge of my seat at many points (which doesn't happen very often).

I highly recommend this movie.

I rate this movie 8 out of 10","9"
"ltamburello","The Scary Movie That Wasn't.","1 August 1999","Perhaps my expectations were too high. Perhaps the anticipation was too attenuated. Perhaps someone switched reels in the projector room before the movie started. The main problem with the film, IMHO, is that the characters are just plain dumb. They realize, albeit too late, that it's time to forsake their film project and haul ass out of the woods. Like the characters, the audience is presented only with circumstantial evidence of supernatural events. I guess this was supposed to heighten the tension, but instead with each passing ""occurrence"" the characters simply plod ahead with their little film, making them pathetic figures. For example, if one of your three-person crew suddenly disappeared without rhyme or reason one morning, would you think that he would signal his return by making muffled grunts in the pitch black dead of night? Would you then call his name and turn on a bright camera light so whatever's out there could more easily find you? Please.

Although Heather has a touch of Ahab-like singlemindedness, the other two are stock characters who are content to follow her search for the white whale.. er, witch.

"lucash42-1","Groundbreaking...in a sense","11 December 2008","I was 16 when the Blair Witch Project came out on the big screen. At this time, it was the talk of the over-populated high school I attended. So one Friday night, I asked my girlfriend if she wanted to see it, she tentatively agreed. Once in our seats, many people around us were laughing and joking about the story, and what to expect.

A man came in from the side door, and put both of his arms in the air in an attempt to quiet the young audience. He was an employee of the cinema and he began to speak with an incredible tone of seriousness.

""Everyone please keep all of you're talking to a minimum, and please silence your pagers(cell phones weren't owned by many at this point). He said. ""This is a true story of these three young adults, and of how they lost their lives in a very tragic way."" With that, he exited.

The hecklers were reduced to a minority, and it seemed as if no one spoke for quite some time. There was an uneasiness in the air that both myself and my girlfriend felt. Suddenly she leaned over and whispered in my ear.

""Come on let's go see something else..."" Before she could even finish her sentence, the lights died down, and the story began. We sat, glued to our seats, as it unfolded in such a way that you could barely tear your eyes away, and if you did, you were fearful that you would miss something vital.

At this point, I was totally convinced that what I was witnessing was real. There was no room in my mind for doubt or logic, and the employee that spoke up in the beginning took care of that.

The Blair Witch Project concluded, and I could never be more content with a movie after the first viewing. Normally I would focus on flaws, continuity, and the ever so popular question, ""Why didn't they just..."" At 16 years old, I had found the first movie that scared the hell out of me.

"PIST-OFF","Deliverence meets Man Bites Dog","13 September 1999","Blair Witch Project may be one of the more inventive ideas to come to the big screen in a long time. It takes a lost in the woods struggle of Deliverence, a slasher film premise and films it in a style so much like Man Bites Dog that the film makers had to have seen Man Bites Dog. There are cetin key elements however to watching the movie with optimum veiwing pleasure. One of those is the whole marketing campaign built around it, especially the sci fi channel special. Secondly I had seen this movie twice in the theaters, once in an art house theater on opening night and the second time in a giant super plex. The movies scariness is tripled by seeing it in a small very private theater, it adds to the real feeling of the movie. Seeing it in an auditorium with people munching on pop corn and teenagers talking detracts infinetly from it's feeling of reality that the makers tried to aim for. Substantial amounts of credit need to go to the film makers for their filming techniques. Such as not filling in the actors on all the plot details. Brilliant but partial inadvertant acting from the actors make this movie feel as though you could have filmed it yourself. One other thing that sets this movie apart is that there are no big shocks in it, the scariness of it all comes from letting the imagination get way ahead of you. See it with Man Bites Dog and compare the numerous similarities. Give it an 8 out of 10",NA

(The person I saw the film with had to be reassured the movie was fiction) The pacing may lag in spots, but it only serves to heighten the suspense and tension.

There's not really a plot or story in the movie, it's just basically a videotape recording of the events that took place during the project. The movie was a bit intriguing, but the problem is it's not very exciting or thrilling and this is probably the main reason why other people dislike the movie. That wasn't an issue for me though as I was still interested in the movie to see what will happen in the end. I didn't find the movie scary, however although I knew the movie was fictional, at times it felt real with some of the paranormal activities and the dialogue which is a credit to the actors.

On second watch many years later, not as much only because I know you don't see anything. But that's what made this movie so riveting when first watching it in a theater. You're in the woods with them, you don't know what's making those sounds, what's playing with their minds. Sometimes not knowing what's there is scarier than knowing. I personally loved this movie. It's original, it's raw, and it shows what can be done with a super low budget. Not everything needs to be scripted with special effects and CGI. Sometimes simply being in the woods at night with an unseen mennace is enough. Great movie.","8"
"syaofsjc","Don't let the hype ruin it for you!","31 July 1999","I saw this movie the night it opened nationwide, after weeks of the biggest hype since the second Austin Powers movie. When the lights went up, I saw people all around me scoff at the so-called ""scariest movie ever made"" and even my companion said it was a ""let down."" Which is unfortunate, because ""the hype"" is forcing comparisons that shouldn't be made and turning attention away from the true brilliance of this film.

I am annoyed with reviewers who compare this movie to The Exorcist or The Shining. You simply cannot compare movies with huge Hollywood budgets with a movie made with two cameras and next to zero budget. Don't fall into that trap. This is not like any movie you have ever seen and that's what impressed those who saw it before the hype and drove them to create the hype.

This movie separates those with imagination from those who do not. If you are someone who scares yourself by thinking about horror films after you have walked out of the theater, than this movie will creep you out for days to come. The filmmakers didn't have the money for special effects and they resist the urge to give in to standard horror movie cliches. This movie presents a terrifying scenario and asks its audience to take the terror to the next level. How far are you willing to let your imagination take you? If you are not sure, you will know after you see this movie by your reaction to it. If you need special effects, blood and gore or things popping up on the screen to make you jump in order to enjoy a scary movie, this film is not for you. But if you can put yourself out in the woods, lost, with people you don't know very well, hungry, scared and tormented by something you can't see (but can hear), then you will find this movie full of creepy thoughts and images that give your mind just enough to torment you with a sleepless night or two.

Also, I highly recommend the website (blairwitch.com). It provides cool background info and interviews not seen in the movie. And, if you are like me, you'll probably start freaking yourself out before you even see the movie.

When you think about what the filmmakers had to work with and what they created, you will be astounded and impressed by this film. Since it is impossible to avoid the hype, try not to let it manipulate you into expecting something this film was never meant to be.

Bottom line: creepy, suspenseful and full of ammunition for a fertile imagination! Great movie!",NA

"AKS-6","Not scary -- spooky","29 January 2000","I'm quite surprised here since I liked this film. I'm not saying it's a masterpiece or the ""scariest film ever made"" because it's not. However, I found it quite spooky. I didn't jump or anything, but when you think about how these people must have felt out in the woods and if you have any imagination at all, it's got to be at least a little bit spooky. I found ""The Blair Witch Project"" to be quite fascinating and interesting. The madness of it all is what drives the film forward not the question whether there is a witch or not. And thank you very much, for there not being any ""scary"" witch seen in the film. I hate the skeleton in ""Hellraiser"", I hate the monsters in ""In the Mouth of Madness"" and ""The Faculty"", I hate Jason in ""Friday the 13th"" What you see is not always what makes a film scary or not, it's where your imagination leads you that makes a film scary or spooky. Now, some of you will have that kind of imagination that makes you not see the spookiness in this film (nothing wrong with that) and others will have the kind of imagination that will make them think this is the scariest fim they have ever seen (and I envy those people). I'm stuck in between, but I have to admit that I enjoyed the film and it was much better than I expected it to be since no one I know have liked it. I would probably give this film a 6 out of 10 because I think it deserved it. What I didn't understand, though, was the ending. I figured that ""now it begins -- the *scary* parts"" and then it just ended. Spooky, not scary. (I saw ""Forces of Nature"" as well today, and I have to admit it, after having seen that disgrace of a film even ""See No Evil, Hear No Evil"" [Sorry, Kevin Spacey, :-)] would have been a great film, so maybe that's why I found BWP quite entertaining.)","7"

It's one of my favourite horror films and one of my favourite films of all time :) you have to watch it :) but please if you watch this and think the sequel will just be as good. Think again the sequel is awful. Nothing like this. There is no special effects what makes the film more realistic. You don't see the witch. Which in my opinion is better as your imagination goes wild to think what actually the witch looks like. I hear they are making a new Blair witch sometime this year or the next but I don't know and it will never match up to this perfect original horror film. Please take your time to watch and do not talk through it as you need to listen to the film. :)","10"

On both occasions I loved it, and at the same time was extremely scared in many moments. The acting throughout this film, considering the lack of experience, is vey impressive. As well as this, something about it being shot on a low quality camera makes it much more intimidating. Must watch for all horror fans.",NA
"chrisbrown6453","There is no question that The Blair Witch Project is unlike any other film you're likely to see this year. With an eerie realness to it, the movie takes you on a journey with three young people to find out t","18 July 2001","Heather, Michael and Josh all head out into the woods to do a documentary on the legend of the Blair Witch. They interview some townspeople, get some background, and then go into the woods. What was supposed to be a weekend trip to film some footage turns into their worst nightmare. One year after they disappear, their footage is found, buried in an abandoned burned out house.

The best thing about this movie is the ability to blend reality and fiction. There isn't a person in this country that hasn't heard of this movie, but how many people believe it's true? Did these three kids really disappear 5 years ago, or is this only make believe? From an impressive web site, to a special on the Sci-Fi Network, to just an amazing underground buzz, the line between truth and reality is blurred almost to the point of non-existence. Never has there been a movie with so much effort put into building a huge back-story leading into the actual film. Was there a Blair Witch? Was she really sent into the woods to die? Did children mysteriously disappear? Who killed 7 children in an old house? Is any of it real?

Watching the film, you really felt like you were just watching a friends home movies (other than the fact that most friends home movies aren't edited and partly shot on 16mm black and white film). No steadicams, no special lighting, and most of the time, no script; just three kids out in the woods having the most terrifying time of their life. The movie showed, very well I might add, all three of them go from fun loving documentary artists, to three people slowly losing their minds. The movie builds very slowly to a very creepy and frightening climax.

The buzz for Blair Witch has been astounding, and while mainstream American might be hoping for more after all the hype, this movie definitely has all the chills and thrills a good old-fashioned horror movie needs. No slashers with knives on their fingers, no one wearing a mask, just good mental horror. While it didn't completely live up to the hype, it was a great showcase for young, hardworking filmmakers to see how you can make a great film by having a good story, good young actors, and a belief that the movie you're making is going to be great.","9"
"koltonbrett","Unique and Effectively Chilling For Its Time","10 January 2022","Cold, hungry, lost and hunted. This movie proves that you don't need scary visuals or a big budget to make a really good horror film. The situation alone makes this movie unnerving. The hopelessness and desperation of these characters is felt. Knowing upfront that these 3 characters are not getting out of the woods, produces a fair amount of dread as we wait to see how it all goes wrong. The found footage format makes this feel raw and real and you can't help but put yourself in the situation and wonder what you would do. Made for less than $1,000,000 and earning close to $250,000,000, this movie is right up there with 2009's Paranormal Activity for best ever movie investment.","8"
"bat-5","Things that go bump in the night.","4 August 1999","One of the best things about The Blair Witch Project is the fact that you have to use your imagination. You are out in the middle of nowhere, and there are noises moving all around you in the dark. You can't see anything, you only hear things. And that's what scares you the most. If it's something you can see, you'll think of a way to deal with it. If you don't see it, you don't know what to do. So you become scared. Fear starts to overwhelm you and clouds your thinking. That's what this movie does. You have to use your imagination and put yourself in these kids shoes. There aren't any monsters to blow up, no ghosts to run away from, no houses to escape from. Everything around you has turned into something frightening. The Blair Witch Project is a movie that relies on the gradual building of suspense rather than the usual horror movie tricks. If you scoff, try going camping in an unfamiliar place and see if you can figure out what's going bump in the night.","8"
"vicdru","The Ghost and Mr. Chicken was more frightening!","16 May 1999","The Blair Witch Project is being called one of the scariest movies ever by more than one person I know. Quite frankly, I was practically bored to sleep. The story idea is really great but the photography (video camera bouncing all over the place), the 'effects' and the acting (I was praying the Witch would get the woman just to shut her up) certainly leave something to be desired. I'd say the scariest part of the movie was trying to determine whether I should tell friends about it or not!","2"
"DavidSim240183","Flawed but fascinating","8 November 2005","I remember how excited I was when I first heard about the Blair Witch Project. The idea of a horror film seen through the eyes of a video camera was an intriguing prospect to me. Not to mention unique in this day and age of slasher films. And although it has it's failings, the Blair Witch Project provides good, solid entertainment.

The three heroes of the piece Heather, Josh and Mike go off to the woods of Maryland to film a documentary about the Blair Witch. The film makes the wise choice of lulling you into a false sense of security. The opening scenes are light and comical, such as interviews with the townspeople, and witty banter between the trio.

But then things start to turn ominous when Heather & Co lose their way. They can't seem to get out of the woods, and what's worse, they are not alone. Someone or something, is stalking them. When they're camped out in the middle of the night, they are certain they can hear noises from outside. Noises that are gradually getting closer to them. Weird objects are left outside their campsite. The map goes missing. Josh disappears. And so on.

The fact that the BWP is seen through a camera gives a heightened sense of realism to the proceedings. But personally, what I found to be more effective was the way the three of them gradually come apart on each other. Heather's obsession with continuing to record the events is counter-played with Josh blaming her for getting them lost. The camera closes on her face, teary-eyed, frightened and very upset.

Or the scene when Mike throws the map away and confesses. The anger from Heather is so profound it was almost painful to watch. And of course we can never forget the most famous scene when Heather records a final goodbye message. Again the camera is right in her face. She now fully expects to die. Because she so freely admits it, it becomes a very powerful and moving scene.

These are the scenes that makes a lasting impression. BWP is never exactly all out frightening, but it is very unnerving. The psychological impact afflicting our trio is much more effective. The ending is rather unusual, because it comes so quickly. Heather and Mike come across a house. They go in. And don't come back out. We never find out what happened to them. Or what was stalking them. This makes for an anti-climatic, but pulse-pounding ending at the same time.

Clocking in at a lean 79 minutes was a wise choice. It keeps events moving at a fair pace, and doesn't burn itself out with over-exposure. Those jerky camera movements would otherwise get tedious after a while. The Blair Witch Project is not without it's flaws, but it does leave a lasting impression, and will make you think twice before going off on any camping trips in the woods any time soon.","8"
"larken-98-527891","Scaring Yourself","5 July 2011","Allow me to offend some people by theorizing about the reason for the huge disparity in how people respond to the Blair Witch Project. Personally, I fell on the side that found it less scary, less interesting, and less exciting than watching grass grow.

People who have actually been in the woods before, and have some shred of self control, mental stability, and the ability to think rationally, will find it impossible to relate to the characters, and impossible to share in their terror. If, on the other hand, you were raised as a spoiled, emotional moron, whose experience of nature consists of occasionally flipping past the nature channel with your cable remote, the movie might scare you ... not because it's actually scary, or because anything actually happens in the movie, but because your own imagination might manage to scare you all by itself. To be blunt, I really cannot fathom any other reason for anyone to think this was a scary movie ... unless they have an extreme phobia of twigs tied together. Sorry.","1"

The film relies on the audience's imagination rather than expensive effects to scare the audience and is very successful. The audio in many scenes is absolutely chilling. This is a very well done and thought out film. Much better than the majority of the ""Horror"" movies churned out by Hollywood lately.

"PyrolyticCarbon","Scary, not quite, but disturbing and unnerving? Oh yeh, big time.","3 November 1999","You'll laugh. Now that's what surprised me the most, there are some bits where you really will laugh - I wonder if audiences did when they thought the whole thing was real? We even found ourselves laughing at the end, but that was totally different, a nervous uneasy laugh. The kind of laugh that hides the fact that you're scared to go home after the cinema and walk in the house on your own without any lights.

Go see this film, okay there's far too much hype, and there's far too many people rubbishing it for no real reason, but you have to see it. If you're a fan of psychological horror then this is for you, actually I don't think you can really use the word horror, psychological terror would be better.

The real disturbing thing was the way the ""fright"" sections were underplayed, add to that the strange feeling you got from eavesdropping on three people as their relationships falls apart and you've got a film that really messes with your head.

"Gafke","Genuinely Creepy","20 May 2005","Three young film students - Josh, Mike and Heather - pack up their filming equipment and head out to Burkittsville, Maryland on an autumn weekend to make a documentary about the Blair Witch, a local legend which continues to haunt the surrounding woods of the small town. The three strike out into the forest with their camping gear and are never seen again.

One year later, their film footage is recovered.

It's a great basis for a horror movie. What could be worse than actually finding a roll of film or two only to discover that, upon development, it contains the dark and horrible story of a missing persons last moments on earth? The hype surrounding this film was so well done that people still believe to this day that what they are seeing is real. And while the hype may have gone a tad overboard (I don't think, for instance, that this is the scariest movie EVER made) The Blair Witch Project is still a very good, well made pseudo-documentary/ horror movie.

Made with hand-held cameras and boasting no special effects whatsoever, Blair Witch takes us out into the middle of the dark and spooky woods and leaves us there with the three unfortunate college kids. It's kind of like being dropped into a particularly vicious retelling of Hansel and Gretel. Strange noises echo through the woods at night, the disturbing laughter of children can be heard and many odd and primitive symbols, made of sticks and resembling crude, miniature scarecrows, are left dangling in the trees for us to find. They are all keys to a mystery which only gets larger and more sinister as the film progresses. The threesome are soon lost and find themselves wandering around in circles, unable to escape from the cursed woods, and this, for me, is where the real horror of the film lies. It can happen and, witch or no, your imagination can conjure up any number of monsters out there in the darkness, heard but never seen, but all of them waiting to eat you. Josh, Heather and Mike begin to fall apart, turning on each other and just as quickly holding on to one another as the woods loom up and consume them.

Nothing is ever seen, no answers are given and the mystery surrounding the Blair Witch and the exact fate of the threesome is never solved. We are left to decide for ourselves if the stories are true and the evil rumored to be within the woods is real. The premise here is simple and the film itself very realistic. It's easy to see why it frightened so many people upon its release - at times, it's like watching a snuff film without the sex.

Gritty, well-acted and genuinely disturbing. People who suffer from motion sickness should probably avoid it, since the constantly jouncing camera IS rather nauseating. People tired of car chases, obligatory sex scenes and CGI monsters should check this out - it's a very cool throwback to the ghost stories told around campfires. Very well done.","8"

It is actually a good movie and i am sure i can actually enjoy it if the lead female role is not so annoying. Her bossy character, her whining high-pitched voice is really annoying.

The Blair Witch Project is possibly the most brilliantly marketed film of all time. The public was attracted to the ambiguity of the film trailer and website, as well as the insisting notion that the events occurred were in fact real. The film also revolutionized how many horror films slash their budget by going to hand-held cameras. It's never an ideal way of film-making,some movies can pull off a shaky camera, some can't, however the Blair Witch Project absolutely does. The big bug-ab-boo is the acting and dialogue are extremely monotonous. Characters are also unlikable at times.

Okay, okay, so spooky noises in the woods are not really scary in general, but what was kinda freaky 'bout this movie is how it seemed to capture reality and how a couple of people would really react to all this stuff happening. Personally, if I heard all those noises in the middle of some redneck woods (Especially the laughing/screaming children) I would sh*ttin' bricks. It shows the stages of denial, insanity, acceptance, fear, hatred, blame, and many others not necessarily in that order as these three emotionally different characters bumble through the woods trying to get a grip on reality. Until I noticed that this film was in fact written and directed by some guy, I thought this was the real deal. I had never heard of it before, until the day that I saw it, so I really had no clue what it was about.

"malkane316","Quick Reviews!!","30 November 2004","POSSIBLE SPOILERS!!

The wild hysteria surrounding this movie proves that the majority of the cinema going audience can still be fooled into believing anything they see or hear, or think they do, but that doesn't change the fact that it is an extremely convincing and effective horror flick. A certain number of people on these boards, and who have reviewed B. Witch Project HATE the film for varying, understandable reasons. When i first watched this, i watched intently, knowing exactly what the directors were playing at, and i found great enjoyment in watching the reactions of those who thought it was real. Did it unsettle me? No. Did it make me jump like the horror movies that rely on loud noises to scare (the Ring Remake) ? No. But it was the first horror movie in a very long time to put a smile on my face, and make me shiver. If you can remember back to when you played hide and seek as a kid- the feeling you had when the person looking for you was 10 feet away and coming closer- that is what this film gives, in a much greater quantity.

It is slow moving, and if you do not enjoy the pace, then you may not enjoy the film, but it compensates this by being short and concise, juxtaposed against how the 3 campers must have felt as the hours dragged by- the point i take from this is that in life we only remember a series of memories, images pasted together to make little sense, and life seems much shorter than it actually was.

The camera use and grainy feel again may be fuel for hatred or love, but it works perfectly- they don't know what is going on, and neither do we, but that doesn't matter because in an uncertain and threatening situation, the natural human reaction is to run or fight. Drained, exhausted, paranoid, they run. Ever had a nightmare about running away from something, but not knowing exactly what it was, or why you are running?

The best part of the movie (apart from the hilarious 'i kicked the map into the river' scene) is the last few minutes when Michael and Heather enter the house following Josh's screams. I get the 'shivering' feeling throughout this (probably 'spine tingling' or 'chilling' is the 'correct term'), especially when Heather screams, and the ending is excellent as our feelings and fear somehow builds and climaxes (apologies for the sexual connotations) in perfect harmony with what is happening on screen. The actors are clearly convincing, again look at the hysteria for proof, and although they are not called upon to do much, they do it well. Oh yeah, the only scene i do not like is the 'Heather snot' scene- it is too long and breaks up the momentum. Few great horror films come along these days, this is one- embrace it, let yourself be sucked in to feel the full effect, don't be critical, and realize how good it is. 9 out of 10",NA

""The Blair Witch Project"" is not the greatest horror movie of all times, it´s not the greatest shocker of the last decade, not even the best one of 1999! The idea is neither new nor revolutionary in any way, because nearly the whole plot is a 1:1-copy from Ruggero Deodato´s exploitation classic ""Cannibal Holocaust"" as well as the style is taken from Danish Dogma-movies like ""Festen"" or ""Idioterne""! The most interesting fact about BWP is the skilled propaganda how this movie was advertised via Internet as a real documentary about three missing students.

Parodies like ""The Bare Wench Projekt"" or ""The Tony Blair Witch Project"" followed. How about another starring Leslie Nielsen?!?

However there are also some good words to say, because I liked the mood of hopelessness, fear and desperation that is transmitted by this film. ""The Blair Witch Project"" is worth one look, but finally it is also one of the most overhyped movies ever made!

Yes, the camera work was bad... there was almost no TV commercials about it... it was still a good movie. There aren't that many movies made these days which can bypass the theatre and still draw attention like this one did/still is. I have yet to see a movie drive the tension and the fear home like this one.

The realism and the real fear are what make this so good of a movie. The legend is put together seamlessly as are the stuff they go through.

I was simply not drawn into the action at all -- perhaps a teenage level of experience is required to identify with the characters -- and the camera movement had no effect on me, being an experienced 3D gamer.

Its a film that makes you wanna hide behind the screen.

It uses the psychology of never really show the audience what it is that the characters are seeing and experiencing, which's very scary.

I fully understand how it was very scary when it got released in that format with its plot, unfortunately it has inspired very many other films that have made the new generation used to the formas.

Clever horror with an idea that changed horrorfilms forever. Original horror on a whole new innovative level. True insanity that grows of boreness, horror and uncertainty with the characters. As they uses different ways to handle the wierd situation.

GREAT ACTING! AND GREAT MANUSCRIPT CLOSE TO REALITY!

"songod-95003","I feel for this film...","21 October 2019","Celebrated like no other when released, well, before released actually thanks to a then groundbreaking internet and media campaign, it has since become the whipping boy for the entire ""found footage"" genre that followed.

Films, usually awful, cashed in on the success of ""Blair Witch"". Some gems emerged, like ""Utopia Report"", ""Grave Encounters"", and ""The Last Exorcism""; but most were, as stated, awful. Predictable, boring, pointless. And most fan-boy reviewers blame ""The Blair Witch Project"" for these dreadful knock-offs.

None of that applies. Thirty years after it's debut the film is still unnerving. It it plays on your primal fears of the dark, being lost, and being followed by something unknown. That makes the film truly frightening. Not a jump scare to be seen.

My only issue, and one that has been an issue from the first time I saw it, is Mike tossing the map. It would have played better if the map simply vanished. Making Mike the idiot for thinking it pointless and thus tossing it in the creek really wasn't needed to amp up the discord between the three. In fact, he soon was back in good graces as Josh and Heather continued to fight each other. Had the map simply vanished, it could have been attributed to the witch.

In truth, the movie was not that frightening, initially. It was thinking about the events AFTER the movie was over that I got scared. Haven't felt that way since The Haunting (the original, not the special-effects laden remake).

Very well done! All the more to feel this way when you realize that the story is well within the bounds of reality and not the supernatural.

"DButcher","Psychological Time-bomb","27 October 1999","I went into The Blair Witch Project expecting the ""SCARIEST MOVIE EVER MADE!!!!!!!!"" And as I sat there, I found the movie enjoyable, somewhat suspenseful, interesting, but far from being the ""SCARIEST MOVIE EVER MADE!!!!!!!!!!"" That was, until the final scene. If you are paying attention to the movie, the final scene's resonnance is absolutely powerful. I made the mistake of going to the film, based on seeing ONE, I repeat ONE movie trailer, so I am not some cynnic jaded by the hype. My reaction was visceral. My body temperature dropped by a good 20 degrees and I was paranoid for a week. I believe that if people who dismiss the the film had watched it with an open mind, they would have found it as disturbing as those who enjoy the movie did. It is more a psychological time bomb than a film. I will be the first to admit that the film was not a constant terror-filled joy-ride through the darkness of our minds. But I could not imagine any other film that has finished with such a disturbing and thought provoking ending that treats the film-goer with the respect of not force-feeding everything to you. Oh by the way, saw the Sixth Sense a week later, and realized there is an upside to production values.","9"

TBWP is by far the creepiest, most frightening film to come out in a real long time. Those that didn't appreciate this truly great film are either lacking in imagination, or too young to remember classic horror films like The Shining.

This film isn't like Scream, which makes you jump a number of times throughout the movie. No, this is much more. The unique camera views make you feel like you are there with them. Rather than use fake looking monsters, the film makers force the audience to use their imagination. Assuming you have one, the worst possible images will invade your mind. The simple sounds are so effective because the feeling of being in the woods at night is freaky alone.

When the film was over, my original reaction was that it lacked some truly frightening effects. However, as my girlfriend and I talked about the film, I continued to relive the experience, each time creating a more terrifying image to go with the experience. I am still reliving the final scene, constantly inventing new ideas about what happened. I now see that this is the scariest movie I've seen, because I can't get it out of my head.","8"

To say the characters were 2 dimensional would be to reward them with too much depth. Three US college kids were always going to find it hard to connect with a UK audience but these three managed to make it damn near impossible!

The ONLY time of tension for me was the un-steady-cam run from the tent into the dark, but 5 minutes does not make a suspenseful movie.

I felt like telling everyone else in line to forget it. The only genius part of this movie is the marketing. That, I will give full credit for. I was taken and so were the 9 other people who accompanied me to the movie because of how much I hyped it. I apologize to them and hope no one else will get duped the same way I did.

I'm in the middle. While other shoestring budgeted film-makers try to make their productions look as slick as possible, the makers of THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT purposely went for an unpolished rough look. That means this a gimmick film (Like THE THIEF- 1952, a spy thriller with no dialog or 1973's WICKED-WICKED where the whole film was split screen.) The star of the film was the medium. The documenting of three student filmmakers lost in the woods, and possibly at the mercy of an unseen witch gets very tiresome. If human star- Heather Donahue meant to play an irratating character, she did a fantastic job. The logic of the film leaves little to be desired. If you are lost in the woods, follow a river (they lead to bigger water bodies and civilization) or follow the sun. I did love the last section, where Heather makes her on screen apology. (That's the shot where we see only her nostril and nostril hairs on multiplex screens.) The film turns from being a documentary of a witch hunt to a last will and goodbye left on video. I actually got a bit chocked up. The finale in the spooky house left haunting images (The many handprints on the wall, Mike in the corner, waiting to be executed) but lacked logic (Would you lug about a video camera while running for your life?) The summer of 1999 gave us two successful horror films that pulled the genre out of the Freddie/Jason/bikini gal in peril rut (The other being THE SIXTH SENSE) Final summary: Poorly planned film with genius marketing and a few good scenes.",NA

I read alot of horror stories like Stephen King and Anne Rice, which are full of vampires and stories of the supernatural. I am a huge fan of thrillers and action-adventure movies, so obviously the Blair Witch Project caught my attention immediately upon hearing some comments and reviews on it. That was all the info i had coming into the movie and the day after seeing the reviews we were looking forward to seeing it, but just expecting it to be a typical TRYING-to-scare-you movie like Halloween H2O. Well as it turns out i was totally shocked on how emotionally involved i was throughout the movie. The last 10 minutes just happened so quickly and ended so abruptly, i don't think i had time to digest it all until after the movie when i really had time to absorb everything. The more i thought of what happened to those three students, the more scary and eerie it made me feel. It seemed so real, and i could see myself in their situation. I probably wouldn't have been so brave to have survive some many days.

Even though i enjoy watching movies, i get scaried very easily and tend to get too emotionally involved in them. I guess my problem is i keep over in my head all of the scenes which makes it more and more scary.

This movie was definitely worth seeing. It was brillantly acted and is an experience that will be remembered as a 'original masterpiece of horror'.",NA

I decided to watch it a second time uninterrupted and realized the horror that the makers tried to portray to the viewer. It really touched my senses and the movie brought to me the very elements that scare me in my own nightmares. The things that you can't see but , rather, implied have a greater effect upon your senses than those that you can! Perhaps those who had a vehement dislike to the movie should view it a second time uninterrupted just as I did. I am too scared to watch it a third time at the moment as the aura of the movie still haunt me. If watching it a second time doesn't affect you then, this is not the movie for you.

"LLAAA4837","One of the most effective no-budget films ever","27 January 2009","The Blair Witch Project consists of footage that was found in the Maryland woods where three college students had disappeared back in 1994. The footage is what they saw. These 80 minutes are the last days of their lives. The footage is horrifying, chilling, disturbing, and haunting. We see these three kids have a lot of fun at first, but then things don't go exactly as planned. They lose their map, they get lost, and they find strange trinkets and symbols around their campsite. As they get more and more lost and the situation gets more and more hopeless, the situations start getting even more disturbing. They are attacked in the middle of the night, they scream, shove, and attack each other, and the sounds they hear in the middle of the night get even more disturbing and horrifying. The last twenty minutes of this film are some of the most hardcore scenes of horror I've seen in a modern horror film. It all leads up to an ending that contains one last creepy image that will likely be ingrained into your mind forever after you have watched the film. The Blair Witch Project is a film that uses atmosphere to create a foreboding sense of dread, suspense, and intensity. The film is scary, not because of what you see, but what you don't see. Most of the horrific scenes in the film are scary because of the power of suggestion and of fear of the unknown. We don't see monsters. We don't see what happens to these kids in the woods with our eyes. We do see what happens in our minds, and that's a lot more terrifying than anything that the film could show us. The fact that there's no logic to the horror adds a level of unease and makes the viewer feel not only completely scared but also helpless. That's how I felt when I watched the film. It is one of the weirdest and most disturbing low(VERY low) budget films I've seen.",NA

It must be said that there is only so much one can do with a limited budget. Of course there are exceptions. For example, ""The Last Night at The Alamo,"" is probably the best example of the truly independent low budget film.

""The Blair Witch Project,"" was certainly hyped and received a vast audience bored with Hollywood's crackerjack horror output. This movie certainly is different. Still though, it lacks what good film needs. Namely, the basics. Story, plot, character development, intrigue, and a slew of other basics are glossed over or are simply missing. To be fair though, these elements were not attempted, at least traditionally.

This film most reminds me of George Lucas' original ""THX-1138"" (not the one with Duvall). It has a studentesque quality about it. I am left wondering what could be done with a remake. Of course, there will be one, but the cat is already out of the bag. Originality will be missing in the next installment.

As cultural phenomenon, I can only guess at its success. The characters speak in a pseudo cool youth speak, in which the F word is noun, adjective, and verb,often in the same paragraph. Well, that may be fine if you live in the vernacular. However, my own experience lends me to believe that only Eddie Murphy has met that task (i.e. ""Life"").

I understand that this feature was released in 1999; a recently made story by a USA storyteller; using USA resources and personnel and locations.

I purchased my Blu-ray as I considered that it was likely to be able to be interpreted as a comment about UK politics of around 1999. I was not disappointed though it took me some musing to realise that I could see parallels that felt real.

It helped that I could wait until I found a lower than usual low cost second hand Blu-ray, for this I would not have wanted to pay typical second hand Blu-ray prices. Why pay that much if one is likely to get scared?

So, I was purchasing a Blu-ray of something that was mostly filmed in 8mm. Except that is not as pointless as I would have once thought.

An example of some detail that stood out for me: The team leader being the one with a map and compass, yet showing symptoms of giving outward indicators of using them properly and results that might come from trusting one's heart rather than what technical indicators say? So, very rarely there might be times when even social outcasts might benefit from that, but to quote Full House series: How rude of me to consider feminist warfare in such terms. Not many might agree with my opinion if I clearly say what it is based on.

I expect that this story is more likely to relate to USA politics of circa 1992 to 98 than UK 1999, but why that title for a USA story?",NA
"sierrabonny","The ""Bored"" Witch Project","21 April 2016","The Blair Witch Project follows three teens (Heather, Mike, and Josh) as they trek out into the woods to do research behind the legend of the Blair Witch. They begin by interviewing several of the folks that live in the town near the woods, and almost everybody knows something about this witch. With the creepy tales of the witch swimming in their minds, they venture into the woods for what is meant to be just a three day camp out to shoot some scenes in the home of the ""fictional"" witch. Once they enter the woods things start declining from there. The first problem is that the circle- walking begins. Classic in any ""woodsy"" horror film. Because of the bewitchment of the woods, Heather, Mike, and Josh become hopelessly lost wandering in circles. While things definitely do get worse for them, the circle wandering is a very large chunk of the film. After they become lost in the woods, the film really has only 2 elements to it: wandering in hopeless circles in the woods, and listening to sticks crack at night. Are both of those things scary? Yes of course! Scary for an audience to watch for an hour and forty-five minutes? You can answer that for yourself. After they become lost in the woods, they begin to hear many strange noises and find mysterious, unexplained symbols placed all around them. Slowly the characters are forced to come to the realization that they aren't just lost. They are hunted. Josh is the first of them to disappear, then suddenly Heather and Mike are left alone to walk in circles and listen to sticks crack. Oh no! The film comes to what could be called a climax in the last five minutes when Heather and Mike venture out to find Josh, for the third time, and they are lead to an old abandoned house. Once inside, they follow his screams, and wind up in a basement where the film ends as you see Mike standing in the corner of the room. The camera goes black. After at least fifteen minutes of pure running, screaming and chasing, that is the end it comes to. Everyone dies. But are we really surprised?","2"

It's neither sublime, nor psychologically frightening, nor visually captivating, so I simply can not comprehend for which reasons someone may have enjoyed this production. There's one thing worth admiring and that's got nothing to do with the art of film-making, but with the art of money making. I suppose you can turn any piece of junk into an underground myth as long as people will go along with it.

Evil Dead, so many years older and so much more fresh than Blair Witch, is the main source of inspiration and I'm not saying it just because it's another movie that takes place in a forest. Maybe, but just maybe, BW could've been something more. Maybe it had some potential, but given that I've seen good movies with terrible premises and disastrous movies with brilliant premises you have to concur that, in the end, this just doesn't matter.

Such a simple idea as this must leave big-horror-movie buffs and agencies kicking themselves, because it shows that audiences are truly terrified not by serial killers wielding chainsaws coming through the wall, but by symbols and slight crackling noises that leave chills for days and weeks to come.

"falcolnpunch","If You Go Down To the Woods in the 90s...","21 January 2014","The Blair Witch Project, the film that, more or less, created the Found Footage Horror sub-genre; paving the way for the likes of the Paranormal Activities, the RECs, and Cloverfield. But don't judge it on those (really quite average) movies, because The Blair Witch Project is extraordinarily terrifying. Even writing this now, reminiscing about the film is filling me with fear. It really is that scary.

We join Heather, her friend Josh and Mike (hired because he can work a video camera) as they adventure in to the woods to find out more about the eponymous Blair Witch, aiming to make a cheap documentary type movie on the fairly blurred subject. As you can expect, things soon get creepy...

Genre conventions pop up about the place from the off: unwitting teens, small town-folk, and so on, but it really just works as the characters (keeping their real life names as in Found Footage tradition) bicker and gradually break down from fear.

And there's a lot of darkness. As the kids sit within their tent, in a hope that the creepy noises outside won't get them, we, the audience, are forced to watch a blank screen, just listening to growls outside and the scared banter inside. Just like Paranormal Activity, something the makers of that film quite right jumped on, your eyes dart around this screen, literally looking at nothing, as you wait, petrified, for something to jump out at you.

And that's exactly where the film quite rightly collects its haters. Not full of conventional scares, you're supposed to believe in the characters' fears, their terror of what COULD be out there. You're tasked with believing in the possible evil out there, as opposed to bluntly throwing it at you. Yes, there are bits here and there, visible to us which are horrifying, but the real fear? Our fantastic imagination.

Today, almost 15 years on, The Blair Witch Project may well be devalued by its less scary descendants (avoid Apollo 18 at all costs), and perhaps with repeat viewings it could easily become tame. But if today's Found Footage movies are Blair Witch's children, then TBWP is their far smarter, pitch black and, most importantly, scarier dad.

Watch it with the lights off.

The found footage genre is a total mess now, with hundreds of imitations churned out at next to no cost so it's hard to recall just how groundbreaking the BWP was. However its uncompromising ambiguity is its greatest strength and sets it apart from almost everything that has come since. The hopeless downward spiral of each character is incredibly realistic and is really the centrepiece of the film; everything else is left to your imagination and that just made it all the more horrifying. I thought about this film for weeks after first watching it and it took me several years before I had the courage to watch again and for me that's what cements it as the gold standard, not only for found footage but for all horror films.","9"

The Blair witch project, it suspects me to be scared without even trying, it's not that easy. You really have to be awake the first 15 minutes of the film or you won't realize what your'e supposed to be scared off.

The film tries to invent a revolutionary kind of method, which is to not have any music to try and scare the audience. Is that method good? Personally I don not like that. It collapses on it self trying to be a horror genre. There's nothing horrifying about it.

Let's say that The Blair Witch Project is real and you find the video cameras, you must then wonder why they didn't stop recording while they were fighting. It's just not realistic","5"
"Mr Parker","The ShakyCam Project","11 July 2003","I'll tell you what I find sad: when something gets hyped to the point where there's just no way that it can ever live up to people's expectations. I remember reading a quote somewhere saying that this movie was scarier than the Exorcist. If I hadn't already seen the movie at that point, I would've been pretty disappointed had I gone to see it with this quote in mind. I personally believe that I will not see a film scarier than the Exorcist during my lifetime. At the time of this writing, I am twenty-eight years old. The Exorcist is the scariest movie of all time in my opinion and this film, chilling as it can be at points, comes nowhere near first place. I feel the need to express this because so many people that I know have watched this thinking they were about to get the very life scared out of them, only to walk away shaking their heads in disgust. I happen to think that while it's not the greatest horror movie in the world, nor is it a great movie, period, as a whole I have to give it a good write-up because let's face it, the filmmakers took a good idea and ran with it. The way that this film was done and marketed is the kind of thing that makes one ask themselves, ""Now, why didn't I come up with that idea?"". You're probably familiar with the story behind it already but if you're not, here it is: three young filmmakers head out to the woods as part of their research project on an old legend revolving around the Blair Witch and mysteriously disappear. The movie you watch is supposed to be the actual footage they filmed while stuck in the forest, found a year later. It's shot entirely with a camcorder and a black and white 16mm camera held by any of the three main characters. Those who get motion sickness easily may want to avoid this entirely because there are scenes in the film where the shots go all over the place in that sickening way that camcorders tend to produce more than regular film does. The whole idea is to give it a pseudo-documentary feel and I think it works well for the most part. There was this whole marketing craze where they didn't tell anyone that the whole thing was a fake and they actually pulled it off to some extent, even going so far as to have a website dedicated to the mystery of the Blair Witch and the strange revelations that emerged from the search team's findings. When I saw this in the theaters, a girl outside was crying about how sad it was that they never found the three kids. She bought the whole thing obviously. I read up on movies a lot so I didn't fall for it because I knew about the whole myth thing beforehand. At any rate, I found the movie to be generally unsettling. The acting is acceptable but seems forced on occasion. It's my understanding that they were given a rough approximation of what kind of performance they were to give in note form so maybe it stems from that. There are some pretty creepy moments in this film and if you've ever been camping in the middle of a dark forest, you know exactly how scary this movie can be at times. If you have to see this movie, watch it for the end sequence which in my opinion is one of the most frightening scenes in any movie I have ever seen. Watch it under the right conditions: dark lights, night time, quiet setting. I guarantee that if you watch this with no huge expectations, you will be satisfied.

RATING:***1/2 out of *****, a half a star thrown in for a genuine attempt at giving us something we haven't seen before and doing it with a bare amount of materials at their disposal.",NA
"noahgibbobaker","I get the appeal, but it's not for me.","2 October 2020","I hate found footage movies and I hate the blair witch project for starting the trend. I only watched it because I heard it was terrifying, I heard it was terrifying from people who saw it in cinemas and didn't know if it was real or not. Knowing it is all fake it makes for a boring, unsatisfactory experience.

I like that the film commits to being as realistic as possible even when unrealistic things are happening. It was a very smart decision and the only reason people were scared of it when it came out. The realism is helped a lot by pretty good performances. I only have a couple complaints about the acting. I thought the ""map was useless!"" really unintentionally hilarious because of poorly written dialogue and pretty bad acting, a few of the argument scenes are accidently pretty funny.

Overall I thought the blair witch project was really boring. I have very little to say about it so I've kept this review very short.","4"

"alfiemachin","Creepy,Eerie,Terrifying and Original","5 November 2016","The Blair witch Project is a new,experimental and in my personal opinion successfully executed film. It delves into the unexplored world of simplicity and complete hand-held camera shots which is very undermined by most horrors which rely heavily on dramatic music and unnecessary jump scares to force viewers admitting they were scared by at least one scene in the movie. The Blair witch Project has no jump scares. No intense and over the top music. No ridiculous CGI monsters or ghosts. And no fancy camera quality. The film scares you to bone with a terrifying story line without even revealing the witch cursing the forest, Clever uses of environment, noises and lighting. But the most scariest thing about this film is that it can very much be mistaken as potentially real due to its theme of basic raw footage filmed from the character's perspective. Besides a few scenes in which acting is poorly executed, the movie easily scared me with its amazing build up and simple yet effective use of paranormal activity occurring around the characters particularly at night. I find it easily understandable as to why some people may find this as a bad way of creating a movie. But if your'e searching for something new and different from every other horror out there this is certainly an option.","8"
"revival05","Realism scares. People who doesn't want to think in movies hate this","6 June 2000","**Warning for spoilers** **Sorry for some spellingmisstakes**

This movie is scary as hell, and I'm not saying this because I'm hyped up, or because I'm going with my friends. Actually, the way I see it, everybody hated this movie. Well that is quite frightening. Has the world gone so crazy that people excpect I KNOW WHAT YOU DID LAST SUMMER every time they walk in to a cinema?

Let's put it this way. You people who don't like this movie has many reasons not to, but no one of them really is fair. I have read almost all comments and I keep seeing the same misstake in the ''bad'' comments: You don't seem to understand it. 1. Is it scary with a pile of rocks? Answer: YES, YES, YES! I bet if you heared some strange noise in the night, and wakes up to find a pile of rocks outside your tent, you would be scared as hell! 2. Heather annoying? Answer: NO, NO, NO! Isn't her reaction pretty realistic? I mean, let's face it: One of your best friends disappear without a trace (you ALSO hear him screaming in the night, but something is wrong, it isn't him) and someones teeths poppes up. Anyone, exept for Superman, would panic and, yes, scream.

3. Throw up for the cameras? Answer: This was one of the stupid comments? What did you want them to do? Keep the camera straight, even though the circumstanses? I don't think so. Didn't you know before you saw TBWP, that the camera would be like this through the entire movie? Some other comments think that it's boring, probably just because that it is not like any other horrorfilm. They maybe want to see the actual creature, but HEY! That's the scary thing about a horrormovie isn't it? The unseen evil... You know that something is out there, but you never get to see it, or at least get a clear shot. That freaks, at least me, out. You guys probably wondered where the music were, or ''where did all the gore and effects go? isn't this a horrormovie''? Yes, it is. But it is a horrormovie that is very, very, very, very scary without anything of that in it. Only using a large forest, some voodostuff, and human minds and then making a masterpiece, is pure cinema art. And something we don't see every day

REALISM SCARES HERE:

First of all, the acting IS NOT BAD! It is just the fact that this is a REALISTIC PORTRAIT! This is the way they'd react too, whatever they say, and it seems to piss them off royaly.

The PLOT is genius for a non-budget film. Also the 8mm is genius for a non-budget. Didn't you guys feel like this was something REAL? Didn't you get the feeling that this actually happened? Frankly this movie felt like a recording I found on the attic or something. Because I could RELATE TO THE MOVIE, IT WAS VERY REALISTIC! All these negative comments, nobody says anything about it not being realistic, because IT IS! And NOBODY EVER THOUGHT ""Hey, it was pretty realistic...Maybe that was the scary thing about it?"" Well, IT WAS!

Is it anybody who really honestly doesn't agree? It shouldn't but in that case, please mail me.","8"
"wdekler","Avoid! Even police academy is better!","2 November 1999","I generally tend to like low budget movies, they have to rely more heavily on the script and acting than the big budget movies. So after hearing some good things about it I saw the movie on a friday evening.... and I have to say that the movie has one good feature: it's only 80 minutes you have to wait for it to end. All the people that I could overhear afterwards were telling each other how much they disliked this movie. You can compare this movie with the standard highschool horror movies, its only much worse and it adds nothing to the genre at all. Don't be misguided by people who say this all is ok because its art. It is not.

"Steve-176","Kid's Stuff","19 December 1999","As scary as The Exorcist? No way!

The Blair Witch Project is however unsettling, memorable; one of those films that can leave you with thoughts and flashbacks for days.

It has an unnerving, believable feel encouraged by apparently very real reactions from the actors. But such flamboyance is never accidental.

The film for all of its apparent naturalness is carefully set up.

I'd like to emphasise that the actors are still alive! I've been amazed by the number of people who believe that the whole thing is real!

This film has taken on a life of its own. There was and still is a very successful internet presence for the movie. Film site surfers have become the nucleus of a solid and enthusiastic retinue of fans itching for a certain kind of scare.

Younger film goers find it very fashionable to have seen the film, resulting in a cult phenomenon that is in full swing. Seeing this movie is a bit like owning the best designer wear.

Perversely, the fact that The Blair Witch Project was made for only a pittance by a couple of film students, has given the film street credibility. It has low budget (big profit) grunge glamour.

But mainly people are flocking to see this because they're looking for a good scare.

But they don't want to be terrified. Most people never want that in movie houses. The fact that The Blair Witch Project is about as frightening, and has the same air, as a ride on an amusement park Ghost Train isn't a huge disincentive for the teen audience to whom this film will really appeal.

So what of the film. We are told during the opening credits that in 1994 three film makers went into a wooded area in search of a legendary witch: ""A year later, their footage was found.""

The film makers were never seen again, but from their film we find out what happened to them. A documentary is made and that's The Blair Witch Project.

This film was written and directed by two young American auteurs, Eduardo Sanchez and Dan Myrick. They conceived the idea, scripted the film (without dialogue), trained their three main actors Heather Donahue, Michel Williams, and Joshua Leonard for two days on how to work the cameras and sent them into the woods to make this ""documentary"". Of course we don't see the rest of the production crew.

This worked remarkably well. The actors, able to ad lib at will while they were doing the filming threw themselves into this horror story. They probably at times frightened themselves.

Sanchez and Myrick then spent eight months editing the footage, getting it to look as much as possible like a rough story of the deaths of three terrified people.

The film is grainy, the cameras hand held and the editing rough. The original mood is jocular when the trio begin their project with some lead up interviews with local fishermen and the like, boning up on the folk lore that surrounds the myth of the Blair Witch.

They go to the woods. As the days progress and the witch closes in, the tension mounts like in all good horror movies. The three start to bicker with one another. Formerly subservient characters become more dominant. A leader makes a tearful confession to the camera.

And what of the camera. The desire to document is only one reason for keeping filming. Why do they keep filming as they even die?

The answer has never been more obvious. Watching the world through a lens is like wearing a mask or taking on another personality, or acting. It divorces the camera operator from what he or she is seeing through the lens.

And that's damn handy if something horrible is trying to murder you.

And if you're filming as you are running, especially in terror, the camera will swing. Those prone to motion sickness might be disorientated.",NA

"MovieGuy109","A very good student film better than most horror","29 October 2011","UCF students Daniel Myrick and Eduardo Sanchez directed this fine piece of horror on an ultra low budget and did it better than most every horror film around these days. We never see the antagonists but the suspense is gut-wrenching. The filmmakers seem to be playing on something more significant than petty slasher gore but our imaginations and what we think the attackers are, whether they are supernatural or not. These questions that we come up with add to our own personal sense of fear. The thing that baffles me about this film is how expertly the filmmakers understand the personal responses and fears of the viewer and do not tell us what to think about the villains, but allow us to visualize and expand.","8"
"RoLaren","Less is Definitely More!","22 August 1999","Few films come along which actively invite viewer participation. This is especially true for the horror/fantasy genre which, in this age of overblown computer-generated fx, assault the audience with noise, gore and the likes of JarJar Binks. Filmakers of insight--and the makers of Blair Witch Project obviously fall into this category--know that the imagination can conjure up far more frightening scenarios than all the fx houses put together. After all, each of us has our own deeply personal, often subconscious, fears--which are seldom those of the filmakers. (Or, should I say, some Hollywood committee's idea of what is frightening.)

Darkness--literal and that symbolic darkness which represents the unknown--is an effective element of Blair Witch; and the use of handheld cameras gives the ""documentary"" an authenticity that no amount of slick, dollar-heavy Hollywood production values could create. One of the most original films to come along in a very long time. (I can almost smell the imitations coming...)",NA
"David, Film Freak","Pathetic horror","7 April 2001","Despite it's mere $50,000 budget, 'The Blair Witch Project' pulled in big bucks across the globe, in one of the cheapest number one movies ever created.

Little known actors use their real names in this movie, where they play a group of high-school students who get lost in the woods making a documentary of the 'legendary' Blair Witch.

You know the caption: In 1994, 4 students went into the Maryland woods making a doco on the Blair Witch... a year later, their footage was found... yeah, well that's basically the entire movie's plot.

The hand-held camera movement is annoying at best, but I suppose it's supposed to depict reality.

"hellion-3","chilling but stomach-churning","9 August 1999","Well regardless of what you think of Blair Witch Project you have to admire the buzz it's generated. I for one loved it - and, like some have already said, you'll either love it or hate it. During the screening it was interesting to watch the characters interact as they slowly fell apart. I don't think it was particularly abrupt and it felt natural. I think the lack of script may have helped to this end. There were a few spots that felt contrived however (Mike singing the the national anthem?! Cmon!).

Some people are claiming this film rips of this or that but the world's full of less-than-original ideas. Ferrari is basically building a souped-up ripoff of Ford's Model-T. I can say the movie for me was unique. Resist the urge to bail early (which I to some degree had, though not from boredom) and also to judge it the moment the credits roll. It didn't give me sleeping problems and honestly I could have walked around in the woods after seeing it but once my brain crunched on it for several hours I was left with an unsettled feeling (more so than for any other film in recent memory), that of the hopelessness felt when one is truly lost.

That's scary, that's what I took from the film. The stuff with the sticks, rocks, etc is secondary and serves the witch premise but honestly who can claim they wouldn't still be panicked if they were lost in the woods, even if there were no noises, sticks, etc. I don't care if you do have a compass and map or you're a seasoned backwoodsman, if you're in unfamiliar forest until you stumble on that road something, however small, will gnaw at the back of your mind saying ""what if...""

I remembered as I watched how someone on IMDB early on wrote it was so stupid that most of the audience was ""laughing at it"". He missed the point, I laughed, we all laughed, simply because the characters were so hopelessly screwed. To those who wrote ""I'd never have done such-and-such, that's so moronic"" I say panic can induce all kinds of erratic and idiotic behavior. I know when I panic - truly panic - I usually wind up digging a deeper hole for myself to fall into. Intellect just doesn't come into play.

One more thing. To those who disregard the warnings of motion sickness BEWARE: this is worse than anything I've ever encountered. I can read in the back seat of a car going 80 mph on a winding country road and I NEVER get sick. About 2/3 the way through this movie I had to cover my closed eyes with my hands to give my stomach a chance to settle. I missed maybe 10 minutes of movie doing this repeatedly. I should have gone in pumped up on Dramamine. The drug should be handed out at the door to the theater and should be mandatory for all viewers.",NA

How wrong I was! If there's a ""Most Wasted Popcorn Award "", I would nominate The Blair Witch Project. After I walked out of the theater, we could barely walk. All the movements of the camera in the film made me sick, not to mention how horribly BAD the movie itself is. Come on, all those stories in the horror movies doesn't really exist! They are just like that-movie. And when you mix it with total reality, it doesn't work. If they shot a few more glimpses of the witch, it might be better. All the made -up things in it is just ridiculous. This IS original, but it's not scary at all (or at least, not a bit scarier than any other horror movies). This creativity should be put somewhere else, not on the big screen. If you want good horror, don't waste your time and money on this movie .

After the initial buzz this film was blasted continually. To me it is a testement to the phonemonm of jumping on the berating bandwagon because this is, simply, a damn good movie and a scary one too. Yes you have to put aside the unlikely choice that the terrified trio would continue to film in such a situation, but it is a small suspension of reality to capitulate to considering that the premise of the film (""reality"" horror, caught on video tape) is a brillant one.

Unfortunetely this is not anywhere near enough to have a good film, the majority of it has to be good not just the last five minutes. The way they filmed it was very interesting, they didn't tell the actors what to say or what would happen, the actors also did almost all the camera work making it bouncy and confusing which could and has made some films even scarier but in this case just gets annoying. The performances are horrible especially the girl, she is just horrible, and deserved her Razzie and should get a lifetime acheavment award from them because she has been just as bad in all her other stuff.

"tfadale94","What the actual...","21 February 2013","Literally the worst movie I've seen thus far, and that includes screening for undergrad film majors.

What are you people thinking giving this high ratings? Let me break it down.

""You had to have an imagination/it's all left up to the imagination."" Okay, so yeah, it's supposed to be psychologically scary. It's a little difficult to be lost in your inner fears with Heather screaming like a self-centered crazy woman. Seriously, shut up. If she would have been even a tiny bit less annoying, it'd have been easier to go into the ""...what if...""'s that my mind wanted to throw out there. Make Josh disappear sooner and perhaps have him scream every night for two nights or more. That's the only part in the movie when I was a little scared. What happened to Josh? Why is he yelling? AH!But we never know, and the mind takes it to the goriest, most painful experience imaginable. Only well-done part of the movie.

""The editing was spot on/first person camera is so immersive!"" I'm sorry, but what person jiggles and shakes around that much when walking in the woods? Try it. When you walk, your vision does wobble a bit, but not in the nausea-inducing way the cameras do in BWP. I didn't feel like I was there, I felt like I had a migraine coming on. I get it, it's supposed to be that the viewer found the footage in the woods. But... it didn't feel like that. For that to happen, I would have preferred a police officer or something to introduce us to the footage, not just a black screen and words.

""The ending was so scary/the locals built suspense!"" It wasn't suspenseful. The moment it was mentioned how the kids were killed, we all knew what was going to happen. Seriously people. NOT SUSPENSEFUL.

""The acting was so honest/believable/ad hoc!"" Cut out Heather. Just get a new actor, she isn't believable as a person, an actor, or a character. About as ""deeply sorry"" as Hitler. Annoying enough to make me WANT her to die. Incessant talking? No. Just, no. Stop. And the way all the actors sort of faced each other awkwardly like a school play for a good majority of the film? Unprofessional and not believable one bit. They didn't work together one bit.

Just burn it, and start over.","1"
"sleestaker","I thought it was a comedy","17 November 2002","No joke, I spent more time laughing at this movie than anything else. When Josh is crying and going, ""Why was it messing with my stuff?"" or something, I was rolling! Scary? Nah.

I know that we're talking about three suburban slackers who have led such pampered lives (they're going to film school, i.e. they don't want to work for a living) that they don't know their collective asses from a hole in the ground, but anyone with a GRAIN of sense who is lost in the woods might decide to FOLLOW THE RIVER, especially since they walked in a circle one day. B-DUUUUHHHH!

Heather Donohue is one of the worst actresses in recent memory and rivals Tony Montana and Vincent Vega for most uses of a certain expletive within a 90 minute span. I'm sure her mother is quite proud that her vocabulary is so broad. And you can't blame this on a scriptwriter, because there apparently wasn't one.

This movie is a laugh riot! It's really funny to see three doofi (plural of doofus) get turned around in the woods and yell at each other because there are no more cigarettes, but it ain't scary...not by a long shot.","2"
"Incubus-5","The Biggest, Most Publicized Disappointment of the Year","12 September 1999","I had to go see Blair Witch. The newspapers said so. They told me I would be in for the thrill ride of my life. Scarier than ""The Exorcist"". ""The Most Frightening Movie Of The Year"". What scares me about this movie is that there are people who think it is so good. Most of them seem to be critics. I certainly do not know anyone who has seen this movie who liked it. Of the eight people in the theater when I went in, three left before the end. I wish I had been so smart. In short, the movie was dull. Nothing happened. Three kids get lost and drop their cameras. The end.

The concept was good. Nothing else was. Terrible script. Terrible camera work. Terrible lighting. Terrible actors. The best thing that could happen to the entire crew on this film is to be lost in the woods and never return. This movie would have been the most dismal failure in all of film history had the media not played it up to be something spectacular.

"Grifter84","Most frightening concept ever","24 June 1999","Since I was a little boy (not so long ago, now that I think about it), I have always been afraid of being in the woods at night and this movie has managed to squashed any chance of me ever overcoming that phobia. It has accomplished the amazing feat of conveying the terrible essence of one of humanity's basest, most primitive and most overwhelming emotions: pure unadulterated terror. The makers of this film understand perfectly that what we can't see is a thousand times more petrifying than what we see acted out in front of us. While we may be a bit shocked by a shot of Jason slashing up a girl at a summer camp, it is only the fear of the unknown that can truly terrify a man. The human imagination will always be able to think of something more frightening than what can ever be shown on a movie screen, no matter how much gore is piled on. Give credit to the writer and director who have created what is undoubtedly one of the most original films of the decade, and most likely the scariest film that anyone will ever want to tremble through.

I beg of you, do not see this movie unprepared. DO NOT BRING YOUNG CHILDREN TO THIS MOVIE, ESPECIALLY IF YOU ARE PLANNING ON GOING ON A CAMPING TRIP! I cannot emphasise enough that I am still having nightmares from this movie. Watch at you own risk.","10"
"Aidan McGuinness","Good as a one off experience - but no need to repeat it","7 January 2002","""The Blair Witch Project"" seems to have got itself a love/hate relationship with many people. I'm a bit divided. The premise of the movie is simple enough: Three students go into the woods to make a documentary about the Blair Witch and end up wishing they hadn't.

""The Blair Witch Project"" takes the approach that what's scariest is what our imaginations can conjure up (though this is of course a result of it's budget of about $20,000). We never see anything as such - a pile of stones doesn't exactly inspire fear but how they got there is (what's meant to) create the terror. The hounded feel is compounded by the use of the hand held camera to bring us into what Heather & co. are seeing - we never know any more than they do. We're with them until the end.

Does any of it work? To an extent. As a one-off-no-lights-on experience it can be eerie for the reasons I've described. The use of unknown actors - who were themselves ""scared"" during filming to add authenticity - helps add to the ""reality"" of this being lost footage. On a second viewing the flaws become apparent - there's no plot for example. That's fine for a one-time viewing but a movie should stand up to repeated viewing. The direction is obviously not really there - they just fling the camera about as they're running around and the ""actors"" are not camera people.

It's hard to judge ""The Blair Witch Project"". Certainly it's different. Different enough to be good is had to say. I'd recommend watching it to judge for yourself but I'd be surprised if many people get much out of watching it for a second time as it'd ruin the taste taken from the first. Overall I'd give it a 6.5/10 (rounded favorably to 7/10 on IMDB's voting poll because I'm a nice guy)","6"
"Jedi-18","Sick bag anyone?","22 November 1999","I liked this film, I liked it because it was different. It was a fairly original concept which is hard to come by these days. It also broke new ground by using marketing to it's full, I think more films will use the internet in future the way Blair Witch did. And why not? I doubt any other film could make the amount of profit which Blair Witch did but then again most films aren't made for the cost of a family car. It possibly suffered slightly from over hype but this didn't deter me from seeing it. I left this movie feeling sick, because I had eaten a big bag of skittles and a bag of popcorn and the camera work was incredibly shaky. I don't normally get motion sickness but this came close. It all added to the effect of the second best thriller this year (after sixth sense).",NA
"tresm87","A foreboding and anxiety filled story that ultimately fizzles with a uneventful conclusion.","19 August 2018","5.6/10 This obviously caught the world by storm when it came out due to its fantastic marketing or trolling however you look at it. People thought this was all real footage and these people actually died at the hands of the Blair Witch. As a kid when this came out, this was truly an innovative film that captivated me with its creepy ominous wood setting and the fact i thought it might have been real. I was constantly searching the woods in hopes of finding things similar to in this film and it gave me great imagination in my exploring. However I had always held an almost angry feeling towards it for not actually ever showing the witch in the film. It led us all in this tense frenzy of psychological terror without ever giving us something to see. If they had just shown something in the final house seen or anything throughout it could've easily been a better film. Ive had a love hate relationship with this for a long time and i do appreciate its forboding and ominous setting and use of the documentary style camera work, but i still feel tricked ultimately by the gimmick and tease of the film. But for what it is it works on some levels, and the folklore and backstory of the blair witch is phenomenally well imagined. The new film as Ive said is superior because we finally get to see a visual portrayal of the witch and it was made with a higher budget allowing them to expand vastly on the plotting and effects. I will say the makers of this film are geniuses with the idea and they grossed a ton from it. Book of shadows was an absolute travesty though that shouldn't be viewed by anyone.","6"
"heckler-2","Wonderful film making!","30 August 1999","This was truly one of the best horror movies that I have ever seen. The best part to me and which most people hate about it was the way you never saw what was doing it. I was just like in really life were you don't always know what is chasing you or after you. The movie attacked all your senses it made you laugh, cry and even at the right point jump out of your skin. This movie was like another I have seen called Cannibal Holocaust (I don't recommend this won to the faint or strong on heart) were they find the film of the lost film crew and see what really happened to them. Both movies caused alot of people to think that they are real and not just a movie which I liked about them because they do look really and do make you wonder.

They movie makers are very smart in that they integrated the Internet with the movie (blairwitch.com). If you saw just the movie you may wonder about the legend of the Blair Witch or what happened after or before and the Internet site tells you just that and also makes the movie seem all the more real. After I went to the Internet site(yes I went there after the movie) the movie seemed alot scarier. I would advise anyone to watch this wonderful movie and if you don't appreciate look at the web site because it makes it much better trust me.","6"
"Hernán","A GREAT AND POWER FULL EMPATHIC FILM","22 October 1999","Ok maybe the Blair Witch Project is like on the top box of the summer, but don't let that confuse you, this is not a stupid typical summer movie, and as you can see for many critics and opinions this is not a movie for everyone. The Blair Witch Project is not a film for selfish people who just want to sit there and see a lot of special effects and people dying to feel terror, This is a totally empathic film, you have to get on the shoes of Heather, Mike and Josh to know what they're feeling, to feel the horror of the situation. Its a movie of everyones deepest fears, its about what terrify us, its about getting inside the Blair forest and share the desperation with Heather, Mike and Josh. And let me tell you if you're willing to get inside this movie you will be scared as hell!!!. The camera work it's essential to make you feel like you're watching your own video, something that could happen to you. It's not about if the story is real or not, that has no importance couse The Blair Witch Project is not scary because of what you know, but of what you dont know, what you dont see, what you feel but can't explain. The witch is as real as our fears, and that's the greatness of the story. I consider myself a horror films fan and I can say I have seen a lot of them, and believe me as I got deeper on the plot of the Blair Witch Project I started to feel this creepy feeling on the bottom of my stomach, that we horror fans love to feel but can't feel to often. As I said before this is not a movie for everyone couse it's not a movie to see from the outside but from the inside, and believe me if you get inside it, this is truly one of the must terrifying films ever made!! This is one of those films you know its going to become a classic, and it surely deserves it.","10"

"sorrow","Comments to potential viewers and disappointed viewers","9 August 1999","""The Blair Witch Project"" is one of the best movies to come along this year for many reasons. It features some of the best acting that I have seen in a long time, is shot creatively, and presents thoroughly believable characters in a story that is character driven. Plus, this film manages to truly get under the skin, providing a creepy and tense emotional experience.

Now here are some things that this movie does NOT offer:

Unnecessary state-of-the-art special effects


Scripted dialogues (neither the kind that are too stale and poorly written to be believable nor the kind that are too well-crafted or clever to seem real)


Verbal masturbation by actors (i.e. - overacting, show-off acting, or any kind of acting not necessary to successfully portray a character)


Cheap-thrills


Gratuitous sex


Gratuitous violence


Cardboard characters in a pre-packaged plot device


Happy endings with ""closure""


Spoon-fed entertainment with no thought or feeling


Unfortunately, the above list is what the average movie viewer wants, and when a film comes along that doesn't give them any such gratification, they tend to get lost.

When one watches this movie or ANY movie for that fact, one should try to experience the film. Be there with the characters. That means no talking to your neighbor, no asking aloud what just happened (as if someone else _knows_ the answer), and no stepping outside of the film to sit safely in your chair. Concentrate on the events unfolding before you and give yourself over to what is precious about art: an emotional experience.

If you let yourself go with this film, it _will_ work its magic on you.

Does that mean you will jump out of your seat or get spooked?

Doubtfully, though some people may. Most likely you will not have that kind of reaction - that is the fun roller-coaster kind of fear that audiences have come to expect from entertainment. This film is about real fear - the kind of disturbing emotional experience that comes from watching three individuals slowly transform into hysterical animals afraid of being trapped in a situation that is beyond their control.

Why does it work? Not because of the fear of what's not on the screen, as many reviewers like to say. No, it works because - when you let yourself go with the film - the actors don't seem like actors performing for your entertainment; they seem like real individuals grappling with a horrifying situation.

Anyone who gripes about why the filmmakers continue to film or why they do this or that is just actively trying to fault the film or isn't paying attention. Such a person is on some level resisting the experience of allowing himself to go with a very real and creepy film. The film explains that Heather is a film junkie who films everything compulsively. There are plenty of people who do this on trips. In addition, the film reveals that documenting everything is Heather's way of coping with a horrible situation.

At several moments when it may seem silly to the third-party viewer that the cameras are still rolling, one must bare in mind that just because the camera is on doesn't mean that the cameraman is actively filming the events. The operator could have simply forgotten about the camera.

Think about it: if you were filming something and were suddenly scared half-to-death, you wouldn't stop and turn the camera off; you would simply run, and that's exactly what happens in this film in many cases.

At other times, the filmmakers continue filming in order to hold on to some sense of order in the chaos that has engulfed their reality. They are clinging desperately to one of the last remnants of the normal and modern world from which they have been separated by the increasingly menacing woods.

""The Blair Witch Project"" is an intelligent and inventive film that demonstrates what filmmaking is all about: an emotional experience. When a viewer goes in merely expecting something safe and entertaining, he will be sorely disappointed by ""The Blair Witch Project"". Such a case is sad, for the viewer who allows himself to go with this film will experience a truly disturbing and rewarding piece of art.","10"
"KoolCatReviews","If you go out in the woods tonight your sure of big surprise","12 January 2021","The movie is such a surprise in alot of ways. It's creative, innovative and believable. Yes the meduim it delivers is cheap and almost amuterish but it's extremely effective. It doesn't relie on alot of ingredients normal movies do, there's no use of music, no establishing shot, no sub plots. It's almost like a different medium entirely. Of course some movies have tried to use the hand-held camera technique but that feels more like style choise, here it's feels essential. The way the story is told is just iconic,in a trashy 90s, understated way. I wish more directors would take note ; tell and orginal story in an orginal way. This is alot better than most movies with 10x the budget.","9"

It had it's moments but it doesn't live up to the hype. Not a fan but don't hate it. An okay found footage. 5.5/10.","5"
"wishkah7","Excellent!","28 November 1999","I really liked this movie! If you're in the mood for a scary movie, this is the one! I don't normally like scary movies, but I really enjoyed this one! I didn't get a chance to see it in the theaters because it was all jam-packed. But I waited for it to come to video instead! And was it worth the wait!

Heather, Josh, and Michael were all good actors in this. After this movie was made, those three didn't die of mysterious deaths, they become millionaires! Who knows? We might see one of them in a real movie! Also, this movie was all pretend, there never was a legend of the 'Blair Witch' it was just something they made up, but everyone who's seen it already knew that! That's why it's so intriguing!

"CGarcia-2","The best horror movie of 1999, and it DIDN'T come out of Hollywood...thank god!","26 August 1999","What can you say about The Blair Witch Project that hasn't been said about such pioneer, breakthrough horror movies such as Night of the Living Dead, The Exorcist or Texas Chainsaw Massacre...Simply put, the movie is an ""accidental"" work of genius...Yes I know the directors came up with this plot, but when you consider the fact that the actors were not only acting, but improvising the storyline along the way, while also being the camera people, sound people and lighting people for the project...that simply makes this movie the most brilliant independent horror movie ever to be made...Only time will see this movie as such, however...take a look at the list of movies we call ""classics"" today, and see how many of them were hated by critics when they first came out...Fantasia, Vertigo, Psycho, 2001 A Space Odyssey...the list goes on...The sad part of the story isn't so much how many people hate The Blair Witch Project, as it is the fact of WHY they hate it...It doesn't spoonfeed the horror to you...If you need Hollywood special effects to come at you and go BOO in order to scare you, then Blair Witch is not for you...If you have an open mind, and like to use your imagination, then you will love it...Unfortunately, most of today's audience might just not get it...this isn't their own fault, however, since Hollywood has been feeding the audiences so many bland computer effects for the past few years, that today's kids never really learned what REAL horror is all about...I look at it this way...If having a camera aimed at someone who's listening to Orson Welles' 1939 broadcast of ""War of the World"" would intrigue you, then you will definitely love The Blair Witch Project, since its mental stimulation goes far more than any movie made today...However, if you're the type who says ""War of the World"", Yuck....then forget it...Blair Witch Project relies on us using our imaginations, and allowing us to ""think"" about the horror...""what isn't seen is alot scarier than what is"", something that Hollywood forgot along time ago, and unfortunately has desensitized today's audience into becoming nothing more than living robots, not able to use their own minds anymore.","8"
"ash24m","GENUINELY SCARY AND VERY ORIGINAL, A FUTURE CLASSIC!!!!","8 August 1999","I don't care what some people say, this movie to me is way scarier than the exorcist, Well i guess it all depends on what gets you scared, I remember walking along though a wooded path by my house when i was younger and i couldn't see my hand in front of my face and as i walked i would step on a dry leaf because it was fall at the time and a couple of seconds later the leaf would un crunch, It felt like someone was behind me the whole time, That is the kind of unknown fear that is a lot scarier than any special affect could ever conjure up . This movie really reminded me of that time and gave me the allusion that i was with them in those woods, I thought it was so original and really played with the audiences imagination and anyone who says it sucks is just trying to be cool. I'd recommend it to anyone who has a good imagination.","9"
"jeffreygunn","Most overrated film of all time.","4 November 2020","The resin this movie was successful was really because of the studio and production team's foray into viral marketing, one of the first movies to do this. That shows just how naive we were about the internet in the 90's. That can be the only explanation for how this movie made so much money, about $250 mil on a budget under $100,000. If I'd done some viral, guerilla marketing about a film I'd made of paint drying it might have made $100 mil at the time. There's little more to watch in this movie. There's nothing redeeming. The characters are not, they're thoroughly unlikeable. Despite the fact that this is suppose to be real (some people actually thought it was, which unbelievable to me), everything seems manufactured, and in the end nothing happens. Elementary school haunted houses create more tension and horror. This movie's success is unfathomable to me, but then Taylor Swift is successful, which I don't understand either.","2"

"BenT17","Boring, unscary, overrated, horror movie has completely decayed with time","10 November 2018","The Blair Witch Project is known for being an extremely influential horror movie. While it is influental(being it created a new sub genre) everything else in this annoying, lethargic, headache of a movie is completely terrible. I'm convinced that the characters in this movie are amongst the worst in horror movie history. They are more than agitating and all they do the whole movie is argue about a map. They just scream and scream and scream at each other and don't stop. It is infuriating to watch them for 1 and a half hours. The story also goes absolutely nowhere. It starts with somewhat of a promise, but when they go into the woods nothing happens for the rest of the movie(until the horrible last 5 minutes) They walk around lost in a forrest and whine(extensively about the map) and that's pretty much it. It is actually documented that the filmmakers ran out of ideas of what to do with the movie while filming and that the actors improvised most of the lines. You can completely tell because all they do for the runtime is have the same conversations over and over again. They just retread the same material repeatedly. While the The Blair Witch Project admittedly had extremely creative marketing, the film itself is awful. The characters run in circles, the ending is a complete bail out, and unfortunately the movie has completely decayed over time.","1"

"paladin-38","This movie is the punk-rock answer to the baroque excesses of a genre grown tired and self-indulgent.","8 August 1999","Within one month of each other, 2 watershed movies have opened that have, each in their own way, done more to shake the hoary old genre of horror movies to its foundations than any movies in decades.

One is the Blair Witch Project; the other is The Sixth Sense.

The horror genre has been mired for some time in the baroque self-indulgence of superficial and ornamental special effects. The Blair Witch Project has come along like the cinematic equivalent of punk rock---stripping away the self-indulgence to help rediscover the elemental core of the genre.

The Sixth Sense is quite another matter entirely: it is quite simply a great pop movie----deeply felt, humanistic---and almost certain to be overlooked and underestimated. It is a movie that uses the conventions of the horror genre, but bends them to its own purposes. Like the movie ET, which taught us that not all aliens are unfriendly invaders, and in so doing, liberated the alien/sci fi genre.......so to The Sixth Sense steadfastly refuses to view the spirit world as some adolescent frat-party of frights. Instead, it reacquaints us with the age-old lore that tells us that the dead shall walk the earth as long as their spirits are troubled. The dead do not haunt the earth, and our memories, just to scare us---but because they want something from us, some grace note that gives their lives meaning, and settles old hurts and misunderstandings, but not in the immature and vengeful way that the horror genre had descended into. And we the living want something from the deceased who have left us: we want them to be proud of us, to give us their blessing.

And so this movie, incredibly enough for a movie that plays almost straight with the conventions of the horror genre, is a subtle meditation about love and connectedness and relationships, between the living, and between the living and the dead. It is a movie about redemption. And one thing it helps to redeem is the genre that it arises from.","8"
"justinmic-justin","Greatest Horror Movie of all time ***CAUTION:SPOILER ALERT***","10 June 2014","***CAUTION:SPOILER ALERT***The Blair's Witch Project was fantastic but very scary. I am 13 and just watched it nonstop on netflix with no interruptions. I admit I may be too young but I've seen many scary and adult movies. Pulp Fiction The Green Mile The first 3 screams Interview with a vampire The shining and many more I cant think of off the top of my head. But this is a whole new level of creepy. When I put it in I was expecting ghostbusters not Halloween meets jack Nicholson's crazy behavior in the shining meets jaws (when they don't show the witch and the directors skill) When they mentioned it on Dawsons Creek for that one episode I thought maybe it wouldn't be that bad I mean I had gotten to find out about and see Jerry Maguire its a wonderful life and close encounters of the third kind from that show. My mother said it wasn't too bad she just got dizzy from the cameras. ***SPOILER STARTS ABOUT HERE***I did expect it to start off worse but it was pretty calm with the hotel and the interviews. But that just made it better it got my guard down making me expect it to be sorta like that even though in the back of my head I knew it would get worse. And it certainly did. From they left the car it got frightening. The noises in the night especially when they found the rocks. But the worst meaning scary nothing was bad was the bundle. I expected it to just be a piece of josh's clothing when I saw the plaid. But then I heard blood and thought it might be some of his blood what came next I never would have expected. It was body parts like what I thought was a thumb or tooth maybe both and nose. Even that was mild compared to what was coming. The baby crying were nothing compared to josh screaming. Just writing about this freaks me out. From all the seasons of supernatural I've seen I know running into the woods never ends well especially one with a legend of a possessing killer witch 10000000 times worse than the one of the west. My anxiety worsens when I see the old burnt house with symbols and children's handprints on the walls possibly bloody. And just when I don't think it could get even scarier they go into the basement. I was aorta expecting it and aorta not. I remembered the part of the man possessed to kill children in his basement and make one look in the corner while he kills the other and then takes the one in the corner out once hes done and kills that one as well. Once I saw the handprints I thought I kind of knew what was coming but wasn't sure. Once I saw the basement I knew what I signed up for a haunting thrill ride I will never forget. I honestly didn't expect such of a creepy ending I thought I wouldn't get too frightened and would continue my life with another classic under my belt. But. instead I got a whole bother experience. Sorry of I built it up too much even though hopefully if your reading this you've already seen this. You see Mike standing facing the corner not moving to heather's screams. Then you see the camera fall to the ground film for a few more seconds until credits appear. I am proud to say I understood the connection the second I saw Mike. I am not proud to say I have never been this scared in my life. Incoviniently on a school night and its almost 11:40. I really hope parents wont allow their child to watch this. I'm 13 and I've seem many scary things.Butafterseeing this I'm ready to jump in bed with my father. I certainly thought I would come out of this unscathed but I am jumping at every noise (doesn't help I have cats) and I cant turn off the light let alone sleep and from what I've heard many grown adult have done the same maybe even worse. Its up to you but I strongly advise you to have only adults watch it unless parents want them sleeping with them until the kids 17 (no exaggeration) they should refrain from letting them watch it. But as I said earlier its your call. I have a feeling I will be mortified for a long time. Most readers may think Imjust a kid who got scared from a little horror movie so if you doubt me watch it inahouse with many windows and a doer connecting to a porch right next to it. At 9:00 To 10:00 with no lights on all alone then tell me its just me when people over 20 years old are totally freaked out. Sorry for any mispronunciations and errors it may be my dialect or spell check.

"MikeT-9","Original But Over-Hyped","16 August 1999","Add another over-hyped film to the worst batch of summer movies in recent memory. I just saw this movie, and I and the three other people I was with just didn't see the big deal. OK, it's like nothing I've ever seen before - granted. It's also like nothing I ever want to see again. I work in the video production business, so believe me, I was happy to see something like that on the big screen. I wanted to like it, but I didn't.

I guess if you're not expecting much, the BWP is something of an accomplishment, and I did think about the last scene for awhile after the film was over. But an hour and a half build-up for a few creepy seconds isn't worth my seven-fifty. Don't get me wrong, I wasn't expecting buckets of blood and scary monsters. I think that's what sunk ""The Haunting"" - showing too much when you don't need too. But the fact that it all hinges on seeming real, when you know it isn't, works against it. OK - all movies are fake, but good ones seem real within their own worlds. Because this film tries to make you think it's ""real fear"" on screen, it somehow just seems all the more fake.

The BWP has been plugged as being the ""new face of horror"", or ""the scariest movie in years"", etc...well, it isn't. For being a very non-traditional Hollywood movie, it ultimately suffers from the same studio-generated buzz that plagues most of the big blockbusters.

The Blair Witch Project is a movie that is based on mood, atmosphere, and suggestion. When someone is sitting by you making stupid comments, this is ruined.

A think there are two groups of people who have been bashing this movie, the teenagers who were looking for a gory, dead bodies everywhere, special effect laden, scare fest, and the people who might actually enjoy the movie if it wasn't for the first group ruining it. Please, if you might be in the first group, either don't go or sit there quietly, because some of us actually want to enjoy the movie for what it is a suggestive work based on atmosphere and mood!

I suggest that if you want to see the movie, you either wait until the crowds go down or go at twi-light when few other people are there. This way you will be able to enjoy the movie fully.

"Meredith-7","Overrated","20 November 1999","I had waited ages to see this film, there had been so much hype after its release in the U.S that I thought it must be really good. What a disappointment. I had read the dossier and seen the documentary Curse of the Blair Witch and had heard people rave about it for months. So my expectations were high- but what an absolute bore. This film is not scary ( for the most part) unless you believe that its true. There is little tension in the first 45 minutes, with the only real terror occurring in the last five minutes- something I could probably have done without. It certainly is eerie, and it certainly kept me awake at night- but I was expecting something more. The woods have unfortunately been a lot scarier in other films ( try Twin Peaks)which was part of its downfall. The film is really original, and the camera work was done very well (documentary style) but it still didn't hold my attention. I found the characters really irritating, especially Heather who evidently had no sense of self preservation. It plays a lot like a student film- I suppose its meant to but I just found it quite boring for the most part and really nothing more than a clever marketing ploy- for which the film makers should be congratulated. However, as a film standing on its own it just does not make the grade. Very Disappointing",NA

You still get solid believable acting accurately conveying the rising fear of being lost in the woods (for those of you also with experience of wild camping). And it offers an interesting mythology, with one memorably-chilling scene involving kids' voices and tent-abuse.

I never felt bored, but my partner did. So if you haven't seen it and enjoy the found-footage films I mentioned earlier then it's still recommended, just prepare yourself for a more subtle, less graphic experience (even less graphic than the minimalist Paranormal Activity 1).","8"
"Dries Gevaert","This will psychologically kill you.","20 July 2000","Whow. Most horror movies don't scare me, mostly because you just get scared for one moment (like when someone's walking into a dark hallway and the killer jumps in front of him), and because those movies are very often just one big cliché. But this really scared the s**t out of me. This is not jumping in front of someone and stabbing him, this is psychologically killing someone. Here's how you do that: First, scare the victims with some weird voodoo stuff they'd rather don't want to have anything to do with. Then torture them by taking away something they really need, their sleep for example, scare them so hard they live the whole day in fear of the night. And ultimately, literally scare them to death by letting them now there's no escape. They'll surely gonna go totally insane, and maybe they might kill themselves. If they don't you'll do it.`

Finally an original concept in a movie, I haven't seen that for a long time. It's too bad that the geniuses who came up with this idea didn't get a bigger budget... Actually, it isn't, because being suck a low budget movie adds to the realism of this movie (it's supposed to be found footage so it's gotta be crappy). There's no other way of making this movie. It's great, and I think it's too bad that some people can't see that. They'll probably walk into the theater or the video store think they're gonna be amused (that's what most people think after 3 Screams, 2 Last Summers and dozens of other copies). But this is the type of movie that is made to crawl under your skin and eat you slowly from the inside out.

Another thing that those people probably didn't like is that you don't know half the story. EVERY Hollywood movie has a complete story with a beginning, an ending and stuff happening in the middle, and the viewer sees everything. This movie is in fact not a movie, as the makers try to tell you that it's just a bunch of found footage put together. And of course the camera's not always running, so there's no continuous story. Which leaves you with some big holes to fill after the movie. One solution is the website that caused the hype when the movie was in theaters and which made me go hire the movie. But it doesn't answer all of your questions, in fact it just adds to the mystery of the whole thing.

Acting. That would be nice in this movie, some people who could put down a credible personage (not someone famous, that would be real stupid, someone who is unknown and took acting classes). I think Heather is about the only one who really made me think that this was real (and that is what the movie is about, right?). Josh and Mikey overact most of the time. I noticed that if you watch the actors closely the movie seems less scary, probably because you see that they're just acting.

The atmosphere created by the people who made this (actors, editors, directors, marketing guys and webmasters) is great, it crawls under your skin and makes the movie scare the hell out of you. That atmosphere is what made this 100,000 $ movie a million dollar blockbuster. Since there was no directing at all (the directors just sent the actors in the woods with their equipment and the script), s****y acting in some scenes, some dumb things in the story (map, runaway) and an empty feeling at the end, I rate this movie a 9/10","9"
"lagriff05","I'm at a loss for words","16 June 2007","This is the storied ""classic"" of 90s horror, filmed in the woods by a bunch of kids from UCF, from what I understand. It's about three college students doing a documentary about the ""Blair Witch"", and it goes well until they end up lost in the woods. The movie descends into a spiral of minimalistic fear and uncertainty. Quite a different film from what people in 1996 were used to.

Is it a good movie? Not really. Does it work as a horror film, and is it scary? Sure, why not. This is a very minimalistic movie, no special effects or costumes or anything. No makeup. Just a bunch of kids trying to scare people, and it worked. This is some very creepy stuff at times. While it inspired countless lame knock-offs and independent films after it, I can't deny that this is a milestone. Nobody had seen anything like this before. The woods make for a very creepy setting, and the actors do their jobs surprisingly well for an indie film.

It sort of starts somewhere and then just...ends at random. Like a journey that you'd take, a pilgrimage. No climactic ending and no clear-cut introduction. Unique way to do a movie, for sure, but it's not really the pinnacle of film-making. There isn't any 'good triumphs evil' story, and it's all pretty bleak and dark. Not exactly the kind of thing you want when you feel depressed.

I'm sort of at a loss for words at this one. It's just something every horror fan has to see in their lifetime, at least once. No rating, it's too hard to decide for this kind of film.",NA

"Kauffman","A real movie.","30 July 1999","It has been a couple of weeks since I saw this film on a preview. At that time, I knew NOTHING about it except its stated premise: 3 filmmakers are lost in the woods and a year later their footage is found. So I went, very sure that this was not the actual case. The ending credits belied the premise. It was ""only a movie"" after all. Yet, throughout, I found myself involved and then I would pull myself out and say, ""would they really do that."" I must tell you. For pure veracity, this film is unbeatable. It could be exactly what it says. To think such an effective film could be made for under $50,000, and have such talented actors, that the actors were the camera operators and improvise their lines, and that we see absolutely nothing that is inherently frightening, is quite amazing. Everything that scares us is what we do not see. This is one of the best conceived film projects I have ever seen. It uses its medium (this could be done in NO other art form) and hits where it intends. By the way, on a more prosaic level such as was the directing/writing good? the performances sound? YES! Every element was excellent, and Heather Donahue deserves an Oscar nomination.","10"

"Mike-DD","Headache-inducing","23 August 2000","Although I quite enjoyed this film with its 'innovative' first-persons filming style, I was disappointed at the end when there weren't any witches to be seen at all. All we can see throughout the whole movie were the three main actors, with spooky sounds and jerky footage of the 'scary' surroundings. While I admit that the thought of being caught alone by yourselves lost in the middle of some scary forest is scary, the film could do a bit better by maybe slipping in some footage of 'scary' objects like a fleeting glimpse of a white shawl floating or something. And the jerkiness of the movie gave me (and my friends)an immense headache and nausea during the 2nd half of the show, that didn't subside until about half hour after the show ended. While the big-screen effect of a theater is desirable, I'd advise most to watch it on video at home - that way, you can pause and rest for a while if you start getting a headache.","6"

Not only is this one of my favourite horrors of all time but the suspense, to me, is unmatched by most horrors. The acting feels immensely realistic and the black and white shots before they sleep are beautifully terrifying. This film is how you make a low budget horror scary. The fact we never see the witch or what happens to the characters perfectly set up a sequel and as an audience member, you feel how trapped the characters are. Fantastic!","9"

And I think that is why some people liked it and others didn't. If you don't have a huge imagination then of course it's not gonna be freaky.

"danielll_rs","Scary?! Is it a joke?!","3 October 1999","I can say that ""The Blair Witch Project"" is the most disappointing film I've ever seen. I was expecting something very creepy and impressing, but that's what I saw: three annoying and dumb amateur actors (specially Heather Donahue, that doesn't stop screaming and groaning) who don't divide their fear with the audience. Result: I simply hated this film.

OK, there are no special effects, but it isn't a reason to bore us. The directors expected to put the audience as a 'fourth character' but they couldn't come even close to this. Only the 'actors' were scared. Telling the true: Snow White's witch stepmom is much scarier than the little Blair witch, who doesn't frighten even a child afraid of monsters from outer space.

Everytime I expected the night to come in the film, but nothing happened and the morning always came again.

And the end? There's no end and we think: 'Oh! Why did I spend my precious money with this piece of crap?' ""The Blair Witch Project"" tries to be a journey about fear, but it is nothing but a film that makes you feel dizzy.

Don't waste your money! Avoid it at all costs!","2"

"JetBanana","With the right frame of mind, this is a truly horrifying film.","29 November 2007","*Not quite sure if what i wrote about the ending could be considered a spoiler but i thought i should warn you anyways*

I have to be totally honest, I have never really been scared by a movie ever in my life. I was sick of all these cheap horror flicks coming out that just have dark and ""creepy"" atmosphere, but nothing more than a few jumps that really try to scare you. But The Blair Witch Project, although very contemporary, may have been the most frightening movie i have ever seen. I mean this one truly scared me. Granted I'm already kind of afraid of the woods, but the concept and realism of the film really puts a fear into you as if you're living the experience with them.

The key to watching and enjoying this movie is to make sure you're keeping an open mind and taking it for what it is. The film is trying to portray ""footage of three filmmakers who went missing in the woods"" and if you can imagine yourself being the one to find this footage, it can really scare you.

Now keep in mind that this definitely is not your typical movie in the sense that there is no traditional introduction of characters, plot basis, and there is not much of a resolution. Although the ending does leave you with a certain uncertaincy that would not make the end as terrifying as it is if you had seen what they had seen. The sheer mystery surrounding the final moments of the rolling camera are what leaves you with the fear still dwelling inside and the idea of dread they must have felt.

This is a movie that almost demands your participation in the sense that you need to be living the situation with the characters to get the full effect. So please don't sit there waiting to get scared the whole time, because if you're going to sit there and try to take it all in, it's not going to happen. So be attentive and don't expect to be at the edge of your seat throughout the whole movie; the movie is very real to life in that it's like day to day bickering of three filmmakers and their experience with the myth they are pursuing.

Hope you enjoy it as much as I did!","8"

"chmollo","The sociology of IMDb user comments","26 February 2005","I've looked at reviews for lots of movies on IMDb, but this one appears to take the cake as far as polarising people's opinions. It's either complete crap or complete genius. And there are 3066 user comments, so it seems to force people to say something about it! I wonder which movies have more user comments than that? Anyway, I watched this on DVD at night alone, so I guess I set it up that it would scare me. And that fact that I had to go to IMDb the day after to see what other people thought about it is testimony to the fact that it stayed with me. It helped having the filmmakers' commentary track on it to put it back into perspective, though. Clever idea. I wonder how much the actors knew about in the final scene though, 'cause the commentary says the actors didn't know they were going to the house and then the crew decks them when they get to the basement - we don't see them on film/video, so we have to assume the actors didn't either. The actors must have really trusted those guys!",NA
"llihilloh","This insults my intelligence.","8 December 2000","I can't believe any of this. One, who would agree to take part in the making of this? And two, who would pay money to view one of the worst movies ever made? (That is strictly my opinion and I know that I am pretty much the only person that hates this so bear with me.)

When The Blair Witch Project first came out on video to rent, I did rent it. I had heard such rave reviews about it so I couldn't resist. Took it home, watched it, and almost hit myself for allowing me to stoop to such low standards. What can I say? It was definitely the most ridiculous film I have ever seen.

I just don't understand what they even attempted at making this. Yes, they were trying to recreate the real story by mixing in stuff with previous knowledge, but I don't think that this is something capable of being recaptured on tape.

Am I the only one that looks for smart, meaningful movies? I want to watch a movie that has some decent writing, an interesting plot, some REAL actors, and NOT a home video that I could have just as easily shot. Is today's society and film goers really this generic? I'm using generic because you couldn't ask for anything more simpler. This is a home movie with no point to it.

As to the people who claim this is frightening and/or scary, you have no idea of what scary is. After I saw this, every time I would hear someone say that they were so scared throughout the whole film, I just wanted to give them a copy of...well, something besides this that WAS scary.

A lot of words can be used to describe The Blair Witch Project and I can't think of any good ones. Just when I thought that it couldn't get any worse, it did. The ending was such a ridiculous let down. They go down to the basement, the camera drops, and poof! it's over.

Maybe if this film had some writing (besides the 'f' word), some talented actors, an interesting story to go off of, and just about everything else needed for a movie, it might stand a chance. This was ruined way before it was ever released at the theaters.

The only thing this movie gave me was a headache. The constant movement of the camera along with that so scary running scene through the dark was as poorly created as you can get. Another thing it made me want to do was yell at Heather telling her to wipe the damn snot off her nose.",NA

It's just one of those movies that your either going to hate or like a great deal. I happened to like this film a great deal. It was filmed only 15 minutes from where I live and I have heard the story many times. The writers of the movie went to Wheaton high school which is also a short distance from my home. So you can imagine why I liked this movie. It is not just that, the Blair Witch Project takes a whole new perspective on horror films. It is more realistic and lacks the fake blood and guts of todays horror movies. This horror flick is related closer to The Exorcist or Rosemary's Baby then anything else. It is the kind of horror movie that makes you think (could this be true). There were really three kids who went deep into the unknown forest to do a project on the Blair Witch.

Hmmmmmmmm.....well, I liked the way the filmmakers set up their story in the early scenes, giving background in to the whole Blair Witch legend, and there was the promise of a few mild chills.....but I found most of everything from the mid-section on to be rather tedious. There were a couple of things that really kind of negated the whole thing for me. The characters behaved increasingly more stupidly and illogically as the movie ran on (not TOO different from any other horror/slasher film, eh?). And I know it's supposed to me a mock documentary but let me ask you this: If you're awakened in the dead of the night out in the forest and scared totally witless, would you REALLY take the time and bother to pick up a video camera and film yourself as you're running away??? NO!! You're terrified!! Forget the camera!! You'd just take off running like your very life depended on it!! I'm not normally one to sit and actively poke holes into a story like this, but that fact just bugged me. Maybe it's because of all the hype and people (even big-time critics) falling all over themselves and calling this a new classic...well, I don't buy it! It's a nice try, but the entire group of people I went to see this with also gave it an ""is that all there is?"" shrug. It just isn't all it's cracked up to be.","4"
"cofemug","Great movie, not for the weak-stomached","8 August 1999","I really liked this movie even though it made me sick to my stomach. No, it is not from the gore. It was from the camera work. Do not see this movie is you are easily susceptible to motion sickness. I don't know if Dramamine will work but it sure could not hurt. The camera work makes you think that you are walking and running with the people, but you are standing still, so you get sick. Trust me, this actually happens.I have heard, however, that if you rent it the effect will not happen. However, the movie itself was great. It was kind of creepy and it had an overall real effect, plus the ending just kicks.

Plot: Three kids making a documentery dissappear, and then their footage is found. Basically you watch their documentary. The movie is, although I have heard that it resembles The Last Broadcast, which I have not seen, is unlike any other movie I have ever seen. It feels like a documentary. If you become creeped out, just think that it is only a movie.

Acting: Resembled the actual downfall of human thinking. It was superb and realistic. You actually feel that the people are reacting to what is around them. You will know these people and what makes them tick by the end of the movie. It will feel like they are your friends. In fact, their personalities are quite common.

This movie was a genuinely creepy movie, and I highly recommend it to everyone, with Dramamine. Or just wait for video. But, if you can get past it, see it with everyone else at the theater. You will be shocked with everyone else. Although not a jumpy movie, it will freak you out of your mind.---------9","9"
"HarryC13","The Blair Witch Mystique: Fiction Well Done","26 August 1999","Such a mystique surrounds ""The Blair Witch Project."" I don't know why so many people are so hung up on the movie being ""real."" So what if it's fiction? It's well-done fiction. It didn't take away from ""The Fly"" for me to know that giant mutant flies don't really exist ... nor did it take away from ""The Howling"" to know that werewolves don't exist. Why all the squawking about this being truth rather than fiction?

I think the fact that it's filmed with relatively primitive equipment, and in a ""realistic"" manner, contributes to some people's refusal to believe it's fabrication. Also, while the Internet has hyped many a movie, ""Blair Witch"" makes more extensive use of this medium (and adds the ""Curse of the Blair Witch"" special on Sci-Fi.) So some of the more gullible of us, thinking anything we read or see on TV must be true, believe it.

I personally think it's somewhat frightening that we confuse the carefully done websites and the Sci-Fi special -- which dispense mythology specifically created to heighten the Blair Witch experience -- with factual news reporting. Get a grip, people. The websites and the special are absolutely BRILLIANT from the standpoint of adding to the feeling of realism surrounding the movie.

"HarryC13","The Witching Hour (well, 87 minutes)","20 August 1999","I used to review books and movies professionally, so I hope my comments will add a few fresh perspectives. First, let me say that it's obvious that this is not the kind of movie that everyone will like. People biased against seeing horror films won't; people who want technical perfection in the filmmaking process won't; people who want an airtight and tightly wound plot won't. And I agree that the film has its problems - lots of gratuitous profanity, a tendency to drag about two-thirds through, and some plot points that aren't entirely clear. For example, I didn't tie in how some of the residents' brief comments in the beginning affected the movie's ending (and various other events). But they do impact it. Maybe I just need to be hit over the head, but I didn't get it the first time around.

All that said: I love `The Blair Witch Project.' Took me two viewings to really appreciate it. The first time, I found it fascinating  and the second time, I found it scary, especially when I `got' the ending. Scariest movie ever? No. But for a combination of scary and interestingly done, it scores big points.

Unlike some reviewers, I found the acting very realistic. Some of the negative reviews I've read cite problems: The actors wouldn't have done this or that, usually. One reviewer said student filmmakers are very savvy these days, and the filming wouldn't have been that rough around the edges. He said this totally spoiled the movie for him. Lighten up  all fiction, and especially horror fiction, requires suspension of disbelief. And horror films are notorious for having plot holes, unlikely things happening, and people going where they shouldn't. In fact, in a lot of horror flicks, if people acted realistically there would be no plot! And obviously fake studio-lot trees and dry-ice `fog' certainly didn't keep `The Wolf Man' from being a horror classic, at least not for me.

I also disagree that finding out how the film was made or that it isn't a true story make it a lesser experience. Sure didn't for me. And I'm glad to see some other comments here that tell me I'm not the only one with the `hangover' effect  it ran across my mind for days after I saw it. By the nature of its filming, Blair Witch gets a little vague in its plot sometimes, but it more than makes up for this with its freshness and genuine thrills.

I also appreciate the intricate Internet and TV framework of mythology  what negative reviewers call `hype' -- that's been built up around the movie. I think it's a stroke of genius.

There's talk of a sequel. Personally, I'd like to see a `prequel' built around the Blair Witch mythology created on the film's home page and in the Sci-Fi special, `Curse of the Blair Witch.'

All in all, I'd rate this right up there with `The Exorcist' and the original version of `The Haunting' as the best of the post-1960 horror films. Although each has its own special brand of horror, each keeps its place well secured in my memory. As to those who are disappointed that they didn't `see the witch' or needed some presence to scare them, blame modern horror cinema for spoiling them with special effects and gore. Those who don't like the film for these reasons would never `get' a classic ghost story.","9"

This movie is so amazing. With films like this, the shlock that Kevin Williamson pumps out should be banned. Williamson's ""grip on teens"" doesn't do jack for the audiences watching The Blair Witch Project. The characters--which are simply some of the best and most able to be cared for--aren't 20 somethings with great vocabulary and total perfection. No, they're REAL. They are just like you and me. They're like friends you know at school. Or, they are you. And you are them. In the woods. Lost. Hearing those sounds in the far distance, and coming across those sights that will be burned into your mind forever.

I hate ""trendy horror."" Movies like Scream, Scream 2, I Know What You Did Last Summer, I Still Know What You Did Last Summer, and The Faculty--along with many others--are some of the lowest forms of horror around. And so many other films with such potential follow them. The Mummy, for example, tried to be funny, taking after some of these films. The Mummy was a horrible movie. All these movies are so bad, but so many people like them. I can't see why. Now we've got another sickening teen-horror-comedy coming out called ""Teaching Miss Tingle."" First of all, it is a rip off of the amazingly gripping novel ""Killing Mr. Griffin,"" by Lois Duncan. Second of all, it's predictable already. You know what's going to happen. And you know what the characters are going to be like. You will never connect with them. And the movie will be terrible.

My point is that The Blair Witch Project is real. All of it is reality, in a fiction movie. The characters are real, the story is real, and the fear is real. Though the whole movie is fiction, you can't say that, or, ""It's only a movie"" with this one. It's like reality, on film. And by the time Heather and Mike get to that old house--which is one of the most horrific scenes ever in horror history--you will feel their fear, and you will wish that you could save them. This is definitely the next Texas Chainsaw Massacre, which was a lot like The Blair Witch Project. It scared you because you felt the realism in it. And like these movies, the next true horror movie will come many years later.

I completely and totally recommend The Blair Witch Project. But don't watch it for the expected scares, but for it's psychological terror. And if you're going to see Blair Witch, PLEASE rent Texas Chainsaw Massacre. It is just as good, if not better.",NA

I just rented this film and I feel like I wasted the money on it. Maybe if I hadn't known it was a movie and had thought it was real, I might have gotten into it alittle more, but even then, it would still have bored me to tears. All that happens is three people get lost in the woods, cry alot, say the F word after every single word and a few other four letter words just to add dialogue. They find some laughable scarecrow stick figures in the woods, big deal. One of them wanders off, big deal. The remaining two cry some more and whine alot. They find a pile of sticks with a weird bloody thing in it, a little strange, but not really scary. They find a falling apart house, think they hear the missing guy calling to them. They run all around the house with the camera, screaming alot. Finally go in the basement and......nothing. End of film. Boring, boring, boring! I can't even imagine a more boring film. If you want to see three people yell at each other, whine and cry alot for over an hour, this is your film. Otherwise, don't even bother to pick this one up. It's an overhyped piece of junk. The only good thing about the film is the concept itself. The idea of making a documentary (mockumentary) about the Blair Witch and that the film crew disappears was very good. But the movie itself, sucked. I'm sure people who copy the concept will do a much better job of actually scaring us.",NA

This was a movie which began as a sleeper, but quickly gathered a lot of hype. Although I thought the movie was just OK, I probably would have liked it a lot more if I hadn't heard all the hoopla. Also, I would have appreciated it more if I knew that the movie was largely improvised (and shot) by the players themselves. And I thought the ending (which, as I said, I won't reveal) was fantastic. All in all, I suppose it was worth being totally annoyed by the three protagonists for the first two-thirds of the movie.

"ghoul-3","BWP Final thoughts and some suggestions","7 August 1999","[Editor's note: this comment contains a minor SPOILER]

I have posted to newsgroups and the IMDb a number of times, especially concerning The Blair Witch Project. I have had a ton of response, mostly favorable, to my less than enthusiastic review and commentary of and on this film. The review was based on a screening copy I was able to pick up on the film. The video looked good while the sound left a bit to be desired. Still I felt that my tape was a 'good enough' representation of BWP.

Briefly, I thought the film was a 'nice try' but fell way short of it's own potential, and other than the final ten minutes, was simply not scary. I have to admit that the advance hype played a part in my disappointment but even if I had known nothing about this movie in advance, I would have still felt that it was just an interesting concept but nothing much more than that.

All through this and other newsgroups people have been saying that in order to fully appreciate this movie you need to see it theatrically. So....I did at a huge AMC theater with a packed house.

The presentation itself in a large theater wasn't anything helpful to my original review of the film...if anything it hurt the movie considerably more. Now....the annoying overacting of Heather....was simply more noticeable on a large screen and the sloppy editing was a lot sloppier on the big screen...and the sound wasn't much better.

Overall the acting in this movie is pretty decent but when it IS 'wooden,' boy does that come through on a huge screen! The low budget look of the film doesn't matter one way or another to me...it never did...but the sound DOES.

I believe the sound is essential in a movie that doesn't have any visual efx to speak of, so when our movie-makers are awakened by creepy sounds, we should be able to hear it in such a way as to duplicate their experience! When Heather screams ""it's all around us!"" we should be hearing it 'all around us' in the theater. Artisan should have taken this 'little' home-made movie and added Dolby-Digital efx! (or at lease basic surround) They do it all the time with older mono movies released to DVD....it would have been easy to do it here...and I don't care what anyone says...it would have helped the effectiveness of this film and it would have not taken anything away from the simplistic nature of BWP.

Which brings me to another important point.

I am tired of people defending this rather poorly made movie by suggesting that it's 'rawness' is some kind of important cinematic event or a horror movie 'first.' While I too am tired of overblown efx-laden movies, it has nothing to do with my general dislike for Blair Witch Project."" These people that are criticizing and insulting those that do not appreciate BWP by insinuating that we're just obsessed with and desire huge budgets with lots of efx, are insane! I think that what we wanted out of BWP is something a little better than we ultimately got!

Hell....I just wanted to be a little scared...instead of bored! That's just my opinion...if you found it scary...that's fine....but don't insult and make insinuations about those people that dared to NOT be scared or like this film all that much, as if it would be their DUTY to do so.

The audience I sat with in this large AMC theater mostly laughed at the dialogue and traded comments about 'overracting' and 'i want my money back.' One young woman actually stood up in her seat and yelled ""this sucks!"" when the film ended. Her and her husband left the theater angrily. I didn't see anyone walking out 'excited' about this movie (and I looked hard for that reaction) and I didn't see anyone who looked 'scared' or visibly 'disturbed' (I looked for that too) What I did see were people who were p**sed off because they had been 'duped' by a movie and it's oh-so-clever marketing ploy along with mass enthusiasm from general movie-goers and critics who were 'bowled over' by the film's raw look and documentary feel, as if those traits alone made BWP something truly special in the annals of horror films...something worth 'trumpeting' like it was the greatest or one of the greatest horror movies of all time.

Yes....they felt duped...and they had every right to feel so.

Finally...here's my list of ways to improve this movie, because I truly believe that if Artisan and Haxan would have just slowed down and made some improvements to this film before rushing it into theatrical release, we would ultimately have had a better film, and one that would satisfy most viewers.

1. Add at least twenty minutes of the cut interview footage (Seen on Sci-Fi's ""Curse of the Blair Witch."") and intersperse it between the hand-held p.o.v. stuff that really gets annoying at times. (I mean... c'mon Heather shoots everything and I mean everything!) This is how ""Cannibal Holocaust"" handled a similar idea and it worked much better.

2. Cut some of the yelling and arguing 'about being lost' scenes. I lost sympathy for the characters, especially Heather, when we have to sit through one scream session after another. These were primarily the places in the film where the acting is wooden and one can easily lose patience with the movie.

3. Shorten the time on screen of the discovered creepy things; rocks, things in trees, etc. I feel that went on too long. If you're going to make a movie with the idea that 'less is more,' then it has to be applied to everything, not just the technical quality of the film and the story development.

4. Re-edit the final ten minutes. We go from Heather's somewhat effective 'goodbye' speech directly into the discovery of the house. There needed to be a little rest-stop in-between...a 'build-up' if you will. Perhaps even a non-eventful night, followed by a short quiet day (instilling false hope into the characters and more sympathy for them from us because we KNOW that this doesn't have a happy ending.

5. Add a defined surround track...so we experience 'all around us' what the characters on the screen are experiencing during both subtle (normal woods day sounds) and terrifying moments. (screams, kids laughing, crackling, foot-steps, etc.)

6. Any why not at least one element that makes us jump? There were numerous opportunities to do so. I could have seen Heather running madly into the woods and into frame suddenly comes Mike or Josh 'or something else' colliding with her. That would NOT have put this movie into familiar typical horror movie range, it would have added a simple much needed scare.

(I know I'm probably going to get crucified for that statement)

7. Re-do the end credits that indicate far too much material that we didn't actually see; interviews with family, friends, and law-enforcement, etc. There were some really angry reactions in the theater during this part from those that stayed to watch the credits.

8. Get rid of the dumb cliched 'electronica' that we hear during these credits. Personally I like silently crawling white credits on a black screen and the 'electronica' here only 'cheapens' this movie and goes against it's own style and intent.

9. Quit this dumb rambling suggesting that BWP is real. The marketing people have relied on that to build too much into this insignificant story....and numerous people are falling for it. The average intelligent film-goer should be able to tell in about five minutes that this is just fiction and improvisation.

10. Never allow Heather to do another interview. I saw her on Leno last night and she was obnoxious, silly and did nothing for the credibility of this film.

Those are my ways to improve this movie.

This post is my opinion and I know there are many who will not share my viewpoints, which is fine. I am both frustrated and angered about all the attention BWP is getting. It's success is mostly undeserved. I believe that it's box-office take is due to the money spent by the curious who are reacting to all the hype and not much else. I also believe that BWP's success will be short-lived, profitable yes....but short lived, leaving the film a minor source of curiosity...the movie equivalent to a 'one hit wonder' Soon...BWP will just be a memory and we all, including me, will move on to something more important. Another horror movie will come along to get us JUSTIFIABLY excited.

God do I look forward to that day.

But... cinematography? horror? scary? I don't think so. Please generation nixers, do not compare this movie to Tex 1, that movie was innovation (capital i), George Romero was innovation. I do agree with a lot of horrorfans that when mainstream Hollywood discovered that horror=$$, it lost most of its underground, non-PC avant la lettre, character.

"Ianfidel","Definitely worth seeing---but.....","25 July 1999","While I really enjoyed watching The Blair Witch Project, the experience would have been far better in an empty theatre. To become completely absorbed in the events on screen, there really needs to be utter silence in the theatre. Unfortunately, crowds in Baltimore haven't totally mastered the art of staying quiet during a film. That said, Blair Witch works much better if you take the events onscreen as factual. Actually, even knowing that it is fictional does not detract from the experience too much, but it's certainly far more frightening if taken as reality.

In some sense, the movie reminded me of Michael Powell's masterpiece Peeping Tom, made in the early sixties. Both films were far more frightening in a psychologically realistic way than in a gore/shock way. Blair Witch seemed as much a consideration of how we view films as an out and out horror film. It's quite short, and upon the fairly abrupt ending (which was perfectly fine by me), many people in the theatre said quite loudly, ""That's IT?!?"" Granted, it's impossible to escape idiots in society, but I would still highly recommend the film, only in a far more empty (or mature) theatre than the one in which I saw it.","8"
"psycho_153","AVERAGE, ALL THE HYPE WRECKED IT!!","26 December 1999","Okay when I went to watch this there was a lot of hype, of how this was the scariest movie of all time, the best low budget flick, but I think all that hype wrecked the effect of the film. Many people went in knowing what was happening, I think it would have been much more better if I went in knowing nothing and then yeah it might have been scary. The people reviewing it were maybe the first to see it, they new nothing about it and it was scary. But since that didn't happen, when I saw it I thought the Blair Witch Project was an average movie. Not really scary when watching it.(nothing scary happened) Overall it would have been a great movie but all the hype wrecked the whole atmosphere. I've heard about Cannibal Holocaust which is meant to be pretty much the same as BWP but it was made in the 70's. A group go in to the jungle to make a documentary on cannibals, they are lost, footage found and we see there footage. An BWP is meant to be original.","7"

I was quite pleasantly surprised at the very genuine humor that is evident throughout the first part of the film. Then as the tone darkened and things began to go wrong, the movie kept me quite focused and frightened until the last scene (which was, by the way, PERFECTLY done).

I really think that Blair Witch will do for the woods what Jaws did for the beach and Psycho did for seedy roadside motels and showers. And I as I told my husband, I am NOT going camping any time soon. Especially not anywhere near Maryland. grin","10"
"uffe-5","Had to set another comment after reading some of the other comments.","16 October 1999","**Warning for spoilers** **Sorry for some spellingmisstakes** Let's put it this way. You people who don't like this movie has many reasons not to, but no one of them really is fair. I have read almost all comments and I keep seeing the same misstake in the ''bad'' comments: You don't seem to understand it. 1. Is it scary with a pile of rocks? Answer: YES, YES, YES! I bet if you heared some strange noise in the night, and wakes up to find a pile of rocks outside your tent, you would be scared as hell! 2. Heather annoying? Answer: NO, NO, NO! Isn't her reaction pretty realistic? I mean, let's face it: One of your best friends disappear without a trace (you ALSO hear him screaming in the night, but something is wrong, it isn't him) and someones teeths poppes up. Anyone, exept for Superman, would panic and, yes, scream.

3. Throw up for the cameras? Answer: This was one of the stupid comments? What did you want them to do? Keep the camera straight, even though the circumstanses? I don't think so. Didn't you know before you saw TBWP, that the camera would be like this through the entire movie? Some other comments think that it's boring, probably just because that it is not like any other horrorfilm. They maybe want to see the actual creature, but HEY! That's the scary thing about a horrormovie isn't it? The unseen evil... You know that something is out there, but you never get to see it, or at least get a clear shot. That freaks, at least me, out. You guys probably wondered where the music were, or ''where did all the gore and effects go? isn't this a horrormovie''? Yes, it is. But it is a horrormovie that is very, very, very, very scary without anything of that in it. Only using a large forest, some voodostuff, and human minds and then making a masterpiece, is pure cinema art. And something we don't see every day.",NA
"Alcaminhante","Could have been brilliant...","28 July 2000","This is going to be a very inchoerent text, i´m sure, because to tell you the truth i still don´t know what to make of this movie. I don´t know, and as probably i never will, i decided to write this, and decide on the spot what i think about THE BLAIR WITCH...hemm...thing.

First of all, i can´t understand how many people were fooled into thinking, this was real life footage. There´s a particulary scene where two of the characters are having a discussion and the third one is filming everything, then one of the characters who were fighting changes place with the guy holding the camera, and goes in front of camera continuing the discussion, while the other now keeps filming the whole thing. Now... Wouldn´t it be more natural, when a discussion broke out, that the guy holding the camera, would put it aside or droped it on the floor so he could break the fight apart ?... Why keep filming the whole thing and then trade places with one of the persons figihting ?

It´s clear that they wanted the figth on camera, so that would create the ""classic"" tense moment between friends when lost. Just this scene would be enough for me to get realy suspicious.

So, apart from this...is this a good movie ? Well...where´s the movie ?...It´s a cool scam, a very good idea, with a great marketing campain.

As for the movie, if the idea of random shots of trees and people walking around in the same place for about an hour is appealing to you, then go right ahead. I mean, there are ""empty"" films where aparently nothing much is going on but are very profound sideways like David Lynch´s "" A Straight Story"", and then there are films where nothing is going on at all like BLAIR WITCH, wich as far as i know doesn´t have any deep meaning or philosophy behind... I´m not totaly against this, because at least i think it´s a very original experience particulary nowadays where all the films have a very stylized look, but it´s no great movie.

If you want an horror movie, with a crude raw look, then go rent THE EVIL DEAD instead. Or Peter Jackson´s BAD TASTE. Now this is how you make a very low no-budget production with imagination. And i´m not talking about special effects. The problem with BLAIR WITCH is its emptiness where nothing happens, where not even the location changes. It´s not scary. It´s just boring. If the idea was to create some suspance, well it works at the begining, but then what ? The scene in the tent is brilliant and very well acomplished. I only wished the whole movie was as creepy as this segment. The ending is abrupt and inconclusive, but of course it had to be, so this could pass for a real misterious crime footage found somewhere. Many people complain about the ending, i don´t, i think it´s perfect for this story and fits perfectly in the idea of reality.

I only saw this movie at the theater, but i´m sure this one is perfect for tv, where you don´t have to ear people eating pocorns next to you, and talking about last night´s football game while nothing happened in the movie. After this kind of theater experience with BLAIR WITCH, now i give even more valour to a music soundtrack. :-)

By the end, i don´t know what to think of this movie. I enjoyed it, but it could have been brilliant, instead of just original. Overall it´s a missed oportunity. Even the fake Blair Witch documentary responsible to give credibility to this story is a million times better and scary than the actual movie, wich only has two good bits, the scene in the tent with the voices of little children, and the final moments. It´s a nice peculiar movie, but it sure didn´t deserved all its sucess. On the other hand, it´s good to see someone in american movies, trying to inovate. Just for this Blair Witch should be praised. But not to much...",NA
"Lucian-4","Creepy, funny, and different.","19 August 1999","I don't know what the people who hated this movie were expecting. I realize that it was over-hyped and all, but I just relaxed and went into an extremely crowded theater and enjoyed the movie. I was absolutely drawn to the characters. They reminded me of situations where I had been in close proximity with friends or acquaintances and we had gotten on each other's nerves. It was totally believable and really hilarious the way though fought with each other. I'll admit that sometimes, in the parts that were supposed to be scary, I started to giggle because the things they were saying were so funny. But I thought that the filmmakers and actors did a fantastic job of creating a building sense of dread throughout the movie. There wasn't much of a plot, but there didn't need to be. As a person who makes art and does a lot of writing, I know sometimes you want to tell a story and sometimes you just want to create a feeling. The point of this movie was to get you acquainted with the characters and make you feel their emotions. It wasn't the scariest thing in the world, but for what it accomplished, I can't fault it at all. If you want gore or spooky special effects, there are plenty of options. This movie offers something different. I am so glad to see younger people do something so good and be financially rewarded for it. And the last shot absolutely creeped me out.","10"
"mlevans","A good evening's entertainment","27 June 2003","After intending to see this one for years, I finally did. What had put me off before were all the horror stories-not of witches, but of people running out of the theatre to puke, due to the jerky camera movements. As it turns out, I probably wouldn't have noticed this at all, had I not been looking for it. (Note: I now see, on an IMDb link that this same factor apparently didn't carry over very badly onto video.)

What I did find was an intriguingly simple tale of horror. I assume most earthlings know the basic plot-as I have for years before seeing it: Three college (I assume) students making a class documentary on a supposedly haunted woods near a small Maryland town disappear, their video footage being found a year later. I have heard people berate this as being as simply and cheaply made as the type of school documentary it portrays. Some have called it a total waste of time. I fail to grasp their viewpoint.

Actually there was a fair amount I did NOT know about the movie-even after watching it. (Thank goodness for the IMDb!) I admit I was a tad freaked out when I saw that the actors all played characters with their own names. Also surprising was that virtually the entire dialogue was adlibbed and that the three cast members knew very little of what was going to be happening to them. It was more a case of improvising and reacting than true acting. Yet it worked marvelously. (I enjoyed the note that Heather Donahue supposedly carried a knife with her out of concern for sharing a tent with two strange guys.) I had always laughed at the `stupid kids' who spread rumors that this was a REAL documentary. Now I see that the producers actually claimed it WAS real when it was first promoted! (Hence, I suppose, the reason for using the actors' real names.)

Certainly the movie awoke Hollywood to a realization that big budget, CGI and multi-million dollar directors are not always the answer when seeking a crowd-pleaser. Eeriness, tension, pathos and a good story are all put together for basically the equivalent of a year's salary for many of us. Less was definitely more for Daniel Myrick, Eduardo Sanchez and Gregg Hale and his castaways.",NA
"perni","Still manages to scare me to the bones...","4 November 2002","I saw this movie for the first time in the 'perfect' environment. It was on Showtime, with no commercials, and it played at night. Then, as it was very late by the time it was finished, I actually had to go to bed without seeing anything that could cheer up my subconscious. The result? A good case of insomnia where everything looked like an inky black shroud with two unblinking white eyes. Holy macrap I was scared after watching this thing. And it still manages to send shivers down my spine. If you haven't seen this yet (and if so, what is wrong with you?), the entire thing is shot with a home movie camera and centers around 3 college students who get lost in the woods and never come back. Some complain about the shaky camera, but I loved it. It seemed much more natural than any stolid Hollywood camera. And I understand how some might not like this movie, since in the end you never get a good look at the horror that is the Blair Witch and there are no special effects or fancy CGI to speak of. But as for me, I didn't need those things to have a good time. The little things that replaced the whizz-pow effects did the job: the tiny hands on the campers' tent, the hundreds of stick figures wafting in the breeze, and a bushel of teeth and a tongue. That's all the movie had to give me to sufficiently screw up my head. Maybe that is why I didn't like the sequel so much, as it actually was a Hollywood flick that resorted to graphic violence and stupid images of people eating owls (spooky, really) to shock its audience. As for the original, it gets a perfect score of 4/4. Oh, and don't bother to watch this on FX or any other TV channel if you really want to get the full effect. Commercials break up the tension every 5 minutes, and you will be disappointed. Instead, rent this, sit at home by yourself in the dark with only a blanket to protect you, and try not to get spooked.

"MovieProductions","Is it scary? real? Doesn't matter, ""Blair Witch"" works","10 October 2011","**** out of (****) (FRESH)

The iconic late-90's faux documentary, a staple in modern horror and occultism, exuded sheer terror and ferocity back in the day. However, the authenticity of the project and its strong marketing strategies didn't hurt a bit. But it wasn't just a financial success, it was a critical one as well. How does ""The Blair Witch"" hold up today? It all depends on your fixation of fear. If you are prone to A.D.D. style of filmmaking with quick-cuts, generic jump scares, and gore galore, you'll absolutely hate this film with a passion and tell all your Facebook friends how awful this film is and how no one should see it. On the contrary, if an eerie atmosphere and a slight interest in mythology lures you in, this film should be a highlight in cinema, just as it was for many.

""Blair Witch"" is a film, dressed up as a documentary, shot with 16mm cameras which revolves around three friends wanting to shoot the doc. but simultaneously unravel the truth. However, in doing so, will their testament be false? will it be true? will they survive?

I don't know about you, but ask me what I think one of the scariest movies of all time is and I'll name this movie. Just the tone it sets and what lies around in their surroundings is just so gruel and unnerving, I was at the edge of my seat for the entire running time. If you can setup a pitch-perfect mood like these guys can, your movie automatically reaches an accomplishment. But what makes ""Blair Witch"" have layers is its strong character development. Each and every character is easily relatable and their acting chops show. One mistake people make is that good acting should be the equivalent to likable characters. That's not always the case. If you have protagonists, maybe obnoxious ones at that, but can give one hell of a performance and fulfill their job as an actor, that is all that is required.

Now what ""Blair"" does to take that extra mile is that the movie is secondary. What a secondary horror film to me is is when it feels three dimensional, when you feel it is so real it's like you're in the movie. ""Blair"" is such an example and that's where the terror lurks. What makes ""Blair"" so scary? Its authenticity. The character setup, the tone, the direction. It's all there. If you're not one to appreciate such things, again, this movie isn't for you.

Is it scary? real? Doesn't matter, ""Blair Witch"" works. If you're a fan of great cinema and attempts at embarking a new style of filmmaking, it's just improbable to dislike a film of this nature. Here's my letter to the twenty first century: You can keep your ""Paranormal Activity"", but ""Blair Witch"" is for the late 90's kids.",NA
"Mr.White-10","One of the top 10 films of the 90s","23 August 1999","""The Blair Witch Project"" is a suprisingly realistic, ""disturbingly"" scary movie about three filmmakers (Heather Donahue, Joshua Leonard, and Michael Williams) creating a documentary on the legendary Blair Witch, venture into the woods, get lost, and strange things start happening. Although it's not as scary as some of the greats, like ""The Exorcist"", it is definitely the ""Jaws"" of the woods. Heather's confession to the camera is VERY ""heart-tugging"". The ending is also one of the most shockingly scary endings EVER (I said out loud ""Oh My God!"" when it got on screen). TBWP features FANTASTIC acting for amatuers, effective camera work, and is an entertaining film, as well as a great film to watch to show how to build tension and mood.",NA
"BB-15","Once It Gets Going, a Powerful Exploration of Fear","31 October 1999","It is amazing when I see an interesting movie like Blair Witch that cost under 50 thousand dollars to make. I say interesting rather than rave about it because there is about half of a very good movie here but the rest I was less impressed with.

First the acting in Blair Witch is top notch, absolutely believable. I recently saw Clerks, another successful ultra cheap feature, where some of the characters weren't even acting. Instead they were simply being their strange selves. But Clerks from start to finish has something that Blair Witch does not. It is tightly paced while Blair Witch rambles for the first half hour. It is too slow and some of the townspeople are given too much air time. Now I understand this is supposed to be some quasi student documentary but it does not have to be dull.

Once the actors get into the woods, the film begins to hit its stride. My only complaint about the second half hour is the lengthy time spent on reactions to piles of rocks and tied together sticks. The editing here needed to be more crisp. On a positive note the tension between the actors begins to build in a very believable way.

The last third of Blair Witch was terrific. The actors slipping into madness, the running into the night is electric and the incredible speech in the tent by Heather Donahue is great. The final crazed moments in the house have a mind bending David Lynch feel, very disturbing.

Few movies that I have seen are as up and down as Blair Witch. Considering that this is a first film and the limited budget this is understandable. But while the beginning is slow, the wait was worth it. Few films explore the depth of fear as well as Blair Witch.","5"

"Fleece Mc","BWP - the most interesting film of the year","28 March 2000","Actually i have seen BWP twice. First in the original version, and then in german. How can a film, that is supposed to look like a documentary, be dubbed? The german version is not scary at all. You don't believe for one secund, that it might be true. The original version of this film is amazing. If i hadn't known that it is a fake, i surely would have believed it's true. (I only wondered how the camera-akkus could last that long.) However. BWP is one of those films where everybody cries: Why didn't i have this great idea? This Film is absolutely brilliant in my eyes.","10"
"Eric-1226","Unsettling and creepy, without the use of faky special effects...","8 November 2002","I can't believe all the negative comments directed towards this nicely done, offbeat little fright-flick. Today's movie viewers must be getting right spoiled or something. I mean, are they expecting blood and gore to be sprayed right in their faces with a bloody fire hose or something? Come on now, whatever happened to indulging your sense of horror and fright with lots of suspense, creepy atmosphere, weird and unsettling goings on - in other words, just plain using your imagination?

Now, don't get me wrong, I love a good blood-and-gore splatter-flick with the best of 'em, but I'm not one of those people who necessarily has to have his horror handed to him on a blood-spattered silver platter. Often times it's more effective to have a spooky story told to you using little more than basic story-telling techniques. And that's what I like about this film, it is virtually devoid of splashy effects - it makes you work for your dinner instead of just handing it to you for free.

The one scene where they woke up to find weird rock piles neatly stacked near their tent was truly unsettling, it reminded me of a scene from the TV miniseries ""Rich Man, Poor Man"" (1976) where Falconetti broke into Rudy Jordache's house and moved some of his most personal belongings  just enough to let him know that, yes, he had been ""visited"".... No great special effects involved, nosiree, but nonetheless very creepy.

So, this movie, while maybe not truly a ""horror"" movie, is still nevertheless a very unsettling picture, and if you've ever been lost in the woods, or have even the slightest trepidation about wandering too far into the deep woods, especially at night, well, then this picture is for you. Otherwise, stick with Freddy Kruger movies, as this one clearly won't be your cup of tea.",NA
"Dwarf-5","Too Boring To Believe","29 October 2001","I've read, heard and seen a lot about how scary this movie is and having finally seen it on TV I have to ask myself ""What movie did everyone else see?"". After an hour I had to turn it off, it was so bad. Scary? If being bored is scary then yeah, it might just be the scariest movie of all time. This ranks right up there with watching someone's vacation on Super-8.

I wish I could rate this piece of crap in negative numbers.","1"
"Polotovar","The first Found Footage horror movie I've ever seen","26 December 2021","This is the first time I've had the pleasure of seeing a Found Footage horror film and I'm ultimately satisfied. The fact that the whole film was shot using footage was interesting. How does this method suit anyone. I found it slightly odd at first as every moment was immediately cut, but after a while I got used to it. The beginning just introduces the plot and it wasn't anything special, but once the forest itself comes into play it gets more interesting. Then again, not for a while. It was intermittent at times. So this film kept switching my interest in different ways. One time it was fun and interesting enough, and one time it was a boring forest. But what was undoubtedly the best part was the ending, which I devoured, and in fact it was the good ending that made it a good horror movie for me in the end. So for me it's a good film that I recommend, but probably only to fans of the Found Footage theme.","7"
"GradeZ","Innovative yet retro-horror film is the scariest film in years","30 April 1999","There was something about those horror films of the seventies and early eighties set in the clandestine corridors of backwoods country. Maybe it was the eerie rustling of the wind or the lifeless autumn leaves that provided the feeling of death and isolation. This is the setting of The Blair Witch Project - a film that is based on the premise that it is the discovered footage shot by a team of amateur film makers investigating a piece of Maryland folklore. The team entered the woods and never came out.

The most refreshing aspect of this horror masterpiece is that it understands the strength of subtlety. This film more than any other in recent memory, exploits the power of suggestion and invokes the hidden fears that could only crawl from the darkest corners of our imagination. It seems that the horror genre has been inundated with movies driven by special effects of late. These films have forgotten that horror movies by nature are supposed to be, above all else, scary. They should make our hearts jump and our skin crawl. The Blair Witch Project does this. It scares with its simplicity - using children's voices in the night, wooden figures hanging from twisted tree branches, and prolonged periods of darkness.

Among truly scary films of the recent past (Black Christmas and the Exorcist are two), The Blair Witch Project is at the top. Hopefully this film will remind horror filmmakers that the unknown is, more often than not, more terrifying than anything that can be captured by a camera.","10"

"ary","Interesting movie","4 October 1999","I watched The Blair Witch a few days ago, because it took some time for the release here in Brazil.This is an interesting and innovative motion picture, with great actings (Heather Donahue is fantastic), great lines (there is one specially funny line in which one of the friends mention Deliverance) and some scary moments. Different from other horror movies, is what you don't see in The Blair Witch that almost turns you crazy, is the psychological aspect of the tension, of the loneliness that makes it so great!the ending is really frightening, and one of the most intense moments show the friends inside a hut at night, and then they start to hear children voice: it's the most powerful part!",NA
"Fever","Am I supposed to be scared by this?","15 November 1999","I finally got around to seeing this movie and I have to say....huh? What was all the hype about? The premise about a documentary was interesting, but these kids were completely stupid. Losing the map, not knowing how to read a compass, and trekking in the woods at that time of year can only lead to disaster. Plus, knowing it was not real made that whole ""sticks hanging from the trees"" thing totally unrealistic. Finally, that last scene had so many things wrong with it, I had to rewind it several times just to figure out what the heck was going on. Don't bother, there are several other horror movies out there that are much better.",NA
"Zen Bones","Use your Imagination!","17 July 2000","The best films call on our imaginations. The very reason that there is such a difference of opinion of this film is because of that. Each person viewed a different film because what was experienced was ultimately not on the screen but in the minds of the viewer. The film gave us a premise and left us to take it in our own direction, much like the radio shows of yesteryear. Today, many people do not really know how to use their imaginations. They don't read books. They're used to seeing films where everything is shown, where emotions are reduced to cynicism, and where reality is defined in clear-cut images.

This film is not about the Blair Witch, or a group of foul-mouthed teens (I can't believe that somebody actually felt a need to count how many times the word ""f**k"" was used!) lost in the woods, or how to make an audience nauseous via shaky camera movements. It's about terror, pure and simple. Horror movies are a dime a dozen. This is not a horror movie. In is an exercise in finding a way to enable an audience to delve into the same world that their personal nightmares spring from (their own dark imaginations) through the device of cameras, lights and a fine cast. At the end, whether it is a success or not is up to the viewer, not the filmmakers. They built the boat and set the course, but it is our task to steer it.

I do however give great credit to the filmmakers who crafted such a fine vehicle. And I have to give major kudos to Heather Donohue who gave the best performance of the year (along with Hilary Swank in ""Boys Don't Cry""). It is through her voice that we hear our own terror voiced. And most importantly see reflected in her eyes. Tremendous performance! Very interesting film!",NA
"cyko26","The absolute worst movie ever","31 May 2001","I screamed and yelled after watching this film for the waste of money.

I can't believe all the positive hype it got from all the stupid and easily swayed by the masses people.","1"
"Gore-Hound666","Quite A Chilling Experience","4 November 2007","I believe a scary movie, can only be effective once. You never know what's going to happen next, your at the edge of your seat, staring off into the darkness to see whats lurking there, this movie mastered that. Once your drawn in, it doesn't let you go. I personally, was drawn in entirely, I felt like I was actually there with them the entire time, thus is why the movie was incredibly effective to me.

The actual story in the movie surrounding the legend is creepy as hell. Children are vanishing, one by one until they are eventually found butchered inside a secluded house deep in the woods. Killed by a deranged man telling everyone an old woman ghost told him to kill them all. The little girl disappearing for days, then returning babbling about an old woman who's feet never touched the ground. The whole making one kid face into the corner while he killed the other, then killing the one in the corner. That definitely stuck in my mind until the end. When Mike says, ""Its a house."" nearing the end, I began to tense up. Imagining myself in that situation is absolutely terrifying. Out in the middle of nowhere, in a forest in pitch black, your friend is yelling for help and you stubble upon a house...Jesus. When the girl descends down into the dark, scary as hell, cellar, that moment she turns and you see Mike in the corner, that moment was extremely terrifying and effective. The fact thats what that murderer would do, and he was caught and executed years ago, so he's out of the question...just gave me a flood of chills. Its just scary, there's no other words I can think of. I can only picture what else was in that room. That other kid butchered on the floor? The ""Blair Witch""? Yeesh, it just scares me.

The fact you don't see anything is the exact reason why this movie scared the crap out of me. Im going to say what a lot of other people have already said, it did was Jaws did for going into the water and what Psycho did for taking a shower. Not only dark forests, but just staring into darkness scares me because of this movie. No other movie has scared me the way this one has. Like I said once you've seen it, thats it. Its only effective once, but hell, its powerful. This movie was a frightening experience, and I loved it. I can safely say, this movie is definitely one of my favourites. I just really really hope I don't fall asleep one night, and I end up dreaming up being in any situation resembling The Blair Witch Project.","9"

"AJ4F","Superficial people won't ""get"" this film","6 September 2003","I just revisited Blair Witch and it remains among the top 2 or 3 scariest films I've ever seen, possibly number one. It works on a psychological level that can't be compared to ""traditional"" horror attempts. If you find yourself ""trying"" to get into it, you're probably wasting your time.

I think this movie is best watched alone on TV at night, or with a small crowd that won't interrupt with banal comments. In fact, I don't think you should talk at all during this film because so much of it relies on ""being there"" and staying there until the end.

I think many people are too shallow or short on patience to get drawn into it, and that accounts for most of the negative reviews. They are simply not describing the same experience had by those who got into it. For me, that happened shortly after the interviews with the townspeople, especially the one with the strange lady at the trailer park. When this film works on someone, it becomes reality, and reality can be overwhelming if you're lost in the woods and the sun is sinking.

Negative reviewers try to dissect it with criticisms of the plot and pacing that have no bearing on how it works for a receptive mind. It doesn't need a traditional plot or special effects because it wasn't meant to work on an in-yo-face level. Notice how short some of the bad reviews are? It's as if they were told to hate it and just want to join the fray. Many probably saw it in a big, sarcastic crowd that prevented them from reaching the trance-state that creates so much of the tension.

It's too bad I'm defending this film by attacking the personalities of its detractors, but I'm afraid that's necessary! To sum it up, if your main musical fare is Hip Hop or Britney Spears you'll probably find Blair Witch dull. But if you can sit still and enjoy slow classical or ambient soundscapes you may find yourself mesmerized. Flaky viewers (or those who'd never understand their own flakiness) need not apply.",NA
"ProfessorPeach","Okay, but NOT altogether original","6 December 2004","Not as brilliant as everyone might make out. The ending works well and is certainly quite creepy, but there's some very dull bits in the middle where not much happens. This is a device that can sometimes be used to build tension, but it flags in places here. At times you don't have a lot of sympathy with the protagonists since they do some really dumb things which make you frustrated.

If you like this sort of thing, then check out The Last Broadcast. It was made before Blair Witch and is similar in feel and style. For some reason, it gets virtually no recognition but IMHO is much better and more gripping.",NA
"stefankrs","Overrated","22 September 2021","This movie is definitely different than many other movies. The setting is good, isolated in a forest that seems to never end. The plot is good, a forest inhabited by the blair witch. The execution was done okay for a found footage but it was just boring. Just an hour of people picking up sticks and rocks in a forest and getting lost until someone stares at a wall in the end. There could have been more to it and I was convinced that I watched a cut version. Sadly, this movie had something going for it but it didn't live up to what it could have been.","5"
"Craven80","It unfortunately let me down.","18 July 1999","I had been eagerly waiting to see this for a month or two now. Being a HUGE horror fan I couldn't wait to see this due to the huge buzz about how scary and creative it was.

But I've got to say this movie let me down a lot. The few scary scenes are hardly unsettling or truly scary, although there is a *slight* creep out factor in them.

Since most of the movie does not attempt to be scary, there are a few good laughs in it. Actually the comic parts of it are better at being funny than the scary parts are at being scary.

**ALSO** Some people are going to see this movie under the impression that it is real footage that was found ...or that it was a shot by shot remake of real footage that was found...Which is not true! But under this impression I could see how the movie would seem a lot better than it does to those who know it was all made up.

ALL IN ALL I give it 1 1/2 stars or 2 out of four. I really wish it was better, it was good concept. The 2 guys that made it are cool, and had a great idea.","6"
"Ace-38","Absolutely terrifying","25 October 1999","I have intentionally waited to write my review for this movie. I saw it shortly after its release and wanted to wait for the initial hysteria to die down. I have now seen it twice at the theater and bought it on video Thursday. This is truly the most terrifying experience I have ever had.

The plotline (borrowing from the tagline here) is three student filmmakers disappear in the woods in Maryland, and a year later their footage is found. A young film student (Heather Donohue) hires two guys (Mike Williams and Josh Leonard) to accompany her into the woods near Burkittsville, Maryland to shoot a documentary on a local legend: The Blair Witch. The three soon find themselves lost in the woods, with no foreseeable way out, no matter where or how far they go. All the while, an unseen force stalks their every move.

This movie clearly plays on all our most primal fears. Where am I?, How am I gonna get out of here?, and mostly..what the hell was that noise? It teases your emotions and tweaks your nerves to the point that you feel relief when the credits roll.

Heather Donohue is a major star in waiting. Her ""portrayal"" of a young woman paralyzed by fear (remember folks, they only had a rough outline of the script, everything that happened was as much a surprise to them as it was to us) is chilling

Michael Williams and Josh Leonard are also wonderful in their ""roles"". Josh, in my opinion, is the most scared of the three. He is the first to fall apart and shows his emotions easily. Michael Williams is the one who tries, despite all odds, to keep the group together in an attempt to escape not only the woods, but whatever is hunting them. These two young men have a wonderful acting career ahead of them, and it will be nice to watch them grow in the future.

One novel thing about this movie is the fact that, in my opinion, it works better on the small screen than the big one. The (mainly) videotape footage frames well on your TV, and somehow adds to the terror. If you buy the tape or DVD, you can skip the ""newly discovered footage"". It feels very tacked on, and is clearly shot on 35mm film. Probably footage scripted and shot especially for the home release.

Unlike modern horror films (Scream, Urban Legend),""The Blair Witch Project"" packs a punch whether its your first viewing or your 10,000th. This movie grabs you by the teeth and pulls you into the depths of its insanity. As an old horror veteran, I have to rank this one among the greats, such as ""Psycho"", ""Night of the Living Dead"", ""Halloween"" and ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre"".

"ebert_jr","Way way way overhyped!!","25 July 1999","There were a LOT of unsatisfied people leaving this film. Especially since getting BWP tickets in Manhattan was damn difficult over the last week (most shows being sold out way in advance).

First though, I have to give the makers credit, it's a fairly original premise that has very believable characters who play their parts well. And I agree this is a refreshingly different angle on the horror movie genre which is not a big budgeted dumbed down horror story with gobs of special effects. Yes, all that's cool....

But the best horror movie ever? C'mon!! This movie was in no way, shape or form the best horror movie ever. Scary? Eh, here and there, but I never, never once felt really terrified. This film is totally overhyped. I laughed while leaving this film as I thought about all the folks who said ""ooh, I'll never be able to go walking in the woods at night again, or ""gee, that's the last time I go camping"". What a joke!! I think the biggest lesson here is to hold on to your map, or bring a second.

The very end was fairly good, especially compared to the rest of the movie. Despite that, most of the audience seemed to let out a ""that's what I was supposed to get scared out of my boots about?!"" groan when it was over.

What a dismal summer for movies this is turning out to be. Just when I thought BWP would be the shining jewel among a lot of duds this summer, it really just didn't amount to much. Wait for the video release is my advice.",NA
"BillTodd","Why BWP's unconventional approach makes it a winner","3 August 1999","I was out of the country throughout June and July, and subsequently missed out on the advertising and hype for ""The Blair Witch Project."" After being extremely disappointed by ""The Haunting,"" I caved in to the word-of-mouth about BWP and decided to give it a try.

I went into the theater not having seen the Sci-Fi channel documentary, not having seen a commercial, and not having been to the BWP website. I knew _nothing_ except that the story involved three college kids who go out to make a documentary about a witch.

I am _never_ scared by horror movies. I nearly slept through Scream, and Friday the 13th movies don't do much for me either.

Blair Witch had me sleeping with the light on.

Why? Because you could _believe_ that the events on the amateur video were real. They _could_ happen. To you. The power of this movie lies in it's ability to make you _believe_ that something is after these kids. And this isn't Jennifer Love Hewitt or Courtney Cox being chased around, this is Heather, plain Heather, who cries into the camera and has a visibly runny nose and we can see how scared she is. She's real. She really looks cold and scared, and it's details like the runny nose that do it. As the days of the expedition pass by and the group gets more and more on each others nerves, the infighting, the stress, the blame, the spooked nerves, all of the dialogue and actions are things that you or someone you know would have done in the forest.

I love Star Wars. I love digital sound. I love special effects. But this movie neither needed nor used any of them. It didn't have music. It didn't have the distracting, ill-used eye-candy visual effects if ""The Haunting."" This has the believable camera shakiness of somebody who knows there's something out there. They're shooting this on amateur video. It looks clunky. It looks cheap. This doesn't have the fine look of film, that refined look we're used to. This is gritty, seemingly real-world footage.

Then there's the sounds at night that we've all heard outside the tent. And the possibility that there's a witch behind them. It's in the possibility, the ambiguity, that ""Blair Witch"" is masterfully done.

That, and the last two minutes of the film, which I want a freeze frame for very badly. The last camera shot is one I'll not be forgetting for a long time.

Those who've not seen BWP, read no further.

Was there really a witch? Obviously there was a murderer, but was there truly effective use of witchcraft? Was it a spell that caused Mike to kick the map in the water, or did he really think it was that useless? Was it sorcery that made them come back to the same point in the river, or did they do as most humans do when walking without landmarks and walk in a huge circle? Was the slime on Josh's gear supernatural? Was that Josh's voice calling them to the house, or was it the The Murderous Old Man?

We just don't know. At least, I don't, not until I see it again. And that's what makes this movie great. In real life, you really don't know if witchcraft is real- deep down inside, when we go camping at night we're slightly spooked by the snapping twigs or rustling leaves outside. And after having seen suspended effigies, ritual rock piles, and hands beating on the tent, we're all a little more willing to believe the unbelievable.

It's this belief in the unbelievable that ""Blair Witch"" begins by poking fun at and slowly begins to nurture until, abruptly, it ends without giving an answer.",NA
"evilskip","Too much hype;too little payoff","13 August 1999","We all know what this movie is about unless you've been taking a dirt nap for the past 4 months.There is no need to do a synopsis for it.I know that a majority of the movie goers out there just love this movie and it is their favorite all time thriller.I really looked forward to this and was hoping for some good old fashioned scares and goosebumps.

Sorry kids, but this movie just doesn't live up to the hype.The only major scare I had was the fear of losing my lunch due to the jerky camerawork.Being severly disappointed doesn't start to describe it.

The movie did have its share of creepy moments.No denying that but creepy doesn't translate into scary.(I'm too old to be a slasher/gore fan so the lack thereof isn't an excuse for not liking this film.In fact that is exactly why I wanted to see this).The late night discoveries and the daylight stick figure area were a bit spooky.So was the surprise dental work outside the tent.The ending almost saved the film with its out and out lose your mind intensity.Finally we get something that is close to being really scary.We could have used a lot more of that screaming descent into hell.

The payoff to the film was ruined because the first hour was tedious to sit through.Major fear number two was that I would nod off.But the 3 characters screaming at each other were so irritating it forced you to stay awake.

These 3 are such morons that I hoped something WOULD come out of the woods and put them out of my misery.Die already!! Who cares about a bunch of whining morons arguing about cigarettes a lack of supplies and an ""are we there yet?""mentality?The absurdity with the map had me lose any connection with the characters.Stop screaming at each other! Beat the moron to death with tree limbs and get the $#^# out of there!

The heralded ""finding the lost documentary film"" is nothing new. Cannibal Holocaust served up that angle more than 20 years ago.At least it wasn't as jerky.

"pinokiyo","The ending still gives me chills.","25 March 2006","When a movie goes mainstream, it usually gets criticized heavily; you just can't please everyone. If the haters could just get pass all the hype and whatnot - while having a sense of imagination - this movie is not bad as what they make it out to be. It IS scary.

The documentary style was really clever, and it was definitely a key advantage in making this movie scarier than other horror movies. I thought the acting was pretty natural and made it believable.

This movie isn't one of those horror movies where it flashes a bunch of graphic images or sound effects at you, but it does it calmly and effectively. The ending REALLY left me with chills. People without a wide imagination will probably not find this movie scary; that's too bad. Really, to also get the full effect, it's best to watch it in the dark with no distraction. They did such a good job that some people might confuse this movie to be real.

I would skip Blair Witch 2, though; it was not clever or entertaining as the original. This movie will definitely put fear in people camping at night, or even worse - someone standing in the corner with their back turned (in a dark room); it was that effective.","8"
"Norm-30","An Over-rated Film","17 August 1999","I have to admit that this concept is revolutionary, and lends to

it's realism. The acting is incredibly intense.

Now, the downside. The constant hand-held camera shaking got to be very annoying in spots; I didn't get sick, just annoyed!

Also, the ""sounds"" they heard at night were so faint that you can hardly make them out, due to the sounds of them moving in the tent, whimpering, etc.

Even tho this film can have NO ENDING, they should've showed the ""intro explanation"" for about 10 secs before the end credits rolled. This would've brought it ""home"" more, with less than a ""hanging feeling"".

I was only 12 when The Blair Witch Project showed up in theaters, but I remember everyone going nuts for it and that meant I wouldn't touch it with a 10-foot pole. I have since (mostly) gotten over that problem — honestly, it stopped me from getting into a lot of cool things — but for some reason I just never got around to seeing this movie.

When this movie first came out in 1999, it blew all expectations out of the water. Shot in 8 days on a $60,000 budget, it went on to gross $248 million in theaters, placing it as the 5th highest earning independent film ever made. The director, Eduardo Sánchez, had set up a website prior to the movie's release to convince interested watchers that it was, in fact, genuine found footage. At its Sundance release, flyers were passed out encouraging anyone with information about the missing three to come forward. The star of the movie, Heather Donahue — whose eyes are burned forever in everyone's minds from that iconic scene — still has people telling her that they thought she was dead. Her mother received sympathy cards after the movie was released. That alone — the whole concept of a hugely viral website combined with a very widely believed myth — is fascinating. It's part of the reason I love found footage style movies so much — the ability to skirt that line between fact and fiction.

The basic story is simple: three 20-something film students head into the woods of Burkittsville, Maryland, to make a documentary about the legendary Blair Witch, the ghost of Elly Kedward who was supposedly banished from Blair Township (latter-day Burkittsville) for witchcraft in 1875. Things quickly start to go very wrong and we watch them run for their lives through the woods until the tragic ending.

It has some pretty natural interactions and dialogue, most likely credited to the fact that much of it was ad-libbed throughout the filming process. The three actors didn't know each other before filming but got to spend some pretty intimate days together out in the actual woods of Maryland. Honestly, the bickering between the three of them gets a little old at times, and particularly the two guys' quickness to berate and insult the director, Heather, for what they perceive as her shortcomings (losing the map, not knowing exactly where in the woods they are, etc).

Overall, its strength comes from, as I mentioned, its ability to make you, at times, unsure if what you're watching is real or fake. It really makes me wish I HAD seen it in theaters, because I, of course, now know that is was not a real documentary but a huge number of people believed it when it was released, and it would have added a whole ton of suspense and tension to the watching experience if I truly hadn't been sure.

But it still has that believable quality from the found footage style, and the fact that we never actually see the thing that we most fear. We have the isolation of being not only deep in the woods but lost AND without a means of outside communication. The breaking down of morale in the group. The mounting evidence that SOMEONE — or someTHING — is following closely behind as they move through the forest. The scene where Heather makes her emotional confession into the camera is brilliant in the sense that it drives home this feeling of desperation, of helplessness. You are on edge for much of the movie because you're simply looking into the darkness to see what's out there.

It wasn't the most interesting movie I'd ever seen, and again, not as impressive as I imagine it might have been closer to its release, but credit where credit is due it's a masterfully done movie both in marketing and execution.","6"

"n_unit","A good idea, with some SERIOUS flaws.","26 November 2006","Heather Donahue Josh Leonard Mike Williams

The premise is that three filmmakers went into the woods to make a documentary and disappeared, only to have their equipment found a year later. The film is supposedly their own footage pieced together, a horrifying and true tale of supernatural evil.

This is both the genius and the undoing of the film. The idea is excellent, but the entire experience hinges on the audience being convinced that what they are seeing is real. Unfortunately, the film does a poor job of convincing us. The low budget and inexperience of the filmmakers shows through time and time again.

Often actors will forget or flub lines and have to repeat them (didn't they have a chance to edit this thing?) One particularly embarrassing instance happens during this exchange, about 3/4 of the way through the film:

Heather: What do we do now? Mike: I think we should go into that horse. (pause) Heather: Don't you mean ""house,"" Mike? (Mike looks into the camera doubtfully, turns back to Heather) Mike: Yes. House. Heather:(looking directly into the camera) Can we do that one again?

Other flaws include the very unrealistic ""forest"" (which was actually a huge sound studio in Los Angeles dressed to look like a real woods). At one point Josh leans against a ""tree"" which is obviously made of styrofoam. The tree easily topples over, and all three cast members begin giggling uncontrollably.

Not only did this ruin the tension in the scene, but it contains a plot hole as well: the character of Josh was supposed to be dead by that point in the film.

It's probably worth a rental, but not much more. Look for cameos by Elizabeth Montgomery as the witch, and Bill Paxton as a small pile of rocks. I give it one star.",NA
"MikeK-7","Sadly, somewhat disappointing","15 December 1999","I was very anxious to see this movie. It had been a long time since I had a good scare. ""Scary as hell"" the poster read. So finally in November, I bought a copy. Well, it's not all its cracked up to be. 90% of the film is boring talk that nobody really cares about, the characters are uninteresting and hateful, and some of the lines sound like they weren't really putting up any effort. I've heard from many people that this film was ripped off by Ruggero Deodato's 1979 film CANNIBAL HOLOCAUST. Although I haven't seen that film, I'm guessing this could be true. I will give THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT credit, however, for the last ten minutes, which are terrifying, but I won't spoil it for those who (unlikely) haven't seen it.","5"

Then I found out it was fake and so the effect began to wear off even the website was change customised so we could see updates on the possible production of two more projects. Finally I hired this movie, and all I can say was is that it occasionally had funny and scary parts but it's scary enough to be classified as one of the scariest movies ever made. If there was anything I was rewinding the ending thinking ""what the F*** ?"" I thought the movie was creative but it's not something I would watch over and over again like some sort of cult. Also I really hope that there will be no continuing franchise of the Blair Witch Project","5"
"paul sloan","What Is This Witch's Promise ?","13 October 2000","This movie, while really an interesting curio,is a nice piece of hokum with some great moments. Most of the action is shown on video tape as we follow 3 young film makers in search of the mystery that is the Blair Witch. Obviously low budget,the whole enterprise is put together convincingly-well. Dialogue comes over as realistic and there is a tense build-up of atmosphere as spooky occurences happen.One problem with the credibility of the story is that it is not really believable that they would continue to film everything when things go so drastically wrong. However, there is much to entertain here and films like The Blair Witch Project show that just because something is low budget it is not necessarily poor quality. The DVD version is well worth exploring with a great scene by scene commentary from the producers and directors and a fantastic pseudo-documentary called The Blair Witch Legacy which expands the story and superbly complements the original movie.",NA
"rogelioduron","Cool movie...I really became a big fan!!!!!!!","23 October 2002","This movie is very well done and the simple idea of making something like this is worth everything it earned,all the fame,reviews and fanatism is the art of good publicity,In those days when internet rumors made this film a masterpiece for a lot of people before even watching it,Im one of those people. What made me become a real fan of this movie was the obscure references that they showed on the internet,how people shared what they felt when they saw the movie and how terrified they were after watching it,as a true horror genere fan i was in the need of a good scare and a rollercoaster of a ride into the unknown existence of the Blair Witch. The Blair Witch Proyect is what it pretends to be,A well planned proyect that became a huge success and a profit making scheme of a Documentary or `Mockumentary'/Snuff film about 3 college students that went to the woods in the making of a school proyect and got lost. They involve a lot of psichological horror and the chemistry between the actors is not so good and the performance of each of them on the side (See `Cubbyhouse' and you´ll pray for evil spirits to teach Joshua Leonard How to act) is a horrible experiment gone awry,Im sure in a few months we´re going to see this guys in a `Where are they now' Tv show,anyway,they deserve credit for being pioneers on this kind of movies in the 90´s,Thanks to the Blair Witch proyect we got a lot of people interested on making good horror movies and invest in them so that´s a good thing and on the down side we got a sequel that sucks but some people say it´s actually better than the original,You decide,This movie is worth being on a good movie collection,I´ll give it a nice 10 out of 10 on horror at the woods movie.I was such a fan of the blair witch that i actually made some stick men for halloween that year and im the proud owner of a Blair Witch movie maniac figure by todd Mcfarlane,it´s cool. There´s a scene when the lead actress played by Heather Donahue say´s goodbye to all her family and that she´s sorry for all that has happened,and she is crying and sobbing,I found this scene pretty disturbing until i saw it a thousand times later in `Scary Movie' and the `Bogus Witch Proyect' of Pauly Shore (who is funny sometimes).",NA
"bjudd","Did I miss something?","18 July 1999","Boy, I sure would like to see the film that most of the reviewers and those writing comments here have seen. The film I saw wasn't scary in any aspect. Yes, there were a few creepy moments and nice build up at the end, but is there anything truly scary about this film? No. I honestly cannot fathom why people are calling this the scariest movie in history. Most of the film was watching these people walk through the woods. There was a chance for them to build psychological terror of being lost in the woods, but that was put on the back burner in favor showing night time events where nothing materializes. I was highly disappointed in what I saw as false advertising for this film.","3"
"DoctorSkyTower","A Very Scary Flick","19 December 1999","I saw this movie on the weekend, and read the reviews. I agree, and disagree, with many of them.

UNLIKE some, I was impressed with the way this flick was handled, the story was intriguing. The three students Josh, Heather and Mike were excellent, I actually sympathized with them and felt their fear at being alone and lost in the forest for 4 nights with unseen evil forces stalking them until... (And I don't normally sympathize with characters in movies!)

The concept of relying on your imagination to fill in what nasty surprises the 3 students encountered was great! (For example: the stick figures) This is what real fear is, and that concept is what I enjoyed!! This was by far the BEST and most realistic horror movie I have seen.

The comparing of this with stuff like Scream 2, was unfair. The BLAIR WITCH PROJECT is much better than SCREAM 2! It was a great change from seeing the usual blood-splashed horror flicks, loaded with one cliche after another.

HOWEVER there was a downside, and that was the annoying, jiggling filming. It would've looked better if it were 'professionally' filmed, rather than done in this style. It can still look grainy like the film WAS found a year later without looking like it had been filmed by 3 year olds... (sorry!) It didn't really add authenticity even though it tried to... We had a lot of scenes which were unnecessary. It was very frustrating sitting there while the students were running around panicking, camera pointing at ground, tree, sky, ground, etc etc etc

CONCLUSION: Ah, ha! So that's what car sickness feels like!!! This movie is very scary psychological-wise, so if you can stand the screen jumping crazily without being sick, this is for you!! Those who want blood and gore, and a story handed to them on a platter, should avoid at all costs.","8"

Since I like these kind of movies, I could actually manage to stay awake. But if you don't like it, watch the beginning, some of the middle to get what's going on and then skip to the last 15 minutes.

The premise is great, the suspense build up is really awesome, the filming itself is not that bad, but it just doesn't get there fast enough. When it does, it's only 5 minutes of footage that you can't see what's happening.

Definitely not worth all the suspense. Nothing is explained, nothing shows up and that's it. Only crying and screaming.

"Phil_H","Hardly worth waiting for.","8 August 1999","I wanted so much to love this movie. After all the hype, the good press, and the other reviews available, I really wanted for this film to somehow profoundly affect me, either by scaring the living crud out of me, or to give something to me that no other film has been able to do in the past.

This film, sadly, does not deliver.

There is absolutely nothing that distinguishes this film from any other horror genre fare. There's some tension, that's well produced as you hope to discover what it is that's going on, but in the end that's all there is--tension.

This could have been so much better. For all the hype, this SHOULD have been so much better.

As an avid moviegoer perhaps I'm jaded, but I just do not see what the big deal is with The Blair Witch Project.

When reviewing a movie for the IMDB, I have the duty to make an accurate assessment, sometimes I have to take a bit longer to come to my senses and resist the urge to issue forth praise that is unwarranted (in my opinion). Most of the positive feedback this film has garnered is just that: unwarranted priase.

Anyone truly scared by this film has either a weak constitution or has never seen some of the truly great films of the horror genre. To those people, I suggest (strongly) that you hit the local video store more often. And in your renting you will find films that will make the Blair Witch Project pale in comparison.

The Blair Witch Project will not withstand the test of time.","3"
"kayozz2001","The Blair Witch project","8 November 2009","Three Americans get lost in the woods. Terrible camera work made itlook very amateur, i'm pretty sure the director even tried to cheat the audience by using two cameras (one of which is obviously noticeable as it is black and white). No music either which is a shame, as i'm pretty sure some of the scenes could have done with some hammer horror style chords and screeches. The lack of any on screen antagonist also decreases its credibility. Although at one point you CAN hear an owl. The three so called actors aren't that good, as i've never seen them in anything else. Another bad move for the director. I think this film would have worked far better with Nicolas Cage, Steve Buscemi and Salma Hayek as the main actors.

"dalton2","Just pure morbidity is what keeps us watching this","31 October 1999","This is an amateur film. It's simple. It's just like a documentary. When we watch this ""film"", we feel a strange morbid curiosity on what's appearing on the screen, very similar to a voyeur's curiosity. I knew it was a fiction, but I tried to believe it was real (that's what it was supposedly made for, wasn't it?). Once I found myself believing what I was watching, I entered into the atmosphere, and this is what I found: morbidity, just that. Ah, and lots of boring minutes of footage, which will scare us only if we think that they are real footage images, where everything could happen as they are real.

All in all, this is my conclusion: This isn't a horror movie, the same way that porno movies aren't erotic films. I could call this a ""hardcore horror film"", and I find this idea pretty disturbing. I can't imagine what kind of films are to come in this line but with higher budgets. Perhaps a pseudo-snuff movie...? Too much for my sensibility.

"Jim-500","Look for the aftertaste","14 July 2000","The Blair Witch Project is an original, quirky flick that is not all that it seems. Like most people, I had heard all the hoopla about its hype and Internet shenanigans before I saw it. Going into the theatre on a dreary day (and in a tired, down mood, to boot), I was ready to be put to the test.

A few minutes after the flick ended, I looked at my friend and we both said the same thing: ""What a lame movie!"" It was true, it seemed. This had been much ado about nothing. Sure, it was an interesting idea, but come on. A group of kids basically screaming and cursing (the latter much more so) about their fate in the dark woods, to the point of being annoying. So I left the theatre somewhat disappointed.

But then a strange thing happened. Several days later, some of the movie's more effective shots began coming back to me (and, much to my dismay, at night). The three cairns piled outside the tent in the morning. The human figurines hanging silently from the trees. The little surprise package, wrapped up in a piece of the missing Josh's shirt. In short, the movie was starting to work some odious magic on me. I began to feel, for one of the few times in my life, a sense of true horror and dread, or at least something close. And I began to consider the existence of all of those unseen powers and forces we know from Stephen King and other horror stories.

Do they exist? Could they exist? Who knows--that is probably part of the game. We will never know, until it is too late, as it was for the trio in Blair Witch Project.

The only thing I found unbelievable about this movie was at the end, when the filmmakers are in the house, and they know full well that something awful is about to happen, yet they are still shown with their cameras to their eyes, walking around filming everything. I'd be so scared I sure would not be worried about my camcorder at that point.

But that aside, The Blair Witch Project has both the capacity to bore as well as the capacity to frighten. But whatever you experience, be wary for the aftertaste. It might just get you.",NA

The makers of the movie tried to go for a ""realistic"" approach to a horror movie, but in doing so, I swear to god upon everything in the universe, it is the only horror movie that made me bored stiff. Again, I will say that horror movies never do that for me! Just this one! It is a complete and utter waste of time.

Being just a way of cinematography language nowadays it's completely left its predecessor, its founder behind. The Blair Witch Project could only be made twenty years ago, when it was possible to make it look credible enough for us, viewers, even if just for a second to believe that this all might have actually been true (or forget it couldn't).

"GuyCC","More of a terror experience than a movie.","4 August 1999","Instead of giving a ""this movie is a must see, go see it now"" kind of review, I'm just going to give a brief overview of what seeing this movie was like for me:

The opening scenes and the first few days of their documentary: The filmmakers are typical 20-somethings. ""My friends and I act a lot like this"", I thought to myself. Right down to how I videotape everything and annoy my friends by doing so. The search for Blair Witch landmarks had an ""everyday"" feeling to any camping trip.

The filmmakers get lost: I can't say I've ever been lost in the woods, but I could relate to the frustration of walking in circles trying to find a way out of a place. The filmmakers' sarcasm and anger with each other seemed natural for the situation.

The night incidents: Every night was worse than the one before, and the point where the filmmakers ran from the tent with Heather trying to understand what was out there was a tense moment. I felt a very uneasy feeling during the scene because I couldn't see what was out there, but I knew something was.

*SPOILER ALERT FOR THE NEXT PARAGRAPH*

Josh disappears: When Heather and Mike wake up and see that Josh isn't there anymore, I knew that something happened, but what and when and how? I couldn't tell. That was the worst part of the situation. The witch's ""gifts"" about Josh's fate were unnerving. Mike and Heather were now realizing that they were part of a game now and were being hunted down.

Heather's close-up: I understood with Heather's apology to the parents of three filmmakers that that she, as well as I, knew that their time was short and the game was almost over. This is the shot that represents so much of the ""Blair Witch"" images that you see, and is one of the most saddening moments because of its finality.

The final scenes: I refuse to give anything away, but during those last few moments, I felt my heart start really pumping in my chest and chills go through my body. I was open-mouthed with nervousness and shock until the credits rolled. A powerful, terrifying ending scene.

At home: After the movie, I went home. I went outside to look for my dog. I have a small patch of wooded area in my backyard. In calling my dog, and going into my backyard, my stomach knotted tightly with apprehension. I almost left ""Sparky"" outside. It's only a movie, isn't it?

This isn't a standard horror movie by any means. There isn't a hockey-masked, knived hand lunatic waiting in the shadows, accompanied by scary music to build up to the moment. This is the boogeyman. This is the creature under your bed. This is the campfire story. This is the thing that goes bump in the night. The creature is never seen, but imagination makes the creature more terrifying than any special effects person could generate. Forget practically every horror movie you've seen. If you want to be scared on a pure primal level, see this. This movie deserves every bit of recognition and credit it gets, and while I'm not looking forward to the countless string of rip-offs that with try to capitalize on its success (It happened to ""Scream""), this is the original, and this is the one to remember. There's no climatic Hollywood showdown. The trio finds themselves in something that is way over their heads, and the supernatural leads them to their fate. Anyone who doesn't see this, is denying themselves an amazing film experience, but the reviews are true. This is truly a frightening film.... but on a different kind of level.","8"
"lolbleachfan","Original, creative and terrifying.","4 June 2013","The Blair Witch Project is one of the best horror films ever made and one of my favourite films of all time.

The story is that the film is supposed to be the found footage of three young film students that head to a rural town to film a documentary about a local myth of a witch that terrorised the town many years ago. They end up getting lost in the woods while being stalked by someone or something.

The film entirely shot on video and cheap, black and white film supporting the feeling that the film is found footage and it works. Something about the look of it, and given the fact that the movie was made a very low budget and there is no music, gives it a sense of realism and a unique atmosphere.

The acting is great, too. All the actors are very natural and, apart from the occasional one or two cheesy line, remain consistent throughout and giving a real sense of fear to the point where you feel like you are among this group and sharing the fear with them.

However, one major complaint that I have is a lot of the time the camera is shaking all way too much to really make out what exactly is going on and is literally black at some points as in you cannot see a thing which is pretty annoying but not to the point where it is unwatchable. Another minor complaint is that sometimes you cannot hear what the characters are saying due to the limited range on the microphone on the cheap cameras they used but this only occurs a couple of times and, again, is bearable.

The whole point of the film is to be scared, it's a horror, so why not let it happen? A lot of these people might have actually been scared but not realized it. But I'm speculating.

The film itself is incredible, a work of genius. It's inspired so many people to argue and debate over what actually happened to these three students, even though by now we all know it was fake. Those people who say ""It's dumb cause it wasn't real"", are they actually saying they wanted to see three students hunted down a probably murdered? So much effort went into making this film possible, some of which even came from the fans themself before the film was even released. I've done a lot of research into the film's background and secrets that I can't help but love it, and there are so many people who limit themselves to simply watching the film with a stone mind and not letting any of the imagination the movie creates seep into their brain.

My second favorite film of all time, it will always be a classic to me. Ten out of ten.","10"
"darin-wissbaum","Just follow the river will you...","3 March 2010","By now I would think most people would know the story of the Blair Witch Project....But here is my take. This film has spawned several so called copies since its release in 1999. Examples would be, ""Paranormal Activity"" and ""Paranormal Entity."" These films were in my opinion not as good as The Blair Witch, which was an original idea the time it was released. 3 young filmmakers, Jennifer, Mike and Josh go into the woods in Marlyland to shot a Documentary on the legend of the The Blair Witch. What happens is they come across an old cemetery and by accident knock over one of the grave stones. This lets loose the the Ghost of the witch. The three filmmakers then become lost and are haunted as they try to find their way out of the woods....ghostly sounds of children laughing and the sounds of footsteps around their tent terify them as they desperately try to find their way out. Despite all that is happening someone always seems to find time to film what is going on which leads to a lot of camera shake but this gives it realism and makes it truly scary.

It was said earlier in the film that the place the 3 were going to make the documentary was up in the hills around Burkittsville, Maryland. As the filmmakers got lost you see a river in several shots and you wonder since water flows to its lowest point why not just follow the river down till you are out? This never seems to dawn on the filmmakers. Of course that would have ended the film...in any case this is still very good....","8"
"lozza333","justifies all the attention it received upon it's release","1 November 2007","This was one of the scarier horror films I've seen and for that alone I can call it a great film. Having seen it many years after it was made, I missed all the hype surrounding The Blair Witch Project upon it's initial release. I had heard many different opinions from different people; it seemed like a 50/50 divide between who liked it and who didn't. That probably levelled my expectations as I simply didn't know what to expect. But I really enjoyed it and some parts of the film were the 'heart-pounding-hard-in-your-chest' moments you expect from all horror films, except that they were amplified by a heightened sense of reality with the documentary-style filming. This is ultimately what the film relies on for it's horror of course; it draws you very close to the hearts and minds of the characters involved and you genuinely feel scared for them. So many horror films simply have characters 'made for dying', that you don't really care about and are just included to eventually become victims.

I am a fan of the low-budget, low-gore style it employs, simply because it still scares you regardless. There are some flaws in the editing style needed to be employed to make it realistic (ie. times when it is unrealistic for them to have their camera switched on, but would be very scary to watch for the audience) and I did feel the film came to a quite abrupt end. But it is also very necessary to applaud the actors, who are part of the reason the film is so believable. Overall, you can't fault the way in which this film helped reinvigorate the horror genre. With the number of mindless slasher films reaching stupid levels in the mid-90s - Friday 13th Part 9 was released in 1993 and A Nightmare On Elm Street 7 in 1994... - I can still feel today, even watching it 8 years later, how important this film was.","7"
"hung_fao_tweeze","Scary? It seems to be subjective. Do see this once.","17 February 2004","I have never seen such a polarity of viewpoints on a movie. There doesn't seem to be any middle ground here. Okay. I'm on the side of those who thought this was a good movie. It gave me some truly genuine creeps. But I know why. I've spent time in the woods....in the night...in the dark. There ARE things out there that can get you going. Some of the noises in the film were very reminiscent of those I had heard. So, that got me going right there. I was a captive audience and was having flashbacks throughout the film.

The acting seemed very convincing to me. Like, HEY! I know people like this! Very real portrayals. You can, if you let yourself, become one of the gang - a quiet partner on the trip, so to speak.

The camera work should require Dramamine. If you are prone to motion sickness - this film will do it. It isn't so bad on the small screen though. Nonetheless, for what the intent is in this film - the camera work is very appropriate. Once again you can feel like one of the gang running your a** off.

Naturally there is no music. Nor should there be.

I believe the lighting is all it should have been as well.

Now for the chill factor....I was fascinated and began to freak a bit the first time I saw this...I admit. I thought the story was very plausible. Who knows what's really out in those woods. You're never really sure even when it reveals itself.

Oddly enough, as much as I liked it the first time, it lost ground the second time through. In fact, I may not feel like watching it again for a while. I must admit - some of what people complain about in this film was more apparent the second time through. But I wasn't 'caught up' in my imagination the second time through. But that's the key here, folks. If you can put yourself there - it can be rather effective.

The story and the whole PR idea itself is really quite good though. Bill Castle would have been proud of this one.

I recommend at least 1 viewing for everyone.",NA

"mmt02","Horror at its finest","2 August 1999","[Editor's note: this comment contains a minor SPOILER]

How many times have you heard a noise in the middle of the night and shivered in your bed? The fear of the unknown source of the noise chills your blood. That fear of the unknown is what makes The Blair Witch Project one of the greatest horror films.

Only using a camcorder and a black and white 16mm held by the actors themselves, the film's subjective cinemtography heightens the atmosphere of fear. Many scenes at night nothing is visible but darkness. The soundtrack is filled with noises but the camera keeps jerking around; you can not find its source.The scene inside the house ( I won't say what happens there ) was filmed ingeniusly (if done on purpose). One character holds the camcorder, the only piece of equipment capable of recording sound, while the other has the 16mm which has no sound recording device. As the one with the camcorder runs down the stairs, the audience can only see what the 16mm sees as it is trying to follow the other person. The screams of the person with the 16mm can only be heard as distant screams through the camcorder's microphone. So the descent down the stairs has an eiry detachment that works extremely well.

The Blair Witch Project shows that multi-million dollar budgets are not neccesary to make high quality films...","10"

Overall i thoroughly enjoyed the Blair Witch Project,its not a masterpiece,but its a film that you would find alot more frightening than watching a hardcore horror film.

Now, over a month later, thats all it still is to me. A cool, indie flick. This nonsense about it being so scary and innovative is really way out of proportion. The movie is funny, very funny and entertaining but it is no where near the bottom of the top 20 horror movies of all time. (The Lerprechaun movies scare me more than Blair Witch.)

"matt-201","Emperor's new broomstick","20 July 1999","If a beginning film class at a community college were given the task of adapting a Stephen King short story on video, the results would probably look much like this bewilderingly untalented feature, which is on its way to being the most popular independent film of all time. The two novice directors claim not to have seen Ruggero Deodato's extremely similar (and infinitely superior) CANNIBAL HOLOCAUST, though the debt RESERVOIR DOGS pays to Ringo Lam's CITY ON FIRE is chump change in comparison. A snooty-toot documentary filmmaker schleps two guys into the woods of Maryland to record evidence of a fabled serial-killing witch. The two guys fill up the first thirty minutes of the movie with fart-sniffing jokes; then, when you're waiting for something terrifying to be unearthed, the crew is menaced with--a bundle of twigs? A pile of stones? A tooth? The B horror movies of Val Lewton and Jacques Tourneur were low on horror and high on atmospherics. Here, in the absence of palpable shocks, you get--twigs. The oafish storytelling, the ""documentary"" surface that wouldn't fool a child in short pants, acting that evokes the adult-entertainment industry--somehow this all spun the buzz machine and turned BLAIR WITCH into the flavor of the nanosecond. Depressingly, a friend called tonight from Houston, Texas, to report that lines curled around two city blocks. This hunk of unutterable junk feels like taps for the independent film movement: the message seems to be, You can be a klutz with a video camera, just as long as you're high-concept.

I won't say that it utterly terrified me, but it was eerie in the extreme. Especially after *not going to spoil it totally* disappears. I recommend this to anyone who can go in and watch this movie not for what it is (a low-budget movie with a great concept and execution), but for what it's supposed to be (a chilling account of three students' run in with the unknown).

No special effects (because of a low, very low budget) but the actors are great to share their fear with you.

"dvdbn","A must see for anyone who wants to be scared","30 June 1999","This movie is not for everyone. Young children shouldn't be seeing this movie, and probably no one under the age of 14 or 15. It's VERY intense. There's a great deal of profanity. The movie is so true to reality that it's impossible to distinguish that it's really only a movie (or is it? you decide). The movie has no blood or gore (except for a very small bit of blood that totals no more than 30 seconds of camera time) and no music to lead you to fear - instead, it relies purely on psychological terror and one of humankind's biggest fears - being hunted. My suggestion if you're going to see this movie when it premiers - park your car in a dark, isolated spot. As you're struggling to get back to your car, you'll realize how scary a movie can really be. This movie is no less than excellent. It's put together well and it's unlike any horror movie ever made. Learn as little about it as possible before you go see it, as it will greatly enhance the experience.","7"

This is one of the best thrillers I've seen, although, it isn't for everyone, some people think the movie was pointless, but it is just that this movie was beyond their level! I think that the most interesting thing about this movie was the curiosity of it. I mean, the writers took a big risk, you may be thinking, but it didn't cost them, but still, it was a big risk to leave you hanging.

When something would get to me and I wanted to see what was here or there or in there, I would get up from my seat like if I was there.

A lot of people are complaining that it was like a home video, that is a lie, the only reason they made it like that was to make it reach you more, there were although some rough parts in the movie, but it is just to help you get into it.

The thing about this movie isn't the movie itself, but your own imagination. The movie isn't what is as ""SCARY AS HELL,"" but your mind. After you see this movie, I suggest you discuss it, it will add to the suspense. It should be part of the movie.

I rented this and, halfway through, DID have to turn on the light and make sure the doors were locked. I imagine it was very creepy and scary in the theater, but is less so when you view it at home. I have a real problem with motion sickness, and only had to glance away once from the rickety camera handling. I did find it a very interesting film, frightening in its realism and well worth seeing. I think anyone and everyone will question the methods...Bringing just ONE compass and ONE map, no survival gear, no means of defense, no means of signaling for help or contacting anyone, and no competent notice of direction on the way into the woods. ***What affected me the most was the depressing behavior of the two male lead characters as the thing wore on. They go from typical, dumb teenagers to violent primates who can't think straight. You get to watch them get lost, and ""resolve"" it by screaming eff words at eachother (very productive) and actually attacking eachother physically because they are so incapable of dealing with crisis. I felt so sorry for Heather, who is stuck with these two Simian idiots through most of the film and has to put up with their complete lack of humanity by any definition. She's the only one with sense, and there's no question that this ""Project"" was about the challenge of working with ""assigned"" partners rather than people Heather might have selected herself....Watch them blame each other and spend their vocal cords on pointless, endless profanity, then turn on Heather in violent assault. Their immaturity and barbarism cost the group its unity, the one thing that could have saved them all. After that it's just Divide and Conquer, the unknown forces taking advantage of the group's fear, chaos and instability, and picking them off one by one. It's no surprise that the dumbest, most violent one (Josh) gets his due first. He gives clear signs of separating himself from the other two, both mentally and physically, long before his abduction occurs. He's followed by the next idiotic (Mike), who is stupid enough to run ahead and lose contact with Heather, despite her pleading screams that they stay together. Then she gets hers, and the end comes quickly. The whole thing runs like predator/prey drama, with 'The Blair Witch' profiting off of the herd's confusion and separation. ***It's half 'Lord of the Flies' and half Apocalypse, with The Monster/Horror being anger, ignorance, impatience and lack of self-discipline on the parts of Josh and Mike. They are reminiscent of preschoolers, their only concerns being ""Your Fault!"" ""No, YOUR fault!"" and blindly allowing this to supersede any attempt at cooperative problem solving. Heather doesn't have a chance, saddled with these two lice-picking cavedwellers.*** She may have gotten everyone lost to begin with, but Josh and Mike doomed everyone irreparably. I don't know if it's a horror film or an exercise in gender comparison and typical, stereotypical male behavior, but ""The Blair Witch Project"" is certainly a creative and disappointing look at American youth gone wrong. Interwoven with this is a macabre fable about The ""Blair Witch"" herself, who does a number on these three would-be documentary filmmakers. It has moments of humor, fright and strangeness (I am still not 100% clear on the ending), and is worth seeing for its shockingly real presentation of a one-of-a-kind story. Even if they won't like it, I think everybody should see it.

And the take-home message...? If there were any ambiguity left on the subject, this film definitely proves that the most dangerous demons are the ones we take into the woods with us.",NA

But the acting is better than some give it credit for. The main trio's descent into madness is guttural and raw. Imitator films don't get as grimy with their camera work as the OG (sorry motion sick viewers).

But gosh, this movie was just a knock in the head or something. This movie is really different, it's not your Freddy or Jason or your leather face, it's not your Final Destination films or your Saw films. What made it so freaky was because it was just so different from other movies. You start to wonder during the film, ""What, this isn't real is it???"" As you might already know, the film is more of a documentary then it really is a movie. You don't know of the actors in the movie, nor the people and they seem so real. But also if you're planning to see this with your friends, don't. See it alone. Some movies are much more scarier seen alone, the Blair Witch Project it one of them. Not everyone is afraid of movies like these because they simply don't understand this type of horror. If you wanna be afraid of this movie be prepared to have scary things happen one step at a time. It's not all at once that is for sure. This movie will keep you watching. Again, see it alone. Or renting the movie will be a waste in my opinion.","9"

It was 90 degrees outside the theater when I left, yet I was covered in goose bumps and shivering from chills up and down my spine.

I guess if you think too much about the story you'll find things that don't make sense to you. I didn't even try. I suspended my disbelief and really let myself get absorbed by what was taking place. It felt real to me and when the film reached its climax, I was just blown away. The ending was so quick and left so many unanswered questions that my mind was reeling.

They fight about the camera being on and everything they say and do doesn't seem like acting. I love the beginning when they are interviewing people around town and getting their opinion and stories about the Blair Witch. As the days in the woods go on you can really feel their fear. In my opinion it's always best to not actually see what is so frightening. Therefore you are not disappointed.

"cinemel","Eerie, but not very scary tale","10 August 1999","""The Blair Witch Project"" is not the scariest movie. It isn't even scary. It is a bit eerie. However, it is so crudely filmed ($100,000 budget) to reflect its feeling as a student documentary film, that it works against itself. So much of the screen time is devoted to a black screen or shots of grass and trees shot with hand-held cameras, that it is just annoying. The most atmospheric thing about the film is the soundtrack composed of dialog and weird sound effects. The hype around the film's origins and promotion on the Internet is just that, hype. The movie just doesn't have much entertainment value. It is just a curiosity, and audiences are flocking to it just for that reason. I suspect they will be as disappointed as I was. The writers/directors, Daniel Myrick and Eduardo Sanchez, gave the gist of each day's shooting to the three actors who use their own names for their characters. They then just took the two cameras, one 16mm black & white and an RCA video camera, and improvised the dialog and action to fit the generalized plot of the day. The actors should be given screenplay credit. Their performances are natural and in its final sequence amazingly real. All of the film's creators will probably go on to more expensive productions in the near future. Possibly then their creativity and talent will be more fully realized.","1"

People like to think it's good because it makes them feel intelligent and perceptive when they say ""You don't need to see anything for something to be scary."" They then go on about how anyone who doesn't like TBWD only likes ""excessive gore and over the top blood"".

Something similar happened when the majority of people liked Inception, because it made them feel smart. When in actuality, 75% of those fans wouldn't be able to explain even basic concepts explored in the movie.

The truth is, you can't make a movie where nothing happens, and claim it's good solely for the reason that nothing happened. There simply are no scary scenes, unless you are scared by voices in the woods and an old house. That's really what this movie boils down to.

On top of that, the characters are incredibly unlikeable, resorting to self-sabotage, screaming, and fighting when they should have simply put their minds together.

"el_monty_BCN","I wish I hadn't known","5 November 1999","When Blair Witch was released in Europe, it was inevitable to go to see it with a high level of curiosity and expectations, given all the rave reviews and incredible box office numbers it got in the States. Unfortunately, one of the things we were hearing about it was not correct: that it was a horror movie.

Because I don't think it is, or at least that it doesn't respond to the perceived conventions of that genre. Blair Witch IS a superb exercise of growing tension, suspense and anguish, with an increasingly oppressive atmosphere which gradually grips you and drags you into the nightmare that these three kids, normal people like you and me, suddenly find themselves in. You know as little as they do, and you don't need any more, because your imagination does the rest. And your perception of the film gets even better the more you think and reflect upon what you have seen. I was entirely satisfied. But this is undoubtedly an arthouse film, and it seems to me that many people had misguidedly gone to see it expecting a slick, popcorn-friendly, Kevin-Williamsonish scare-fest with lots of surprise shocks and a blood-drenched grand finale. Which it certainly is not. Therefore, I can understand why so many complain about it having disappointed them so much.

For me, only one thing could have made it better: having been able to see it without knowing it was fake, like the first people who saw it in the States did.

Its central premise and its style of filmmaking is so inventive, and such a healthy kick in the ribs to the tired Hollywood thriller conventions, that I wanted to like this movie more than I was able to. The structure is just a little too loose, and moments of real tension and fright are leavened by far too many more moments of randomness and boredom. Also, I don't feel that the film really *builds* to its climax - you know, squeezes us tighter and tighter into a vise grip; it's simply a pattern of tension and release, tension and release ad finitum until the final attack and then it's suddenly over. Still, like I said, you have to decide for yourself - and if it really works on you and you should like it more than I do. . . well, then I'm envious. I really wish I could like it more.",NA
"kooperthecool","Who do i see about getting the last 86 minutes of my life back?","5 March 2007","It was all so good until the last ten minutes? What the hell happened?! It had such good potential: some amateur directors go into the woods to explore an urban legend. Brilliant. OK, sure, the camera is enough to make you projectile vomit in your seat but still, its good. It is undeniable that the first hour or so was good. Pretty freaky stuff, a lot of dark camera scenes. My only criticism with the first hour or so is the constant use of the word 'f*ck'. How is it possible to say 'f*ck' 133 times in the period of 86 minutes? Right, top rant over, we get to the final hurdle. They follow the sound of Josh's voice into a funny house. Was Heather deaf or just stupid? If she found his tongue and teeth wrapped up in a nice little package, why would you follow the supposed sound of his voice? No tongue, no noise. Simple.

After stumbling around a house for a couple of minutes, they explore the attic and the basement where both cameras are dropped. What i fail to understand, however, is why Mike dropped his camera and how the hell they both died. So when Heather drops her camera, we see Mike standing in the corner of the room. What the hell? Nothing wrong with standing in the corner. He may have to come realise that he is, after all, a dunce. How would that kill you? And why would their bodies not be found? Maybe because nobody cared.

Sure, it's easy to criticise and i probably wouldn't have come up with that idea in a million years, but if you're going to act on a good idea...do it well.

"beejer","If you go down to the woods today...........................","31 October 1999","This is one scary movie. It's not a monster or a slasher picture but more of a psychological scare the pants off of you type of horror.

Co-directors Myrick and Sanchez have created terror through everone's fear of the unknown. It has the look and feel of an amateur documentary film and having unknown actors play all of the parts only increases the feeling of authenticity. You are so drawn into the main characters situation that you will believe that this is an actual event that took place.

The film is masterfully crafted. In the early part the main characters are joking around and having fun as they interview the town folk about the legendary Blair witch. Then as they go into the woods, deeper and deeper, they begin to hear things go bump in the night, become lost and slowly begin to unravel. The last few scenes of the picture are as frightening and unpredictable as any I have seen.

Heather Donahue, Michael Williams and Joshua Leonard, playing themselves, are convincing as the three amateur film students. The fact that they seem to be the characters they are playing and are largely unknown actors only heightens the horror.

The jerky motion of the camera gives an authentic feel to an amateur documentary and reportedly left many viewers, including this one, with a feeling of nausea at the film's end.

The Blair Witch Project clearly demonstrates that the modestly budgeted independent film is alive and well. We'll now probably have to endure many big studio clones of this one that are sure to pop up in the next year.

"Denver53","Not scary, but interesting","30 December 1999","I'm beginning to believe there is a dividing line between those who liked TBWP and those who didn't that is often based on age. The post-25-year-olds seem to, for the most part, view the film as so-so and not scary. Many of the under-25 viewers like it very much and find it innovative and terrifying.

I'm over 25, so you can guess where I fall on that continuum. Blair Witch was interesting primarily as a study of three people freaking out, not as a horror movie. Much has been written about the low budget and primitive technique. Yes, it is primitive, and that adds a certain mystique. It is like watching old home movies. It's so bad it is interesting to see how the filmakers will get a story across with so little apparent ability to do so. But to me, that isn't a point of contention. The quality of the film technique is what it is.

The story itself is basic. Three young film students set out to do a documentary about a ghost legend. You don't learn much about the students beforehand, and they have little depth. Most of what you learn comes from watching the group dynamics of the threesome as their situation gets worse and each individual starts to break down. From that perspective, TBWP was interesting. It also gets very annoying, as they begin to yell at each other and become irrational over what appears to be simply noises in the woods and some related odd goings on.

The lack of reasonable behavior by the threesome is what ultimately turned me off. I'll avoid giving away too much here, but will state a two examples:

1. When the students become lost and lose the map, they show very little ability to reason out an escape route based on the direction of the creek and the position (east - west) of the sun. If they had a map before, and saw the creek on it, and then find the creek, how hard can it be to follow the creek in a direction that gets them to safety? Can't they remember what was on the map, at least the basics?

2. The film lost all believability when the filmakers, especially the female star, continued to shoot video of what were supposed to be horrifying and sudden developments. I could see taping *after* the developments, when a little time had passed for the students to adjust. But *during*? I don't know about you, but if I find bloody remains the last thing I am doing as I find them is filming, and zooming in and out on them while also screaming my head off.

That was the problem. How could a person be calm enough to film something frightening, while at the same time screaming and generally losing it in fear? It is hard to believe that one person is doing both simultaneously. And every time that happened, I remembered I was watching a movie, and these people weren't real, and anything that happened wasn't scary. I suppose if the camera were a small, helmet-mounted unit that taped automatically it would have worked better. But just a little.

In the end, The Blair Witch Project was interesting but certainly not worth the hype. I wonder how many people have homemade ""story"" videos in their tape collections that include plots of the same quality? Probably a lot.","5"

It takes three typical youngs, used to good life, and with the normal teenager sensation of omnipotence, to the woods. At the beginning, everything seems so funny and happy, but as the time goes by, they realise they are not as powerful or smart as they thought, and that their hope is giving place to insanity.

"~AleXa~","A vain, unimaginative effort to spend as little money as possible to parody a documentary about a nonexistent urban legend.","8 June 2000","The Blair Witch Project (1999) Reviewed January 3, 2014 after 2nd viewing (Blu-ray)

A vain, unimaginative effort to spend as little money as possible to parody a documentary about a nonexistent urban legend.

Where to start Well, I will preface my review with the following: The first time I saw this, I was scared out of my wits. Why you ask? Probably because I watched it at home in the dark late at night with no one else in the house, I was 16, and I had not discovered The X-Files yet (yes, it was out, but I did not start watching it until 3 months later). Now that I have a lot more knowledge, wisdom, and film expertise, I can see what a tragic cinematic failure it was.

The characters have little to offer the film. We barely even relate to them. Heather starts off as this well-to-do, innocent, but headstrong and controlling film student and winds up a whimpering baby. She knows something is out there and her bright idea is to go check it out in the middle of the night with armed with nothing more than a camera and a flashlight? Not so bright OR believable. I grew up camping with my dad (yes, in a tent in the middle of nowhere) in far more remote and scarier places than this, and I can PROMISE you, if you hear a weird noise in the night, the ONLY natural reaction you would have is to a) run to the car and lock yourself in till morning, or if you don't have an easily accessible car, b) stay in the tent, pull the covers over your head, and pray for daylight. You do NOT go venturing out to ""see"" what it is when there is no ""seeing"" to be had, documentary or not.

And her two supporting males? Let's put it this way: I only finally figured out who was Mike and who was Josh when Josh disappeared! They interchanged roles so much between the oversensitive asshole and the pacifist, I couldn't tell who was who, and I cared for neither. Part of the success of a film is portraying believable characters that the audience connects with, and all we're doing is screaming at the screen about how stupid they are. And yes, it's scary, but I kept being taken out of the film by Heather Donahue's OVER-acting. It was unnatural and you could feel it was forced, not gripping and intense the way it was supposed to come off.

Plot you ask? What plot? It is nonexistent. So for starters, they never explain why they are trusting some guy they don't even know to go into the woods and camp to make a documentary in the first places. Then they complain about getting wet from crossing a creek What? And did no one else notice that in the beginning, they were only supposed to be out there for a weekend. I counted one night actually, and they got NOTHING. What was on the documentary? Like a few interviews from crazy locals, them in a motel room, them walking, and some rocks they found in a pile? That was in the first 20 minutes of the film they started to go back! Then as what little tension builds does, Heather suddenly decides there must be something in those bound twigs that appeared mysteriously on our doorstep in the middle of the night, so she unwraps it to find I still don't quite know what Fingers? She completely loses it and is hysterical, and yet we're supposed to believe she very rationally decides not to tell Mike? I understand why someone wouldn't—to keep him from panicking so that they both don't lose it—but she's not in her right mind!! That's the point isn't it?! Not to mention Mike just throws the map in the river cause he gets mad! If you're that paranoid about getting lost and that anal about getting back on time, that is the LAST thing you do. Just unbelievable all the way around.

As for the director, he was obviously loony when he wrote and 'directed' this. I use the term loosely because he states he instructed them to film everything so that it appears as a documentary. The first 10 minutes are so boring you almost cut the film off. Then there's the matter of camera quality—I mean, come on--even in 1999 it was better than this. And what is with the constant switching from color to black and white? It only serves to distract the viewer and keep the focus off the story. Pick one and stick with it!

In all seriousness, not to offer insult to the show in the last because I love it, but an episode of ""Ghost Adventures"" is far scarier than this, and at least its NOT fiction pretending to be fact! Each episode documents evidence, history, and fact at a REAL location about a REAL supernatural event. The LEAST the screenwriters could have done was develop a film based off an ACTUAL LEGEND. The lack thereof only serves its intended purpose of creating never- ending loopholes for the directors to do whatever they want and be as minimalist as possible. Their motto: Minimum input, maximum gain. Do NOT be fooled! This film is nothing more than a cheap trick to make a quick buck. I hate to say it, but Paranormal Activity (the first one) did it so much better. *I* could do better if I had a video camera and two friends dumb enough to follow me into the woods based on rumor. EPIC FAIL!!

If you're looking for a thrilling supernatural movie, see The Sixth Sense, The Ring, The Mothman Prophecies, Saw, The Haunting, 1408, Devil, Signs, or Dream House.

Something about uppity females swearing is very unattractive. However, this effort goes to the heart of human fear, that which they cannot see, that which they do not understand and that which they cannot explain in simple and logical ways. Much like the power of religion, fear is baseless yet all pervasive, the very things modern people scorn as hocus pocus or fantasy (god, ghosts, evil spirits) are the same things that will give a well adjusted person the fear this film evokes, it is elemental, the caveman type of fear of the dark, strange noises and""things that go bump in the night"". This is why it works, I watched with a background in emergency medicine, funeral direction and other forensic science experience but it still made me jumpy. That is what a good horror movie is all about, not gore and blood and chainsaws every 5 minutes. Spoiler alert is purely to cover my butt, lol.","7"
"KillerLord","Intelligently Done Movie That Gives You Decent Goosebumps!","10 October 2008","The movie ""Blair Witch Project"" is a remarkably well done movie. Now, I am slightly confused with my own statement here. Because, there is not much done in this movie. I shall elaborate on what I mean a bit later on. But let me briefly summarize that this movie is indeed a scary movie that does give you the scares and the goosebumps that one expects from a scary movie. But the beautiful part of this movie is that it does not give you typical ghosts, ghouls and monsters as found in this movie. It taps on the fact that you are more afraid of the unknown rather the known. And this is the greatest strength of the movie.

The movie is about a collection of tapes. The movie starts out by stating that three kids had gone into a certain forest searching for what is simply known as the Blair Witch. They have never seen her but almost everybody has heard about her. The movie says that the kids were never found but their tapes were found and all we are shown in the movie is the tape recording of the adventure the kids went on. The movie does not have a cameraman. It is all recorded by the three kids who are the only major cast in this movie. Other people appear for only 2 or 3 minutes at the very beginning of the movie.

There is a certain rumor surrounding this movie that it is real. Many people believe that the tapes are authentic. I recommend you read the detailed and elaborate article on www.wikipedia.org which clearly explains the methods adopted by the producers of this movie to advertise this movie. The producers actually placed advertisements reporting the three lead actors as missing. This has led many people to believe and also spread the rumor that Blair Witch project is real. Well, it is not.

The movie's strength is that it shows you fear. The lead characters are scared of their experiences and fear shines on them. But if you have read about the movie in detail, you very well know that the fear on the characters' faces is genuine. They did go to the forest and instead of making them act, the director actually decided to scare them and thus the fear you see on their faces is genuine. So, for the genuine emotions of fear, frustration and tension you see on the characters, I'd prefer giving credit to the director. After all, he made the decision of making half of their experiences seem real to them. I don't know if it is a cruel way of making a movie but it works. The audience is scared and the movie is meant to do that.

The most scary thing about the movie to me was the stick figures they find in the forest. This really heightens the overall tension in the movie. The characters have lost their way in the forest and are doing the balancing act between consoling each other and also taking out their anger on each other. Each blames the other for their state of misery. We get to see genuine anger, frustration, fear and eventual terror in this movie.

A very ""well done"" movie indeed. Highly recommended for watching especially in the dark and preferably alone!","8"

"jmerlino","Good concept. A lot of filler","2 December 2020","I saw this movie in the theater when it came out. I think the story is interesting, and could have made for a decent movie. Unfortunately, a solid chunk of the movie is just running through the woods with a camera.

There were four moments in the movie that I thought were really effective:

1: At the beginning, they're interviewing a woman about the legend. As she speaks, her toddler kid keeps putting his hands over her mouth and saying ""mommy, no!"" (This was IMO, the best moment in the film)

2. When the find the little bundle filled with twigs and teeth and stuff.

3. The ""I'm so sorry"" scene (This one stayed with me for a couple of weeks)

4. The guy standing in the corner at the very end.

Also effective was the story in general. Setting out to debunk a local legend, but instead becoming part of it.

What was not so effective was the camera work and acting. You can justify this any way you want, but the bottom line is, I didn't really care about these kids, and the ""scares"" (such as they were), weren't very scary.

One has to give it credit for popularizing the ""found footage"" subgenre, which has given us some really good movies like The Poughkipsie Tapes.

I give the crew credit for creating a phenomenon on a shoestring budget, but I have no interest in seeing it again, and can't really recommend it to anyone except for the most die hard horror fans, who, I'm sure, have already seen it.","5"
"Primtime","Highly Overrated","12 August 1999","With The Blair Witch Project, I have read and heard many an overrated reviews. This film simply isn't all that amazing. Rather than what others say about being shocked at the last ten minutes of the film or being scared throughout, it just doesn't ring true. What really got me was the fact so many people still sat in their chairs after the film was over. Someone was even crying. I haven't seen that kind of reaction to a film since ""Saving Private Ryan."" Even Eyes Wide Shut, which is a much better film had no one staying afterwards.

One can talk of the raw emotion that this film conveys to the viewer. I have a problem with this though. Not enough of the film is seen on camera. During the late night scenes in which someone or something is moving around the tent, we never get to see the looks on the faces of the actors. A lot of emotion is heard, especially during the last quarter of the film, but since I couldn't see it happening, it all seemed rather phony to me.

The fact that this film will in time become the most profitable of all time just goes to how much impact hype really has. There hasn't been a person who I talked to about this film that doesn't want to see it. The truth of it all is that I have seen much better films this summer including EWS and American Pie and would recommend these over BWP any time. This film is definitely a rental.

The Blair Witch Project

Directed By : Daniel Myrick, Eduardo Sanchez (II), 1999

Hype backlash bigtime

Tremendously over-hyped horror hit (grossed over $130 million in US) that collapses under it's own weight regardless.

Three kids, two cameras (a handheld and a 16mm) and an investigation into the cold, rainy woods of Washington searching for witches and superstition make out The Blair Witch Project. The `documentary' is presented throughout as a true story and was even preceded by much internet and word-of-mouth hype as to whether or not it was a true story. Of course it is only a movie.

Very repetitive (day, night, day, night) and be advised to leave most of your logic at home (No mobile phone? One compass only? One map only? No clue as to sun-reading at all?). Thank you.

However; the premise was intriguing. The back-to-basics approach of filmmaking, the superb acting (mostly ad-libbed) and the desolate scenery make for an interesting experience. The intimacy and anxiety is enhanced by the great performances of Heather Donahue, Michael Williams and Joshua Leonard.

It would have been interesting to observe (or be) one of the few who viewed this just when it was taking off, because frankly I wasn't convinced at all.

Nevertheless, viewing Blair Witch in a packed cinema a few days after opening night, where 90% of the crowd consisted of teenagers, I made an interesting observation. The last horror film that most of these kids saw was probably in the vein of 'I Know What Jason and Freddie Did Last Spring'.

So naturally, they wanted gore!

Or did they? Some made remarks during the movie ('Is this it?' 'When does it start?' 'Alright with all that name calling!').? Maybe they had just heard that this was the movie that had fooled everyone across the sea and that it was genuinely scary and tested new ground.

If that is the approach, then be prepared to be hugely disappointed. Sure, I was annoyed at these spoiled and 'illiterate' (pun intended) MTV-generation youths, that had apparently been feeding on junk-and-dollar horror for too long.

At the same time  however - their reaction is somewhat understandable. The hoax was part of the package. Kind of like de-masking Jason. State of the art special effects may show him to be ugly as nothing you've ever seen, but he looked so much more frightening with his hockey mask on. He was MUCH more terrifying when shrouded in mystery.

This is the trick and trap that Blair Witch reminds us of, and ultimately falls for itself. Kapow.

The Blair Witch Project is a small movie celebrating it's own originality and thereby to an extent forgetting the initial task. Which is to scare! Yet it is somewhat charming and most importantly solid proof of how spoiled and unimaginative many have become when watching horror.

I suppose it was Ok for the money it cost, but to be honest I found the sixth sense more scary than this! To compare it with The Exorcist is risible! To be fair the people who I attended the cinema with were more impressed with it than me, so you can only conclude that it must hit a nerve with certain individuals. But sorry for me, I was left waiting throughout the film for the scary bits, and to be honest I found the final scene too unbelievable (ie. If I was wetting myself, I wouldn't be running round with a camera still trying to film!) Glad some of you found it scary, but The Blairwitch project just didn't quite do it for me.",NA
"dr_casto","Great little film wasted on general public.","30 July 1999","I really loved this film, but felt like someone had cast pearls before the swine when I saw this at my local cineplex. It was very distracting to have to put up with traditional horror movie fans' rude behavior during the showing I attended. Please, if you don't like documentary style films, or if you have to be bombarded with special effects and gore to have a good time at the movies; do everyone a favor and stay home! This is a nice little intimate film that will crawl up your spine and into your head if you let it. In between the times I was yelling at people to shut up, I was genuinely spooked by this movie. I think all of the hype about the film has drawn in a lot of viewers who are expecting something else. This movie doesn't force itself upon you, it will only scare you if a allow it to. This apparently takes more concentration than general audiences have. Rent this when it comes out on tape and enjoy.","9"
"ayed","Pseudo-documentary that is truly frightening","25 August 1999","Let me preface these comments by saying that I have never been scared by a movie in my 20 years of viewing. Sure, isolated moments in some of the more effective films of the horror genre have made me jump, but I have never experienced the growing dread and unease inspired by The Blair Witch Project.

By now, the media-hype surrounding the unprecedented box-office success of this shoestring budget indie film has begun to overshadow the power of the pure film experience. This is a shame. I wish everyone could come to this film as I did -- unaware of the hype, knowing just the barest plot details. Add to that mix a quiet, respectful audience (though very near the theatre's 500 seat capacity) in a Maryland cinema.... and you would have the ideal ambiance for enjoying (is that the right word?) this film. Too many people are going to see Blair Witch with their expectations artificially inflated and, inevitably, many of them will be disappointed because this film does NOT hold your hand in the typical Hollywood fashion, revealing all its secrets and tying the plot's threads into a neat package at film's end.

To those of you who have yet to see the film, these words of advice: do not immerse yourself in the media coverage before you go. Do not seek out the ""answers"" to the film's unresolved questions found on web pages and in the film's companion book. The power of this movie is its ability to make you empathise with the fairly mundane yet primal emotions expressed by the actors. As you follow the ""filmmakers"" on their journey into the woods, you feel the characters' frustration, confusion, disorientation, and, most importantly, fear of the unknown. The tangible ""horrors"" of standard ""scary movies"" -- the killer in the hockey mask, the monster stalking the summer camp -- are constrained the moment their image appears on film. Blair Witch proves (as do the perpetually disappointing adaptations of Stephen King's genuinely frightening novels) that hinted-at, suggested horrors fleshed out by the viewer's (or reader's) imagination are far more powerful than the best work of Hollywood's special effects teams.","10"

"RedWolf-8","A thriller for some, a thinker for others.","1 August 1999","I went to see this film with two other people. Going into it, I expected to be frightened beyond belief, which in hindsight, might have affected my opinion of the film. The general opinion of the film critics and other people who saw the film seemed to be that it was unbelievably thrilling , and gripping, and worthy of comparison too horror classics like The Exorcist. After seeing The Blair Witch Project, I can say that I do not agree with these people. I am not making any attempt to trash this movie as I was generally impressed by it in several ways. First of all, the first person perspective from which the viewer sees the film is very creative and adds a lot to the thrilling aspect of the film by making the viewer feel like they are actually there. Also, the way the characters are portrayed adds to the realistic feel of it. It feels less like acting and more like the natural behavior of three people in a difficult situation. For me, what was on the less appealing side was the lack of closure in many parts of the film. (You will be able to understand this statement after viewing the film.) While this feature also adds to the unique feel of the film by making us realize our own fear of the unknown, it also gives people the option to fill in blanks on their own. The problem with this is that you never know what is really happened. This nagging feeling of uncertainty was enough to turn some people off. I talked to several people after seeing the film, and the general feeling was that it left too much to think about for the viewers. These days, people go to movies to be told a story, whether it be funny, scary, dramatic or whatever, they want the story to be told to them, they don't want to have to create pieces of it themselves. Although it is intellectually stimulating, it is not expected from movies. For this reason, I would say that The Blair Witch Project is more of a psychological thriller than a straight horror movie. If you like thinking about what could have, or what really happened, then this is probably your type of movie, otherwise you might be a little disappointed unless you are very easily scared.","8"

This ""film"" was too predictable and you could see the ending coming a mile away. Another major downside to the film was the constant back and forth swaying of the camera, true this was supposed to be a documentary but after 15 minutes into the film I had to look away for a few minutes to focus on something that wasn't constantly moving a 100mph! I walked away with a headache and 4.50 poorer. Don't go see this one folks, don't even wait till it comes out on video. Here's an indication that a great deal of other people have the similar opinion as I do...I when to try to see it on opening night, it was sold out an hour before it was supposed to start. So I go the next day buy my tickets in advance and when I do go to see it I have no problem finding a good seat with no one in front of me, hmmmmm...could it be that after the majority of die hard film fans saw the very same movie as I was about to see and then after clearly seeing that it was a complete joke told everyone else the same?

I loved the design elements, from the series of twig bundles to the abandoned ""cabin"" at the end with the bloodied hand prints on the walls. However, the amateur level of theatrics and ad-libbing take a major leap of imagination to overcome. Michael Williams comes off best in the least showy role, with Heather Donohue and Joshua Leonard coming across as sophomore college drama students left too long to their own devices. I understand it would be very difficult to develop any sense of plot and script when you leave it to the improvisational skills of untried talent, but perhaps a real script with improv touches would have resulted in a truly interesting horror flick. Also the conceit of having Heather NEVER give up her camera really breaks the believability in moments when no person would realistically keep filming.","1"

Even after the horrible criticism I heard of this, I watched it on DVD tonight, with my girlfriend and all the lights out-with the inclination we would not like it nor be ""scared""...and it scared us both unbelievably. I have never been that scared from a film I will admit. The key is to step into the movie, which they make so easy to do. And I dont care what any tough guy writes, you would be scared sh*tless if you were in that situation.

"DorianWynHowells","People who don't like this have no imagination!","8 January 2002","What's wrong with people? I thought this film was a great example of showing that an audience does have a distinct part to play during a film!

But nooooooo, we have to 'see' everything don't we? We have to see the monster's or the killers to give a film praise! Scream - we 'see' it, so it must be good right? Look at Jeepers Creepers for god's sake! when we finally see the 'monster' it all becomes laughable!!!

This is where the Blair Witch's success lies, in the imagination of the viewer. The last 20 minutes of this film, for me are almost unbearable. People complained about the 'shaky camera' effect, but that's what makes this film. It's the fact that we as a viewer are thrown around both visually and emotionally by the three characters.

When they are attacked in their tent and they decide to run, that scene is soo effective because we never see what it is that's doing it! it's our own imaginations running riot with us.

The three leads all behave and react well to their given situations, the girl being the lst to break down. Josh was great, he was both strong, and weak at the same time in the later scene's when the group had lost their way. Mike, was a pain at times, especially his OTT 'hammed up' confession that he destroyed the map. Fool!

The fact that this film was marketed as a 'documentary' was also effective in obtaining interest.

My only qualm? this film didn't work in the cinema's because we were all aware that we were watching a film. I guarantee, if you watch this on your home t.v. (preferably the smaller the better) then you will feel insecure. Oh, and watch it in the middle of the night. or maybe even in the woods. . .. . . .

""THIS MOVIE WAS ABOUT AS FRIGHTENING AS A BUG'S LIFE!""

I disliked the Haunting also because it wasn't scary, but at least it had some good special effects. Blair Witch Project has nothing to offer for $8.00.

The hype around this movie was that it was original, scary as hell, and didn't rely on effects using your imagination instead. Well it wasn't scary (I brought my girlfriend who gets frightened very easily, she even jumped a few times at the Haunting and she said Blair Witch wasn't scary at all), its hard to invoke thoughts of sticks and stone piles and believe this is scary material.

After the disappointingly abrupt ending, I walked out of the film feeling cheated out of my money not by the film makers or actors, but by all of the critics that gave praise to this farce. They, in my opinion should all be given their pink slips.

The characters backstories aren't important seeing how they contribute to the movie fine. The pacing of the movie seems fine, a lot of things just seem fine.

Unfortunately for the filmmakers, the scariness increases.. up until the very end (which to be honest freaked me out totally). Overall this movie scares you .. but in a different way.

The fact there's no witch in sight is very clever, and also, the children sounds and such create genuinely spooky moments. The realism amazed me, the acting and cam-corder idea were incredibly real. This movie doesn't capture my love, like similar horror flicks like The Evil Dead series or The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, but it has an often genuine horror feel, rarely like those, but its genuine horror all right, and in my opinion, it was one of the best horror films of the '90s.",NA
"tripwires","Over-hyped and disappointing","15 August 2001","I thought this movie was going to be great. Unfortunately, the thing I stared at for an hour and a half or so was unthrilling, boring, and filled with stupid people whose vocabulary did not go beyond the word ""f**k"", who spend the entire time screaming at each other, walking around aimlessly in some strange woods. Did I mention that they spent the entire time screaming VULGARITIES at each other? I don't have a problem with vulgarities; in fact, I use it a lot myself. But it really disheartens me to know that people today cannot find a more intelligent way to insult others and have to resort to swearing, simply because their vocabularly isn't wide enough.

Not only is the ""Blair Witch Project"" boring, it's pointless. 3 (or is it 4?) kids with a hand-held camera, walking around in some strange woods (did I mention that part?), doing nothing but yell at each other, scream at seemingly nothing, and basically annoying the life out of people who don't have time to waste of crap like this. I understand that the point of concealing the thing they were all screaming at is to let the viewer fill in their own blanks, but it got tiring after a while. Besides, the actors are so incoherent it's virtually impossible to hear what they were saying, or muttering, or whining about.

For me, the suspension-of-disbelief aspect began to break down when the kids started avoiding the absolutely obvious way out of their predicament: follow the river! Duh. Wait a minute -- is it possible that the Blair witch was casting spells that were affecting their minds, ultimately ensnaring them in an evil web? Nah!

"Ike-18","The nightmare of Poe...","8 August 1999","The Blair Witch Project is the most terrifying movie I have ever seen, if not the most horrifying movie ever made. To try to describe in words such as soul-mortifying, heart-stopping, mind-paralyzing, would not do it justice. It is something you must experience. Now, I'm not going to spoil this movie for anyone who hasn't already seen it, but I am going to give you a few tips so you can better enjoy the movie. First, it is essential that you listen to every bit of dialogue in the movie, especially the town interviews, otherwise you are not going to understand why the ending is so insanely frightening. Second, go to this movie expecting to be scared and wanting to become part of the movie. If you go trying to prove to everyone that you were not scared by the Blair Witch, then you'll do it, you won't be scared, and you'll have missed the opportunity of a lifetime to enjoy a truly awesome movie. The Blair Witch Project is sheer creative genius. And the way it is filmed, although possible borrowed from other films, just adds to the complete madness. It becomes all too real as we watch the decent into the malstorm of Heather, Josh, and Mike. And the ending...well folks let's just say that I nearly deficated on myself right there in theatre. My girlfriend thought I was going to rip her arm off, I thought she was going to crush my fingers, and my heart thought it was going to rupture. Intense is not the word. This movie is the nightmare of Edgar Allan freaking Poe or whoever else you want to compare it to. And what makes it work is that you never know quite what's going on. Stephen King once said in his book Danse Macbre that our imaginations are darker than any horror movie could envision. That although we might be scared by something in a movie, it could have always been worse in our imagination. Well, that's what makes this movie so flippin' freaky. You are lead through a series of horrifying events where you are just as confused as the victimes and the climax is so viscious because you have been drug to the darkest corner of your soul and then......you're left there, forced to peer into the inky blackness and left with your mind writhing with fear, branded with the last scene like a hot iron.

"oyason","A gothic's gothic","22 January 2003","Here at last is a film that can with all justification wear the mantle horror, in its richest sense. Gone are the axe murderers and green vomit spitting demon possessed, gone are all the bug eyed monsters and even the more sympathetic ones. At the same time, we recognize in Heather's character Victor Frankenstien's obsession, i.e., the hubris that leads us all into the woods when we're not absolutely sure where we're going. That's the dilemma of the human experience, and that's why Blair Witch works for so many of us, I think. We all make Heather's error a hundred times or more in our lives, and we drag people along who either don't know how to fend for themselves or actually can't. And that's when the heartache begins, as the old song goes, because the way out isn't clearly marked. And while the woods may not be as filled with tigers as they seem and the world may not hate us, the tigers are still chewing bones, and the world does not exactly love us, either. As for the controversial camera work, it's pretty clever to create a plot wherein whatever the camera does is basically going to be correct. These are student film makers, right? At the same time, to those who believe the actual film makers got sloppy, please check out the more recent editions of the film with the outtakes, a couple of which are genuinely wretched. No, a lot of serious thought beyond just marketing went into this piece. My favorite scene in the film is when Heather, exasperated, insists that people don't get lost in America. Right behind this, Michael and Josh begin singing ""the Star Spangled Banner"" and ""America the Beautiful"". Whether it was intended or not, the film makers comment that people do get lost in America, and they don't have to be in the woods either.

All in all, the film is a fine piece of psychological horror and a decent outing for the actual film makers, Sanchez and Myrick. Clearly there's always room for improvment, but I don't know if it's in any of the areas (""Genuinely scary films like the Exorcist or the Shining"") some people are suggesting. I'm of the opinion that this one stands up all by itself, in a way that most films people call ""scary"" seldom can. It displays a little confidence in the imagination, not only in the imagination of the audience, but in the imagination of its cast. That's a rare achievement in these days when most American film makers use special effects as a crutch. I think the Blair Witch Project is one of those films that lends the horror genre some much needed credibility, and all kudoes go to Sanchez and Myrick.",NA

This one is on a similar vein - low budget, actors you've probably never heard of, and not necessarily your regular happy ending. Blair Witch takes it further - as well as enough hype to take it way up the box office charts, you're left wondering 'was it real?'. The actors are credited as themselves, the official web site (www.blairwitch.com) contains news footage of the search for the three filmmakers, and has no mention of actually making the film. Call me gullible, but I'm still not 100% sure!

As for the fear factor? I saw the movie at a matinee, so the cinema wasn't too full, but even the few folk who were doing a bit of heckling during the film were silent for the final ten minutes, right through the credits, and people only started moving after the lights went up.

"PJS-5","1 out of 5 stars 90% incompetent:Forget Pokemon,Star wars,W.W west THIS IS THE CON JOB OF 1999","23 June 2000","Pros: Good for a few chuckles. Cons: Proof that critical and popular moviegoing opinion can be quite absurd.



The hype for this movie is quite absurd.

Even the most respected film critics of professional and amatuer types drooled over this.

Sadly so did a large portion of the public.

The plot simply goes like this 3 filmmakers go into the woods to find the blair witch and they end up lost.

This is one of the dumbest,most inept,boring movies of 1999.

Sure blair witch isn't the only highly-hyped film of 1999 there are films like American Beauty,Three Kings,Being John Malkovich,Toy Story 2,The sixth sense,etc. were better than this movie.

Even highly-hated films of 1999 like Pokemon the first movie,Baby Geniuses,Wild wild west were much better than this dreck.

And no I'm not hating just because it doesn't have traditional scare tactics like big budget scares or cheaply made killers or just to sound different.

I may be too nice for giving this film a 1 instead of a 0 but I find some of the intentional humor funny so it is at least worth a few chuckles.

This film is purely for ""Arthouse"" fans only sure although I'm not a big fan of arthouse flicks there are plenty of good arthouse flicks out there.

But needless to say THIS ISN'T ONE OF THEM!

Although it was more boring that irratating afterall this film could be fun if it were treated by the folks of MST3K.

This film could've also been tolerable if they used the actual footage instead of this shotty re-make.

Originality is not a bad thing. But this makes the concept of originality look like ""something nobody else was stupid to do"".

Low-budget films can be good. Now I can't say this films budget should be bigger it just needs a better script.

So please I know that films like Pokemon the first movie,Wild wild west,Star wars episode 1 are highly flashy but they are more entertaining than this thrash.

Though it wasn't as bad as films like Very Bad Things and such but it was pretty close.

After sitting through this film I actually felt sleepy so I guess it is at least good for some sleeping medicine.

So please ignore the massive slobber over this and stay away from this unless you're a certain MST3K fan.

So if you want to see a good critically aclaimmed flick see Toy story 2 or the sixth sense (which sadly didn't do as well as blair witch)or something like that.

Hey say most of anything 1999 flick than this.

But this first half hour is essential to know the Blair Witch myth (wish I listened hard, heheh). Then the next hour is where the transformation of the kids from happy, to whining annoyance uttering the F word plenty of times, and ultimately fear.

I never got scared or made me think hard such as to lose sleep. What it is, is simply an interesting way of making a movie. That's it. The actors don't have much of a script to work with and so most of the scenes are ad libbed. And the story is constructed as a documentary. At the end, you feel that you want to know more, but since it's a ""unfinished documentary"" the end is naturally abrupt. This is one story best viewed on a TV screen IMO.

The verdict: 3 of 5 stars.","6"
"Jack-182","Creepy ain't it?","4 July 1999","I didn't know much about this movie when I first started watching it, at first I just thought it was about a boring documentary in which three slacker kids wanted to hit it big by making their story about a witch. I was frightfully surprised when I soon realized that their camping trip was soon to turn out for the worse. After the movie was over and that last horrifying 10 minutes of the film was completed I found myself wondering if this was an actual tape from those three kids disappearance. Thankfully this isn't an actual real tape but rather just a not so regular movie. I saw the film about 2 days ago but the story line and plot are still very clear in my mind and still make me think that this could actually happen and that although just a story, it still makes me wonder what if...","10"

"Harvest-2","Be afraid...","19 July 1999","Like most people now, I think I have become jaded to just about everything in movies. Violence, sex, the monster popping up at an unexpected moment, it's all been done before. The Blair Witch Project has none of that, and has only one scene that shows blood, but it is still the scariest film I have seen in over 10 years. I don't know if I agree that it is the scariest movie of all time, as I can think of some notable exceptions that still get to me today, but it defintely ranks up there with films such as The Haunting, Night of the Living Dead, and The Exorcist. I don't want to spoil it for anyone who has seen it, but I will say that at no time do you believe the people in the film are simply acting, and the power of suggestion, not the power of visuals, work to unsettle and frighten the watcher. Definitely go see this one in the theater, if you like to be scared, you will not be disappointed.","10"
"bobbyelliott","Original but not very exciting","31 October 1999","Saw TBWP on DVD last night. I was a little disappointed after all the hype. First the good points. It's original - definitely not your formulaic, Hollywood fare. Great atmosphere - the music is really frightening and the footage looks authentic. Good acting - from everyone but especially Heather. It's short - 80 minutes. The DVD package is excellent - the movie, director's commentary, various trailers, BW myth, TV documentary. The user interface is also well done (very spooky). BUT... nothing really happens. That may have been OK when no-one knew anything about it but now that some of the story has leaked out (like the fact that it was the producers who spooked the campers) then something was lost. You couldn't help think ""I know who put that stuff there"". So it's a victim of its own success. I gave it 7/10 and it *will* remembered for a long time - but not because it's a classic horror movie - because of its originality. If you want classic horror watch Psycho or Halloween. This movie's not in the same league.","6"
"Jazzman-17","Defines Fear","4 August 1999","Let me pose a question. What is more fearful? A noise in the dark or the thing that actually makes the noise? Usually the noise alone. I'm not too scared when i'm in my downstairs and i found out that the noise was really just one of my two birds munching some birdseed.

This movie really digs deep into fear. Most movies nowadays can't seem to scare the audience without shock music and 3000 gallons of fake blood. This movie far surpasses others in the scaring department even though it has aprroxamtely 1/1000 the budget.

I watched this movie two days ago and the final scene still gives me chills. This movie though is definately not for the MTV generation of people who need an explosion or bloody corpse every minute(hey i'm saying that and i'm a teenager)

The only real flaw in this movie is that we cannot really beleive that they would continue to film with all the paranoia in their minds by the end of the film. This movie though really builds and the fear is not attained by jumping out of your seats. It's the sense of dread when you come home and wonder what that bump in the night was...","10"
"livewire-3","Oh dear!","6 November 1999","When getting ready to go and see the Blair Witch Project I had seen a fair amount of television programmes showing scenes of the film with pictures of film-goers coming out of the cinema scared witless. The thing is that they must have been witless in the first place because all this film is, is a cheap camcorder documentary. The actors strive to be real which somehow they never achieve. Only the last 15 minutes of the film were remotely scary while the 65 mins at the start were weak. To believe the legend you would have to be Mr. Gullible which doesn't help. I thought that in the last 15 minutes the film could redeam itself with... (do not read on if you haven't seen the film)..

...some mutilations and the girl (who screamed so much I wanted to kill her)running around being chased. Unfortunately this film would have been good if it was as good as the hype, but it never could match that, maybe that was the problem. I read somewhere that the film cost $33,000 dollars to make so I shouldn't be too harsh but as it approches or maybe goes over $100 million in the box office I can but wonder ""is this a huge scam?"" Th mystery of the Blair Witch to me is how it ever became so great in the eyes of the critics. when I register my vote on IMDB I will do so accordinally.",NA
"angelynx-2","Intense, suspenseful gem","21 July 1999","OK, if you're looking for a shock ride this is not the scariest movie ever made, but it beats any shock-ride movie I've ever seen for sheer breathtaking horror and dread. **SUPER intense!** I **mean** it! A bit slow getting started, but tightens the noose steadily and inexorably. Wonderful use of black-and-white photography and of the simplest possible - but terribly effective - visual devices to suggest primal nature magick and relentless pursuit by night. As the bewildered, terrified kids begin to collapse from hunger, hopelessness and exhaustion you are right there with them, and I guarantee you will *not* be breathing during the tremendous final ten minutes. Cripes, what a climax!--BWP is a pure triumph of filmmaking simplicity and understanding of basic human psychology over multi-million-dollar monster effects, and I hope its lesson - which was well known by directors of decades past - is well remembered by filmmakers now and to come.","8"
"Ray-107","Not scary when seen, but plays with your mind for days after","11 August 1999","I've read a lot of reviews for the film, some of the ""scariest movie ever made"" sort, and some of the ""I can't believe I paid $7.00 for this garbage"". The truth is that neither sort of review is accurate. What is accurate is that your psychological makeup and the way you perceive the world will determine how you view this film. In other words, you can be as terrified by Blair Witch as you allow yourself to be.

The film is all about the fear of the dark, the fear of the unknown, and the way we deal with the unknown in our mentality. Are you the kind of person who is scared of walking down the steps in the dark after seeing a scary movie on TV? The movie will terrify you. If you're not this kind of person, you may not like it.

The thing really annoying is the reviews here I've read which state things like ""why didn't they just light a bonfire"", ""if you keep walking in one direction you would have gotten out of there"", etc. You people are missing the point entirely. In the film, they had walked 15 hours in one direction, and wound up at the same place. There was nothing wrong with the three hikers, there was a supernatural force hanging over the proceedings. They were in a kind of ""twilight zone"" where time and space no longer had meaning. This was what was terrifying about the film; coming to that point where nothing makes sense anymore, where reality is just a memory. It's that loss of control over your own life and your surroundings that is the most terrifying thing to experience, and that's the message of the film. And you people are waiting for witches or chainsaws or something. Open your mind.",NA
"osiris-2","Very good but not quite up to all the hype...","24 July 1999","Truly this is the scariest movie I have seen for some time. It proves that a good horror movie doesn't need a lot of blood, guts, or special effects to be effective. Many have ranked this movie with Psycho, but I would definitely not go that far. While it is scary in the night scenes, the day scenes tend to drag on. I was always anxious for it to get dark again - when all the scary things happened. In my opinion, Psycho never dragged along. But, regardless, I am telling everyone I know to go see it. It will most likely be their best scare for quite some time.","8"

"eiffel1988221443-2","My favorite horror movie of the 90's!","24 March 2001","This movie was great! I don't know why people didn't like it because they didn't show the blair witch but thats what makes it so creepy! It's also funny how they scream and yell and fight with eachother even though it's not ment out to be. My favorite scene is were they are in the tent in the middle of the woods and they hear children's voices,then all the sudden there tent gets pounded on, that was really scary! It's also cool what Heather finds in that package when she wakes up after one of the film makers is missing! Watch this film it's as scary as hell (thats also what is says on the cover)!",NA
"Taitdog","A great psychological drama---a truly excellent sleeper","11 August 1999","I applaud the filmmakers and actors, who succeeded in all they set out to do: Make an inexpensive, thrilling movie that defied genre, created its own, ignored Hollywood conventions, and stood out as an original masterpiece. I villify Artisan Entertainment and the hype machine surrounding this movie, for making it out to be something it's not. This is NOT a horror film, it's a psychological drama, about the unravelling of three friends as they trust and distrust each other in a dire situation WITH THE BACK DROP BEING the Blair Witch documentary. That's why the film isn't that scary. However, the last five minutes are definitely tour de force creepy and had me going. This is not Hollywood moviemaking and should be viewed by only those who can get past the non-Hollywood feel. This year's PULP FICTION, this year's CHASING AMY, this year's USUAL SUSPECTS. Expect many inferior copycats, expect Heather Donahue to become a sex symbol, expect a BLAIR WITCH marketing blitz. Get past all that (although I myself that Heather was hot and don't mind option 2) and revel in one of the best sleepers ever. Rating: A+",NA
"Freyja","If only the General Public weren't so brainwashed","2 August 1999","I loved this movie. Mainly because it is so totaly different from any film I've ever seen. I wanted so badly to strangle the kids in front of me who were snickering at the scenes that were completely black. They were like ""where's the picture?"". The general sheeplike public has been so brainwashed by hollywoods idea of a blockbuster film, that when they see something that is actualy good, and fresh, and groundbreaking, they brush it off and scoff it for not having wide screen special effects, and unrecognisable actors who don't churn out cliched on liners. They get temporary A.D.D. when there is no score to tell them when to be scared, and when to yell at Drew Barrymore, ""Don't go outside!"" The joke is on them, cause 20 years from now, this movie will be seen as a cinematic milestone, and they will be pretending that they loved it when they first saw it.",NA
