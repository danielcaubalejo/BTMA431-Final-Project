"FeastMode","I'm BEGGING you, please make Rated R movies","31 March 2022","Movies like Venom and Morbius need to be Rated R. They would be significantly better if they weren't restrained. And we've now seen multiple highly successful Rated R superhero movies (Deadpool, Logan). I'm BEGGING the movie studios to have the courage to go all out.

But that's far from the only reason this movie failed for me. Venom was still awesome as a PG-13 movie. So why didn't I love this? I love superhero movies. I love vampire stuff. This should have been a layup for me. It didn't even have to be good. Entertaining and cool would have been enough.

Unfortunately this movie is a complete mess. It's poorly made in most aspects. The story is disjointed, the dialogue is basic, the character depth is barely there, the relationships are superficial. But all of this could be forgiven if you just give me awesome, entertaining action scenes. My friend put it best: ""The action was gibberish."" You couldn't see anything.

I really tried to like this movie. I tried forgiving the poor quality in hopes of some mindless entertainment. But it never came. And the climax/conclusion has zero impact.

The only things that stood out to me as positives are one early action scene, and the visuals during the action scenes. The action itself is terrible, but the effects during some of the slow-mo shots are visually appealing.

After a fantastic start with Venom (8 stars) and Spider-verse (8 stars), the Sony Marvel side universe has faltered with Venom Carnage (5 stars) and failed with Morbius. Please do better. I know you are capable of making great movies. (1 viewing, opening Thursday 3/31/2022)

SPOILERS (also for Spider-Man: No Way Home)

The mid-credits scenes are... puzzling. They show the sky-splitting effects from No Way Home, and the Vulture transfers to the Sony Marvel universe. I can't come up with any logical reason this would happen. In No Way Home, they sent everyone back to their universe of origin. But for the Vulture, that's the MCU. So why would he switch?

On top of that, they have this super weak Sinister Six setup. And it doesn't flow with where the character Morbius is at the end of this movie. He seems to be ""a good guy,"" but now he wants to join a villain gang? I guess you could argue that they're not know to be a villain gang at this point, but as a viewer it doesn't feel right.

1) The post credit scene in Venom Carnage teases us with the possibility of beast Tom Hardy as Venom vs MCU Spider-Man.

2) Immediately followed by a middle finger to the fans when No Way Home cancels that possibility by sending Venom home.

3) Now this Morbius mid-credit scene debacle.

I have to ask, what were they thinking?","3"
"hifiman-62270","Far better than expected","8 November 2022","I expected Howard the duck such was the hate for this movie. Instead I got a short, dark sometimes quite violent slice of entertainment. Not the usual overcomplicated. Overlong marvel stuff that all end up being the same. Matt Smith and Jared Leno gave excellent performances and the special effects for a medium budget movie were very different but still very good. It's a simple origins story and to me I think Jared Leno may be the cause of bad reviews..maybe because he wasn't the Joker of choice and that's a problem for some people. But reviews suggesting this is some kind of disaster turkey are absolutely wrong.","7"
"paul_haakonsen","Turned out to be rather enjoyable...","10 April 2022","I have to admit that I had really been looking forward to watching ""Morbius"" ever since I saw the first trailer. And having been reading the comic books, I will say that Michael Morbius is one of my favorite Marvel characters, so it was nice that the character was finally brought to the big screen.

But then the movie was delayed and delayed again, and once finally out a lot of bad reviews were swarming the movie, so I was actually somewhat reluctant and hesitant about actually sitting down to watch it. But I decided to ignore the bad reviews and go see how the movie would treat the comic book character.

Writers Matt Sazama and Burk Sharpless managed to put together a fair enough storyline. I will say that it was aimed more at an audience fully and wholly unfamiliar with the Michael Morbius character. And I can understand that approach to the first movie with the character, as to introduce a whole new audience of viewers to the character, and not go in on the deep end and do fan service to us whom have been reading the comic books for years.

Personally I had hoped for a bit more in terms of story, but it was actually adequate enough in terms of entertainment. An origin story for a character new to the cinema screen is in its place, I suppose.

I was also somewhat hesitant about it being Jared Leto to don the mantle of the living vampire, given the swing and miss performance of Joker in the 2016 ""Suicide Squad"", but then again he was amazing in the 2000 movie ""Requiem for a Dream"". Thankfully, then his performance as Michael Morbius was quite good and actually was suitable for the character from the comic books.

Visually then you are in for quite a treat, given the fact that this is a Marvel movie. The CGI and special effects are quite impressive in the movie, as they are in all Marvel movies. So if you enjoy flashy CGI and special effects, then ""Morbius"" doesn't disappoint.

All in all, then I will say that I was more than adequately entertained by the 2022 movie ""Morbius"", though I had hoped for a bit more in the story department. But hopefully the future will add more layers to the character and his story.

My rating of director Daniel Espinosa's 2022 movie lands on a seven out of ten stars.","7"
"Thanos_Alfie","Simple start...","31 March 2022","""Morbius"" is an Action - Adventure movie in which we watch Dr. Michael Morbius, a biochemist trying to find the cure behind an extremely rare blood disease. He infects himself and he is completely changed by it.

I have to admit that I do not understand the reason behind the low rating of this movie. I am not saying that it's a masterpiece and it does not have any flaws but it does not also worth that low rating. I can understand that it's small duration didn't help the main character to evolve and I believe that there was not enough time for the end of it. The interpretations of both Jared Leto who played as Dr. Michael Morbius and Matt Smith who played as Milo were good and their combination worked very well. To sum up, I have to say that ""Morbius"" is a nice, entertaining action movie and I recommend you to watch it because I am sure you will enjoy it and I advise you to lower your standards before watching it otherwise you will be disappointed.","6"
"ethanbresnett","An absolute mess","8 April 2022","Morbius is one of those rare films that pretty much gets everything wrong.

The story, the character development, the action... everything about it felt very dated and messy, with practically no redeeming qualities to be found anywhere.

There was no depth to any of the characters which made it so hard to get invested in what was going on. In truth I don't think any of the performances were bad per se, but they were all so bland.

It didn't help the characters that the writing was so poor. They had no faith in the audience at all, spoon feeding us exposition in the most clunky ways imaginable.

The action was truly dreadful. It was either in super slow-mo which exposed the poor CGI, or it was at super speed to the point you were just watching blurs.

The story was so basic and formulaic. I hate to say it but I was actually bored watching it. The pacing also felt very off, as the film came to a very abrupt end, before subjecting us to some bonkers credits scenes.

I can forgive bad writing. I can forgive bad action. I can forgive a weak plot. But there is one thing in a film I can't forgive and that is when it leaves me bored. As a result Morbius scores a measly 3/10.","3"
"aidanratesmovies","Overdone CGI and editing aside- I enjoyed this one","31 March 2022","Entertaining and very atmospheric, Morbius manages to serve up yet another helping of campy superhero indulgence despite many little flaws. I'll start off with the problems I had with this film- that mainly being its blatant editing and CGI. I know many people say this about a lot of superhero films, but coming from a horror lovers perspective- as well as fitting the atmospheric and tone Life director Daniel Espinosa seemed to pair within it- this movie really should have been rated R. It feels like Sony really did censor and edit this one as much as they could have, with the blood and violence being as limited as possible. It takes away from the experience as a whole, one moment in particular where a man acts like his throat is cut open but there is LITERALLY NOTHING THERE. Unsurprisingly, as with the case with a lot of films like this, the CGI can be a bit overused at times. For the most part I liked the look of vampire blood hungry Morbius taken on by Jared Leto- but other similar CGI and at times that CGI itself can feel a bit too ugly and forced for comfort. The fight scenes towards the end in particular are also overdone with CGI, and I just really wish Sony would have let the people working on this film give some life to the project instead of worrying about its box office gross. I know i've complained a lot so far, but in terms of a film- I oddly did enjoy this one for the most part. Sure it's messy, Matt Smith's character is a bit over the top and it has some formulaic moments- but it is a very entertaining film. Leto and Arjona give their all to their performances and it has a lot of cool ideas and concepts that are interesting to see fleshed out on screen- particularly with Morbius in particular as he begins to learn how to control himself. There's a lot of humanity hidden beneath the surface in this film though, even with some formulaic moments, there's a lot of depth and heart put into the titular character and it really allows you to empathize both with the film's story as well as Leto on screen. In the end, I enjoyed Morbius- it is far from perfect but it was a solid superhero endeavor and I'm curious to see what they may do with this character next.

My Rating: 6.3/10.","6"
"DeadMansTrousers","People need to learn to enjoy movies without comparing them","1 April 2022","This is not your favourite huge budget Marvel movie like No Way Home, this is a introductory film of a somewhat niche character and if you compare any comic film to something like No Way Home it will fall flat. I went into this with an open mind and I had an enjoyable time. It's a different type of Marvel film with dark humour and I enjoyed myself while watching it. I am familiar with the character and have read the comics and I was not disappointed with what Leto and Smith respectively brought to their roles. I think if you are able to enjoy a film without nitpicking at it then you'll have fun with this.","7"
"JoBloTheMovieCritic","Morbius","2 April 2022","6/10 - I don't know what all the fuss is about with this one when the quality matches that of either Venom movie and while I didn't love the visual design of the vampires, I thought the cinematography, VFX, sound design, and Adria Arjona (who is now on my ""Actors to Watch"" list) really elevated the relatively weak story.","6"
"FlashCallahan","Snore-bius","10 April 2022","Dangerously ill with a rare blood disorder and determined to save others suffering his same fate, Dr. Morbius attempts a desperate gamble.

While at first it seems to be a radical success, a darkness inside him is unleashed.

Will Morbius succumb to his mysterious new urges.....

You know when a studio knows that a film may be in trouble, when they plaster the Marvel name everywhere on the poster, just in case nobody knows who Möbius is. And this film is a lot of trouble.

It's nowhere near as bad as a lot of reviewers have said, but its the same as saying a hammer to the foot is better than the hand. It's clunky, unfunny, and worse of all, boring.

Leto looks so uninterested with his character, and lacks the oomph that Möbius needs. Yes, whilst he is in vampire form, it's undeniably pretty cool to look at, but its all CGI and only took a green screen and Leto wearing a few ping pong balls. So Leto is a major problem, he's a good actor, and has been in some fascinating films, but this is him just phoning it in.

The rest of the cast are okay, Smith is really chewing the scenery with his Milo, and whereas in other films he would grate like Ruby Rhod, he brings some much needed life to the film when he's ever in it.

The nods to the MCU are so in your face, that it makes you wonder if the studio thought the audience would forget it's in the MCU. There is a daily bugle, and then the end credit sequences that are only there just to reiterate to the audience that they are watching another MCU film.

The boat is named the Murnau a nod to Nosferatu, Möbius uses his lab like a gym, a reference to The fly. This just makes you want to watch those films, because they are infinitely better.

And if the slow motion was taken out of this film, it would only be fifteen minutes long, there is that much in this film.

It's too dark to be camp, too self-absorbed to be funny, and this is what the film desperately needs.

It's one of those films that you will go back to again and again, just for the 'what the' factor.

It's not the poorest comic book movie ever made, the remake of Fantastic Four holds that crown, but it's on a par with Superman 4 and Batman & Robin, rubbish, but for some reason you can't help but watch it every once in a while.","5"
"goswamidiptanshu","Its a Decent movie!","19 May 2022","The pacing is tight and the action was awesome, the colors effects while in a fight was looking amazing, the story was decent as a origin, The 1st half was good although the final act the last 30mins were little meh, the villian's suddenly gone rogue was little odd felt like it just happened and the Nurse's stuff felt lost at the end with it the post credits just didn't make no sense considering the man morbious was. Overall 1st half was good and the ending felt little mess although its a part entertaining and a decent watch.","8"
"DarkVulcan29","Not great, but I liked it more than The Eternals","3 April 2022","Michael Morbius(Jared Leto) a doctor who is slowly dying from a rare blood disease, struggles to find a cure, when he thinks he has, but things work a little too well, until he discovers there's more supernatural to it, then he could have imagined.

It was entertaining, but to much feels taken out, like it was supposed to be R rated, but they decided at the last minute decided to take out most of the violence in order to get a PG 13. Everybody plays there roles pretty well. Jared Leto does alright has Morbius, but the film itself is pretty cliched, but still fun and entertaining, and if that is all you want then Morbius does deliver.","8"
"rjgrund-123-603438","Better Than Expected","9 September 2022","From all the bad press and reviews I suspect that people were looking for more then it intended to be. Seeing it for free on Netflix might have dampened the pain. This is not an MCU movie. It's trying to be one in the Underworld flair. Maybe too much Underworld. One of the problems is that Jared Leto cannot carry a movie. He needs a stronger lead to work off of. When he has that he's more than enough. The subtlety of the effects works for me. The bad guy Milo was a little too one dimensional and flat. Predictable. Weak writing in that regard. Not enough character development. I can see Morbius working in an ensemble MCU cast. Hopefully he will be given that chance.","7"
"kevin_robbins","This is not a great addition to the marvel universe but it is an entertaining one, much like the Venom movies","6 April 2022","Morbius (2022) is a movie my wife and I recently watched in theatres. The storyline follows a doctor with a rare blood disease that is in his final days. Him and his childhood friend do their best to cope with being on their death bed. When the doctor has a breakthrough he discovers the cure is as much a curse as a gift...that doesn't prevent his friend from wanting a taste. Can Morbius find a way to save him and his friend and modify his cure or will his friend get his hands on the cure and cause all new problems?

This movie is directed by Daniel Espinosa (Safe House) and stars Jared Leto (Requiem for a Dream), Matt Smith (The Crown), Jared Harris (Mad Men), Adria Arjona (Pacific Rim: Uprising), Tyrese Gibson (Baby Boy) and Al Madrigal (The Way Back).

The storyline for this picture is very well told with great character backstories and evolution. You can easily find yourself rooting and relating to both the good and bad guy. The action scenes are excellent and very well done. The opening boat scene really sets the tone for the movie. I liked the ""smoke"" effects around the characters and there's lots of solid kill sequences and use of blood. I did wish they kicked the gore up another level but that's more of a preference, especially when there's so many kills. I'd also say I wasn't a huge fan of how the ending was executed in the final fight. They did do a good job of tying in the multiverse to keep you aligned on when and where this takes place.

Overall this is not a great addition to the marvel universe but it is an entertaining one, much like the Venom movies. I would score this a 7/10 and recommend seeing it once.","7"
"Nixon_Carmichael","A profoundly bad movie. Sony is 100% guilty of false advertising. Early review.","31 March 2022","This is an early review. There are no plot details (spoilers) here, however if you want to go in completely clean, then skip the rest of this review. Not that there is anything to reveal.

The basic set up as depicted in the trailers and advertising is that Michael Morbius is a doctor in the Marvel Universe who is afflicted by a rare and gruesome blood disease. Setting out to find a cure for himself and others of his ilk, he winds up becoming a vampire and proceeds to go head first into adventures in the same vicinity of Spider-Man. This is all in the marketing material that has appeared over the past two years.

Speaking of the trailer, there is zero connection to other Marvel movies nor the MCU in this film. Essentially everything you saw in the trailers does not exist in this movie. Like at all. This is studio executive meddling and false advertising at its pinnacle.

In terms of technical filmmaking, this is a mess. The action is a disaster. It harkens back to the disastrous comic book entries from the days of yore, a la the horrific Fan4stic, X-Men Origins Wolverine, Thor2 and Green Lantern. It's just one messy CGI PG13 cut scene after another. I don't know if the director, Daniel Espinosa or the studio are to blame, however, given the fact that Tom Rothman, the Perpetrator in Chief of Sony, was also head of 20th Century Fox back when they were churning horrific movies, my money is that the disastrous production that is Morbius is to be blamed on Tom Rothman and his henchman suits at Sony.","3"
"martimusross","Well Worth A Watch","1 April 2022","Morbius

Overall it was Good

I expected so much more but basically it was an origin story for a vampire. Well get real how many vampire movies have I seen, from Dracula to Twilight and What They Do In The Shadows, I know every nuance about vampire life, and yet here the movie presumed we knew nothing.

Just as the movie was starting to flag in came adult Milo, played by Matt Smith, he dominated the screen and the stark contrast between the method style of acting and Thespianism could not have been more noticeable. It was great!

To me the jury is out on Jared Leto he has the look but not the charisma, he was proficient in this role but nothing more than that!

I really enjoyed the CGI and the way Jared, moved, flew, glided and transformed the rest was unremarkable.

I'm giving this a firm 7 outta 10, it was well worth a watch even if in conclusion it was quite a mundane origin story.","7"
"TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews","""I... am... Venom""? Movie, just because you aim low doesn't mean you can reach it, not if you're gonna put in this little effort","2 April 2022","Dr Michael Morbius(Jared Leto, playing the role fairly lowkey, perhaps to avoid reminding people of Juggalo Joker. ...I mean, he's playing a vampire. Just saying, iIt's not unreasonable to expect some ham) has a rare blood disease. He figures that the answer is bats, and tests it on himself. Let's be honest, who of us wouldn't do that, in that situation? Of course, it goes wrong and he becomes a creature of the night, which is a slight upgrade from merely dressing, talking and moving like one.

I am at this point slightly concerned that I may have made this sound more interesting, complex, and unconventional, than it actually is. In a lot of ways this feels like it should have come out 15 to 20 years ago. It's been in development for that amount of time, so maybe they just didn't do that much to change it anytime recently, to keep it up-to-date, since this is a subgenre that has evolved tremendously in that time? Without a doubt if this had come out one to two decades ago, we would be looking at it as a product of its time, rather than something that is completely out of date. It still wouldn't be good. Not even close. But we'd be going easier on it than we, rightfully, are now.

Clearly Matt Smith is enjoying himself. And his enthusiasm is infectious. For a while I was thinking, ""it doesn't really fit with the rest of what's on screen but it is fun watching him metaphorically dance all over the place"". And then he started doing that literally. On more than one occasion. In separate scenes. The action is decent, although the meh, and at times possibly unfinished, special effects do make it harder to make out. This was clearly trimmed down, and a lot of the things we were excited about from the trailers are either majorly altered or a scene that is now just a clip with narration.

I recommend this to those who miss the bad old days of the first Ghost Rider flick. 3/10.","3"
"cruise01","Bloodless, okay action, and could be worse.","2 April 2022","3.5 out of 5 stars.

Morbius is a pretty fair superhero film that may be thin on plot and decent action sequences. It does add an entertaining adaptation bringing in another character that is supposedly a Spider man villain. May not be as fun as the Venom movies. Jared Leto does a great job playing a sick Dr. Michael Morbius. Who is on a desperate search for a cure from his blood borne illness. Which one will be leading him into becoming a vampire. Adria Arjona also did great playing his love interest. Matt Smith is a bit flat with his character and also playing a villain that is one dimensional and forgettable. Jared Harris playing as Morbius mentor is also thin with his character. Along with Tyrese Gibson which the script did not give these characters anything more besides be on the hunt for Morbius.

The film is very fast paced. And the script does not give much character development with any of the supporting characters besides Michael and Martine (Adria Arjona). The plot is thin and may not be as strong. The action sequences were okay. With the fast movements with the characters and editing which makes the scenes more of a chore to see than increase the entertainment value.

If your looking for a quick superhero escapism in the theatres this film will be great. The direction did not do anything new to make it stand out compared to any other superhero films. There is a mid credit scene to give you a hint on where this character will be placed in the universe. The film is not great but still delivers some entertainment.","7"
"zezinhomene","Morbius is my religion now","9 June 2022","This is not a simple movie, is an experience, an experience that will change your vision of life. After I watched Morbius, every movie looks blame, every scene looks awful. Now I only love Morbius and Jared Leto. When he says ""It's Morbin Time"" ... I felt a mix of emotions that i can't describe. The ultimate cinema experience. Go watch Morbius now and do it at least 5 times every day. Now it's time to Morb everyone.","10"
"AdrenalinDragon","Venom doesn't seem too bad now","31 March 2022","No surprises this was awful. Jared Leto is terrible and Matt Smith was annoying. CGI was laughingly bad and the slow-mo action and wonky editing made things borderline unwatchable. Writing was all over the place too with some terrible dialogue. There's little fun and it took itself way too seriously. Honestly, this made Venom seem alright in comparison.

"tresm87","Morbius is another interesting yet scattered offering from the Sony-verse that delves into the more horror aspects of this anti hero.","30 March 2022","Much like venom it seems people are going to either love or hate anything from the Sonyverse. Some hate it because it's not in the MCU and still uses characters from the MCU spiderverse. Some love it for its more dark delivery and darker comedy. I actually enjoy what Sony is doing by making movies for the more vicious anti heroes while making them grounded for the most part. The MCU rarely touches on those important details. Morbius is very much like the first venom in its set up. Gives a nice origin story with some intriguing body horror and more gruesome than normal imagery for a comic book film. Definitely has some scattered plot pieces but it's serviceable. Also leaves more room for expansion in the world if the Sonyverse. Leto was great imo and still proves he's a fantastic actor. Visuals are very effective and vibrant. Overall the film is what I expected and it was solid.","7"
"Wolfgang-Kern","I don't understand the hate","31 March 2022","Morbius is not a perfect movie but it's a fun and entertaining ride. It's a comic book movie and yes, it won't win an Oscar or other awards. But it's still not that bad how some people make it seem it is.

Definitely worth watching and seeing it for yourself before being scared off by reviews that are not even slightly accurate.

Just my opinion :)","8"
"eddie_baggins","A toothless and inept Marvel offering","31 March 2022","Delayed a total of 6 times on its way to its eventual release this week around the world, Sony and Marvel's collaboration to bring its anti-hero Dr. Michael Morbius to life appeared to be one of those cursed productions that was doomed from the start and upon seeing this toothless and spineless comic book adaptation on the big screen its safe to say that the world would've been far better off had Morbius stayed delayed permanently.

An incredibly inept feature from director Daniel Espinosa, who somehow keeps getting Hollywood films to make with significant budgets and name brand casts despite never actually directing a good film, Morbius feels far removed from most brands associated with the Marvel name as its $75 million dollar budget is nowhere to be found on screen as a blur of video game like CGI, amateurishly scripted scenes and poorly acted characters hog the films lifeless 100 minute runtime that can't come to an end quick enough.

Failing as an origin story, with Michael's entire history set-up in one cringe-worthy flashback scene, an unnerving vampire tale and an action comic book film, it's hard to know what Morbius thought it was doing with its potentially entertaining material as Espinosa lets his leading man Jared Leto flounder in yet another high profile role that begs us to ask the question about his talent as a Hollywood leading man while he as a director ensures Morbius is nothing but an enigma of a character lost in a diabolical story that's hard to recall even mere minutes from walking out of the cinema.

Sometimes with films that fail as badly as Morbius does there's snippets of what might have been found within them, moments that show not all hope was lost at all times but that's not the case with Espinosa and Leto's blockbuster that truly has no moments of escape from its grim, shaky cam filled collation of cinematic rubbish with the only slight glimpse of a better film coming from Matt Smith's villain Milo (yes that is what he is called throughout most of the film, Milo) with the well-liked one time Dr. Who at least appearing to have fun with his role while everyone else is about as enthusiastic as a bloodsucker heading into their coffin for a day time nap.

Undoubtedly developed by Sony and Marvel to play a key role in the future with both Venom and Spider-Man properties, its hard to imagine how anyone will get excited coming away from this when it comes to the prospect of more Morbius being present in the biggest movie brand name going around and despite an attempt mid-credits too get audiences enthused by what may lay in store for Leto's charisma free biochemist in the near future, most will be merely rushing to the exit door to escape what is quite possibly the worst Marvel film we've yet seen.

Final Say -

Things never looked to good for poor old Morbius but not even the most pessimistic of pundits could've expected a film quite as bad as the one we get here, a DOA offering without purpose, intent or creativity, Marvel would do well to ensure Morbius never awakens again from a very long and hidden away slumber.

1/2 a blood bag out of 5.

"ajping","So bad it's good","23 August 2022","Imagine if Pablo Picasso had been sent to prison and with no other options began painting on the walls with his own feces. This is Jared Leto in Morbius.

The writing is bad, the editing is horrific, and the plot is nonsensical but Leto delivers. This is a masterclass in how to make the most of a terrible film. He carries this movie and it's so entertaining to imagine what he will say next.","10"
"kosmasp","Bat Man","5 April 2022","Someone on BBC1 asked Jared Leto about this, but I had it in mind before. And I think the Bat Man joke is too obvious to be missed out on. And that he is being played by a guy who also portrayed the Joker.

That aside, I can see that some people don't like the movie. The CGI isn't that good - especially considering the budget this must have had. There is also a dance (by the main villain) that reminds us of the bad dance by Tobey Maguire in Spiderman 3 ... also as cringeworthy as the one from back then. We then also get a Kayser Soze moment. Well not as iconic as the one from the Usual Suspects ... but it still is there.

We have a lot of scary faces, but not a lot of blood. Considering the violence and the death that are occuring ... this does not display them as visual as it could. But if it did, this wouldn't have gotten a PG-13 now would it? While this is a Marvel character, it is owned by Sony .. but as you may be aware there are other things that seem to get .. into the mix. One of them has an appearance during the credits ... in two scenes. No scene after the credits .. but those two scenes suggest something that Jared Leto has already hinted at himself ... an new Universe is building ... well if the powers to be and the box office allows them to.

Not a bad movie overall, but lacking a few things, even though the actors and the cinematography are not to be blamed (the latter has some bad moments especially during the last fight, where I couldn't tell where up and down was) ... sound was amazing, but I watched it in an Atmos cinema, so there's that. Very flawed but not as bad as some probably think it is ... it is an origin story and is quite stale pace wise ... but it is what it is.","6"

"classicsoncall","""We shouldn't be here when it gets dark.""","2 April 2022","Underwhelmed as I left the theater, I thought maybe I missed something but my trip here to the review pages confirms my opinion. Forgetting about the Morbius character's ties to the Marvel Comic Book franchise, this is basically a run of the mill vampire flick, and unfortunately, it doesn't break any new ground for the genre. The story is somewhat ordinary, as Michael Morbius (Jared Leto) seeks a cure for a rare blood disease, and by experimenting with bats, manages to turn himself into a creature of the night. His childhood friend Milo (Matt Smith), who helped fund the research for a cure, self infects with the same serum and discovers a lust for power that comes with the transformation. It's a pretty tepid plot line that results in some head scratching CGI considering how far special effects have evolved to the present day. More effective is the virtually seamless facial metamorphosis from human to vampire and back again, but it's something you expect nowadays and not particularly innovative. It all brings into question why the filmmakers would go for such a tired and formulaic approach for a vampire super-hero. When all is said and done, you can't even say that Morbius came out of the picture as a good guy, as his options didn't suggest much more than defeating Milo's alter-ego in a final vampiric showdown.","6"
"viantyara","Watch it for the sake of MCU","3 April 2022","Morbius is an interesting choice of a character to add to the MCU or Sony Spider-Man Universe, especially to have a stand-alone movie. Unlike Venom, which has more recognition in general audience.

This is not a bad movie. Mediocre at its best. Fun action sequences, good atmosphere for its genre and characters, but again, it's very... basic.

The conflict is very predictable and overused. Somehow the runtime is too long for what the storyline trying to tell, with that being said, weirdly some moments still felt rushed.

No actual character development, no memorable hero moments. The cinematography is done well, Jared Leto's acting is great, I just hope it was written better, both the dialogue and storyline.

But then again, with Morbius has a possible appearance in future Marvel Movie, especially in MCU, I'm still intrigued and excited.","5"

"ferguson-6","two of us against many","31 March 2022","Greetings again from the darkness. Trust the science, they said. Dr. Michael Morbius is a brilliant doctor/scientist who has devoted his life to formulating a cure for the rare and crippling blood disease he and his friend Milo were born with. This is an origin story pulled from the Marvel comic book characters created by Roy Thomas and Gil Kane. The film is directed by Daniel Espinosa (LIFE 2017, SAFE HOUSE 2012) with a script adapted by Matt Sazama and Burk Sharpless, who previously collaborated on DRACULA UNTOLD (2014) THE LAST WITCH HUNTER (2015) and GODS OF EGYPT (2016). Sometimes past work tells you what you need to know.

An opening sequence features the always cool shots of a helicopter zipping around the water and cliffs of Costa Rica, before landing at the mouth of a cave that houses zillions (I counted) of vampire bats. The brilliant Dr. Morbius plans to blend vampire at blood with human blood in his latest try at finding a cure. All of his work is funded by the ultra-rich and equally suffering Milo, both men desperate for relief from their deteriorating bodies. We flashback 25 years to a clinic in Greece where young Michael (Charlie Shotwell, CAPTAIN FANTASTIC, 2016) and Milo (Joseph Esson) first meet as they are being treated with regular blood transfusions by Dr. Nikolis (Jared Harris, ""Mad Men"").

Jared Leto stars as Dr. Michael Morbius, who is known in Marvel comics as ""The Living Vampire"", so we kinda know where things are headed. It's a surprisingly subdued performance by an actor renowned for his characterizations that are anything but. His grown-up friend Milo is played by the always entertaining Matt Smith, and Morbius' love interest and research partner is Dr. Martine Bancroft (an excellent Adria Ariona). You've probably guessed that the blood blend works ... right up until it turns Morbius into a blood thirsty killing machine. This puts FBI agents played by Tyrese Gibson and (master of wisecracks) Al Madrigal on his trail. And yes, we know this is headed to the high noon (or midnight) showdown between childhood blood buddies and it's the do-the-right-thing Morbius versus the 'hey, I like this superhuman power' Milo.

The first segment of the film does a terrific job of setting the stage, but the story, the characters, and the execution let us down for the final two acts. The fight scenes feature some of the worst special effects I've seen in years. Sure, the film's release has been delayed a couple of years, but that's no excuse for what we see. On the bright side, some of the effects do work, and Matt Smith is fun to watch in a couple of his scenes. We do wish for more of Martine's story, and for a better story overall (after the intro). The film is part of the SSU (Sony Spider-man Universe) and perhaps its best comparison is VENOM, sans the chuckles. It's clear this film's mission was to set the stage for a sequel, and that becomes even more obvious in the mid-credit scenes. Normally, I wouldn't mention this, but since the director has already discussed, and an appearance was made in SPIDER-MAN: NO WAY HOME, I believe it's fair game. The great Michael Keaton pops in as Adrian Toomes (aka Vulture), giving us an indication where the sequel is headed.

Just because that time was over it doesn't mean those movies are. And Morbius is the perfect example of it. The story of this movie is so predictable and bad written. Even though the main character and the main villain are played by great actors they have an awful development and all of the other actors don't even know how to make their jobs right! And I can't be the only one who didn't understand what was happening during the fight scene with all that CGI smoke. And the dancing scene, oh dear. And just to make this movie even worse they made the MCU vulture into this universe even though it's a completely different universe and he asked morbius to join him into the sinister six. For what ? Nobody knows ! And going back to talk about CGI, how does multimillionaire company like Sony pays so bad there special effects workers to have such an awful special effects? Resuming they made every possible thing that could go wrong in a movie and then gave it the name Morbius. And I just love how Sony that the memes about the movie were actually people saying they loved the film even though every critic site and the box office said the exact opposite and decided to relaunch it. But on the other hand, if you like fun bad movies, like me, this is the perfect movie for you and that's the only reason it's not a 1/10 movie.","3"

"cinistersynthicate","It's okay, and you'll be okay.","1 April 2022","FIRST OFF: I scrolled down through some of these reviews, I understand, and agree with some of the criticisms I see about this film, others.. well I can just see you really want Spidey & Company back at Marvel & I do believe it does help cloud the judgement just a bit & I get it, now am I saying this movie is perfect? NO. Is it good? Well, no. But it's okay. To go to the extreme that this movie is the second coming of Fantastic Four (2015) is an extreme to me, and If you disagree, you are entitled to your opinion, but I will just advise you to go rewatch it again.

Morbius is a cool little movie, that I see as a bigger risk than any of the previous spider-man related projects it has dropped, while I, being a comic reader for most of my life wasn't jumping for joy when it was announced, I threw my respect for trying it at least. The product was what I pretty much expected; the films' story does what it can with what very little it has to work with, it's not groundbreaking, but I will say I was able to look through it's basic dialogue, and story errors to see great performances from both leads (Leto, Smith) The CGI, I believe was worth my price of admission, and I RARELY mention that as a positive on any review, I was pretty impressed and had no reason to be. The action scenes are really cool, have some fascinating shots, and feel somehow immersive, leaving me with this feeling like I almost was there seeing him experience some of the beauty in some powers. There are a few moments that story wise you will scratch your head or ask yourself if you missed something & I believe I fault that on the runtime and I also question what may have been left on the cutting room floor as I had noticed a couple of scenes from the trailer missing from this movie, which I really hope didn't happen but I understand this is a typical studio decision, even though 2 hours is average for a blockbuster. An additional, and final criticism I do share with some is that this absolutely should've been rated R, no question about it, and it probably would've hit better, but then again the budget cut would've probably gave us worse looking CGI.

At the end of the day, check it out if you're thinking about it, if you're on the fence, just don't.

"dakotadickenson-83457","Not Sony's best film, but could of been something great","6 February 2023","So, after hearing all the bad reviews and choosing not to watch it in theaters, I finally had the chance to view Morbius on Netflix and here is my overall review on this film. For starters, I think this movie could of been the start to something great for Sony's spiderverse, but what I think made this film fail and not receive well with critics and people alike is the delays it had from the covid pandemic and bad editing. I felt some scenes in this film were heavily edited and cut which made some of the acting not on point like it was intended to be. Jared Leto I think did his best he could with the material given to him. His performance as Morbius is definitely better than when he was Joker in Suicide Squad. Matt Smith as the villain was definitely the stand out character for me in this movie and was probably my favorite part about Morbius. Tyrese Gibson was not in this film as much as I thought he would be and when he was, his scenes were either heavily cut from the final film or he was just acting like a police version of Roman Pierce from The Fast and The Furious franchise. Adria Arjona was a okay character. Honestly any actress probably could of played her part. The mid and post credit scene honestly was pointless and Michael Keaton's Adrian Toomes from the MCU had no point in being in this movie whatsoever. It pretty much ruined the awesome mid credit scene we got in Spiderman: Homecoming and made the mid and post credit scene in this movie feel like it was Sony's last minute effort to save this film from becoming a complete failure. Instead, they failed to do so making it more of a failure and raised more questions than delivering answers. Overall, this film was better than most make out to be, but bad editing and delays make this movie impossible to want more from it in the future. My rating 6/10.","6"
"MrDHWong","One of the dullest, most boring superhero-related movies to be released in the past fifteen years","3 April 2022","""Morbius"" is a superhero film based on the Marvel comic book character of the same name. Starring Jared Leto in the title role, it is one of the dullest, most boring superhero-related movies to be released in the past fifteen years.

Since birth, Michael Morbius (Jared Leto) has lived a life of constant physical pain due to a rare blood disease impeding his movement. As a doctor, Michael uses his medical knowledge to create a special kind of artificial blood filled with the genetic material of vampire bats in an effort to find a cure for both himself and others. After taking a sample of the cure, Michael's health improves significantly but soon he starts to display symptoms of superhuman vampirism, killing many people and draining their blood for sustenance in the process.

I have no idea what Sony Pictures thinks they're doing with their Marvel properties. One minute it seems they want to keep everything to themselves with standalone films and the next they want to collaborate alongside Disney's Marvel Cinematic Universe with Spider-Man. All these strange eschewed timelines make for confusing viewing for casual audiences and fans who cannot make heads or tails of where each of these films fit into which canon storyline. Like the two ""Venom"" films before it, ""Morbius"" is another attempt by Sony to introduce a Spider-Man villain by giving them their own solo film but it fails in practically every way possible.

Once again, this film has fallen victim to the dreaded PG-13 rating handicap. This is especially frustrating since the main character is a vampire, a legendary creature who drinks the blood of the living for nourishment. Scenes that could have left a visceral impact on the viewer have clearly been watered down to fit the confines of its assigned rating. For example, whenever Morbius picks up someone and sink his fangs into their neck, the camera cuts away before we can be shown any gory detail. If the film were R rated, this could have been a great opportunity to demonstrate the horrific powers the main character has acquired by showing the bloody aftermath from the destruction they are causing. Instead, all these moments were merely implied or glossed over.

Another thing that bothered me greatly was how unnecessarily dark the film was. No, I don't mean dark as in thematically, I mean the literally dark screen. Half the time I was squinting during the action scenes just to make out what was even happening. For moments that are inside Morbius's laboratory, it made sense for it to be dark but why did the filmmakers decide to use that exact same dim tinting during parts set outside in broad daylight? I get that he's technically a vampire and that he has an aversion to sunlight but not every single scene in the movie needs to reflect this. In a good movie like ""The Batman"", darkness is used as a storytelling element to show how the hero uses it to his advantage to hunt down his enemies. In a bad movie like this one, it only hampers the entire visual experience, making it very ugly to look at.

The film also has some of the worst editing I've ever seen in a superhero movie. Everything is so chaotically paced it's near impossible to become invested in anything long term. Yet despite its breakneck speed and relatively short runtime (104 minutes), the film is surprisingly boring most of the way through. Perhaps it's the overall lack of interesting moments or the underdeveloped characters but nothing in this film left any major impression on me. It's a shame because I like the idea of a character like Morbius gaining his vampiric powers through genetic engineering instead of via the supernatural because it could have made for a more interesting exploration into potentially introducing vampires into a new Marvel timeline. But instead all we get from it is a few brief moments of exposition intercut with an arbitrary action scene saturated by a dark screen where it's hard to see anything. To add insult to injury, most of the action contains ""shaky-cam"" which makes an already badly shot movie look even more badly shot.

I can't help but feel sorry for poor Jared Leto. He just doesn't seem to have much luck when it comes to appearing in superhero films. His version of the Joker in the DC Extended Universe is one many would rather forget (save for his scene in Zack Snyder's Justice League) and now I'm sure many would prefer to overlook his take on Morbius as well. To Leto's credit though, he at least looks like he's trying his best with the terrible material he has to work with, which is a task easier said than done. Sadly, there's not much here worth salvaging, as the script he has to work with is dead on arrival.

Another actor who goes to waste along with him is Matt Smith as the antagonist Milo. Like Leto, Smith is also working hard to bring out as much entertainment value from his character as he can, but he is constantly bogged down by the film's worst traits. In the brief moments Leto and Smith were interacting, I could feel that there was some fleeting chemistry between them that could have made for some great dialogue scenes. But I guess the filmmakers thought the audience wouldn't care and decided to insert more badly shot and edited action scenes to pad things out.

Even with my low expectations, ""Morbius"" still managed to disappoint me even more than I had imagined. Worst of all, the film isn't even bad in the cheesy fun sense; it's just a boringly forgettable experience. All the potential was there for them to have made at least a semi-decent origin story surrounding this character but without focus and passion (you know, the most important things required to tell a story in the first place) it all fell apart embarrassingly. The film is already failing both critically and commercially so hopefully this will serve as a wakeup call to the people at Sony. If you want to watch good Marvel movies featuring vampires, then watch the first two ""Blade"" films starring Wesley Snipes as they still hold up pretty well today (don't bother too much with ""Trinity"" though). As for this one, if you value your time and money, avoid it at all costs.

I rate it 3/10.","3"

""Morbius is yet another disaster from the Sony-Marvel shared universe.

Despite good performances from Jared Leto and Matt Smith and even a couple of visually captivating action sequences, the formulaic screenplay that seems to originate from the beginning of the century ruins everything in its path.

From the predictability and zero creativity of the main plot to the heavy reliance on uninteresting, unnecessary exposition, Daniel Espinosa finds his most significant problem in the blatant lack of care in the treatment of the characters.

The narrative logical lapses are too many to ignore and even amplified by extremely messy editing, a third act wrapped in an unfathomable blend of CGI, and a plagiarized score.

Things progress quickly in Moribus, almost too quickly. The story is essentially about two friends, and the birth of a...hero? The hero part isn't really clear, though, Dr. Moribus is dedicated to saving lives and saving himself and his best friend from an incurable illness. Moribus is a genius and he creates a cure that in typical mad science experiment goes horribly wrong. Then the good doctor's best friend takes the ""cure"" with predictably bad results. Unfortunately, the whole thing is very predictable and because of that a little boring. There are some great FX and action sequences, but compared to today's FX-heavy movies, it is pretty standard fare. Decent for a movie night.

"adykotidou","Enjoyable movie, but there should've been more character development and less cringy CGI.","11 September 2022","To be fair, I haven't read the comics, so I can't tell you if they did the character justice or not. Still, I really liked the idea - Morbius desperately trying to find a cure for his disease, even if his methods are unethical and experimental.

However, I can't help but cringe at his ""vampire design"". They pushed it too hard and in the end it just looked messed up. It doesn't work like it does with Venom, for example. And in general, I believe that they overdid it with the CGI. It just looks weird at times. And the whole ""flying and controlling the bats"" thing doesn't help.. Even that pushes the concept of the vampire too far.

Also, I'd have liked there to be a bit more character development. It feels like they only showed us the minimal in that part. Maybe if the movie was a little longer, we would have better understood our characters and their feelings. I mean, Milo got bullied in the past, but was that really enough for him to go haywire and start killing all these people? Was he really that jealous of them for not having a condition like his? I wanted to learn more about him and his feelings, for example.

Lastly, how and why did Vulture get to that universe? You can't break the laws of the MCU and not explain a damn thing. And why did they cut so many scenes from the movie that were in the trailer?

In short: I still enjoyed this movie, even with its flaws and cringy moments/designs, but it could have been better. Still, it IS better than the Eternals and all of the MCU series (they're a waste of time and should've been movies instead of series).","6"

The CGI was so horrible and it felt like most scenes were on stage. The camera angles were weird and didn't compliment the movie. I found the first half boring and when it finally picked up it was intersting for a moment when he first changed and was trying to figure things out. Then it took an even more boring turn when the cops soon got involved and he did not want to change at all. I wanted to see him own it. Be a vampire, find yourself in it. Use it for good or bad. But running away from it was annoying. There was no feelings or chemistry in th love story. It felt thrown in. And the whole relationship brother thing didn't flow nicely either. I didn't feel the connection at all. I honestly was rooting for the other guy because he was so much cooler and more interesting. Overall I found the movie boring and was very tempted to shut it off.","4"
"MiroslavKyuranov","Anorexic Weak Mess","30 March 2022","By any means this is not a good movie with interesting story and well-written characters. It's hard to determine, but maybe ""Morbius"" won the prize for the weakest film in SSU (Sony's Universe) and honestly it does with ease.

Leto is ""okay"" in the role of Michael Morbius, the problem is that the role itself is not very well written. Matt Smith is the one who had the most fun with his role, everyone else is just there.

The story is exactly what you expect to see - 90% similar to the previous two ""Venom"" movies, so there is no big mystery to unravel.

The effects are pretty...how to say it...for the most part bad for a comicbook movie in 2022. Let's not forget that this movie was supposed to come out in 2020, initially before ""No Way Home"". However, I'm not sure that the people who worked on it did their job in the extra 2 years time, because...well I'll leave that to you.

The main reason someone to be interested in this film is to understand how everything connects, given the easter eggs from the trailers. Well, don't expect too much, because you'll be disappointed.

Morbius is another interesting character, who does not need a solo movie, only to be presented properly. Unfortunately, Sony again has surpassed themselves even after they squandered so much opportunities with the ""Venom"" movies. Honestly, I don't have high hopes for neither ""Kraven"" or ""Madame Web"". The standard is pretty low.

The film is mediocre and feels like something straight from 2006, with some nasty effects and overall made just to make some dollars. Pitty. Disgrace to the character.

I can say that the best...or rather the stupidest they have left for the end. I mean the credit scenes will make you shake your head and laugh.","5"
"stevendbeard","Super Hero Let Down","2 April 2022","I saw Morbius, starring Jared Leto-House of Gucci, Fight Club; Matt Smith-Last Night in Soho, Doctor Who_tv; Adria Arjona-Life of the Party, Pacific Rim:Uprising and Tyrese Gibson-the Fast & Furious movies, the Transformers movies.

This is a super hero movie let down for me and I love super hero movies. For those unfamiliar with the character, Jared plays Doctor Michael Morbius, a biochemist with a rare blood disease and he has spent his life looking for a cure. He was also a villain that tangled with Spider_Man a lot in the comics before he turned good-kind of like how Venom did. Matt is Jared's childhood friend that has the same disease. In his search, Jared experiments with vampire bat enzymes and comes up with a serum that cures his disease but also changes himself into a vampire feeding on blood. Of course, Matt wants the cure too but Jared thinks it's too dangerous. Adria is Jared's lab assistant/doctor friend that helps him and when dead bodies start showing up-drained of blood-Tyrese plays the F. B. I. Agent that is investigating the murders. The fights are not as good as the ones in the last Spider_Man movie-maybe I was just expecting too much-so it was a little bit of a let down. There are 2 scenes as the end credits start-nothing at the very end-that hint at a sinister sequel.

It's rated PG-13 for violence, frightening images and language and has a running time of 1 hour & 44 minutes.

As I said, I love super hero movies so I would probably buy it on DVD. But if you are unfamiliar with Morbius, it might be better as a rental.","7"
"bradykitchen-33648","Seems like a first draft","4 April 2022","Morbius stars Jared Leto, Matt Smith, Adria Arjona, Jared Harris and Tyrese Gibson. Michael Morbius is in the process of curing his rare blood disorder when he unleashes something even more life threatening, but not to himself.

This film is bad there is no sugar coating it, but I believe it's watchable. I say it's watchable because I can appreciate the simplicity and the combination of horror and marvel but what makes this movie bad is the lack of development. The film just moves from plot point to plot point without any character development. The plot moves quick and thats good but if you don't develop your characters the plot doesn't matter.

The lead character in this film has very little development and it keeps him from being a compelling character. A lot of the scenes in this film feel like they were cut, as if they finished the scene and decided they didn't like it so they cut it down. Jared Leto is good as Morbius but without the development it doesn't matter.

This lack of character development is not just for Michael Morbius it's for the entire cast. Which really sucks because I think Matt Smiths character Milo could've been really great. The performance by Matt was very enjoyable but there was far too little of him.

They also have added a romantic relationship which again might've been good if they developed it more.

There are quite a few emotional moments in this film but none of them are actually emotional and that is because the movie doesn't make the audience care.

Overall this film is bad. With zero development, the film doesn't allow you to care about any of the characters involved. Without that character development it's hard to be invested in the plot.

3.5/10.","3"
"Zedyeti","It's better than most mcu movies, you just hate Leto","8 September 2022","I imagine the very low rating has to do more with peoples hate obsession with Jared letos 10 minutes as the joker than the actual movie. It isn't bad especially for an mcu movie. Not saying it's anything special but it's nice that it is a little different, like people actually die like a comic book lol.

It is short for an mcu movie so it feels like it may have been rushed, but I don't think that's a bad thing. If they dragged it out I would have rated it lower.

I feel we should have moved past this point in the Superhero genre. The story did nothing that hasn't been done better elsewhere.

Sony is still trying to work out this game. Which is odd, given how well they stared out the gate with Spider-Man and Spider-Man 2.

But since those two, they haven't been able to find a film that has completely knocked it out of the park, without Marvel Studios involvement. The Amazing Spider-Man had good bits, and Venom was fun, but Morbius experience came across as a chore.

I thought Jared Leto wasn't bad, and actually held himself back a bit (unlike say Tom Hardy who went all out with Venom). Matt Smith looked like he was having fun also.

Visuals were patchy, but had some interesting parts. While the end credit scenes detracted from an already disappointing story.

Dr. Emil Nicholas (Jared Harris) had brought them together as kids in his quest for a cure. As an adult, Morbius had been working with Dr. Martine Bancroft (Adria Arjona) in questionable research with vampire bats to continue the quest. They discover a cure of sorts with dark consequences.

This is a Sony Marvel comic book movie. I don't think it's completely bad but it's definitely not good. I don't want to mix up the comic book universes but I keep going back to The Joker saying ""Why so serious?"". This is a comic book movie in need of some fun. It doesn't have to be jokes or light silliness but I just want the audience to enjoy the film. That's what's missing here. There is no enjoyment. I don't care about this protagonist. The first hour is a long introductory first act. His CG action scenes are interesting for about five seconds but it turns into a lot of smoke and chaos signifying nothing. The writing's low point has to be the counterfeiting lab. Why is he taking over a counterfeiting lab? He's not using it to counterfeit money. He's not being a good guy arresting criminals. It would make more logic sense for him to take over an illegal drug lab. At least, a drug lab would have some of the needed equipment. I grow less forgiving of this movie with every passing thought. Sony is building out their cinematic universe and nothing more is achieved.","6"

"3xHCCH","Moody Jared and Manic Matt","31 March 2022","Michael Morbius (Jared Leto) and his friend Lucien a.k.a. Milo (Matt Smith) first met twenty five years ago in a hospital where they were both being treated for a rare blood disease. Their doctor Emil Nikols (Jared Harris) noted Michael's exceptional intellect and sent him off for further studies. Presently, Michael has become a brilliant doctor and scientist who had been able to develop life-saving artificial blood which earned him a Nobel Prize.

Working on the anti-thrombotic elements of the saliva of vampire bats he had collected from Costa Rica, Michael invented a drug which could cure the affliction he (and Milo) suffered from. However, because human trials were illegal for such substances, he conspired with his girlfriend Dr. Martine Bancroft (Adria Arjona) to inject the serum into him on a ship on international waters. The terrifying effects were not what they were expecting.

Morbius was a character from Marvel Comics that I had no idea about. This was a Sony release, like the original Spider-Man and adjacent characters like Venom and Carnage, and so it won't be directly connected with main Marvel Cinematic Universe which is under Disney. There is controversy among fans how Sony was confusing the story arc of the MCU, like seeing Tom Holland's Spider-Man in the closing credits of ""Venom.""

Being his origin story, we see how Morbius met his best friend and blood brother Milo, and how his bold experiments had brought their friendship into the next level. Jared Leto played Morbius all moody, broody, and mired in his moral predicament, in sharp contrast with Matt Smith (best known as the 11th incarnation of the Doctor in ""Doctor Who"" and Prince Philip in ""The Crown"") who played Milo all loud, gleeful and manic.

Aside from the vampiric transformations, CG effects ranged from subtle (like his ear wiggling for echolocation) to bombastic (like his high-speed wave forms tinged with bright colors from his clothing). Director Daniel Espinosa effectively created an atmosphere of dread and horror, but kept things within a PG rating. A character last seen in ""Spider-Man: Homecoming"" appeared in the closing credits scenes hinting a Multiverse connection. 6/10.","6"

"the_malbogia","Genuinely like it, despite its major flaws.","20 September 2022","I went into this movie with an open mind, but somewhat was expecting the worst.

The movie genuinely isnt as bad as the press made it out to be.

Where is shines is its unique was of doing action sequences that rival bullet time/Flash-time. The atmosphere they bring together is definitely top notch, and the style some of the shots are filmed in are great.

Where this movie definitely falls short is its predictable villain/plot line, lack of real character development, and overall character motivations that feel week. By the end of it you barely remember anyone's name or purpose. They are written so minimally and dull-like that by the end of it you end up not really caring that much for them. Also the movie has terribly slow pacing to the point I wouldnt be shocked if you fell asleep watching the film.

Overall, I thought they did a decent job at bringing Morbius to the big screen, even if the plot feels like it was phoned in.","7"
"stilloopless1","I enjoyed it","2 April 2022","After countless delays and pushed back premiere dates, Morbius has finally hit the big screen, sadly without much interest or fanfare. Even worse, without many favorable reviews from critics. I was having second thoughts about going, but I had purchased my ticket a few weeks back. After all, for me an opportunity to take in a new Marvel film in the theater isn't something to bypass lightly. Not really knowing what I was in for, I grabbed my movie bag and venture to my favorite theater to see what's what.

Other than the few trailers I'd seen beforehand, I went into Morbius cold, never having read any of the comics and being completely unfamiliar with the character. I can't say anything about how the film holds up to ""canon"" as a result. I can say that Morbius the film is a straight up origins film and for my time and money a fairly solid one at that. I've definitely seen much worse.

While there's no deep dive into the character of Michael Morbius but we're given enough info (though some of it's vague) as to who he is, his motivations, and the type of person he is to make the film work. Morbius is heavily CGI, most of it well executed and effective, there is some overuse as well that becomes campy, but again nothing that's a detriment to the overall film viewing experience. The same holds true with the prosthetics as well, particularly in the case of Matt Smith's Milo (there a couple of scenes that made me laugh-out-loud when I shouldn't have).

Morbius is stunningly atmospheric and has plenty of good action, nice touches of humor, and humanity. A strong cast does there best and gives it there all to their credit. Due to the runtime of an hour fort-four minutes the character development is limited but leaves enough of an impression to want to see where they go next. The ending is also anticlimactic as a result as well. Quite abrupt to say the least.

Predictability/formulaic is also present, yet the film remains interesting and entertaining nonetheless. It's also clear that given the subject/plot that an R-Rated film would've been a better choice for this one than going the PG-13 route. Tempering the blood and violence to get the more kid friendly rating definitely impacted the handling of the film and toning it down didn't do anyone any favors.

From my viewpoint, Morbius isn't the greatest but it most certainly isn't the worse either. I was intrigued, never bored, an entertained the entire film. Yes, there are questions I have and holes that I want filled but I'm glad I went and saw it on the big screen. I most certainly want to see what's next for the characters/franchise as well. Do you NEED to see this one at the theater? No, waiting for a home viewing will probably work just as well. But, if you WANT to see it on the big screen, I say go for it. It's a fun little popcorn flick that doesn't deserve the haterade being thrown at it in my opinion.

Morbius gets a 7 from me.

Oh, don't bolt right away, you get a couple of credit scenes.","7"
"reddiemurf81","How far are we allowed to fix something that's broken?","9 September 2022","Dr. Michael Morbius has spent his life trying to fix the part of himself that's broken. He suffers from a rare blood disease, and after years of searching for a cure, his time is drawing to close (in his own words, he should already be dead,, so he knows his time is limited). In a last ditch effort to save not only his life, but the life of his best friend Milo (and the lives of countless other people who suffer from the same disease),, Michael creates a serum by using cells from a vampire bat, and injects the serum into himself via the spine (not exactly legal, so he does this on a cargo ship over international waters).

The serum works in ways far better than Michael could've imagined. He now has the physique and strength of a top olympian athlete, and feels more alive than ever,, but Michael quickly discovers other, less spectacular side effects from the serum. He now has an uncontrollable hunger for blood.

Human, blood.

Now,, the real problem with this movie isn't that it's bad (really,, it's not that bad),, it's that it could've been really great if it had been written better and had better direction. It should've been rated R, for starters. The cast is really good, and it certainly had a big enough budget to be great,, it just lacks in the writing and direction, imo. If you watch it, you'll see that there is too much needless CGI, and there is also too much off screen stuff that should've been on-screen. Anyways,, I'd give it a 6.5 rating. Worth watching and enjoyable enough,, but no where near as good as it should've been.","6"

Jared Leto gives a reasonably charismatic lead performance with a few good jokes but can only do so much with a bland character and overall lack of emotional heft. Matt Smith is undoubtedly the standout, completely over the top and clearly enjoying it.

The CG is extremely messy and distracting, especially in the final fight which is almost completely incomprehensible. The action overall is competently shot but lacks any real weight or impact, made worse by a lack of blood and over relicance on slow motion.","4"

"chloeurc","Halloween film","1 April 2022","Morbius Review- Minor Spoilers

Pros: 1. Entertaining. This film is only 1 hour and 44 minutes long and goes by pretty fast. The first half of the movie is definitely better than the rest. I was surprised it actually has some cool parts and Dr. Michael Morbius is a kind-hearted person deep down and has elements that reminded me of Eddie Brock. I definitely need an oversized pajama shirt of Morbius's scary face on it now! His character I think has potential.

2. Martine Bancroft. The main female character Dr. Martine Bancroft is a colleague of Dr. Morbius and in the comics becomes his fiancé. She brings cool female touch to the horror of this movie, I ended up liking her character.

In comparison to Venom's Anne Weying (Michelle Williams) Martine (Adria Arjona) is a cooler better supporting character and a lot more loyal. Okay yes and she also has a cat (which Morbius lets hang around).

3. The 2 mid credit scenes. The theater that I was in, like smart Marvel fans, stayed around for the credits and it was the moment that people cheered. I won't go into details with what they were but it was awesome! It definitely is part of the other Marvel universes.

Cons: 1. The villain. Matt Smith who is supposedly a good actor in other films SUCKED in this (no pun intended). In my personal opinion he is what dragged this movie down. Jared Leto is apparently a better actor than Matt Smith, at least in this film. His character Milo has a scene that is about as cringeworthy as Venom dancing in the club in Let there be Carnage.

2. A lot of CGI. There are a lot of scenes of CGI and fight scenes that kind of make the movie lame because of the floating weird aura around them as they move. When Dr. Morbius goes full vampire, as he looks in the photo, he looks super creepy and awesome but most of the time him and his villain don't look that cool, and of course very fake.

3. Some things didn't add up. I was a little bit confused as to how his origin begins. There is a scene where Dr. Michael is standing in front of the bat cave with his bloody hand out, but then another seen where he's injecting himself with the ""cure"". It took me a minute to realize which one happened first and then later. Also there's another scene which I didn't like regarding him and Martine (I won't go into details for spoilers) but I understood it later. There were some scenes that definitely needed help.

If you love dark perfect-for-Halloween type films you will enjoy this. It has its moments where it's like Venom, but not as cool or endearing. If you pass on it I understand, it's not Marvel's best, but for the Marvel boys, go judge it for yourself.

For the record, Jared Leto is not in any way like the Joker at all in this movie. It lacks a lot but for a Halloween movie it's cool. 6.5/10.","7"

I really did enjoy the whole movie, I thought the acting was good, the visual effects were incredible and I just felt like everything linked up the way it should of and I have a theory why its so disliked, this is an underrated Marvel character that not many are aware of, he's not woke and that's a problem these days.

"ladymidath","I Really Enjoyed It","8 April 2022","Growing up with DC and Marvel, Morbius became one of my favourite comic book characters. The comic book code lifted the restrictions on vampires so Morbius was able to end up getting his own series. He originally appeared in The Amazing Spiderman #101 The movie does this wonderful character justice. Jared Leto was great in this, bringing the pathos and fragility to the character. It was a joy to see Matt Smith (Doctor Who) as Lucian/Milo.

The rest of the cast of was and I enjoyed seeing Adrian Toomes (portrayed by Michael Keaton), also known as the Vulture turn up mid credits which of course is setting up Dr Strange And The Multiverse Of Madness.

I don't understand the negative reviews, Leto was perfect as Michael Morbuis, the special effects were good and the story, although PG, it should have been an R, really worked.

Hopefully there will be a sequel that will be more of an R rating that would suit Morbuis' darker story and origins.","10"
"neil-476","Should have been better","6 April 2022","Michael Morbius was born with a rare blood disease which threatens to cut his life short (and also friend Milo's). Fortunately he isca brilliant scientist, and his research leads to a vampire bat-based serum. For anyone who has ever seen a science fiction or horror film, or read a comic, the side effects will come as no surprise.

This movie has come in for moderate criticism which, in my view, isn't wholly deserved. The story is solid, if unsurprising, a routine superhero origin. The cast are all good. The effects are well executed.

The problems, because there are for sure problems, come down to script and direction. There are areas which need explanation but none is offered - why does Michael call Lucien Milo? What exactly are the powers which come with the treatment? Dressed up in special effects, there is an echo-location thingie, also some sort of smeary thing which is flying? I dunno. The fact that the effects often take place in extreme darkness and rapidly edited jigglecam adds to the difficulty in following what's going on. This shouldn't be difficult to follow - it's a straightforward story - but the director seems to have sacrificed clarity in favour of style, and this was not a good decision. The scenes setting up follow-ups also have an element of ""Huh?""

This movie was for me amazing. Always been a Morbius fan and I went in and saw this movie without any hopes. It delivered.

I hope we will get plenty more of Morbius in the near future.

"ravenhaired-60589","A good movie rendered bad by unfair reviews","31 August 2022","As a Marvel fan, I must word my disappointment, for the movies and series they are producing nowadays are ever so dull. Yet that doesn't apply to Morbius. It's immensely more enjoyable than most marvel movies. I watched it in sync with (thor, iron man 2 and 3, captain America civil war, thor love and thunder, the avenger's age of Ultron, and all marvel new series.) and it hands down outshone them all. The story is captivating yet the writers didn't handle it properly. And to be fair the cast merits a round of applause for their remarkable performances considering what they had to work with. Especially Jared Leto and matt smith. They were both beyond amazing, I believed every sentiment they conveyed. Jared is a wonderful actor who lures you in with his realistic and original ways. Not to mention that he's a lot like Morbius in real life which deemed him a perfect fit.

The movie could've been a blockbuster if they had given it the same attention they usually bestow upon other marvel movies for they pale in comparison if not for the sometimes poor CGI and rushed writing

The reviews are utterly driven by unreasonable hatred and personal preferences that are irrelevant to the movie and its events.","9"
"martinrobertson300482","Awful","6 April 2022","Only really watched Morbius because its connected with Spiderman. I didn't have much interest and knew it was going to be bad from the trailers. But just how bad is it? Well it's really just a whole lot of nothing.

We've seen this story a hundred times by now. Mad scientist experiments on themself and ends up with superpowers. But not just superpowers. Vampire powers.

It's basically a combination of all the superhero and Vampire movies we've already seen. Except with terrible action scenes that you can't make out for all the bats and rubble that are in the way. As well as repetitive use of annoying slow motion, and people's faces quickly morphing into a Vampire face mid sentance. Just to remind you that the film isn't boring. There's even a forced unnecessary romance in there for no reason.

It could of at least been average and is almost saved by the decent villian. But then there's those tacked on midcredit scenes that just remind you this is all one big con to get you back into the cinema next time. Watching something that should have Spiderman in it but doesn't.","2"
"UniqueParticle","Awesome cheesiness especially in RPX!","7 April 2022","I fairly enjoyed Morbius for what it is the effects are really good, Jared Leto is great, and even has pretty good music. The negativity is understandable too there's some poor bits for sure like the dialogue in a couple parts was meh and the way it was filmed felt off occasionally otherwise for a stand alone marvel movie it's great action wise! I love how it's part thriller that aspect was perfect. Daniel Espinosa made a solid experience that is at least 7.5.","7"

"jprice-38253","So bad that I walked out, what a joke...","6 April 2022","Morbius, the perfect example of a movie that clearly wanted to be a major try hard of other movies. The movie is LITERALLY a wanna-be of The Hulk, Venom, Batman and many others done already before in the past. No purpose, no story, unoriginality, way too predictable, no sympathy or feelings for any of the characters, bad cinematography, flat humor, terrible writing and dialogue that just doesn't make any sense whatsoever. The only thing I'm spoiling here is when Morbius shows up to this lab, full of thugs. After damaging a guys bones to make him leave, Morbius says: ""I am...Venom."" THATS the part that made me walk out. Like, shut up. Just no. Did this guy really say he's Venom? Goodness gracious. All I was watching here was this vampire randomly killing people for no reason, because of this ""curse"" that he can't control. You can't look at Morbius as this hero or anything at all. You're not rooting for anyone in this film. Its pathetic. You're gonna be sitting there wondering what's going on, why a lot of stuff is happening, what's happening and when the film will end. You will not care. Trust me. This is only 2/10 for its cool effects and action sequences. That's it.","2"

"theatrequeen","Better than expected","2 April 2022","The critics were a tad too harsh when it came to reviewing this film. I have never seen a villain origin story quite like this, and I loved every minute of it! Jared Leto commands the screen as Morbius, and I was intrigued by the entire story. I loved it!","10"
"robopig-26082","Gut Wrenchingly Beautiful","24 July 2022","For context here, prior to my first viewing of this film, I had lost my wife to degenerative blood disease, and lost my children in a CVS Pharmacy. I was on hard times with the loss of my wife, no doubt. And before my fateful visit to Jared Leto's soon to be 12 time academy award winning classic; Morbius, I was on rock bottom.

The moment Michael Morbius came on screen, I felt a safety I had never felt since the age of five, suckling on my mother's tait. He was everything a man should be: Jared Leto (star of the critically acclaimed Morbius).

But the moment in the film that really changed it all for me was when Michael Morbius (as portrayed by Jared Leto in the film Morbius) was fighting the boss of the Vampire Mafia; Count Dracula (as portrayed by Dwane ""The Rock"" Johnson in the film Morbius). All seemed lost, like my kids in that CVS, until Michael Morbius (as portrayed by Jared Leto in the film Morbius) said the line ""Morbers of the world unite, for it's Morbin' time"", and with the power of one morbillion suns, he completely obliterated Dracula (as portrayed by Dwane ""The Rock"" Johnson).

Naturally, this received a standing ovation. One old man even had a heart attack, and a few of us got a few kicks in during the confusion. It was truly a life changing moment.

"GusherPop","Best Sony Film yet","5 April 2022","Dr. Michael Morbius (Jared Leto), the title character of Columbia Pictures' MCU-adjacent semi-horror movie ""Morbius,"" is a ""living vampire."" What, you might be thinking, does that mean? Did the good doctor become a vampire without having to die first? Why, yes-he fused his DNA with vampire bat DNA in an attempt to cure the rare, fatal blood disease that's been plaguing him since childhood. (What disease, you ask? You sweet, innocent child.) The fusion gave him super speed, super strength, echolocation abilities, and an appetite for blood that's only partially sated by the artificial substitute for which Morbius rejects a Nobel Prize at the beginning of the film. (Why? Again, you're asking too many questions.) In short, he's a science vampire. (So, like if Batman was a doctor, then? Wrong universe, but close.)So that means the usual rules of vampirism don't apply, right? Yes and no. Loxias Crown (Matt Smith) Morbius' best friend turned greatest adversary, does turn himself into a vampire using Morbius' formula. But we don't know if he died in the process. That sequence is left off screen, for reasons presumably tied to the many reshoots and delays that hampered ""Morbius"" on its journey to the big screen. Enjoy the gasp as it escapes from your throat, dear viewer. Because you're not going to get another one, at least not from this movie. Better luck next time with the actual undead, we suppose.

Jared Leto atmost tried his level best to match up the movie character and done it well whereas the antagonist Matt is not suitable for that character.

"Taske95","I just came back from the cinema - disappointed","4 April 2022","At the request of a friend, I went to the cinema with him to watch this movie because we both love vampires and the horror genre. What did we watch? This vampire film is almost without visible blood, and what little is seen is black, while the only red blood is in medical bags that are given for transfusion, like wtf. Next, I would describe this film as - super ultra fast action, because Morbius is moving so fast that the shots can barely catch it. Oh yes did I mention that as Morbius (the vampire) moves and flies he leaves behind a trace of color like say a character in a fortnite ! Wtf. Oh yes, and the movie has the dumbest ending ever, outrageously shortened. When the movie ended, I couldn't believe it, I felt like I was watching a cheap first episode of the series, and I expected to watch the next episode right away. Bypass this abomination in film art.","1"
"jimwt66","Better than I expected/slightly different than the comics.","19 May 2022","It has been a long time since I read the Morbius comics but I believe they did a decent job. The look of Morbius was pretty good except I could have sworn his was whiter. I also do not remember him having the power to control bats.

The issue with origin stories is either they do not have enough time to spin it up or they don't have enough time for the action parts. This movie tried to balance the two and missed the mark by a little. It's not a huge miss but I would have liked to see more of the beginning and definitely more of the action. And it was clear who was going to be the bad guy right from the start. Not a huge deal but not a surprise when it was revealed.

What I didn't like was the smokey colors that trailed after them when they were ""moving fast"". I guess that was there was to highlight they were fast moving. It's certainly not that they become misty when moving or at least I do not remember that.

My one big issue that will be mainly for the part 2. Is Morbius' bite could make other people become pseudo vamps like him without his powers. They did not indicate this happened to any of the previous victims. Only one of them woke up and if they try and make that person powerful that will be a big let down. In fact, the origin of that one would be different than the original origin of that character. But who knows...With the multiverse thing going on they could have had different stories that lined up with this.

That's the real reason they did the multiverse...That way they can redo anything they want and say ""hey, it's not the same"". I guess it's better than time travel which allows them to change whatever they want. Take Star Trek for instance. I like the new movies but they threw in some time travel and can now recreate the whole Star Trek franchise and make changes whenever they want.","6"
"alanskoczynski","It certainly was one of the movies released","22 September 2022","Morbius gets a lot of hate which is fair. It's not a great movie, however most people who have the strongest opinions have never watched it. The perfect thing to call this film is medicore. I've seem worse, but it has a lot to improve. The directors were to ambitious while making it and had to drop a lot of side plots, which led to a lot of plot holes and unanswered questions. One of the worst example of this is the first scene of the film. We see morbius with a group of mercanaries behind him on an island hunting for vampire bats. The island is even shown on the poster, so that means, that it will be important later in the movie, yes? Well... no. Not even once has this scene been mencioned in any way in the film. It should've been just a post credit scene, cause it certainly felt like it was. The other bad thing about this movie is the pacing. There's either too much, or not enough happening at one time. For example the flashback to morbius's childhood would seem like an really important part if the movie, and yes, it is important. Hovewer, this is probably the most rushed part of the movie. Everything is happening really fast, which makes it way too hard to understand than it has to be and makes it feel like it's been compressed. With such an important scene being so fast paced you'd think that so is the rest of the movie. It's not. Most of this film is way too slow, with 80% of the action happening in the last scenes of the movie. The action scenes are also nothing special. Most of the scenes are there because morbius is just staying offscreen doing nothing.

With the whole rant i was just on, you could be surprised why I gave it such a good review. Even though it turned out the way it turned out. There are some good parts of the movie. Firstly, a lot of people have complained about how bad the cgi looks when morbius transforms and yes it doesn't look appealing, hovewer i think it could have been intentional. When morbius first transforms he is terrafied of what he became, acknowladging that he turned into a monster and this is who morbius truly is. Half human and a genius doctor, half monster, and the bad looking cgi emphasises the monster half, which is sometimes taking over the good side. The true reason why I gave it a 6/10 is because this movie has a lot of potential to grow. I mean the story is great in theory. I love the trope of a good person which has done a bad thing and they're forced to keep doing bad things to survive. Hovewer, morbius did not use this trope very well. It just seems sloppy the way it's written.

To sum up everything I've written. Morbius had a lot of potential to be great, hovewer because of sloppy work and bad choices it became the mediocare movie that it is.","6"

Mobius immediately gets derailed with some shoddy storytelling that shows signs of continual reediting.

Michael Morbius (Jared Leto) has suffered from a blood disorder since childhood and has dedicated his life to finding a cure for himself and best friend Milo (Matt Smith.) He is a Nobel prizewinning chemist and a rebel.

Morbius stumbles onto a cure by splicing his blood and genes with Costa Rican bats. It turns Morbius into super strong vampire monster with maniacal tendencies.

The cure is unstable but when his friend Milo finds out about it, he takes the blood and is angry at Morbius for denying him the cure.

The batty Morbius finds himself in the frame for various deaths.

The movie is muddled. It has a flashback to 25 years ago at the beginning and never gets around to tell the audience that it is now back in the present.

The ethical side effects of Morbius's experiments are never adequately explored.

Both Leto and Smith are saddled with flat and hackneyed characterisation.

The whole thing lacks energy and is only connected to the Spiderverse with the mid credit sequences at the end of the movie and that too was befuddling.","3"

He befriends and protects the wealthy newcomer boy Lucien, calling his Milo. When Dr. Nicholas notes his high IQ, he sends Morbius to study in the USA. Twenty-five years later, Dr. Morbius (Jared Leto) becomes a scientist awarded with the Nobel Prize, but he continues his research with artificial blood that he has created with Dr. Martine Bancroft (Adria Arjona) and financially supported by Milo (Matt Adams). When he feels that he will die soon, he decides to research vampire bats in international waters in a cargo vessel for ethical reasons. He prepares a serum and injects himself, turning into a monster and killing all the hired mercenaries on board that have threatened and injured Dr. Bancroft.

When Milo sees Morbius strong, he believes the experiment has succeeded, but Morbius refuses to give the serum to him and they fight each other. But soon Morbius finds that something very bad has happened.

""Morbius"" is an engaging adventure with a lead character that resembles a vampire. The screenplay develops the characters very well and holds the attention of the viewers.

"zardoz-13","Marvel's Living Vampire Makes His Screen Debut!","26 April 2022","The latest incarnation of a Marvel Comics character in director Daniel Espinosa's ""Morbius,"" starring Oscar winner Jared Leto as the shape-shifting vampire, hasn't proven itself the blockbuster either Sony Pictures or the public sought. The studio greenlighted this $75 million anti-heroic epic after the phenomenal success of the audacious ""Venom"" movies. ""Morbius"" shares little in common with the two Tom Hardy outings. For example, legendary biochemist Michael Morbius has no symbiotic sidekick who provides comic relief. Although ""Morbius"" debuted with a healthy $39 million haul its first weekend, the super villain saga suffered a steep setback, plunging 73 percent during its second weekend, coining a mere $10.2 million in ticket sales. Film critics have panned it. Now, it also seems the public is less than elated. The Screen Rant website reported: ""'Morbius' didn't go over well with audiences and currently boasts the lowest CinemaScore of any Marvel-based movie since 2015's 'Fantastic 4.'"" Meantime, The Direct website added: ""'Morbius' will have suffered the second-worst box office drop in the superhero genre right after NBA legend Shaquille O'Neal's 'Steel' from 1997.""

Apparently the critics and the public must have forgotten ""Morbius"" is a supervillain. Were they anticipating a carbon copy of ""Venom?"" Mind you, the PG-13 rated ""Morbius"" is far darker than the typical Marvel superhero saga. Nothing about this 105-minute origins epic is remotely facetious. Morbius doesn't don a spandex outfit like he did for his debut in The Amazing Spider-Man comic #101 (October 1971), and nobody spouts any clever dialogue. Basically, ""Morbius"" emerges as a horror fantasy laden with allusions to ""Dracula"" and ""Dr. Jekyll & Mr. Hyde."" When Michael transforms from a sickly to a scary person, he doesn't resemble an urbane Christopher Lee in a dinner jacket. Instead, he appears repulsive, like a skull-faced demon from an ""Exorcist"" knock-off. Clearly, the critics and the public alike wanted something far more flamboyant.

Sony and Disney own the rights to various Marvel characters. The Disney Marvel characters are appealing. ""Iron Man,"" ""Captain America,"" ""Black Widow,"" and ""Thor"" are role models for kids. Indeed, these characters are immaculate, while Michael Morbius knows his evil potential and wrestles with his split-personality. ""Dracula Untold"" co-scenarists Matt Sazama and Burk Sharpless appropriated story material from Bram Stoker's classic novel ""Dracula."" Not only is the sovereign vampire mentioned in dialogue excerpts, but the narrative also features a ship cruising outside the 12-mile limit in international waters. Several thugs armed with assault rifles die hideously on it. Similarly, in ""Dracula,"" the eponymous vampire exsanguinated the entire crew of the Demeter. For the record, a different version of this incident occurred in ""The Amazing Spider-man"" comic book. Sazama & Sharpless paint a more sympathetic portrait of Morbius. When Morbius saw his colleague, Dr. Martine Bancroft (Adria Arjona of ""The Belko Experiment""), strewn unconscious on the floor of the ship's laboratory, he went berserk and massacred the mercenaries, rather like as Dracula did the Demeter crew. Once he realizes the enormity of his conduct, Morbius wipes the surveillance video clean and radios for help. None of the traditional Marvel characters would tolerate such an atrocity. Afterward, Morbius vows never to do anything as heinous again.

Mind you, these mercenaries had nearly killed Martine, so Morbius' behavior could be deemed chivalric. As you can see, Espinosa takes things rather seriously as does Michael Morbius. Jared Leto looks convincing as a man cursed with a dreaded blood disease. Things don't really improve after he engineers artificial plasma for use on battlefields. Instead, Morbius discovers a cure. Unfortunately, the cure turns him into a monster! Moreover, one of Michael's closest friends, Milo (Matt Smith, the 11th ""Doctor Who""), suffers from a condition similar to Milo's. Michael had promised to share any breakthrough treatment. The problem is Michael needs human blood, a luxury that only goes so far in its artificial format. Once he develops blood infused with vampire bat DNA, Michael faces the prospect of having to kill people. Meantime, Milo lacks Michael's discipline. If he cannot get what he wants, Milo will devour humans without a qualm. Essentially, Michael and Milo emerge as different sides of a coin. This difference enhances the dramatic tension between these childhood pals.

""Morbius"" opens in Costa Rica where our protagonist has gone to trap vampire bats for his blood work studies. Sony could have made a movie strictly about Morbius transporting these deadly vampire bats to New York City. We learn Morbius suffers from a rare, incurable, blood disease. During his youth, he spent many years in a sanitarium for special needs children. One day Dr. Emil Nicholas (Jared Harris of ""Lincoln"") introduces Michael to another young patient named Lucien. These two grow up and bond until Michael leaves the sanitarium to attend a special school for the gifted. As a renowned hematologist, Michael invents artificial blood, and an adult Lucien (Matt Smith) bankrolls Michael's research. His prestige as a researcher spreads when he not only wins the Nobel Prize but then refuses to accepts it.

Neither Espinosa nor Sazama and Sharpless bite off more than they can chew with ""Morbius."" The filmmakers acquaint audiences with Morbius as well as his predicament. Since his survival depends on drinking human blood, Morbius must come to terms with his destiny. Apart from Ang Lee's ""Hulk"" (2003), few traditional Marvel characters encounter such life-or-death extremes as Morbius. Essentially, the filmmakers have forged a character of greater depth than ""Iron Man,"" ""Captain America,"" ""Thor,"" and ""Dr. Strange."" None of these superheroes face Morbius' challenge. Happily, overseas audiences have given ""Morbius"" a boost, buying $81 million in tickets to this sterling Sony release and raising its global haul to $148 million plus!","9"
"Sleepin_Dragon","A poor movie, special effects couldn't make up for a dismal plot.","24 July 2022","I badly wanted to enjoy this, I've been late arriving to the franchise, but I've embraced it, and fallen in love, especially with the earlier releases. What I've always enjoyed, are the little links and tie ins, nothing offered up here, Morbius seemed a strange addition.

Now I'm no expert, but ouch, this really wasn't a good film, I am a huge, huge fan of Jared Leto, and of Matt Smith, and despite some quality from the both, neither was able to elevate this film above the mediocre level. Not the fault of the actors, they did well, however the script, made no sense, it made absolutely no sense, there was a total absence of character development here. The script felt woefully amateur.

In terms of its relation to the rest of The Marvel universe, this sits as an awkward bolt on, made, seemingly just for the sake of it. You know what they're like, he'll be back.

The music was good in parts, bland in others, the effects looked good in some scenes, some, just looked off somehow, maybe rushed?

I didn't go in with high hopes, and I'm glad, I would have been sorely disappointed, what irks me more, is that the £40 I spent, could have been used on so much more.

Annoyingly bad, 4/10.","4"
"trinaboice","Snore","13 April 2022","IN A NUTSHELL: Snore. The problem with this movie is that it takes itself extremely seriously. It's about a biochemist named Michael Morbius who tries to cure himself of a rare blood disease, but instead, he inadvertently infects himself with a form of vampirism.

It hurts my heart to give a Marvel movie a bad grade because I'm normally such a huge fan, but I just couldn't get into this one. It's directed by Daniel Espinosa and written by Matt Sazama and Burk Sharpless.

Marvel is magic, but Sony didn't capture it this time around.

THINGS I LIKED: I really like Jared Leto and am sincerely happy for him to be given this comic book character to bring to life. He's extremely talented and really works hard to introduce us to this interesting character.

Matt Smith, Adria Arjona, Jared Harris, Tyrese Gibson, and Al Madrigal flesh out the cast and all do a fine job.

The New York City scenes were actually filmed in Manchester, England. Weird, right? They had to change all of the street signs and license plates and could have saved some time if they had just filmed in the Big Apple. They also did that in the movie Captain America: The First Avenger.

Marvel fans will be able to spot a lot of Easter eggs and tie-ins from the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Watch Matt Smith's character carefully and you'll even spot some similarities to Jim Carrey's character in the movie The Mask.

There are some cool special effects.

THINGS I DIDN'T LIKE: The plot wanders around. Snore. I just didn't care about the characters or the story.

The constant beating score is heavy-handed and exhausting.

There's some action, but mostly a lot of smoldering anger and talking.

Lots of CGI and not much we haven't already seen a million times before.

So much exposition.

The characters are thin and underdeveloped.

Spiderman? Venom? They both capture the whimsical humor needed to balance out the serious drama. Morbius completely forgot about that successful formula.

The movie isn't that long but feels like it. I was bored within minutes.

The fighting and action scenes are just a big jumbled mess so that you can't really see what's happening.

TIPS FOR PARENTS: It feels more like a horror movie and is very dark for kids Blood Bullying Violence You see a mouse die.

Science Destruction Innocent people die Scary vampire faces Sooo much anger

THEMES: Special gifts Being ""normal"" Vampires Friendship and loyalty Helping others

"waltermwilliams","What Walts Watching","3 April 2022","You wanted an action, adventure, horror, sci-fi, thriller then look no further than ""Morbius"" as it tries to tick all those boxes.

Sometimes it tries a little too hard.

You wait almost one third of the screening before you even see the vampirism of ""Morbius"".

One of the most adaptable, versatile, chameleons of this current generation of actors, Jared Leto, plays the award winning scientist ""Dr Michael Morbius"", famous for inventing artificial blood and saving countless lives through his work in the laboratory.

Morbius lives with his own blood disorder, so his actions aren't entirely selfless.

The cure he so desperately searches for through the experimental use of vampire bats will transform him into Count Dracula and his need for real blood will grow.

Former Dr Who, Matt Smith, plays his lifelong buddy ""Milo"" who's from old money and is funding the good doctors research because it would also benefit his own health issues.

There is one scene involving Milo lifted directly from ""The Usual Suspects"".

Another wonderful British actor Jared Harris feels a bit wasted as ""Milos"" carer, ""Dr Emil Nicholas"".

In fact, Marvel comic book fans are asking themselves of all the characters you could do a deep dive for why even choose ""Morbius""?

To be honest I've been looking forward to this screening for months because I'm an unabashed horror fan.

I've been watching Hammer Horror Vampire films forever.

However the horror elements (SFX/CGI) feel dated and not very scary, more designed for a younger audience.

Al Madrigals' Agent Rodriguez, gives the viewer some comedy relief, which is mostly missing from this Sony movie.

It felt like it was trying to be dark like DC's ""The Batman"" but didn't get even close to reaching those heights.

Watch out for: 2 Easter Eggs during the end credits that give you a clue as to where the director, Daniel Espinosa, is trying to take this movie and any upcoming sequels.","5"
"jboothmillard","Morbius","13 April 2022","There is the Marvel Cinematic Universe, and there is the spin-off Spider-Man Universe, which stemmed from Venom, and that is the universe that this story exists in, to bring us perhaps one of the lesser known in the comic books, and I was willing to give it a chance, directed by Razzie nominated Daniel Espinosa (Safe House, Life). Basically, at a hospital in Greece, ten-year-old Michael Morbius (Charlie Shotwell) forms a close bond with his surrogate brother Lucien, whom he renames Milo (Joseph Esson). They both share a rare blood disease and desire to be free of their illness and to be ""normal"". Their adoptive father and hospital director Dr. Emil Nicholas (Jared Harris) arranges for Michael to attend medical school in New York while he focuses on caring for Milo. Twenty-five years later, Michael (Razzie winning Jared Leto) is awarded the Nobel Prize for his outstanding achievement in biochemistry, creating synthetic blood that saved many lives, but he publicly declines the award. Michael has recently returned from Costa Rica and has secretly captured dozens of vampire bats, which his colleague Martine Bancroft (Emerald City's Razzie winning Adria Arjona) discovers. Michael hopes to splice the genes of the bats with his own to develop a cure for his condition. He visits Milo (Matt Smith), still being cared for by Nicholas, and informs him of his planned illegal experiment. After receiving funding from Milo to outfit a private mercenary vessel in international waters with his equipment. After running tests on a lab rats, Michael and Martine are pleased by a successful solution being created, and Michael is ready for the human trial, on himself. Michael drinks the solution, but is instantly transformed into a monstrous vampire, knocking Martine unconscious, and killing all crew members aboard, and draining their blood. Michael regains his senses after his bloodlust subsides, but has no memory of his actions, and is horrified after watching the CCTV. He erases the CCTV footage of his experiment and what happened, calls the authorities to locate the vessel, and jumps overboard, leaving Martine unconscious. Michael returns to New York and is amazed by his newfound superhuman strength, speed, reflexes, and echolocation (hearing distant sounds), and his vampire bats are at one with him. He is able to walk in sunlight, but remains in his lab, maintaining his lust of blood with his synthetic blood until it gradually ceases to satisfy his needs and time to do so is decreasing. The vessel is located and investigating FBI agents Simon Stroud (Tyrese Gibson) and Alberto ""Al"" Rodriguez (Al Madrigal) deduce Michael's involvement in the deaths. Michael is questioned but released with no substantial evidence on suspicion of murder. Milo learns that Michael has found a cure but is furious when Michael refuses to give it to him, warning him of its danger. Martine awakens in hospital, but also does not give any real answers to the FBI questions. Michael visits Martine and is shocked to discover the body of a dead nurse. Believing to be responsible for her death, he tries to escape, but is cornered and arrested. Milo visits Michael in prison and offers to use his wealth to get him out. But Michael realises that Milo has taken the cure and killed the nurse. Michael manages to escape and finds Milo in a subway station, he is unrepentant, confessing his bloodlust-induced crime, he urges Michael to embrace his powers. Unwilling to hurt his brother, Michael flees. Michael meets Martine to explain everything, from the positives of the cure to the hideous crimes of Milo. Finding an underground criminal lair, Michael scares away a gang and acquires a new lab to develop an anticoagulant to stop and kill Milo. He also intends to use the solution on himself since he will become unable to resist his bloodlust. Stroud and Rodriguez find footage of one of Milo's attacks, they believe Michael, as a vampire, is spreading a curse and the story is released to the media to track him down. Nicholas sees the footage and recognises Milo carrying out the attack in the subway. Milo returns and Nicholas pleads with him to stop, Milo is angered he may prefer Michael, he responds by wounding him and calling Michael. Nicholas dies in Michael's arms while Milo goes on to attack Martine. Michael returns to Martine, but he is too late, she also dies in his arms, and he drinks her blood. Michael confronts Milo and, as vampires, they brutally fight in an abandoned underground construction. Milo overpowers Michael, until he summons an army of bats to restrain him, allowing him to inject the anticoagulant. Milo momentarily mourns his surrogate brother as he dies, then he flies away with his bats as the authorities surround the area. Michael mourns the loss of his loved ones and embraces his identity as a vampire. Michael is unaware that his vampiric powers have entered Martine's bloodstream, and she is revived with newly developed powers. Meanwhile, Adrian Toomes aka Vulture (Michael Keaton) when he finds himself transported by a spell (by Doctor Strange) from Peter Parker's universe into Michael's and is released from prison. He later approaches Michael and suggests that they join forces. Also starring Corey Johnson as Mr. Fox and Joanna Burnett as Nurse Kristen Sutton. Leto has followed his deserved Oscar win in Dallas Buyers Club with some disappointing performances, from a terrible punk Joker in Suicide Squad to a Razzie winning over-the-top Italian idiot in House of Gucci, he is only a little tolerable and suitably moody, Arjona is beautiful but is not much better, while Smith gives a scene-stealing performance as the villain with a dry and dark sense of humour. It is a fairly predictable story of a biochemist trying to cure himself of a deathly disease and becoming something nasty in the process, the anti-hero plot is a bit disjointed at times, the friend turned enemy and horror elements are reasonable, you want to see where it's going, and you cannot deny the special effects are fantastic, so it's a worthwhile enough superhero vampire action. It was nominated the Razzies for Worst Picture, and Worst Screenplay. Okay!","4"

But what really shocked me was the closing credits or end credits (list of the cast and crew of a particular motion picture not the ""post credit scenes""), the visual effects in those closing credits were AMAZING, I can't express how much an amazing experience those closing credits were, for the first time in my life I didn't want them to end.

"raykuanlabel-291-473410","My New Favorite Halloween Movie","8 February 2023","A much cooler indie vibe film compared to Wakanda Forever; including Thor Love and Thunder. I also enjoyed the almost european tone of the movie. The visual effects especially on Michael Morbius transformation were just perfectly refreshing compared to the recent MCU movies which are too over the top with too Much green screen written all over it. Sure you would think it's too Batman, but only because of the bat scenes. Otherwise it can hold on its own. I only wish it was a longer film with more action scenes to go with it. I truly hope Morbius 2 is going to happen soon. I will be the first in line.","10"
"Top_Dawg_Critic","Not great, but still better than Batman.","2 June 2022","Why is Sony hiring B-grade inexperienced director and writers for blockbuster titles? This film had tons of room for improvement, particularly in its convoluted and lazy screenplay. There are scenes where things are happening, and we don't know how or why e.g. Leaning back and almost falling off the rooftop while getting caught amidst the unexplained sonic waves? Didn't any one person see these mistakes (even in editing) to make what I'm sure would be easy fixes? I'm not sure why the mid-credit scene was even needed, as it made the already incohesive story more incoherent. The premise of the story itself was excellent, too bad it became a wasted opportunity.

Cinematography was decent, although the S/VFX could've been much better and more exciting. Sound and score were on point. The 104 min runtime flew by with the decent pacing, almost too much so, that I feel another 20-25 minutes of better experienced writing could've gone a long way in making this film much better. Casting and performances were great all around. Still, it's certainly not as bad as all the critics say it is, and I actually enjoyed it more than Pattinson as e.m.o. Batman. A well deserved 7/10 from me.","7"
"gxingchen","Truly one of the movies of all time!","26 August 2022","Morbius is, in short, a phenomenal film. It is a beauty to behold for the mind, the ears, and the eye. It is both an original and a clever homage to some of history's greatest films. It is a pioneering achievement in the art of filmmaking, one that shall never be surpassed. This film will draw you in, and it will touch you. It will make you feel a powerful range of emotions which you have never felt before. You will laugh, and you will cry. You will rage, and you will fear. You will be sick to your stomach. You will ultimately feel a satisfaction unmatched by that which you have already experienced. Morbius is more than just a movie. It's a personal experience. The characters were realistic and beautifully written. I felt like I knew them. Nay; I KNEW them. While I was watching the film, I considered them my closest friends. Their struggles, although foreign, were also relatable. As I watched them overcome their fears and their prejudices in order to save the day, they taught me that I, too, could be the hero. It made me rethink everything I thought I knew about society, heroism, and morality. This movie is truly a miracle. It cured my cancer, fed my starving children, and brought my grandmother back to life. Daniel Espinosa (the wonderful director of this film) is more than a filmmaker. He is a PROPHET. Mere words cannot express how thankful I am for the existence of his masterpiece. Thanks to Espinosa, we finally have an answer to the age-old question. God is real, and He is Morbius. 100/10 stars.","10"
"felix-bergman","No masterpiece, but not as bad as everyone is saying","31 March 2022","Morbius was by no means any masterpiece. It was pretty forgettable over all, especially the action sequences, which isn't a good sign for an action movie, and throughout things just happened with no to very little build up and the few characters we had got very little in terms of development or explaining their relationships, and then it just kinda ended without me being ready for it.

That said I was never really bored in the theatre. It was an interesting enough premise, I understood the motivations and it kept a pretty straight line throughout. None of these actors are gonna win any Oscars for their work on this movie, but unlike some others I had no problem with any performance. Over all an OK night at the theatre and I would rather re-watch this than anything Disney/Marvel had put out post Far from home, except No Way Home, and even that isn't super good IMO, it's just special to watch because of all the returning actors. Try to pitch that movie but have every returning character from the other universes be played by different people you'd end up with something properly stupid.","6"
"joshey_kun19","Don't Believe the Manufactured Hate","2 April 2022","Is this film amazing? No. Is it the worst Marvel film? Definitely not. After seeing it in theaters I do believe this film is getting a lot of manufactured hate to sway viewers not to see it. It really isn't that bad. It does of course have flaws. It's low budget was obvious in it's many scenes of cgi, acting was cringe at times, some horrible humor and lines, and some of the cinematography was a little bizarre to me. Also, it suffered from a short runtime that made it so that characters weren't fleshed out as much as they could've been. But with all it's flaws, it was still a fun and entertaining film. The cgi may have been odd a lot of the time, but still looked like a really cool video game. Some of the effects (especially when flying or fighting) were pretty cool. The actors felt like they were dedicated to their parts, even with some weird lines. The dynamic between Leto and Smith was fantastic as well. This origin story was a tad generic, but I feel like MCU fans should be okay with that by now. Overall it definitely had flaws, but is nowhere near as bad as critics and certain MCU fans are trying to make it out to be. Give it a watch and judge for yourself.","6"

"arod_85","Not as bad as the ratings suggest","3 April 2022","This movie was a disappointment, because it could have been great. However, it's not as bad as the reviews suggest. The story was interesting for the first half and turned into a hot mess for the second half. I could have also done without so much of the CGI because that diminished the film and made it feel ""cheaper"". I would have preferred prosthetics instead of the CGI faces because they looked really good for the first half, then turned so obviously fake by the second half, it was laughable. The CGI ""blurriness"" when the vampires would move looked terrible. I know it was suppose to represent the bat radar, but it was distracting. I also thought the detectives were pretty pointless to the story and could have been written to make some type of contribution for the climax of the movie. It needed to be darker to work, with a tone like ""The Batman"". However, the actors, especially Leto, did a good job for what they were working with. It wasn't terrible, just wasn't good.","6"
"ahd-87286","The hate is clearly unfair!","1 April 2022","As many have written here, the hate is superbly unfair and it doesn't do the movie nor the production team justice.

When that is said, I understand some of the ""fair"" bad critics. Many things could've been improved. But the story, the CGI, the action, and clearly ""the vibe"", are all good and nice done. Especially the CGI.

The major fail is the timeline and this whole thing where they try to connect the dots in a weird/confusing way. I was baffled a few times on what the heck was going on, obviously I understood it, but it was odd.

Jared Leto did an OK job, considering that I'm not a fan of his movies, and I'm someone who hated his Joker in Suicide Squad. Otherwise, all the other actors were doing ok.

I see what Sony is doing, and I wanna say this: Dear Sony, LISTEN TO MARVEL!! And stop trying to act like you got it. You don't. Marvel knows better. Trust me.

All in all considered, the movie deserves a 7-8/10.

Enjoy it!","7"
"jamaisj","A Good 1990s Throwback","10 September 2022","Well.....not as bad as it could have been. The acting was actually pretty decent; I'm not saying it was awesome, but the actors did the best with what they were given and much scenery was chewn.

The problem is that this would have made an awesome 1990s B-Movie: The SFX were pretty good, but too heavily dependent on the CGI when practical effects, including prosthetics, would have done better. The lighting was good, but too geared towards spooky and atmospheric when realistic lighting would have been much more effective.

There were some stand-out effects, such as the trails and the echolocation effects, but this was more of a throwback to the early SciFi movies (before it was Syfy) and was more appropriate to something from the Asylum than the MCU.

The writing was hardcore 1990s, however. The science had nothing to do with anything in the real world; the Technobabble knob was set on high and they did not hold back. You should not use anything you see here to help someone, including the legal stuff. The visuals are also too geared towards Easter eggs, and the post-credit scenes are just sequel-bait.

In essence, if you loved Spawn or have a major Full Moon fetish, you'll love this movie. If you're looking for a serious movie, however, look elsewhere.","6"
"toseale","So Forgettable - Coming from A Comic Book Movie Fan","27 September 2022","Morbius lacked so much depth, and practically fought for its life just to have some. The dynamics between Jared Leto's Morbius and Matt Smith's Milo was just boring and unnecessary. To be honest though, most of the movie was unnecessary. It was a cool idea, but it was boring, and aside from a few cool scenes, it's completely forgettable. There's so much to keep up with and so much that doesn't make sense, so it's just killing itself from scene to scene. The after credits were rough, and let in some pretty big potholes. The fight scenes are messy, and while creative, definitely not outstanding. And the character deaths that were included to make the story more interesting were stupid and angering. This entire movie was just a mess. If there ever is a second one, there's gonna be quite a bit to clean up.","2"

"natmavila","A Bat-tastic Disaster","13 August 2023","Well, where do I even begin with this cinematic masterpiece? If you're in the mood for an intense rollercoaster of confusion and questionable decisions, look no further than ""Morbius."" The plot reads like a recipe gone horribly wrong: mix in a dash of blood illness, sprinkle some vampire bats, and voila! You've got yourself a recipe for disaster.

The acting is so over the top that even the bats would be jealous of the hammy performances. Jared Leto's transformation into a vampire is so believable, I almost thought I was watching a documentary on ""How Not to Cure a Blood Condition."" And don't get me started on the FBI agents who seem to have mastered the art of deducing everything except how to properly investigate a crime scene.

But the real star of the show? The bats, of course! They're not just your average bats; they're Michael's furry companions, and they're here to save the day. Move over, Batman, there's a new winged vigilante in town! So, if you're seeking a film that will leave you scratching your head and wondering if you've accidentally stumbled into a parallel universe where logic doesn't exist, ""Morbius"" is the cinematic masterpiece you never knew you needed.","1"

I believe if the showrunners had spent a bit more time on the back story I think you'd have another Ironman! The CGI and Special Effects were the movie! The whole ensamble was very talented but given what they had to work with. The viewers is left after watching with more questions at the end of movie.

"michaelscelza","Very cool","2 April 2022","After reading the reviews and knowing how many times they postponed the opening, I didn't expect too much. However I was pleasantly surprised. Special effects are cool and the story moves nicely. It didn't try to be funny, like VENOM did, but it was able to find a nice groove. End of credit scenes are terrible. Make absolutely no sense. Most likely they were added by some moronic Sony exec. Ignoring the end of credit scenes, the entire movie was fun. And I'm hoping they do the sequel soon.","7"
"rannynm","Fantastic Graphics, Lots of Action, Very Dark","13 May 2022","Morbius is a jaw-clenching film, filled with jump scares, betrayal and a bit of romance. The film is also great to watch if you are a fan of bats.

Morbius digs deep into the life of Dr. Michael Morbius (Jared Leto), a man who has a deeply dangerous condition but is a complete genius in the lab and in the operating room. Morbius and his best friend Loxias Crown (Matt Smith), who he calls Milo, have been struggling with this condition since they were born, and they have not been able to find a cure yet. Morbius at a young age is accepted into a gifted school for kids, and he leaves Milo to find a cure for both of them. As Morbius gets older, he does more experiments, and he ends up unleashing this beast he may not be able to defeat.

As the storyline suggests, one theme of the film is that sometimes you don't feel like yourself. There are external forces that can cause you to do things that you would never do or say things you would never say. We all can be triggered by situations, circumstances, people and events that take us out of character; but hopefully, not to this extreme. The CGI in this film is phenomenal; you see a lot of detail in both the characters and the settings. The settings are very cool, and it is fun to see all the different landscapes. The music matches each scene very well, especially in the intense scenes. Not a lot of films have the amount of suspense and thrills that Morbius has, and it is unlike other Marvel films.

The message of Morbius is don't lose sight of who you are no matter what happens. There is some language that would be inappropriate for younger viewers.

I give Morbius 5 out of 5 stars and recommend it for ages 13 to 18, plus adults. Morbius is available now in theaters.

"viswalahiri","Morbius is a well-made film, that has an abrupt ending and lacks wow factor.","1 April 2022","Morbius is a well made film. Unlike the reviews which completely put down the movie, I believe that it was enjoyable. I am not a Marvel Fan, and have never read the comics.

I enjoyed the good graphics, face design, and design of Morbius's powers and how they are visualised.

The film had no negatives, but lacked a wow factor that would make it 8+.

I have noticed though, that the story felt like it had an abrupt ending. The goal of the main protagonist doesn't appear to be realised, it's just that a fight has been won.

It felt like given 40 minutes more of screentime, the story could have been taken to a better place.","7"
"jmzalapa","Jared Leto is... The Bat-Man!","2 June 2022","Man, where to start on this snooze fest. It's like someone took every troupe and cliche, mashed them together and made this film.

You can guess the plot if you've ever seen a movie.

The dialogue doesn't exist.

The action scenes are a blurry CGI mess.

The characters are wooden and uninteresting.

Plenty of things make no sense, such as why Dr Bancroft was in the ICU on a ventilator after getting knocked mildly unconscious?

Why did the bats not also bond with Milo?

Do the bat men control electric lighting, or is that just lazy cliché writing?

Why would police shoot at a fleeing suspect who has committed no evident crime?

Why are these two detectives everywhere something happens? This is New York!

Just dumb, man. Try harder. Honestly, the only reason I gave it 4 stars is because I'm trying to make myself feel better about the 20 bucks I just spent to watch this brain dead film.... the real vampirism was to my wallet.","4"

"edrddz","It is Boring time!","10 July 2022","The movie is Dull. Nothing happens, when it happens, it is dumb and makes no sense. The plot is full of convenience where people are in some place just for happening. For example, the Morbius boat is full of armed guards just to have some action scene there.

Action scenes are short and full of blurred colored effects or dark effects and none of them work.

Uninteresting characters. You have Morbius, a new made vampire that needs to drink human blood to live. You could explore this in so many ways, like trying to drink blood from animals, buying blood from blood bank and making needing people dying because lack of blood packs, leading to ""I will drink blood from bad people"". But they decided that trowing a blurred colored ball is more interesting. Side characters are empty as well.

This movie is so boring that is more enjoyable to do the dishes.","1"
"mashpotatoe","Not as bad as the reviews","10 April 2022","Personally not a big fan of Leto myself, however the trailer looked dark for Marvel so it got me curious. Went in with no expectations and to be honest, the movie was really enjoyable. By no means it is a masterpiece but the action scenes were fun and overall make up of the ""beast"" was quite terrifying. Pleasantly surprised, leave your biased opinions at home and just watch it for what it is and I'm sure you'll enjoy it. Big plus that it's under 2 hours so it didn't drag anything out. Great length, good action scenes and open ending. Nothing to complain about other than maybe I'd love a few more action scenes. Watching how the ""creature"" moves and fights is different from what I've seen in any other movie so would definitely have loved to see more of that.","7"
"dpxrp","Good movie","23 September 2022","I really enjoyed this movie. However if they remake this movie it needs to be rated R so more can be done...thats why I rated it a 9 not a 10. The storyline was good. I think more can be done on the second film. Jared Leto is a phenomenal actor and I can't wait to see what happens in the second one. Watch the movie for yourself and let yourself be able to make your own judgment. It is now showing on Netflix if you want to catch it. I really don't feel that there's any type of spoiler alert other than it not being rated R. The movie definitely starts a little slow but has a great ending. Let's go!","9"

The trailer is very true to the movie. If you don't like the trailer, just don't see the movie, okay? It's a good action movie with cool effects, but you probably shouldn't see it unless you're a Marvel fan. And it really isn't worth just 1 out of 10, that would mean the movie is utter crap, and it definitely isn't. People here are so extreme with their grades. I had a good time with this movie, the actors were good, I liked the story, the action and special effects were good...I just wish they could have shown us a little more. It felt like it was over too quickly. There could have been more to tell. For me, this was a solid 8. I liked it and would like to see it again, as is often the case for me when it comes to Marvel movies, since I'm a big Marvel fan. If you're not a Marvel fan, you can probably skip this movie. The bonus scenes don't really make any sense though...even if you've already seen the latest Spider-Man movie. Many plot holes there and just weird connections that doesn't really work.","8"

"becky-92346","An absolute mess.","11 April 2022","Morbius (2022) follows Michael Morbius as he tries to cure himself of a rare blood disease, but eventually ends up accidentally turning himself into a vampiric being. I had very low expectations for this film, and I guess you could say this film met them! It really was a complete mess of a film, but this made it entertaining occasionally.

Firstly, Jared Leto was already a bad pick, portraying the character with no emotions and no likeability to him so I really didn't care what happened to him. I also feel like the characters were VERY poorly written which didn't help, with a super forced unnecessary romance. Matt Smith was the main redeemable quality of this film, he tried his best and at least brought an ounce of personality.

Speaking of the writing, the humour felt incredibly flat. It was probably the weakest attempt I've seen in a Sony or Marvel film. The only times I laughed were when I was cringing because the film made me THAT uncomfortable. However, I did somewhat enjoy hate-watching for the bad humour.

The visual effects and cinematography was okay. The CGI for the most part wasn't terrible in comparison with the other elements of this film, but there were some moments that stuck out in a negative way. The fight scenes looked okay but were also incredibly goofy to the point where I often laughed at them.

The pacing of this film was an absolute mess, The movie really proves the phrase 'time flies when you're having fun' wrong, as this film felt like it went by in about 45 minutes. It also ends incredibly abruptly and doesn't attempt to come to a proper conclusion, it felt unfinished.

Lastly, the end credit scenes were completely unnecessary. Both of the scenes were pretty much the same, and were just a petty attempt at trying to cram all the characters into one universe again.","2"
"ganthonystx","Not great, but not terrible either","5 March 2023","Hey, not all Marvel movies have to be about the big names (Spidey, Iron Man, etc.) They took a character with a not very recognizable name did the best they could. The cliches were there, but not too over the top. The action scenes and CGI, while not jaw-dropping, did keep my interest.

Jared Neto is not my favorite actor, but he does a decent job as being driven to succeed, without coming off as an egomaniac. His character could have used a tighter and more detailed back story, Not sure where this timeline fits into the MCU universe, although the door is left open.

Would I pay cash to see this in a theater? Nope. But an acceptable watch at home.","5"
"mick-18173","Why the hate?","1 April 2022","First off Jared Leto isn't my first choice as an actor at all and before the movie I was honestly skeptical of him being the lead actor; but this is probably hands down one of his best acting movies I've seen him play. He's typically a supporting role in bigger movies but he killed it as the main character. I don't understand the hate around this movie. Yes it could've been at least 15 minutes longer with more action scenes, but for a Sony/Marvel movie they did a great job and was up to pare with their other movie Venom. I believe this movie deserves a lot better ratings then what it's receiving and I definitely believe it's worth the watch.","7"

I just wish Hollywood would stop trying to make Matt Smith work (bit cringe, though he was great on the Crown).

Great performance by Jared Leto. Not too impressed by Matt Smith's performance to be honest. Very enjoyable. I'm beginning to think that alot of critics are paid by Disney to give their own produced shows and movies great reviews. Even when they're terrible. But, those same critics give shows and films bad reviews that don't deserve it. Like halo and morbius. I for one am glad I went to the cinema to see it. Unlike endgame. 3hrs I'll never get back. In short. Don't go by dodgy critic reviews. If you like the trailer and the synopsis sounds interesting. Watch it. Make your own mind up. Don't be a sheep. Following the heard.","7"
"cijwalker","Darker Tone Marvel","31 March 2022","People are just given it a bad review just to jump on the bandwagon. I'm a big Marvel fan and I liked the movie. I think people are so use to the Jokes after jokes after jokes these new marvel/Disney movies they have been producing where every marvel character is funny. So when you see a darker toned movie from them that's not family friendly people don't like it. I think the pacing was good I was tuned in. Its also the fact He's not a big name like Spiderman/Thor. However for a standalone movie it wasn't bad, but because people dont know Morbius I think it would of helped if they had cameos of others like blade etc. Or they should of had him introduced into someone else's movie first like how Black Panther was introduced in the avengers movies. I think you should see it for yourself everybody has their own taste. I like the darker side of Marvel like Blade, Spawn, Ghost Rider, Punisher etc.","8"
"Isawtitanic222222","Doesn't deserve the lash back","3 April 2022","In comparison to the Venom franchise, morbius holds up.

This movie was disappointing and could've been executed better.","4"
"gabriellhtj","Y'all got too used to hate on this film.","31 March 2022","UNDERRATED. AS. HELL. Morbius does not deserve the hate at all. People in the Internet read the first reviews of critics and started spreading what they were saying, so suddenly everyone was saying how bad this film was without having even watched it. Now they have watched it and nothing's gonna change their minds. It's a snowball of hate that grows and grows and it's completely uncalled for.

Jared Leto is getting the same amount of hate he got when he portrayed The Joker; sure, it was a very ""out there"" portrayal, but still unique and original. I believe the same thing happened back then. Which I don't understand, because the guy is a tremendous actor (and a great freaking singer too, but that's besides the point). Maybe people have something against him? Maybe he did something bad that I don't know about and got ""canceled""? In any case, the fact stands: he's a really good actor.

Watch Morbius without reading too many reviews and make up YOUR mind. That's the only way to actually see this movie for what it is - a dark adventure that does its best to serve as a connection between universes, but also a great origin story for one of the most underrated Spider-Man villains ever.","10"
"ranjsidhukicker","Not as bad as they say, worth a watch","1 April 2022","Going into this movie I was expecting it to be bad, borderline unbearable, largely due to the critic reviews. Oh boy did they get it wrong. This movie is far from as bad as they say, but I also would not describe it as anything spectacular. I feel that people are comparing it to other Marvel properties such as No Way Home and that is why reviews are so bad. That is unfair to compare it to such other films as Morbius is a fresh take on Marvel it feels. It is obvious that the delays ended up holding back what this movie could have been, perhaps what it truly should have been. It was enjoyable to watch from start to end. Loved the action sequences and CGI was beautiful. Takes a little bit to get through the more monotonous beginnings, but once you get to sink your teeth into the good parts, oh boy does it deliver. Some characters needed more development and the story what is a bit disjointed. Jared Leto is finally in a role that suits him, Morbius and Leto will only get better with more appearances. I rated it a 7/10 because a 7/10 to me means that it was an enjoyable movie regardless of whatever may be wrong with it, and I would gladly watch again. It is clear it would have been better suited as a rated R film, but with its current restrictions down to PG-13 I would say it is worth a watch at least. Don't expect to be blown away, except maybe by some of the action and CGI. I can see ratings from 5/10 to 7/10 being a fair range as everyones taste are different, but some of these other reviews I see are just taking it too far because it is not what Marvel is used to pushing.","7"

Wasn't even that bad, the CGI wasn't even that bad either, Jared Leto's performance for someone who is suffering a progressive blood disorder seems rather on point where as critics saying is was a dull performance which doesn't make sense at all, the story seemed like it was made for something to be built up to in the future. This film doesn't seem like it was made to be a one time outstanding amazing film, it felt more like a good solid film that you could rewatch and that it's building up to something bigger. My opinion would be ignore the critics, go watch the film yourself, watch the to mid-credit scenes and make up your own mind.","7"

"SAMTHEBESTEST","Marvel's Gothic Tale Of Vampire-Fame Superhero Will Drain All Your Blood","1 April 2022","Morbius (2022) : Movie Review -

Marvel means superhero. But is it completely true? Can Marvel be something different too? Yes, it can be. Can it be something related to vampires? Yes. Here's Morbius to give you all the answers. You see, this concept of failed experiments (of scientists or doctors) or side effects of experiments is way too old in Hollywood. James Whale made some iconic films like Frankenstein (1931), ""The Invisible Man"" (1933) and ""Bride of Frankenstein"" (1935) with this formula in the horror genre. George Waggner followed Whale's footprints and made ""The Wolf Man"" (1941).

Those early experiments were shocking to the audience in that era because Hollywood was establishing new genres then. But the same stuff became old and cliched with films like ""Hallow Man"" (2000), ""Spider Man"" (2002), ""Hulk"" (2003) and a few others. Some films used the formula of a failed experiment to show the good guys, while some used it for the bad ones. Spider Man 3 came with that Venom thing, which showed us two characters being haunted by the same supernatural power, and recently we saw a Malayalam superhero flick, ""Minnal Murali,"" (2021) with the same thought. Marvel's Morbius is quite similar to these two films. But it has a damn boring plot and a predictable twist that just doesn't survive.

In the film, Dr. Michael Morbius (Jared Leto) tries to cure himself of a rare blood disease with the help of his girlfriend and fellow doctor, Martine (Adria Arjona), but he inadvertently infects himself with a form of vampirism instead. He is blessed with enormous powers, but he doesn't know how to control them. Is it a gift or a curse? His surrogate brother, Milo (Matt Smith), shows him the other side of this new invention, which creates differences between them. Who will win in the end? A good vampire or an evil one? The second half of Morbius provides you with all the answers, and believe me, there is nothing unpredictable or new here.

Marvel films are usually not dark, but this one is an exception. I don't need to explain what happens when Marvel tries something dark and intense. The fans don't expect them to make such films. They just want entertainment and larger-than-life characters with screaming heroic acts, not a story. With Morbius, Marvel fans get neither of them. Morbius is not a superhero film, actually. It just ends up being a superhero flick, somehow. A vampire drama is nothing new for us. From ""The Golem"" (1920), ""Nosferatu"" (1922), ""Dracula"" (1931), and many other well-known horror films and TV shows (in every industry across the world), the idea just doesn't change. Then how can Morbius be an exception? It just happens to be dropped in the wrong universe and at the wrong time, that's all.

Jared Leto has been impressive in the last 5-6 years, with some good acting credits to his name. So, Morbius was a simple task for him because VFX did the majority of the work for him. Well, this is not just the acting-driven role he deserves, but he's fine with whatever acting-loaded scenes he has got. Matt Smith is surprising, though. His character comes as a surprise, and that's still digestible, I should say, but his performance too comes as a surprise, and that's a pleasant surprise, I must say. The gorgeous looking Adria Arjona hasn't got too many long scenes, but whenever she appears, she makes sure that you notice her presence. Jared Harris, Al Madrigal, and Tyrese Gibson's support is strictly okay.

Morbius is full of colourful visuals. It looks unnecessary and illogical as the colour themes and that foggy smoke behind the vampires don't really make any sense, but don't know why, the screen appeal carries it through. It doesn't bore, and that's too much, but the screenplay does. Also, the fighting scenes are shot from close angles - putting a lot of strain on your eyes for some time. Nevertheless, a few of them are brilliantly shot, and indeed, they entertain you. However, a little more practical sense would have only helped.

Morbius' mediocrity is not limited to the writing, but also reflects on Daniel Espinosa's outdated vision. Come on man, I mean, it's 2022, not 1982 to show so much repetitiveness on screen. Espinosa's directional techniques drain all the blood out of Morbius' body. Somehow, the soul survives due to Marvel's comic tale. Rest, it's a strictly below-average show saved by some breathtaking action sequences and somewhat pleasant visual effects. Don't expect anything more than that, not even a penny, because if you do, Morbius will suck all your blood during those 106 minutes. Overall, an underwhelming Gothic tale with uneven Marvel stamping all over. SKIP IT!

"vedvaghela","Second reckoning of god himself","29 May 2022","This is what Rob Pattinson saw at the end of The Lighthouse, he couldn't handle it because it showed him the truth of life and universe itself. He like a mere mortal put on this earth saw what even cosmic being couldn't interpret.

Morbius changed my life. It opened my eyes to unknown secrets of life. The journey of Dr. Morbius is relatable and I could feel myself being him in those situations (of course when reality striked, I could never be him but it felt good to imagine being as great a person as Michael Morbius). If there were ever a renaissance to occur I believe this movie would start it, and arguably it already has.

So it's no surprise it instantly became the highest grossing movie of all time in the span of just 1 month. Everything about this film is surreal and artistic. Don't make the mistake of thinking that just because it's a comic book movie is generic because it's far from it. I can attest that no comic book movie would ever come close to Morbius, not even The Dark Knight.

One of the best scenes to ever grace the history cinema was Matt Smith's character, Milo, dance scene. It was encompassed almost everything that is right with 21st century cinema.

Words fail me now to describe the art piece I witnessed. It's a shame we had to wait 3 years for Morbius to arrive because I think if it had come before pandemic, it would've stopped pandemic from ever occurring because Morbius puts the virus to shame. It would be afraid to ever infect a crowd of Morbius devotees. Praise Morbius.

I don't read comics now, neither do I watch any other movie than Morbius. I have devoted my life to Morbius. Morbius you are and to Morbius you shall return.

Stay Morbin.","10"

"Fuad_RMNM","Oddly, Logically Reasonable Superhero Story","30 March 2022","It's pretty rare for me to see superhero movies with a great logical explanation for their superpower through sci-fi. This Morbius (2022) has a lil bit blown my mind with their scientific explanation and great delivery which is convincing enough to think if Morbius's superpower is possibly happening. One of the Greatest Scientists and a Nobel Prize Repellent, Dr. Michael Morbius struggle to find the cure for his incurable disease for his fellow sufferer. Then, he has found the cure through bat vampire blood with great superhuman power but costing uncontrollable body and mind. Long story short, this movie is about the introduction of Morbius's superpower and most of the storyline is about controlling his superpower.

The pros are suitable pace which is not too fast or too slow, great logical explanation through a Lil bit of sci-fi, and a clear storyline through simple story explanation. My odd POV, I thought this movie a lil bit reminded me about the chars from The Twilight Saga, especially The Volturi. The Volturi char seems to have a similar appearance to Morbius through the same haircut and vampire ambiance lol. The cons are incomparable to other superhero movies and standard quality for overall including visual, ex: CGI. This movie didn't about a superhero typical plot in which superheroes fight the villain from a threatening world. It even didn't about fighting a very difficult or a very strong villain which makes this movie didn't qualify enough as a superhero movie. But both of that reason is typical of Sony Spider-Man Universe like Venom movies. This is also the main reason why Morbius has been made to synchronize with Spider-Man, Venom, and upcoming movie through the different universes of the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) which consist of the Avengers.

Overall, this movie is just good and okay. It's worth it if didn't expect any expectations of a superhero movie. Maybe it felt like Venom movies but tbh I'd rather choose Venom lol. Lastly, there are two post-credit and pretty important if wondered how the universe collides with the Spider-Man.","6"

"donaldnwolfe-843-383565","Underrated","19 September 2022","I've never been particularly interested in the Morbius character from Marvel and I was in no hurry to see this film, especially after reading about how poorly-reviewed it was. But, having just watched it, I'm glad I did. It was well-acted, had a relatively solid and unusual plot, and was spiced with effective action sequences and interesting FX. Comic characters, including those in movies, are contemporary counterparts to the gods and heroes of ancient myths. As such, they are all clouded with an air of ridiculousness. Although there are many ridiculous elements to the Morbius story (super strength from vampire bat DNA?), on the whole Morbius's tale is no more absurd than the stories of Thor, Hulk and scores of other comic characters. Suspend literalism and view this movie with a modicum of wonder. It's dark and perhaps a bit too self-serious, but it's also a rollicking ride through vampire fantasy. I recently watched the latest Thor movie, which was well-reviewed, and I'm not sure I liked it any better.","8"
"lisaeveboden-17041","I don't get the hate?","8 November 2022","Firstly, I'm not a serial reviewer. I only review something when I feel strongly about it. I absolutely loved this film! I love action, horror and tense movies and this was right down my alley. I honestly don't get why all the hate. I review a film for being entertaining and thoroughly watchable. I don't care if it's not like the books, previous movies, games or comics. I just review the film for what it is!

And this kept me on the edge of my seat. Matt Smith is simply WOW! He really plays a great part. Jared is amazing as usual but I think Matt stole the show.

If you have no pre-conceptions then give this movie a go. I really did enjoy it xx.","9"
"SHU_Movies","Textbook Disappointment","31 March 2022","I'm a pretty big fan of Morbius after I've seen him in the 90's animated Spider-Man series and read some of his 2013 comicbook run (Morbius: The Living Vampire). When this was announced, I got super excited and throughout lockdown 2020/1, it was one of my most anticipated upcoming comicbook movies. It was a crazy letdown with a messy script, bad writing, uninteresting characters, VFX that varies between really good and just awful, a terrible final battle and a really abrupt ending. Jared Leto carries this movie HARD.","2"
"johnnyhbtvs27","Hopefully We Don't Get A Repeat Performance","4 April 2022","Morbius starts off very average before falling off a cliff with a rushed CGI mess of a finale. The movie's one saving grace is Matt Smith's hammy performance as he glees it up as the villainous Milo. The rest of the movie is one gigantic bore with Leto sleepwalking his way through the role. The last 20 minutes come and go with little fanfare as it looks like it has just been cobbled together at the last minute. There are 2 mid credit sequences but by the time they come, you won't care enough to have any interest in it whatsoever. Hopefully Jared Leto never meets Hardy or Holland. Woeful attempt at Morbius.","4"
"Cinema-reviewer321","The Living Vampire","4 April 2022","Morbius is a known Spider-Man villain and/or anti-hero in the comics, and now he has his own movie that is confusing for Marvel Spider-Man fans like myself.

I'll start with positives. I liked Jared Leto as Michael Morbius and thought he gave a good performance, along with having some good effects on him and looking comic accurate when in vampire form.

The abilities of Morbius were cool and how he used them were visually interesting. When there are scare scenes they do look scary if they are effective.

Now my negatives. Matt Smith's performance in the movie can be over the top and weird seeing in a movie like this, I only believed that him and Morbius were friends.

The villain was predictable and the movie has plot holes leading to scenes that don't make sense, even the ending was a little confusing.

The action scenes moved too fast and were hard to see, especially with all the CGI they have for the looks of the vampires. Only rarely you will get a clear shot, but it's mostly shaky cam.

The mid-credit scenes are confusing when it comes to the Spider-Man universe, and it made me wonder why they are doing all of this to something already setup and without any motivation in why it is happening.

I would re-watch this to see if I can understand it more in what it is trying to do in connecting with other Marvel universes.

But I found this movie mostly mediocre. Some people might like it and some fans might be dissatisfied with what they got.","5"
"namie-98193","I enjoyed it","2 April 2022","I think Mobius is cool. The chemistry between Mobius and Martine is kind of awkward, I just don't buy it. In fact I really like Milo, because he's sure and evil. But the characters' motivations are all over the place. I am just not sold with any of their convictions. At the end it felt like a cliff hanger where none of the characters are fully developed, especially the detectives, Martine and Nicholas, even Mobius himself. Milo has the best arc. Overall character backstory are like 40% covered and doesn't explain much. That's not a movie by any standard. More like a tv show.","7"

The effects are good. The story is a little basic but like I say it's ok. The worse thing about the film is what comes after it, the post credit scenes (two of them) just don't make sense and felt really hurried.","7"
"gpx_fto","Refreshing old school action story-telling","1 April 2022","I didn't watch the trailer, I didn't read the review, I just went and watched the movie.

The action scenes were actually really good and I was surprised see the awesome powers of Morbius - The first action scene played in my mind when I woke up this morning and I thought what a great job they did bringing this character to life.

Easy to follow story that keeps you engaged, actually focuses on building up the origin story of the character while throwing in great action and pacing. Really enjoyed it.

May not suit people expecting it or comparing it to other movies and having preconceived ideas. Can't we just enjoy a movie for what it is? Walk into a theatre, leave preconceptions at the door, enjoy a movie from start to finish for what it is - A little predictable once it gets going however that doesn't take away from the might of the Morbius experience and especially what it sets up post credit... Goosebumps.

Thumbs up!","9"
"southdavid","Not much at 'Stake'","4 April 2022","I'm not sure what the magic touch that Marvel has is, but whatever it is, it's certainly not rubbing off on Sony when they try and make a film without them. Two disappointing ""Venom"" films are followed by this one about Spider-man's Vampiric sometime foe, sometime friend that looked like a shaky proposition a long way out. That it's not as bad as some reviews have made out is about the best I can say.

Having been born with a debilitating and life limiting blood condition, Doctor Michael Morbius (Jared Leto) has spend his life trying to find a cure. Coming to believe that the answer lies in the DNA of Vampire Bats, Morbius tests his experimental serum on himself. Though he is cured, even given superhuman abilities, his rational mind is only sated by the consumption of blood - human or synthetic. Struggling with his curse, he refuses to give the cure to his long-time friend and benefactor Milo (Matt Smith), but when he takes it anyway, Milo finds he has less qualms about taking a life.

It's not awful, but it's not good either. Like it's ""Venom"" stablemates before it, it is a CGI heavy superhero film that feels behind the times. Not investing enough in the story of the film and assuming that brand name recognition and a tiny bit of spectacle will be enough to get people in. Leto's sleepwalks through the role a bit, though Matt Smith, and Jared Harris as their defacto father get a bit more to do. Tyrese Gibson and Al Madrigal appear as two special agents, but their contributions to the plot are so limited they could have been cut entirely. In fact, they do just disappear from the film after a while.

To get slightly more specific about my problems with the plot, I feel like Morbius and Milo fall out too quickly, once they're both Vampires. That the romantic relationship was unearned and the less said about the post credits scenes and their baffling look into the future the better.

I feel like Sony could do with a little more quality in their creative teams, maybe a few more gambles with types of directors and writers their choosing for their projects. (Or just knock it off and the Marvel do it).","5"

I think Leto did a good job of portraying morbius. For a story line it was good for an origin story, I left the theater curious of where Sony was planning on taking morbius moving forward and how he will play into the rest of the Sony universe of Marvel characters.

Spoilers!?!?

One thing I don't really understand and are hoping they will clear up next time morbius shows up in a movie is the end credits...they portrayed morbius as a antihero throughout the entire movie then in the credits portray him as a villain teaming up with someone from the sinister six villain group so that definitely needs to be explained moving forward.

Overall though I enjoyed the movie and look forward to morbius moving forward and especially hope to see him make an appearance in a blade movie.","7"

"Xavier_Stone","Fanboys unable to defend this","6 April 2022","For all the people out there who love Marvel/DC/ super hero stories made into movies this film is for you. You deserve it, and you'll love it as there are tons of plot holes filled with bad acting and dialogue. You never have to ask why something happens as you don't care.

For most of us, we are interested in a unique and smart story telling experience for an origin series. This doesn't happen often, but when it does it's nice to see.

Can't say much else. Jared isn't entirely to blame as the script has him starting off on an offshore freighter for some reason and just gets more bizarre from there. 10 star fanboys, industry employees and bot farms will continue to prop up the dismal ratings and reviews.","3"

"kjproulx","Even with Low Expectations, this Marvel Movie Disappoints","1 April 2022","I have been a fan of Marvel films since I was a kid and I always try to look for the good in them first, simply because I don't enjoy disliking them. When a superhero story is told very well, they're some of my favourite stories out there. When Sony began to branch out their Spider-Man universe and make villain films, I was very worried. I had some fun with both Venom films, but neither were great by any means. Well, the latest Sony/Marvel villain film, Morbius, has just hit the big screen, and it's not good, which is saying a lot coming from me.

Trying to cure himself of a rare condition, Dr. Michael Morbius (Jared Leto) discovers that there may be a cure hidden in the blood of bats. After injecting himself to find out, he morphs himself into some kind of vampire. From here, he begins to lose control, creating casualties along the way. His best friend Milo (Matt Smith) also has this condition, so I'm sure you can guess where the villain storyline comes into play here. So now that you have the just of the premise, let's dive in.

Firstly, I'm not going to ignore the elements that worked for me overall. I'll admit that this is the best I've seen from Jared Leto in a while and the chemistry he shared with Martine (Adria Arjona) was absolutely a highlight of the film. The tone suits what's going on and I enjoyed the look of it overall, but the tone and slow pacing eventually grind the film to a halt on a few occasions. I'm also all for a darker hero/anti-hero story in the Marvel universe because we haven't had much of that, but there just wasn't enough of a good story being told to back that up. There was an effort here, it just didn't work for me.

So, why didn't this film work? Well, I was instantly turned off by the first scene, as the discovery of the bats is literally the opening sequence. Just a couple of scenes later he's already injecting himself and the cure begins to work. It's almost like the first act of the film was condensed to five minutes. Moving along, there are many scenes of dialogue that drag on, while the important plot points seem to be brushed over as bullet points. Morbius is so focused on getting to the good stuff, but it's sacrificing its characters in the process. On top of not really caring about what was going on, the finale just felt like another CGI fight that lasts for about 20 minutes. Those sequences can be tolerable or even great if they're part of a good film, but I just found myself rolling my eyes this time.

In the end, Morbius is a film that takes place in the same world as Venom (maybe?) and Spider-Man (maybe?), but I was too confused with the conclusion of the film to really know where it takes place. I'd almost say it takes place in its own world. Morbius is a movie that clearly feels tampered with in post-production, and not in a good way. I do like Jared Leto as this character so I will gladly sit through a film that includes him, but I really don't care to see a series of films based solely on Morbius. Once the credits rolled I had no desire to recommend it to anyone and I can't see myself revisiting it, unless necessary. Morbius, even with low expectations on my part, sadly disappointed me.","3"
"Aleacity","B+ Great film, Fantastic Soundtrack","6 April 2022","From start to finish, this is a solid entry for a ""blockbuster"" horror/action/scifi/fantasy/superhero film. It is on the ""dark"" and ""horror-laden"" side. For the storyline, casting, and dialogue, this is again, a solid entry. It has intelligence (we agree to suspend disbelief, and no more than usual here) and the necessary dollops of humor and romance that we also expect, for example, of a Bond film. Where the film excels is in the soundtrack by composer/sound designer. Jon Petter Ekstrand. An absolutely brilliant mixture of orchestral/symphonic, techno/electronic, and Luigi Russolo-esque noise composition (nods to John Cage, too). Highlights include the microtonal horn theme for the ""evil side"" of the vampire bat-man; the brilliant sonic representation of echolocation (this MUST be experienced in IMAX and/or Dolby Cinema Theatre of AMC); and Milo's ""mad-I'm-a-vampire-killing-machine"" celebratory dance to the chanted rap-like techno song ""Ekse"" by Stockholm based Off The Meds. And the length, at 100 minutes, is perfect! Ignore the naysayers! Catch this one in the theaters, preferably IMAX!","9"

"tclement-60638","I want more of Morbius in future films!","11 May 2022","I am a constructive critique: I tell what they could have done better and not to chastise.

I am a massive Spider-Man fan and so I have heard of Morbius' character from watching Spider-Man the animated series. So finding out that Joker was cast to play The Living Vampire, I was excited.

...Spoiler-free review first... I liked Morbius' design, very cool and very frightening while looking pretty comic-accurate! :) I am also obsessed with Doctor Who, so finding out that Matt Smith is in this picture made me light up excited.

I enjoyed watching Jered Leto, bravo on his acting as always, very good physical acting on his part as well for the first half before his change.

I definitely believed that Michael really wants to help people, so he was a very cheer-worthy protagonist.

Overall the plot made sense to me.

I am glad this film didn't have as much humour as the Venom films have (not to dis on the Venom films) Pretty cool graphic effects. Also, a lot of their vampire bat facts were true, so very good on doing your research for the script!

And while I am a horror movie fan, I am glad that this wasn't a horror movie so that kids can enjoy watching this comic book story.

To sum up, I did enjoy watching this movie :)

{SPOILERS ahead} Here is what they could have done 'better' (in my opinion) I don't like rating films thatI liked to be below a 7/10, so this is why I deducted some points away from a perfectly enjoyable movie: The writing; I am a perfectionist and so I usually am not completely satisfied with an art project unless I see every angle as near air-tight as possible. I thought Agent Rodriguez' dialogue was a bit too much (I just found out he's played by a comedian but still) I wish the film had a bit more depth to it, Milo's character development into becoming a villain felt forced and not exactly 'believable' I guess, I just didn't see the reason for him to turn on and try and kill Michael. Also, while I am a Matt Smith fan, I would have had him act different post-serum than what was given instead (I like my villains deadly-serious) ...also how did Milo take the vampire serum if it needed to be injected into the spine by a second person?

There was a few moments in the film where I thought the scene-palette could have been different, but the majority of the film had nice colours.

I just didn't leave the theatre having that epic blood-rush flow through me as I do with a lot of superhero films, I can't exactly tell what it is the film lacked, but it's just this feeling in me of incompleteness.

I would like to know what's in store next for Michael Morbius now that he is still possibly a wanted 'criminal'.

Also, I got really pumped for this film when I watched the trailer on Youtube, and I notice that movies a lot of time now have this problem where the trailer is a bit more epic than all of what the film turned out to be. I didn't see the Spider-Man graffiti on the wall, Morbius being a bit lighthearted after delivering that ""I'm Venom"" line and Vulture bumping into Michael in the hall.

And as a mild comment, I wasn't particularly fond of the title graphics at the beginning and end with the vector purple scheme (but that's just me as a graphic designer) I am excited to see how this Venom-verse will progress in the making of more films, I am excited. I really hope Morbius will continue to be in more of these films and getting some screentime with my favourite wall-crawling hero :)","7"

I've never seen such a voluptuous portrayal of characters. The directing was splendid, and don't even get me started on the acting. The acting was so great I almost thought everything was real. Do not get me wrong, I know the public doesn't agree with my opinion. But if they would just give it a chance, they would see that it is actually a 21st century masterpiece. If I could bring back the founding fathers from the dead and show them one thing from present day media, I would show them this movie.

"moshtagh-laghaei","Underrated and not complicated","16 May 2022","The movie ""Morbius"" is a simple actions, adventure, and sort of crime film, which is about a doctor suffering from a rare blood disease. Doctor Morbius is after a cure, but in the process he turns himself to a something unexpected and changes his life for good.

The movie is so underrated that I thought I was going to watch a complete garbage! However it turned out to be as satisfactory as any other action movies. Almost every actor's performance was okay, I liked it actually. However, the screenplay could have been deeper. The process for the characters to evolve is not enough and it actually needed more time and deeper meaning to it. The visual and special effects were satisfactorily interesting, however they could explore the abilities of the main character further and deeper.

Generally the movie is satisfactorily entertaining, if you lower your expectations level and enjoy the movie.","7"

Yes, certain things should've been better and prolonged but it is not bad nor it should be ignored. I recommend a watch, but yes do not expect the wow factor of other superhero genre movies.

"paulclaassen","A Vampire movie or a Batman movie? Either way, I still enjoyed it.","7 August 2022","Critics didn't like it. I did. 'Morbius' tells the story of brilliant scientist Michael Morbius, who suffers from a rare blood disease.

Morbius (Jared Leto) befriended Lucien/Milo (Matt Smith) from a very young age when they both were in the same hospital with the same blood disease. From this young age, Morbius was a promising young man, who ensured Milo he would one day find a cure. The character set-up was good enough for me to root for them and understand why they did what they did later in life.

Desperate to found a cure and become 'normal', Morbius' methods are unorthodox, to say the least, as he pushes the boundaries of what is considered acceptable for the sake of science. Morbius succeeded in finding a cure, with blood taken from vampire bats. However, it turned out to be a curse, as the cure would be short-lived with the effects wearing off after just a few hours. And it turned him into a vicious blood-craving vampire.

'Morbius' is an entirely new take on the vampire genre. Maybe we should call him the new generation Batman - ha-ha-ha!! Many scenes reminded me of 'Batman', and I had to convince myself this was actually a vampire movie and not a 'Batman' entry.

The storytelling made the film feel more realistic than most vampire movies. Opposed to killing, Morbius doesn't want to drink human blood, but just how long can he resist? Find out for yourself! With action, adventure, drama, suspense, fantasy, horror and even time for romance, 'Morbius' was an exciting - yet very different - superhero movie. I also enjoyed the lack of humour, considering this is a Marvel movie and they so love adding humour!

The antagonist turns out to be Morbius' own best friend. This character ended up so similar to other Marvel villains that there was nothing really remarkable about him. Nevertheless, he was still an evil villain.

The visual effects and make-up were fantastic. My only criticism were the finale. The climax is your typical Hollywood superhero, over-the-top, CGI laden, create-as-much-havoc-as-possible cliche. I felt this could have been toned down and would have been more effective in the process. Regardless, I still enjoyed 'Morbius' very much.","6"

"parry_na","Not that bad ... and not that good.","9 June 2023","If you read articles about 'Morbius the Living Vampire', you'll doubtless be reminded how it was one of the biggest flops of 2022. It only made a few squillion dollars profit instead of *loads* of squillions of dollars profit. In the high-flying world of big-budget mainstream films, of franchise 'universes', a mediocre performance is unforgivable.

The film itself I found to be okay. The pacing dragged somewhat in the middle, which made me question why it was given 104 minutes of runtime instead of something leaner. The acting from Jared Leto as the title character Michael Morbius is good, supported by a surprisingly flat turn from Matt Smith as his pal Milo - although it's curiously wonderful to hear the former Doctor Who say 'ar*ehole.' We also get your typical husky, strutting, growling cop, and there are a few other sundry characters we never really get to know.

Michael conducts a series of blood experiments to cure his malady and that of his friend. It's no spoiler that he becomes vampirised, but isn't fazed by daylight or crucifixes and looks smashing with his shirt off.

Overall, the film is average, but with some very good set-pieces. It looks spectacular, of course, in the way that all mainstream films do. Possibly the reason it is perceived as a failure is that it tries to appeal to fans of superheroes as well as horror hounds and ends up satisfying neither. Minus points for the CGI-fest in the final scenes; there are also a couple of tie-ins mid/post credits to the bigger Marvel Universe which will be meaningless unless you're familiar with other brands and franchises in the factory such films have become. My score is 5 out of 10.","5"

And not going to go into spoliers but wtf is that mid credit scene 😑. I truly think that sony should let Kevin Fiege help with this universe fr. So including the 2 venom films here's my ranking.

"rgkarim","Morbius Needs A Doctor For Storytelling","1 April 2022","The Make Up/Effects at Points: When they are investing and putting effort into the movie, the effects are not bad in Morbius. While not really achieving what Disney has perfected, there are times where the pale, emaciated figure of Morbius is rather shocking to see and I applaud the ability to make his disease look realistic. Once the vampiric powers start to arise, there are times where the effects are looking pretty cool, and hold some edge of cool for me in the way they designed the transformation features. Seeing his eyes transform into this blind like state was my particular fate, but other eye color changes, the warping of the face at times, and even the cool finger effects of his claws were elements I thought were done well for this film. It's again not the most unique or jaw dropping experience we've ever seen, but it works for me.

The Special Effects: Again, there is a lot of room for improvement, but at times Morbius manages to shake some things up for using technology to make some moments pretty cool. At the lower level of likes is the dash like speed force he has, managing to be actually fast, but not too slow-motion madness like Snyder likes. As more powers arise, there are some cool moments that help make you feel like you are in for the ride (like a virtual coaster), and the sonar is pretty cool in those opening moments. My favorite involves the use of critters, and the nice use of lighting and sound effects to really give you that element of dread, darkness and superhero abilities that we love to hear/see in the theater.

The First Part of the Story: There is a nice opening to this movie as the first act unfolds for Morbius' place in this crazy mixed up universe. A nice touching moment between the two main characters, some engaging medical drama moments that match other searches for the cure, and some other set ups got points for engagement for me in this film. If only that quality could have been kept for much of the film, but that opening showed great promise for this series.

The First Action Scene: It's not the most put together scene, but I did like the angle they took with the first fight on the boat. Morbius' dive into his powers leads to a predator like moment that held some dynamic angles and approaches to taking on the extras. A few first-person moments, mixed with fleeting glimpses of him in the shadows felt like a hardcore Batman Begins scene that works with this savage nature of Morbius' tale. It showed promise for the rest of the film, but that did not quite pan out.

The Acting: It's not the best by far, but there were moments where the actors were able to salvage some of the movie with performances that could have been capitalized on. Ariona is stunning on many levels, a combination of beauty, smarts, and spirit that makes for a more interesting supporting character for this film. She held a lot of the logic and goodness of the city, but always had the ability to challenge the rules that made her perfect to help with Morbius' plans. I'm going to skip over the other top billed actor due to their low involvement, but Matt Smith as Milo had moments that would have worked had they reigned some of the writing back. Smith's non intense moments do have some heart to it, and that first act again shows the promise of a complicated character. When he is forced to go to other extremes, there are times his mannerisms are perfect for the role, and other times a little too much. Still, I enjoyed the performance he brought to some degree. Leto is of course the star of the film, and he tried to do as much as he could with what he was given. Leto's first act is strong, and his second act is not bad, but there is just some missing direction or planning that gets lost to the weaknesses of the movie. Overall, there is some decent and good chemistry, but it's lost to a lot of other things in this movie.

DISLIKES:

The Weaker Acting Moments: I never expect Oscar roles in these movies, but I've had enough quality to know stronger acting roles in a superhero movie. Morbius has a lot of shorthanded acting moments, many being cheesy, flat, or just ludicrous with the material given. As the movie progressed, the acting quality continued to worsen until it was just a messy finish that was humorous at times and lacking on others.

The Writing: I don't know what's up with the dialogue, but the movie's quality in lines also degrades over time. That strong start, engaging dialogue with realism and panache are practically absent at the end, and things just become very simplified and cut to be almost not needed by the end of the film. Other lines and attempts to be clever find their marks, but most are straight misses for this reviewer, lost to all the over-the-top visuals and lackluster second and third acts that have too much in them.

The Comedy: Is very limited for me to be honest. The movie's jokes have become stale from the multiple trailers that they have very little bite to them unless you have missed those trailers. Other jokes are very forced on you, and for me (and most of my audience members) did not generate too many intentional laughs. I hate to say that, but I just did not laugh as much as I have at other superhero movies in this film.

The Action: Sony used to be awesome with their superhero action, giving me those high-flying Spiderman moments that to this day still get me stoked for what they did. However, Morbius' darker atmosphere offered some chances to tear into the fighting again as he explored the nature of his powers. While some of these effects did accomplish this, much of the action was lame for me, quick bouts of overexaggerated moves that were over before they started. No coordination, no titanic displays of powers, just a few quick blurs into slow motion snarls don't make for the most entertaining battles for me. Throw some choreography, a bit of fun moves, and some other tropes and this could have worked. And as a plus, drop the Snydervision antics down a peg if possible.

The Visual Effects: The Other side: Some things look awesome and others are showing the limitations of Sony's group and the impact on budgets. I can't say it's the worst, because they can still do better than me, but the cheesy visuals dilute the vampiric mode they were striving to design. During the creature moments, prosthetics could have helped with this, while also tightening up the CGI to not look so fake and artificial. It's nothing that destroys the movie for the most part, but Disney again has proven their merit in this element.

The Story: This is the weakest element of the movie for me, and the part that I think weakness many of the other elements mentioned above. Morbius' first act actually is not bad, a little predictable, a few extra cut moments, but sets the stage for ethical dilemmas that will be tested in the coming hour and a half. And then comes the second act where suddenly things pick up pace, lots of elements are pushed in, action scenes get muddy, and build up/testing is rather low, dropping all that preparation. The movie tries to fight quality and speed at this point, and the thing that suffers is suspense and character utilization, which is very poor in this movie. Big name actors, and roles get various levels of showing up on screen, most of which feel very weak to the promise being made. Once the third act hits... the movie is rushing to not only wrap up this chapter with an ""exciting"" climax, but also set up for the next movie if they get greenlit. Unfortunately, this failed miserably for me and felt like a sweep under the rug. Unlike Venom, the after credits scene could not redeem the ending, and even these scenes don't quite make sense or have the punch I think was envisioned. Had the story been balanced and not as much crammed in, perhaps all these dislikes would be likes.

The VERDICT: Morbius is indeed one of the weaker installments of the Marvel series, and it all comes down to planning, writing and balance, which this movie lacks. Sure, there are moments that do work for me, the first act in particular being the strongest part, alongside some effects and fighting do work for me. The acting does its best with the material, but it can only do so much with what it was given, which is not much at times. Where the movie fails though is that the visual effects are lacking at times, alongside mundane action sequences that utilize little of the imagination Sony once held for their hero flicks. It's really the writing and story though that just have everything collapse, a rush mess that seemed to take hits with each delay, including the hasty wrap up and teasers that they are trying to lure you back in with for the sequel that may come. It's too much in one movie and it really pales in comparison to a lot of other things in this category. Thus, the effects may be the only worthy theater visit quality, while I give a strong nod to seeing this at home if you can.

My scores are:

Action/Adventure/Horror: 5.5 Movie Overall: 4.0-4.5.","5"
"benjaminskylerhill","Horrendously bland.","1 April 2022","Remember Venom (2018)? Remember how it had characters with almost no distinct traits or charismatic screen presence?

But also remember how that movie also had some fun moments where Tom Hardy carried it with hilarious banter and visual gags with Venom?

Now, imagine a movie that only has those bad things listed above, while all of the fun, humor, and any sense of self-awareness has been stripped away.

"nevil_76","The movie is valid, only it is hated by the ""widows of Spiderman""","31 March 2022","I saw the film today and I really liked it: serious, introspective and with quite serious themes (such as the condition of those who suffer from serious illnesses and are constantly forced to care, I have two relatives in these conditions and I have particularly empathized with both protagonist than with the villain).

I found the characters well placed in the roles, from Jared Leto, to Matt Smith (very good), but also Adria Arjona and Jared Harris, maybe Tyrese Gibson and Al Madrigal a little lower.

I liked the effect of the view amplified by the echolocation (hence the trails that are seen) and also the physics of the vectors used by Morbius to fly (it is not really a real flight, but a gliding on the updrafts).

Quite coherent plot and discreetly (although not entirely) faithful to the origins of the character.

For me the only reason for the low rating is that everyone who gives it to this film expected to see Spiderman (sorry, but the title of the film is Morbius and therefore we talk about him), or who hates Sony regardless.

My Score: 6.8 Cast=10 Acting=7 Plot=8 Ending=6 Story=6 Imagine=8 Pace=4 CGI=9 Comic=6 Funny=4

Dangerously ill with a rare blood disorder and determined to save others suffering his same fate, Dr. Morbius attempts a desperate gamble. What at first appears to be a radical cure reveals itself to be potentially more dangerous.

""How far are we allowed to fix something that's broken?"" I think I found the cure for those that hated this movie...watch Love and Thunder first and you may appreciate it more. I actually liked parts of this and I'll look forward to seeing Morbius in future non-solo films. I had issues with the pace and humor of the film and its following of the comic mainly stems from easter eggs in the film; which you need to watch the blu-ray to see. This was not a bad watch overall, but I think it's my lowest score of the MCU films.

"gab-67599","""I AM VEMON""","23 June 2022","And then with 3 little words this whole movie was just ruined for me. I have now seen this movie 3 times. Twice online, illegally where the sound and pic were unrecognizable. Then once again today still illegally on soap2day but now at least I could see and hear it all. This movie was a visual treat, bright colors thrown at you and great effects. Let me put aside my feelings for Sony trying to cash in with this movie. Or the fact that Morbius would never team up with anyone doing bad like the vulture guy. This movie was GOOD! I already love vampire movies and superhero's so the combo was great! This movie was at least worthy of between 6 and 8 stars. Anyone rating it lower is just lying or being hateful. Drama, love, mystery ending. What more could you ask for. I am sad everyone else does not feel the same as I do in watching this movie. That means pt.2 will not come out until after spider woman. I definitely do not want to see that. I love this movie and will continue re-watching it because it was that good. Next movie I will be front row in the theaters to see!

"bankofmarquis","It's Not Bad...It's Dumb","7 July 2022","""It's not as bad as you heard"", is certainly the very definition of damning something with faint praise, but that is exactly the right thing to say about the 2022 Sony Comic Book Film Adaptation of MORBIUS.

Starring Jared Leto, MORBIUS follows the origin story - and first adventure - of Spiderman villain Morbius who, inexplicably, becomes the hero in this story.

While, ultimately, not a good film, there are some good things happening here, so let's begin there.

The lead performance by Jared Leto as Dr. Michael Morbius is - very surprisingly - somewhat grounded in reality. Leto is not one to be subtle in his character choices (see HOUSE OF GUCCI) but in this one, he is (somewhat) reserved. It would have been easy for Leto to go over the top with this character, but he wisely chooses the opposite route...and it works. The always watchable Jared Harris (CHERNOBYL) is on-board in the ""mentor"" role while Tyrese Gibson and Al Madrigal bring some humor to the proceedings as ""Agents"" who are chasing after Morbius. The rest of the cast are benign - neither adding nor detracting from the proceedings - with the exception of Matt Smith (LAST NIGHT IN SOHO) who's character is so badly written that he flounders under the weight of the absurdity of what his character is tasked with.

Trying to overcome the ridiculousness of the story is the Direction by Daniel Espinosa (the Denzel Washington action flick SAFE HOUSE). He moves the action along quickly, never really lingering on the absurdities of the events going on (and there are PLENTY of absurdities to avoid - more on that later) and Espinosa actually has an artistic vision of what he wanted to accomplish visually in this comic-book film, freezing many frames when the picture on the screen looked like a page from a graphic novel. It's a smart choice for a film that can only be described as dumb.

And dumb this film is. I kept feeling any sense of common sense and reality slip away as this film - written by Matt Sazama and Burk Sharpless - quickly devolved into the absurd and ridiculous. One does have to suspend belief when watching Comic Book films (how else are we going to believe that a man can turn into a human spider) but in this case, the suspension is mighty - it is one of the dumbest films ever made (in terms of plot and situations) and that is saying something. The makers of this film really stretch the term ""go with me here"" as Morbius is constantly chasing and evolving and being chased in the most absurd ways throughout this film with special effects that add to the absurdity of the proceedings. To be fair, this film never falls into the ""so bad it's good"" range, it hovers just above that line.

The end credits scenes start to setup a ""Sinister Six"" Spiderman film, so there is some hope for this - it would be interesting to see Leto's Morbius team up with some other Spiderman villains (who's names would be a spoiler), provided the script is better. There's no way that it can be worse.

MORBIUS is not a bad film - it just will insult your intelligence.

"aprilgregh","Just really, really bad. Wow.","1 June 2022","I've always been a comic book fan, Marvel in particular, so I always view every comic movie at least once. I've even repeatedly viewed some films that were widely panned by critics and users alike, simply because they offered something that I found mildly entertaining. My point is, in spite of the plethora of bad reviews, I did what I usually do and gave it a shot, hoping it would surprise me.

Morbius did surprise me. I was blown away by how bad it is. This movie doesn't even follow the rules it sets for itself. Morbius can't control himself when his colleague (and I guess love interest?) suffers what is the equivalent of a papercut but 5 minutes later he is totally able to ignore the buffet presented while kneeling over his eviscerated, soon-to-die mentor? I could go on, but just know that it's bad. Really, really bad.","2"
"MatthewMichaelHoffman","The first movie to ever make One Morbillion!","11 May 2022","SCORE: 6.2/10

Alright, I'm going to do my best to review this as a film, mid/post credit scene aside, to start. For one, I don't understand the HATE for this movie. It took the exact formula of Venom and replaced the humor with intensity. I personally enjoyed this more than Venom. I was engaged throughout the entirety of the film and found myself somewhat excited to see what would happen next. Admittedly, acting was subpar in a few areas, the storytelling was pretty bad, and the entire movie felt a little off when it comes to pacing, but overall this was an enjoyable movie to watch.

Now to talk about the mid/post credit scene. As a Marvel Fan, I have grown to be just as excited about the mid/post credit scene as I am about the film itself. I am in belief, just like in Venom, that a subpar movie can be enhanced by a meaningful mid/post credit scene. I am still in shock that whoever made the trailers for this movie decided to spoil the mid/post credit scene. If I had no idea that the Vulture was involved, those scenes would've enhanced my feeling towards this movie. I just want to meet the person whose idea it was to do that and understand the point of spoiling that part of the movie for the audience. It is almost on the same level of if we saw the portal scene of Andrew and Tobey coming through in the Spider-Man: No Way Home trailer. What were they thinking?","6"
"postofficecb","Dubious","12 January 2023","I fast-forwarded through this. The problem is two-fold. One, no one cares about the characters. They are flat and insipid and any modicum of development is a caricature at best, particularly the opening scenes. Worse, it's performed by otherwise very capable actors.

Second, Hollywood must stop feeding the myth of the MCU, as it's generating worse and worse quality all in the name of the almighty dollar. There is no resemblance here to a superhero, and even if there were, story is abandoned in favour of makeup and special effects and a repulsive visage. The fetishization of all things MCU is second only to, well, the second amendment, and with 6 year olds shooting teachers, we know how useful fetishes can be.

Stop the MCU.","4"
"saru2020","this should've been named Batman","24 September 2022","The plot is as old as hulk but it is still nicely made with very good transitions & animations, VFX is on another level

looks like Venom & Morbius have come from the same brains and maybe that's the downside knowing it upfront they've mocked it in the same film as well still its almost similar kind and nothing special as such

another good same-old instalment from marvel, not so disappointing but still not so engaging either but still this one makes it a one-time decent watchable for sure.

But overall, it looks like Marvel's filmmaking style has become somewhat stagnant with no new ideas coming up and still the same-old scientist injecting himself & turning into some beast, this is the same idea being used for several decades in a row, there definitely has to be something else that works in this genre, only trial & error would bring that out and big cash house like Marvel should definitely come forward boldly to try different kinds to see which idea actually works for the masses.","6"
"cardsrock","Gonna morb all over this review","19 October 2022","With all the hype and bad press leading into me finally watching this, I can safely saw that yes, it really is a bad film. The story and direction are straight out of the early 2000s superhero film era, and no, not the good ones. Leto isn't the worst in the role, he's just a bit underdeveloped and mopey for me. The first half isn't terrible, but the second half just drags on and on while limping to its lackluster climax. There's a lot of unintentional comedy too.

Add in the blatant copying of scenes and music from Batman Begins, and this film really irritated me. Sony has no idea what it's doing with these Spider-Man spin-offs and how to tie them into the MCU, as evidenced by the bafflingly constructed post-credit scenes.","4"
"joebloggscity","Not as bad a bite as critics are making it out to be...","4 July 2022","I'm tired of comic book movies, and only watched this as my local was showing it for next to nothing (so basically they were practically giving tickets away to get people to watch this, not something that I've ever known before to happen to recent releases). They made up for the difference with me buying a big popcorn!

From the off, I'll concede that I'd heard how poor this was from the reviews and so went into it with low expectations, maybe it was the popcorn that was all I wanted. Anyhow, I've watched it and in truth I don't think it's as bad as critics are making it out to be but also not that great either. It's - meh!

This is a vampire-esque movie where our antagonist is cursed with vampire superpowers and out to stop his old friend who goes too far wit the serum that caused their new condition. The problem for many is that Jared Leto has unfairly and wrongly become a whipping boy. I think he's a great actor, but is now lumbered with some of lesser rated roles (such as in Gucci and Suicide Squad) being held against him. Give him a break, he's actually good in this film, he's NOT the problem.

For me the problem is that this is really should be a darker horror film but tones down and is a mish-mash to be more of a comic book film, and that tone takes away from what it could have been. Also Matt Smith as the antagonist hams it up, and despite him being British, I have no clue what his accent was all about! Really terrible!

This film is a fine popcorn movie, but the negatives can't be dismissed. It will be fine for most as a one-off viewing but definitely not for little kids even though it is a Marvel movie! Give it a go for a one-off, just keep your mind open.","5"
"karukun","What's everyone's deal? This is an okay movie","5 April 2022","Pretty much what I said here, I don't have a lot to say here. Morbius is pretty similar to the Venom movies (which would make sense as it's made by the same company), they're movies that you go into knowing they're kinda bad but you like them anyway.

The first half of the movie I ended up really enjoying. My only complaints are what you would probably call nitpicking. I'm not a huge fan of how everything looks smokey, at first I thought this was Morbius's perspective with his echo/hearing, but then everything was smokey. Also this seems to completely copy Venom in the way where Morbius becomes a anti-hero, instead of a bad guy. Isn't Morbius supposed to be a villain? Is everyone gonna become a anti-hero?

I was enjoying it until Milo (Matt Smith) becomes the antagonist, then it just kinda became stupid.

But it isn't nearly as horrible as people are making it out to be. Y'all are dramatic lol.","7"
"dominicignaciouk","Decent film","31 August 2022","I didn't know this had anything to with marvel so no expectations, on the whole this is a good movie, with interesting story, I love vampire movies an this hit the spot, okay there wasn't head ripping or blood everywhere but okay scenes, I think it should have a better rating, I think if it wasn't connected with marvel then it would have done better. I would much rather watch this than spider-man or something because this was little darker and just more my type of movie, I have to say there is kind of a batman feel obviously because of the bats. I would like to see more of Morbius as series or movie,","7"

If you like marvel films I would watch it but with lower expectations.","5"
"fpqgbydymm","Great Addition To Sony-Verse and MCU!","1 April 2022","Ignore the negative reviews for this film. If you liked Venom and Venom: Let There Be Carnage, you will enjoy this movie. This is the start of something exciting for the Sony-Verse.","10"
"danielmanson","Poorly written in a slap bang average movie","13 April 2022","You'd think from some of the reviews I've seen this was the worst thing ever made. Was it an amazing film and a good addition to marvel? No. But, it's not horrendous either. It has some glaringly obvious issues when you watch and the plot felt a bit soulless. But it could have been much much worse!

What's the issues? For me the main annoyance I had was the writing of the film. It just seemed so disjointed at times and almost rushed. It felt like someone went ""write a marvel film you have a week"" and this is the product. The final half an hour or so really illustrated this as it felt like it would almost skip parts (won't give examples due to spoilers) and certain actions weren't explained. I feel like they needed to flesh out the plot a bit more and with it being a short film, they could have done this easily.

The characters. So actually the base set of characters on face value is absolutely fine. But the chemistry between them just wasn't there. Distinct lack of character depth as well didn't help either. The romance side of the plot made absolutely zero sense and came from nowhere as there was absolutely no sexual chemistry or anything even hinting to it. The actual villain played by fellow Rovers fan Matt Smith needed more depth. He kind of just becomes a villain for no reason. Give us more! Just became hard to root for anyone really.

Little niggles I want to mention. I wanted the fight scenes to be a little better. Was quite hard to see what was actually happening because it was that fast and there wasn't enough of it either. The film is basically 95% shot in the dark, which from an audience point of view it got annoying.

So yeah, for me that's Morbius' biggest issues and I think what's annoyed me more is that this could have been amazing, but just fell so flat. Like it's not the worst film you'll see by any stretch, but I left feeling dissatisfied. It's average at the end of the day and that's why I'm going 5/10.","5"
"danteism","Worth a watch and better than the current rating would have you believe.","1 April 2022","Granted, I only rated it a 6.

If I was allowed to use decimals, I would have given a 6.4 and I have pretty demanding standards for what I want out of any given film depending on the genre. No fanboy apologist or hater here either. I love the best of the Marvel and DC films, as well as serious dramas, arthouse, foreign films, select horror and more.

Given the dismal reviews here and from critics we went in with very low expectations and were pleasantly surprised!

While it's nowhere near the high bar that has been set in recent years by other comic adaptations it's not even the worst Marvel movie in recent years. One of those in my party said they liked it better than Eternals, and I think it's markedly better than the Edward Norton Hulk, the first Thor film, the first Suicide Squad, the theatrical Justice League, and X-Men Age of Apocalypse / Dark Phoenix as well.

Even marginally better than both Venom films in my opinion.

That's not to say it's great, but it had enough fun moments and redeeming qualities to make it worth a watch.

Apart from the first action scene which was solid, most of the rest were not particularly thrilling.

Jared Leto was solid enough and Matt Smith was great.

Plot was a bit thin, dialogue was proficient, and pacing was good.

Special effects were good, general tone and atmosphere was well done, and the styling of Morbius' monstrous side was perfect.

If the trailer held any appeal whatsoever and you go in with very measured expectations there's more to enjoy here than the current ratings would suggest.","6"
"Slarkshark","Generic Entertainment and Origin Story","5 May 2023","This will be a relatively generous rating and review. The main reason being, that it really was not any worse than 'Venom', and it was better than 'Venon: Let there be Carnage'. A 6.5/10 would seem about right.

There's not much to make this origin story stand out. What would have been nice is if they made Michael Morbius have a Greek accent, or at least have a larger portion of the film take place in Greece, instead of New York, which is the setting for almost every other comic movie. Even in the beginning, why don't they have young Morbius, who is in Greece, speak Greek? Other than that I thought they stayed pretty true to his character, and that Jared Leto actually did an alright job.

Lots of complaints about the CGI, but again, it seemed no worse than the CGI in 'Venom', and in some ways it was probably better. It's problem was an over abundance and over reliance. All the action is CGI, and so the movie is completely saturated with it. Perhaps with this type of character it may be hard to avoid, but that seemed to be one of it's main issues.

This movie also didn't seem overly necessary. It's a story that could have easily been part of Spider-Man film, and didn't necessarily seem like it needed to be a stand alone. Not to say that's a bad thing, we've just seen these origin stories told in pretty much every other Spider-Man film. Brilliant scientist involved in an experiment that goes wrong and gets turned into some kind of monster... this happens a lot.

What was good? The acting seemed good, even if the characters lacked depth. And... I liked the closing credits; not the post credit scenes, but the actual initial credits design and music. Am I reaching now?

Not much else to say. It's by no means as bad as the reviews say, but I get it. It's just kinda bland and generic, but still provides entertainment, so I suppose that's the end goal.","7"

He's a genius despite all this. Good action sequences and fun. Watch yourself.","7"

Finally last night I decided to give it a chance and couldn't even stay awake during its short runtime. It's so rushed I felt like I'm watching a 100 minutes trailer of a movie. How come people earn millions of dollars by writing such an inferior script.

After finishing the movie, all I felt was they've made the movie just to introduce a female ""morbius"" in the end. I mean seriously, his best friend becomes vampire, then his girlfriend becomes vampire. Is this a new sequel of Twilight or something? Stay away at all costs.","5"
"Pairic","Like A Bat Out of Hell","6 April 2022","Morbius: A Vampire with a scientific origin story. It fits into the MCU, there are a few clues buried in the film so pay attention, no need to wait for mid-credits teasers. A tale of mortality, Morbius and his ""brother"" Milo have a chronic blood illness, they meet as 10 year olds in a clinic run by Nicholas. Morbius vows to ensure that they grow into cranky old men together. Morbius is cranky anyway, 25 years later he turns down a Nobel Prize at the Stockholm ceremony because his invention of artificial blood was only a by product of his ongoing search for a cure for the blood disease. Milo's wealth funds the research laboratory run by Morbius but they both realise time is short as does Martine his co-researcher. An experiment splicing vampire bat genes with his own goes awry transforming Morbius into a Vampire and putting Martine at risk.

Some great combat scenes, especially aboard the freighter where the clandestine experiment is being carried out, Morbius picks off his victims among the gangways and pipes. The tearing out of throats etc is a bit restrained and often off camera to ensure a lower age rating for the film. The opening sequence involving Morbius encountering a cave full of vampire bats is spectacular. While generally impressive the CGI is a bit ropy but not in the usual sense: Vampires move swiftly leaving coloured ropes or tendrils in their wake. The vampire nemesis of Morbius is truly savage, like the Joker at times with his grimaces. Jared Leto is best when he plays Morbius in his debilitated state or as a Vampire, less so when Morbius is an enhanced human. Jared Harris is Nicholas with Matt Smith as Milo and Adria Arjona playing Martine; all put in convincing performances. I get the impression that some crucial scenes may have ended up on the editing room floor during so I await a director's cut. Directed by Daniel Espinosa from a screenplay by Matt Sazama and Burk Sharpless. 7/10.","7"

After watching this movie your life will change in ways you couldn't even fathom. You're whole understanding of everything you know will change and your perception of life itself will warp and implode. After watching this movie you wont be able to stop rewatching it. This movie was made by the hands of God himself. I recommend this movie with every fiber in my body.","10"
"kospeti","What is up with these manchild characters?","2 April 2022","It was advertised as some kind of thriller, but it rarely tried, and even when it did, it was rather pathetic.

Many scenes, that wanted to be serious/sad/epic? Were kind of funny/cringe. The motions of the movie were all over the place.

Action was terrible, in the beginning they tried to be a bit spooky with it, but then just went full on Taken and cut every .1 seconds.

It makes no sense, the whole thing of Morbius is that he's fast and has boosted awareness. Why would they get close to him in action and not show anything???

Instead we get to see him fly around the city.

The antagonist was a mess, he had no motivation, no background of being this evil guy he was portrayed as.

He just woke up one day and chose violence.

There were many insignificant side characters that added nothing to the story.","4"

I finally went and seen the movie before screening sessions ended in my town. And I must have seen the wrong movie. Morbius was absolutely brilliant. I was left me on the edge of my seat with some scary moments. It was a true bloodlust vampire-style flick. The plot was absolutely brilliant and the special effects to demonstrate the powers attained were very well conceived. The duo dynamics between Leto and Matt Smith was the perfect match. Just wow!

"songod-95003","Entertaining and engaging","16 May 2022","All the bad reviews on this film seem to generate from a dislike for Jared Leto and his method acting. Reportedly he delaying production while filming the scenes when he was crippled by refusing to not be his uncrippled self when taking breaks. The delays resulted in complaints from crew, etc.

Sure he was not crippled but what if a performer was?? Would the delays in bathroom trips be a cause for complaints?? Sure as heck not!

Also, as is the trend today, unfounded rumors about his wild life when on the road with his band 30 Second to Mars, made its way into reviews of the film as if they actually were relevant to it. As for them, well, I was a road musician for years and show me one who has not had a smidgen of the wild life?

Like graphics are good, but Jared Leto once again performed poorly, which seems to be a common factor to movies he stars in. I would say his role as Morbius is one of his better one, but even that isn't saying much.

The plot is very predictable, as I guessed immediately that ""Milo"" would become the villain of the movie, and that Doctor Martine would be turned as well.

I would say the best acting was done by Adria Arjona, as her character was the most relatable and developed.

If you like sub-par vampires this is a movie to watch! It's cliche, even if Morbius and Milo can be in daylight without issues, but that's about it and even that isn't original.","7"

The villain has a very confusing motivation, it was rushed, it can be cringey at times, and it is predictable (that is why it is a 7/10 and not a 10/10). If you can look past this though, you will see an interesting story about a man and his friend who suffered from a blood disease his entire life and just wanted to be cured. When he takes the cure and it has side effects that are horrible, he decides his friend would be better off the way his friend is for now. I would even say it is kind of sad.","7"

So it has a dark theme, having it be PG-13 is ridiculous. It should be more like the Blade movies. I think giving this movie a 5.2/10 is unfair, it's not that bad. I personally loved Jared Leto's performance and that's the main reason I was able to enjoy the movie, also Matt Smith did a good job playing Milo, the performances are really decent overall. Im sure many people hate this movie just because Jared Leto is in it, I've noticed that there is a huge trend about hating this actor.

I love the concept, that you have an untreatable disease and you're willing to do anything to find a cure no matter the risks, even if it means that in the end you become a monster. I was instantly attracted to this idea. One of the main problems that I have with the movie is that they didn't really know if they want Michael to be the good guy or the bad guy. For example he brutally murdered all these mercenaries but later in the movie he wants to protect people from Milo who becomes evil and starts killing people after taking the cure. The Morbius character looks really cool to me, I liked the action scenes where we see Morbius' powers but certain VFX made no sense like other people have mentioned. The Venom movies are not that much better in my opinion. I would really love to see a more serious R-rated sequel. The movie has many flaws but it is entertaining for sure. It's a 7/10 for me.","7"

The actors were good, the scenes are well made with really good effects however, the script is a bit dull slow based, it could have been better.

"Writing4You","Fantastic Movie","1 April 2022","This is a great movie. I wasn't familiar with the Morbius character but I wam so glad I watched it. The storyline was beautifully written and incredibly interesting. I appreciate stories that delve into alternative possibilities within science and Morbius did that. I enjoyed the awakening of powers within Morbius cannot wait to see the next film in this series.

Jared Leto is one of the best actors in Hollywood and it shows.

Most superhero archetypes play semi flawed characters in personality only but Leto delivers a character flawed in a variety ways, on the edge of a darkness that very few characters can go within this world.

This movie did not disappoint.

As someone who writes screenplays, I respect the work done to bring this film to life.

The whole cast was great and each character shined!

The effects were amazing, especially as Morbius began tapping into all his powers.

This is the dark film that many of us have been waiting for and can appreciate solely on a great story.","10"
"okletmereviewit","A Marvel Universe Vampire Love Story","1 April 2022","I had high hopes for this movie. For what it is, it is good. If you are a comic book fan, then you are going to be disappointed. I am ranking this at a 7 because if you are new to this character and just watching it with no bais then you are going to like this movie.

For action, there is a ton of it. It would have been greatly enhanced if it had been done in 3D. No sex scenes, and mild cussing, allows for children of most ages to see it. However, with the onscreen CGI transformations it may cause nightmares.

This aside. The story line follows a fast paced ""jump in"" style of story telling. You feel lost in the first few scenes of the movie and then gain footing about 20 minutes in. The best scenes sadly are what is shown in the trailers. That being said. There is a romantic side to this story, as many movies have. It is a man with a rare blood condition, who is above averagely smart who happens upon a formula crossing the DNA of a Vampire Bat with that of a Human, causing a hybrid al a Bruce Banner/Hulk. Dr. Michael Mobius is able to take on supernatural/superhuman abilities such as flight, sonar, and strength, as long as he feeds on a blood substitute that is slowly losing its ability for him to survive without drinking human blood.

His one and only friend, a boy named Lucian ""Milo"" who happens to have the same type of blood issue as Morbius is his benefactor and pays for the controversial and state of the art treatments that leads to their mutual transformation into Vampire hybrids. And as any story arch goes, you have one who is good, and one who turns bad with the new found power. It then turns into a superhuman fight throughout new york with Morbius's love intrest getting caught up in the middle.","7"

The middle was interesting, even though foreseeable, but the ending sucks! The last 20 minutes destroyed the whole movie. Packed with over-the-top-action and in consequence boring somehow. A movie which is exchangeable to many other movies by its qualities. In the last 20 minutes it looked like they wouldn't know how to end it and stuff it with action to make an excuse of it. After that the last cheesy parts were unbearable. No! I don't like that. I'm a Marvel fan and was in a rush in the MCU by phase 1-4, which had a pretty awesome peak in 'Avengers: Endgame'. I also like the Marvel TV-series, at least most of them. But this movie is dull.","4"
"ObsessiveCinemaDisorder","An outdated and lackluster approach, falls under modern comic book movie standards.","29 May 2022","Morbius, the third entry in Sony's own Spider-man Universe, is a comic book movie out of the 90s Sam Raimi Spider-man era, like Daredevil or Ghost Rider.

Sony's unsophisticated approach leaves Morbius out of sync with modern blockbuster expectations. It adapts the bare minimum from its source material and instead the script draws a lot from horror films we've seen before.

Jared Leto, in his first leading man role in a blockbuster, shelves his headline-making method acting and plays it straight to a script that gives him nothing interesting to do, rendering a bland and humorless experience.

To say a few good things, the Morbius CGI make-up is well done as it allows the vampire look to change in various states of thirst. It visually shows Morbius' struggle controlling his thirst.

Michael Morbius and Milo's story begins in a promising manner. The character dynamic is borrowed from Park Chan-wook's Thirst, where a reluctant vampire creates a bloodthirsty vampire. However, Matt Sazama and Burk Sharpless' script never follows this friendship in earnest. The middle portion remixes ideas and scenes from other movies in a box-ticking manner, such as David Cronenberg's The Fly and Blade.

The script sinfully ends abruptly after its climax and is missing a satisfying resolution. Yes, Morbius defeated the villain but how does he truly come to terms with becoming a vampire? The movie provides no answer.

Finally, in the film's most cynical move, it immediately teases what's next with its two after-credit scenes. The first scene was expected but poorly written. The second scene made no sense at all and was like a studio exec puppeting the actors to say whatever he wants like Rick Moranis playing with action figures in Spaceballs.

If Sony chose to bring Tom Holland's Spider-man back into this Sony universe, I'd be scratching my head on how he would fit in with this roster of villains in tone. By giving each villain a solo outing, they've all become anti-heroes.

Sony's Venom movies, which are oddball buddy comedies, fared much better and can be enjoyed in a guilty pleasure trashy way purely from the silliness of watching Tom Hardy argue with himself. Ultimately, what sinks Morbius into being a dud is it's a lot of ""been there, done that"" and doesn't put anything interesting on the table.","5"

This was a great movie with action, betrayal and love. Besides that, I got my wife to watch a Marvel movie!! How great was that! The only reason she did is that she's a big Horror movie fan and she loves Vampire movies. I'll take it! Other Marvel movies, she rolls her eyes so hard I can actually hear them. Jared Leto played a wonderful addition to the Marvel universe, and I can't wait to see the sequel.

Though the story is quite similar to other superhero movies, this is honestly better than venom and the batman and even some mcu garbage like black panther and shangchi that gets a ridiculously high phony rating. Fairly speaking this should worth a 6+, which the rating again wrongly reflect on like most of the movies, as a lot the raters and critics are just a bunch of pretentious kids without much sense.","6"

Seems there's a lot of people who agree with me here on IMDB.

Absolutely worth a watch and a worthy addition not only to the Sony/Marvel franchise but also to the MCU and to super hero movies in general.

Jared Leto can act. This character may not be his most difficult role to conquer or even a very complex character, but his does well. A great choice of actor for the movie. I do hope they continue with Morbius in future movies.","8"

The antagonist went from nice guy to indiscriminate evil man child with absolutely no gradient in between it made my eyes roll into the back of my head.

Everything from plot points to character motives to Morbius' powers are so unexplained. I was lost literally 5 minutes in and it only got worse with every scene.

It's so thrown together it doesn't even feel like a real movie.

The film leaves you scratching your head for it's entire run time and then just ends in the most abrupt way I've ever seen. It's like the final act of the film was never filmed.

And with that everything that looked cool about the movie was cut. Vulture narrated the trailer and he's basically not in the film. Jokes are left literally incomplete.

No part of this movie is memorable other than what has already been memed to death.

Jared Leto and the actors did a job and said the lines with large amounts of normality. I will also point out that it was shot with cameras and the special effects were there. The antagonist was bad and opposed the main character. When Jared Leto said ""It's morbin time"" i knew this movie was a masterpiece, everybody at the theater screamed and cried tears of joy. I will say with ease that this is one of the films that was made and one that people watched. If I had to rate this movie from 1 to 10, I would.",NA

It's hilarious, but it's definitely not supposed to be. It's laughably edgy, and it takes itself far too seriously. The writing is baffling and convenient, and the combination of that with the abrupt editing means that things just happen with little reason, leaving you a bit confused.

One of the genuinely worst things about the movie is how boring it is to look at. The wonky CGI is quite funny, but when that's not around, everything is just bleak and has that sort of grey filter, like an episode of EastEnders.

Even with Matt Smith someone who I like even he couldn't shine in this movie.

I was intrigued that they brought Adrian Toomes in the credit scene we'll see what that brings.","3"
"GamieXP","A good beginning.","10 April 2022","Please bear in mind, this is my opinion which is subjective.

I fail to see where the critics can go so hard on this film if I am to be honest.

Let me begin by saying Leto does a good job with what he has been given, it's not a master piece but there aren't many of them around now days and given we live in a time where people love to hate on Sony or Leto - this film didn't stand a chance.

It's a good film, a good story & overall I love the character Morbius. Sony are trying their hardest to create something of their own which will always prove to be difficult when they're essentially in their own world away from Disney.

I do think if you pitted Leto's Morbius against Tom Hollands Spiderman then we would have a great film on our hands. For us to get such a blockbuster it would mean Sony admitting defeat & essentially signing all of these characters over which is never going to happen.... So a Disney PlayStation 6 is more likely if I'm honest...

This film is good, it has good moments, the on screen effects are next to non, they display his powers in a cohesive way which keeps it interesting I just fail to see how RT have given this a 17% score when it honestly deserves a 70% at minimum but as I said, most fans who don't understand the contractual constraints Morbius has against it (Sony/Disney malarkey) a lot of fans will be wondering why they don't tie this in and why they don't mention Spideys latest fight instead they're in their own pocket universe with their hands tied behind their back.

A good film, well worth the watch & I would watch again - Yes.

"kobemackenzie","Morbius did not need a movie.","13 July 2022","Morbius is about Dr. Michael Morbius who looks for a cure for a rare blood disease that he and his best friend are suffering from only that the cure he makes turns him into a vampire. Morbius did not have a great story. It is engaging but unfortunately it really falls flat. The movie does have some great special effects and CGI use. But the thing that was upsetting was that there were so much stuff in the trailer that got people really hyped then the movie came out and it had none of that stuff which wrecked the movie. The main villain is not at all scary, menacing, intimidating or terrifying he was pretty lame but funny! The side characters also had nothing to do in the movie it's like the Director didn't know what to do with them so they are kinda just there.

Jared Leto takes on the role of Morbius and I am not a fan of him at all but he does to a good job playing Morbius playing the sick man who has hope for a cure then playing a man that is scared of what he became well also playing a monster. Matt Smith plays Morbius's best friend and main villain he does make him charming and funny but not much else. Tyrese Gibson plays a cop who has nothing to do in the movie he is just there. And Adria Arjona plays the love interest she is the only other character in the movie that is interesting and has some character development.

"noxaman","An odd case.","9 April 2023","Morbius is one of those rare films that has such a bad reputation that upon actually watching, I was surprised by how completely palatable (if not bland) it turned out to be. I kept waiting for ""that scene"" which would explain all the hate, or the endless memes, but it never came.

Unfortunately there was never any point where the film grabbed my attention either, despite some top-shelf visual effects. The villain's origin and motivation made sense, but were somehow shallow compared to the protagonist, and the ultimate conflict between them was more of a plot contrivance than anything character-driven.

Morbius is not a film I regret watching, but it's certainly not one that I will return to view again.

"siderite","Simply a bad movie, bland and pointless","31 May 2022","Some people love to see a Marvel film fail, some dislike Jared Leto and some are offended by something in the film. However, the film is certainly not something to hate or is in any other way special. It is a formula film with cardboard characters that no amount of acting could have saved. And they used the wrong formula, too. It is totally forgettable, in a way that makes me work to remember what it was about, minutes after seeing it.

But it's easy to see how this came about. It's an Avi Arad production, who has been working in the Marvel universe for his entire producer career and had some successes, but the large majority of his work is of the same kind: targeting the widest tier of the audience, uselessly over the top, badly written, low budget (or better said: wasted budget) and underusing their cast. The end credits (not the scenes, the actual credits) say it all: a total of 6 actors that have any relevance to the story, then minutes and minutes of scrolling for ""the team"" which includes every single union person that threw a glance towards the studio lot. This film isn't for you, it's by the masses, for the masses. The movie itself is little more (or less, qualitatively) than a play with a lot of CGI thrown in.

I actually feel bad for Leto. In this film he was subdued, reasonable, playing ""the doctor"" perfectly and abstaining from the wild shenanigans he is infamous for. The other Jared, Mr. Harris, who I admire as an actor had a few scenes as a very secondary character. Do you see Michael Keaton in the cast? That's because he appears in post ending scenes, to hint at a future story combining The Vulture and Morbius. And Matt Smith... in the Dr. Who series playing a different kind of Doctor, much maligned because he was coming to replace the marvelous David Tennant. He was actually a fantastic Dr. Who, compared to most, and here he is reduced to a mindless beast with a complete lack of self control.

Where is the story? There is none. From the nonsensical start scene to the ending that screams ""Sorry! Next one is going to have Keaton in it! It will be good!"", the plot is as linear and predictable as they can be. I mean, comic stories are usually trash, but this one isn't even special enough to warrant ridicule. It's just bland and featureless and pointless.

Bottom line: from the producer of Blade, with the budget of Disney Marvel and with a cast that could have achieved almost anything, comes a movie about a day walking vampire that has no story, no acting, no soundtrack, no blood, no sense and provides no reason to ever watch it.","6"

"rchosen-193-5535","Movie was not good or bad. Just felt like it existed and no real other feelings.","18 May 2022","First off I love my comics. But I never got into Morbius stuff. Felt to cliché for a character. I skipped the movie at the theaters because people said it was bad. As always it was comic lovers of him saying it was bad because it wasn't like the comics. Which shouldn't matter in a movie.

So I finally seen the movie and I have to say, it was not as bad as I thought it would be. Leto did a great job in his role. However the movie didn't really give me any emotions while watching. Even after the end I was like ""Hmm"" and that was it.

It felt out of for a Marvel movie. The story wasn't all that appealing. As with the same reason I didn't care about the comic, vampire stuff is just always the same. The pacing also felt really off too. The only things that I even cared about were the credit scenes. If Morbius never appeared again I probably wouldn't even remember he existed in a movie.

While vampires are kind of repetitive, I still am looking forward to Blade. Who is WAY more interesting then Morbious seems to be. I am curious how the two may fit together in the MCU given they both have the same vampire theme going.

Again, Leto's acting was great. But the movie just felt lifeless to me. Instead of paying to rent it, maybe just borrow it from your local library instead. I have no interest in watching it again nor do I want to see any bonus features usually on a disc.","6"

"atasahakyan","Not the best MARVEL movie but not the worst either","8 April 2022","There were few down moments that I was like what? But overall I really enjoyed it. The visual was stunning. One advise to people who go too deep in the story. Don't look for logic or perfectly reasonable stories, just enjoy the amazing visual effects and the graphic. Really was fun. I don't care the story.","10"
"vengeance20","It's Average","2 April 2022","So, from hearing about this Film I wasn't in any hurry to watch as previous films of the DC/MCU Universe haven't been great. But from seeing the scathing reviews left, right & center, made me think this probably wasn't going to be too bad. I was sort of right.

The film sees Morbius trying to find a cure for his illness via creating artificial blood, but the side effects are far more devastating than he could've imagined as the new blood turns him into a blood thirsty Vampire. So, while trying to find a way to reverse the effects he simultaneously has to stop his friend with the same illness he has from causing havoc across the city after he himself is injected with the same artificial blood specimen.

I found the film to be average. It's not amazing & is quite dull, hollow & soulless in a couple of areas which makes for a sort of mundane viewing. Saying that though, the story is simple, the action is pretty good if not as bout as average as it comes with super hero films & action films in general. The effects are pretty good also & the film has a great runtime of 1 hour & 33 minutes, 1 hour & 37 minutes including the mid & end credit scenes. The pacing wasn't too bad, if not a bit slow. The violence & gore could've been better as with the characters who felt flat & cardboard.

Overall, it's average. It's not nearly as bad as what critics are saying. You'll enjoy it for what it is & should be enjoyed for that reason. Give it a watch, trust me.

5/10.","5"

"yusufmusaji","Easy watch nothing spectacular","17 July 2022","The storyline seemed like a below par story written by an inexperienced writer. It lacked depth and the film seemed too rushed. The character development couldn't progress because the film skipped major scenes. The film was easy to watch and the cinematic effects were well developed. There seems to be several hit and miss with Marvels recent films especially when introducing new characters.","7"
"jozzcooper-531-406397","Gave it a 10 because there is no 11","5 June 2022","When I think of how I felt the first time I saw the Seven Samurai, how my first viewing of Casablanca moved me, and the seemingly incomparable experience of watching 12 Angry Men for the first time, I realize now that those were just so-so moments since the release of Morbius.

This film broke the curve on IMDB's top 100 list. The list is now called Morbius and some other films you might like here and there. Certified Fresh on RT is now changed to 'Roughly 1/4 as good as Morbius'.

Agatha Christie was asked what it was like to be named a Dame of the British Empire and she said, ""pretty nice, but I won't live long enough to see Morbius, so everything else pales beside that.""

James Hetfield was asked how he felt to walk out on stage in front of 1.3M fans. He said, ""man, we were Morbin'!""

I can say I have seen this movie over 150,000 times. That's in my imagination, but it's the same thing. I mean people were acting, they had things like lighting and sets. You won't find that every day. Something to experience, I can only imagine. Honestly, this is my favorite of all the movies I have never seen, and I don't say that lightly. I urge you to go out and not see this film today. You'll thank me later.","10"

"cinemapersonified","Terrible Movie","13 June 2023","Rating: 1.0 Overall, one of the worst movies ever created with how much money was put into this and the output they got as there is not a single good thing to say about this movie (and I really hope nobody has to go through the struggle of having to see it, even for the meme).

Terrible Direction (I do not understand how someone could do this bad of a job at directing, it was as if every scene was off and there was no consistent tone of style the director wanted to go for), Very Bad Acting (Pretty Bad to Bad from Jared Leto (A performance that had so many questions overall with what he was doing as it was very over-the-top/forced and not well executed (but he did show moments where he is someone who can act (its just that that was not the majority of the film))), Terrible to Very Bad from Matt Smith (His performance was just borderline annoying and really did not help with being the foil/villain to Morbius, it was just hard to believe overall cause of how questionable it was), Bad from Adria Arjona (She did have some range of emotion, but this did not save her from giving a phone-in performance that really did not play that much to the story at all as a love-interest), Pretty Bad from Jared Harris (His performance was actually the best because of how bad everyone else was, he really just was a neutral character that did not provide any value with what he did), Terrible to Very Bad from Al Madrigal (He just did not match the tone of the movie because he tried to be funny when it was serious and vice versa, and because of this his performance just felt so off and was hard to watch at times (so this bad performance maybe just a by-product of the movie being bad and inconsistent)), Very Bad to Bad from Tyrese Gibson (He just lacked any effort as it felt very phoned-in and effortless when he was trying to be serious and find truth), Terrible from the rest of the cast), Terrible Story (There is just so many jumps and assumptions made to the audience that the story does not come together at all (this can be especially be seen as Morbius just knows he has these powers without even showing us how he got them); also, there is just so many plot holes and boring moments that the writing really shows how bad it is), Terrible Screenplay (The dialogue is horrible and so unnatural that its borderline laughable that someone actually wrote this; also, the attempts at humor were so bad as it just left awkward silence rather than having the audience laugh; moreover, the character writing is terrible as you do not care about any of the characters introduced in this movie), Bad Score (it is just so poorly used and written as serious themes play during comedic moments and vice versa; also the score is just so loud at times that you can barely hear the dialogue), Terrible Cinematography (It felt like a fan made movie with how shaky and amateur the cinematography was), Bad Sound (It was so poorly mixed that I could barely hear the characters as times), Bad Editing (the actual different cuts and transitions between scenes was so poorly done it felt like this movie was made in Windows movie maker), Terrible Visual Effects (it was over-saturated throughout the entire movie and just felt extremely cartoony at times), Plot Structure was really poorly laid out as it spent no time in its exposition and developing the character to where once the climax comes the audience is just so confused with how Morbius got his powers and developed as a character; also there is no exposition as the movie just ends on a cliffhanger, Pacing was incredible fast and mismanaged to the point where the movie is incredibly short and there are so many questions left when the movie ended (if the movie was good I would have wanted to have seen like 30-40 more minutes, but I would not wish anyone to see 30-40 minutes more of this movie), Build to climax is nonexistent as we just get there with no background with how we are there; climax was horribly executed as we find out we were in the climax after the movie ends; also the actual fighting and over-saturation of CGI made it so boring and hard to watch, Tone was incredibly inconsistent as the moments where it was meant to be funny it tries to be serious and vice-versa (it was as if the director had no idea what type of movie he wanted to create), This movie is not bad to where it is funny it is just bad to where it is just so interesting how it even go made.","1"
"veritybingo","Dracula 2.0","15 May 2022","What irritates me about the MCU is, apart from having to remember the plots & characters of 87 other films to follow any one storyline coherently, there is also a blaséness and complete lack of awe or amazement in anyone, namely civilians. Why would anything be surprising if you live in a world of superheroes, aliens & magic?

That's why this movie is more watchable than other outings, as it chooses to ignore or neglect to mention its cinematic counterparts, making it more a self-contained stand alone movie. Some may scoff at the scientific creation of vampirism, discarding the mythology and lore, but one does not necessarily cancel the other.

Matt Smith is quite effective in his villainous turn, and it has a certain dark atmosphere that helps, even if it may evoke similarities to other films.","6"

With some shots reminiscent of The Matrix and the Tobey Maguire Spider-Man trilogy, amazing graphics, and a great plot and cast, Morbius delivers completely. I don't know what the critics are saying-they tend to be off with movies anyway. One of them rated Turning Red higher than any other movie they'd ever seen, like Scream, The Batman, Ghostbusters Afterlife, A Quiet Place, which were amazing movies and Turning Red was a pile of crap. Morbius is an amazing movie that had feels from every genre- like The Sixth Sense was. Little bit gorey and a bit shaky at times with the camera, but those are the only not amazing parts of the film.

To be honest, early in the story, there are dumb bits - a kid replaces a blown fuse with a spring from a pen, immediately recognised as ""gifted""? Then, a scene where Morbius simply put 2 vials of the most dangerous serum that turns human to super vampire, on the table just like that. I mean, he should have hidden them somewhere safe and secure!

The rest of the movie, is, rather good. And Jared's acting is on point. Not great, but not bad either. Matt Smith's acting as a villain is more prominent, I have to be honest.

The CGI, is also NOT THAT BAD. Acceptable to me, not sure what others are talking about.

Action packed, well choreographed fight scenes, and good continuity. Effects that aren't too over the top, and balanced with a good story.

Obviously Morbius won't top The Avengers but I'd definitely say this movie is even better than Wonder Woman 1984. Worth to watch for all Marvel fans.","7"

"view_and_review","Generic","13 September 2022","They said it was bad. I didn't listen. Now I agree. Am I sorry I watched? No. I'm one of those who has to see for himself. Furthermore, I've seen worse.

Michael Morbius (Jared Leto) suffered from a rare blood disease which required him to get blood transfusions several times a week (or several times a day I can't remember). The disease was so debilitating he and his good friend Milo (Matt Smith) had to walk with crutches and they weren't expected to live long.

Morbius was a genius who developed synthetic blood. This allowed him to get transfusions more often and it helped save many other lives. Still, he was on a quest to find a cure for his ailment, and he saw bats as an answer.

After experimenting with bat blood, he developed a serum that he figured would cure him. While it cured his disease and made him a superhero of sorts, it also made him bloodthirsty and he had to satisfy the bloodlust every so many hours or he would revert back to his sick self but worse.

Why was it bad though?

It was too generic. Generic bad guys, a generic means to superhuman powers, and a generic villain. Nothing about it was special, unique, or worth watching. It was entirely too predictable and entirely too much CGI. Maybe saying entirely too much CGI isn't correct because just about all action movies are CGI heavy nowadays. I mean entirely too much bad CGI.

Lending their talents to this weak comic book movie were Jared Harris and Tyrese Gibson of note. I wasn't familiar with the female lead, Adria Arjona. She was more-or-less the love interest even though she was also a doctor.

I think superhero movies are getting lazy. They dominate the box office so much I don't think they even try anymore. They pretty much produce a lackluster film and slap Marvel or DC on it and watch the hordes of fans come in. I'm one of those fans though I did not watch this in theater nor the latest Thor movie. More and more I'm finding easier to wait for them to be on Disney+ or Netflix.","5"

Because you will never get that, with any Marvel or DC Comics movie, so if it's that they are searching for I would just stop watching any of those movies. And even if this character isn't like the comic book does it really matter? I only want to be entertained and Morbius is certainly entertaining. Decent CGI's, good acting and a story that is easy to follow. I thought Jared Leto and Matt Smith did a good job playing their characters.

If you're a big fan of the MCU, then be sure to watch this movie. Yeah facts are really good. But the plot twist is pretty generic: what does a good guy do when he gets powers that make him a bad guy? There's not a lot of originality as the answer that question but the movie isn't. ""bad""! Just understand that it is almost 100% origin story so don't expect a big complex plot or narrative. I like the two leads, especially the ""bad guy"" - but who IS the ""bad"" guy!? : ) Not sure if the movie did well enough that we'll see a sequel, but this character deserves to be given another story, so that we see him become Morbius!","7"
"Steve9920","I did not rush to see it, neither should you.","16 October 2023","Cards on the table, I am a big superhero film fan, but I have been pretty much vampired and zombied out in these two genres.

But eventually I gave Morbius a shot, not expecting much, and it delivered not much, in spades.

Good aspects were some of the effects. Slo mo snapping to still shots produced an effective comic book feel in places, along with some nice framing and close cropped shots. The thumping bass, heart beat like soundtrack was a nice and appropriate touch I thought.

The bad aspects were mainly in the writing, uninvolving characters ( the detectives ) , lame love interest, forced rivalry between the two main protagonists, lack of any real villain, the only motivation/aim was to get blood. Its a vampire yarn, but really, a conflicting/perilous story arc would have added some interest.

"zilika-53681","MORBIUS CHANGED MY LIFE","10 May 2022","THIS MOVIE CHANGE MY LIFE, where to begin, with fantastic acting, a plethora of greatly talented actors, a score that rivals Hans Zimmer, CGI on par with Marvel quality films and a narrative so coherently and immersive that it puts great superhero films like the Batman trilogy to shame.

Jared Leto and Matt Smith are the perfect duo, their chemistry is clear as day and in my experience no other actors come close. Their friendship can truly be felt as if it two real friends were going through turmoil.

The soundtrack of Morbius were like the final bells ringing the end of school, every sound and each song is carefully crafted to convey the most captivating emotion, each symphony forcefully releases dopamine from my mind and I can not get enough of this film. To match this, CGI constructed to such perfection that it brought tears to my eyes every single instance Morbius would 'morb out' and go savage on his enemies, his ability to carefully plan out strategies and execute them flawlessly, clearly connotes an ability that would rival the likes of Thanos.

Narrative, never in my existence have I sat through 104 minutes of pure bliss, everything makes sense, everything happens for a reason, and everything has consequences. It is not just a movie, It is perfection on screen.

I am vividly awaiting Morbius 2 and am thoroughly excited to witness him morb out on his enemies, once again!

"Catocala","A huge disappointment with the personality of a cardboard cutout","30 October 2022","I was looking forward to Morbius so much! I love vampire movies and I love superhero movies: what could go wrong? Well, pretty much everything... The story, the action (or lack thereof), the main character, the villain, the side characters, the CGI, the script, the lack of a real plot; literally everything was so poorly done, it was sad to watch.

The story was completely lackluster: scientist gone awry because he has a rare disease that he will fix by splicing his DNA with bat DNA. Sure. You gotta come up with something to kick off the whole vampire shtick, it's a forgivable flaw. But then the vampire looks ridiculous! Everything looks so computer animated that Pixar would be jealous. O yeah, he moves so fast that he leaves a cloud of colorful farts behind. Why? Nobody knows! It just looks absurd, nothing to do with vampires and to top it off, it isn't remotely scary. In short, you have a main character and a predictable villain who are supposed to look super badass and be scary, but instead they might as well have worn a tutu and a tophat.

One of the main shortcomings was that nothing made sense. Every single character just does something out of nowhere for the sake of absolutely nothing. All the characters are flatter than a coin. A villain being bad just for the sake of being bad. A romance that is super forced and without any use in the story. The presence of mercenaries on a boat in the middle of the fricking ocean, that only has two scientists on it. Come on! Seriously, why would you literally bring professional killers on a boat when you need no defense from anything or anyone? And why would they instantly turn on you when there is no money to be made from that? How do you know all these mercenaries in the first place when you're just a scientist? At least TRY to come up with some motive!

Also forgivable, because we are going to see some awesome vampire rampage right? Guess again: the actual action is 100% abscent throughout the film. They tried (and failed) to cover up this weird choice by an overload of Matrix-like slow motion scenes, dodging a few bullets even. That's about as much action you will get to see in that 1,5 hour of your life that you wasted. It is completely baffeling that they chose to make a vampire/superhero movie while leaving out any realistic fights. Are they trying to cater to children and not allowed to show actual violence? Especially if nothing else interesting is going on, at least make it entertaining!

The story is downright superficial and feels as if the writers didn't even care about their own movie. It's as though superhero movies nowadays just use the same old tired formula and throw a lot of money around to make yet another disappointing movie devoid of any real feeling. As long as it bring in the cash, I guess. It is just such a waste of money, time and effort, when it has so much potential to actually be something so awesome and instead becomes something so soulless and unremarkable.","4"
"Zac_La_Porte","Really Needs Bloodier Action and Better Screenwriting","9 April 2022","For Venom and Marvel fans who love CGI action, Morbius is a total blast! To be practical though, it'll probably go down as one of the worst Marvel movies that have been designed and shot for many noticeable reasons. Everybody just seems to miss the fact that it's reasonably entertaining, and the action sequences are consuming with jump-scares and vampire-themed chases.

The specific problem with the bloodsucking action scenes that eventually lower the enjoyment of the movie are all the moments where the blood is kept at a mild limit. This was obviously done to avoid a more mature rating so there would be more audiences in the theatres, but seriously, bloody superhero-related movies like Deadpool and Logan usually deserve more credit and fame. It doesn't get anywhere more violent than Venom, but the CGI work is still worth going to the cinemas for.

When you're watching it, a lot of the details and themes make it obvious that the actual execution with decent direction, cinematography, editing and sound is what's surprisingly done well. Reading it as a book or something, it has an extremely flat idea for the story and the screenwriting is just terrible. Jared Leto is an excellent vampire-superhero and Matt Smith is equally as brilliant in the opposite-to-the-protagonist role, but they truly deserve to participate in better material.

"aaronjconroy","Nowhere near as bad as people make it out to be.","9 April 2022","Let's be honest, people just want to be popular and hating on Jared Leto, no matter what the man does, gives people those likes and reacts. In reality, he's quite a talented and diverse actor but the script for the movies is what let's him down. Side note, Joker should never have been in Suicide Squad, he is not part of it. Morbius is nice easy to watch short Marvel film. Nothing spectacular, but also nothing as boring and pretentious as Eternals. The movie has an easy to follow story, some light bits of comedy, a love interest, and some fight scenes like any other Marvel movie. You don't need to invest too much into this to enjoy it. My only criticism is during the flying scenes the effects are a bit jarring to watch. Other than that I liked Leto and Matt Smiths performance in this movie. A nice and simple 6.5/7 out of 10 movie.","7"
"migellepatterson","Good vampire film","1 April 2022","Morbius is pretty good I liked it! It's a very safe origin film for the character and all the Easter eggs from the trailer was there and end credit scenes which I won't spoil, Acting was also spoiled! It's not a blow you mind film the FX are similar to dracula untold but it's a solid safe character arc of the Michael morbius character and how he gets his vampire powers and why.","7"

"cgvsluis","Truly terrible entry in the Marvel Universe.","26 October 2022","This was a decent film with a plot until about a third of the way through the film when it became utterly boring and predictable. Oh! And did I mention nonsensical? It was interesting how Morbius had a plan to kill the bad guy and himself...but then he doesn't follow through with his plan. Rules are not explained for those who aren't plugged in to the whole Marvel Universe which is unfortunate and alienating if they are hoping to get new audience members. And finally it ends with teasers for the next movie...which I for one have no intention of watching.

This is the story of a prize-winning research scientist who has been looking for the cure for some mysterious and unexplained disease that he and his somehow obscenely wealthy childhood friend and now patron. He sort of finds a cure, but it has the side-effect of causing him to crave blood...which he uses his own invented fake blood but it is lasting a shorter and shorter time. He can't control it, so he doesn't want to give it to his friend...so his friend steels it. And then, we'll you know the rest or you can have a nap like I wanted to do.

Instead I hung on till the bitter end when a whole new character is introduced. Talk about shamelessly shilling for the next film!

Not a recommendation from me and probably for a reason for me to never watch another Marvel production.","1"
"LegendsofHorror","Movie Review: MORBIUS (2022)","24 April 2022","In October of 1971, the anti-hero then villain Morbius was debuted in The Amazing Spider-Man #101. This is when the world was introduced to Dr. Michael Morbius who over the years has developed quite the following, even when teaming up with Spidey, Blade, Dr. Strange and many others but eventually returning to his darker roots. This introduced the world to one of the most brutal killers that ever graced the MARVEL pages, from 1974-75 he would get his own book and over a period of 16 years would be a guest in various books up until 1993. The summer of '93 ""Rise of the Midnight Sons"" crossover story arc which ran for 32 issues reintroduced the world to his vampiric charm.

Now we fast forward to 2022, where superheroes are a dime a dozen but still have the going power to fill seats. As Vampire films are a popular sub category in the horror genre, it seems that Morbius will fit right in as a multifaceted superhero feature, sadly only as a PG-13 entry and running at 104 minutes. After my first initial viewing, I was excited to see one of my favourite characters come to life on the big screen but, after a second watch I did notice not one or two but several discrepancies that bordered on ""camp"". I also had some issues with his origins and even a slight bit confusing post scene which I will address without taking anything way from the film itself.

Dr. Michael Morbius, is played by noneother than the multi-talented indie film favourite Jared Leto who is in his first ever big budget starring role. Leto who is also a vampire enthusiast, also plays the dual role of a producer in the film as well. Another star of the film is noneother than ""The Doctor"" himself, Matt Smith (Doctor Who & The Crown) who plays Morbius' best friend ""Milo"". Jared Harris known for his roles in such TV and Film hits as (Sherlock Holmes and The Crown) plays Dr. Emil Nicholas who helped raise and care for both ""Milo"" and Morbius during their early years. Adria Arjona plays his fiancée and lab assistant, Martine Bancroft. The film starts out with a much older Morbius in South America seeking the cure for his illness, which involves a plethora of vampire bats and a blade across the palm. Its a quick intro, which I personally thought should have been placed elsewhere in the film. We are then introduced to a young Michael Morbius, sick and bedridden. This is also where his life takes a turn when he meets his new bed fellow ""Milo"", who becomes his best friend. During this time, we begin to see the brilliance that young Morbius has even though his illness is a major influence he pushes on through the bullying and the isolation. His friendship with ""Milo"" blossoms until he is taken to a school for the gifted, the two stay in touch as Michael continues learning and slowly becomes a highly respected and Nobel Prize-winning biologist specializing in the field of human and animal biology with a medical degree in hematology. By this time, he has been introduced to the beautiful and equally brilliant , Martine Bancroft who works alongside him trying to find the cure that is slowly killing both Michael and ""Milo"". As the story drives on, a cure seems to be close at hand ergo we sync back up to the opening sequence and are now all caught up with the origin of how and why.

Now, once the action kicked in...the Vampire in me smiled and began to get invested. The CGI was done well, although I am a fan of practical effects I feel that they nailed the look and the mannerisms of Morbius as ""The Living Vampire"". The Venom-isque fighting scenes were cool to see but I think they relied too much on the CGI for the vampire sequences and should have focused more on Leto's performance and allowed the audience to see where he wanted to take us the viewers. Something else that as a horror fan that I personally got a kick out of was the ""easter eggs"" from different classic vampire films that were placed throughout the film. I think the villain even though he was created especially for the film, was a bit too campy. He did have his moments and had a cool vampire look.

I personally feel the backstory was rushed, especially the childhood and the exclusion of certain characters and the addition of others was in no way needed and honestly it felt like the writers really didn't get or like the original source material. This is a dark story, it always has been and trying to make it a PG-13 when SONY and MARVEL's Deadpool had a Rated R, so why would a horror not be? The film took two years to film and they had members of Ridley Scott's team and the team who worked on the CGI for the Avengers films and it shows that there was heart put into it. And I honestly loved this film but it just rushed altogether and ends a bit short.

As I said before the end post scene that included Michael Keaton is overtly confusing (as Leto himself publicly hinted at the Sinister Six) as the original members were subdued and ""converted"" in ""Spiderman - No Way Home"". As all comic book fans know Morbius himself had NOTHING to do with the Six, so I suppose we will have to see exactly what SONY has in mind. They also poke fun at Venom at one point in the film, which was fun but weird. Its so fast, if you don't listen for it you could miss it. I personally would love to see a ""Midnight Suns"" Trilogy if they could team up again with MARVEL and grab some loaner characters that would make for a awesome story arc.

All in all, I enjoyed sinking my teeth into this incarnation of one of MARVEL's Anti-heroes. I have already pre-ordered my copy and you should too. Its great fun and a worthy addition to the Spidey-Verse collection as well as your horror movie Vampire collection, I mean let's face it Jared Leto makes for one badass and sexy vampire.","7"
"sbweightman","What a flop","1 April 2022","A flat film with a dull plot which barely explored the idea of wrestling the beast within and did the bare minimum of explaining the characters and the plot. It's very visually stylish during the action scenes, but there's so many effects it obscures the action and the still/slow motion scenes add little to it. The characters are weak, the plot is cliché and has holes, the editing is choppy, there's an unfunny cop duo who I presume were supposed to be some sort of comic relief, and an anticlimactic ending. Add in 2 pointless post credit scenes and you have a poor movie through and through.","2"

With Morbius everyone expected a level of production over Underworld 3 Evolution (2006), but as we know nowdays it's impossible for a studio like Marvel to make such prolonged production with much more technical resources than just CGI.

I think most of fans of Marvel's Morbius are long matured, but they got a movie for kids. Also the vampire theme is old enough and it should've delivered something surprising...","10"

He did so well dodging the bullets. Also the scene in the movie where the one fortnite skin comes in was cool. He was a detective and was good and his job because he found Morbius.

Venom was questionable but was saved by some great humour. This lacks the humour.

It's a total mess.

And... the truly worst part is the end credit sequence where Sony is so intent on getting us to the Sinister Six that we're supposed to accept that Morbius would willingly team up with Adrian Toomes (aka the Vulture) against a teenage kid he's never heard of let alone met (Spider-Man)... truly terrible.","3"

A one point two characters with no previous sense of having romantic feelings begin to make out. It was so dumb. There are plenty of unintentionally funny scenes, mostly involving Tyrese Gibson and his terrible acting. The end credits make zero sense. A fair amount of people booed at the end.

"acesandalchemy","Avoid This Disaster of a Film","4 April 2022","Morbius is bad. No worse than that. It is an unredeemable pile of garbage. Why? The list of reasons is lengthy, but here are a few highlights:

1. Morbius is Boring: How do you make vampire superheroes boring? HOW???

2. Ridiculously Inaccurate Science: It's a superhero movie, I accept garbage science and barely blink most of the time. The problem is when you mix basic facts from the real world with your fantasy science in completely ridiculous ways. For example, vampire bats are described as being capable of taking down mammals ten times their size. That is simply not what a vampire bat does at all.

3. CGI: One of the worst uses of CGI in the history of the MCU. They borrowed the flight smoke effect from Harry Potter (that smoke you see when evil wizards are flying), changed the color of the smoke, and left it everywhere. Smoke trails over here. Smoke trails over there. No reason for the smoke trails, but let's just have them anyway. Notably, they don't seem to appear when vampires are seemingly teleporting between places, or being stealthy, but anytime there is a fight *bam* smoke. I can just imagine the director, ""This is a nice fight scene, but you know what it really needs? More smoke!""

4. Incomprehensible Fight Choreography: Vampire vs. Vampire fights should be amazing. They should be interesting. They should be fast and slick and filled with opportunities for clever action sequences. Instead, almost everything is left to the imagination because the camera cuts away from every blow, or the entire screen is just covered in smoke trails (MORE SMOKE), or the fight just makes no since from a physics point of view - like a slow blow somehow throws a character 40 feet across screen.

5. Giant Plotholes: How did you get off the boat? Why do you not try to clear your name? Etc. Etc.

And I could go on... at no point was this anything other than a train wreck.","1"

"PerryAtTheMovies","""Morbius"" the lax vampire....","1 April 2022","6.3/10

I don't know anything about ""Morbius"", but I was expecting, more. It was entertaining, but it took a long time to be so. The story was alright and seemed to jump around in a weird order. I felt lost a few times trying to figure where in the story I was. At one hour and forty-five minutes, the timing felt way too long. I got bored and by the time the parts that seemed to give the movie substance, I was over it and couldn't wait for the film to end. I also disliked the whole villain aspect. He never seemed convincing and lacked any true hate for the character.

The only reason I can justify giving this film a six is because visually the film was awesome, the sound along with the score was incredible, and the use of echolocation in the characters was interesting.

Overall, I would recommend seeing this film on cheap night, or possibly even waiting for it to home release. The base of the film was good, but it failed to grasp any true traction. The length of the film would've been good if the story was actually interesting. Visually stunning and the soundtrack was actually amazing.

Thank you for taking the time to read my review and I hope it helps you make a decision on it.

Until next time.... Enjoy the show!","6"
"Kazombie","Do not believe the fake votes. This is a solid action film.","21 May 2022","I do not understand the hate. First off, I'm a DC fan and I know there are millions of Marvel fanboys who like to pointlessly bash anything that comes from DC.

Second, I do not like most of the bubblegum movies that MCEU produces. This is not based on bias but purely on my taste in movies and story telling.

Now that that's out of the way, let's talk about Morbius. This is a solid action film with great action sequences throughout. The story is great and takes the time to build the characters that we feel for. Jared Leto has done a wonderful job with the character. Finally he shines here unlike his portrayal of the Joker (for whatever reason).

The relationship between Morbius and the scientist was very shallow and uninteresting. Matt Smith was the saving grace in all scenes he was in, and the relationship portrayed between Morbius and him was lovely. And that's it. That's one of the few things that was entertaining to watch.

This story seems very boring to me, since it is basically the same plot as Venom, there are not many changes, and the ones that exist are very bad, the antagonist has very little development and does not have a credible reason to be like that, it is not possible to observe the fights, and the whole plot is predictable. The few things to highlight are some performances and some slow-motion scenes, although these have spent a big part of the budget and do not add much to the plot or to the visual aspect.

It is another movie that shows that vampire movies have no salvation or redemption, it is totally forgettable, not even the post credits scene could save it.","2"
"alain-leccia","Don't believe the negative reviews","3 April 2022","Morbius is not a masterpiece and it never intended to be one. It is a fun, well directed film that takes the bet to explore a more mature, horror like universe and it's truly refreshing. Jared Leto nails his role and the action is well choreographed. It's pure entertainment and it gives a good glimpse at what an Amazing Spider-man 3 could be. Now I know it's definitely not what the other marvel movies are but in my opinion it is much better than the Venom movies and it manages to tell a good story from beginning to end. And I'm myself surprised to write a good review about this film for I never thought it would be that good judging the reviews saying the movie doesn't offer anything and gosh, I'm so happy I went to verify that myself. The movie again is far from being a Spider-man No Way Home but it truly manages to never be boring and brings tension like no other Sony/Marvel film before. To understand why the reviews are negative, you need to watch the post credit scenes because yes... They don't make any sense but... It can be corrected and honestly, it doesn't stop the film from its success in being a pure entertainment product. So, yes, don't believe the negative reviews and ratings because if you're looking for a fun film for your Saturday night, it may be worth it and you won't regret making your own opinion about this movie that I judge ballsy and fun.","8"

There are few words to describe the havoc that this movie is, there is no characterization of the characters, the scenes that should be tragic are not precisely because they do not tell you anything about the characters, the fight scenes are a unique confusion, the CGI is good in some places while in others it seems that they have applied filters of Instagram, the music is apt nothing to say but not memorable and the moments of slow motion personally I enjoyed them only during the fight scenes too bad that you do not understand anything anyway. These were the main flaws but let's not forget the two biggest flaws, the post-credits scene and the terrible resemblance to Venom 2. The post-credits scene is meaningless and confuses the average viewer even more, instead I noticed that in some parts, especially a small twist towards the end, the movie is very but very similar to Venom 2 the only difference is that in this movie there are no bad jokes. I'm afraid of the next Sony products, this movie was a pure disappointment and you can see that it was the product of a thousand changes in progress, I remember that the first trailer dates back almost 3 years ago and in all this time they have done nothing but make more confusion within the film.","3"

The action director or whatever must have been slacking or something, because there was no effort given there.

Characters are completely one note. Morbius: cursed good guy, Doctor Lady: moves plot forward, Bad guy: be bad, Cops: absolutely useless, Father: also useless. At least this movie is short, it just ends abruptly. One of those tokyo ghoul or dune type endings.

Please, don't waste your time watching this movie. Pick any other movie on Netflix or whatever and watch that instead.","1"
"srawrats","It's really not that bad, actually a pretty good story and I enjoyed it.","3 April 2022","This movie is not nearly as bad as some reviews are saying, it was better than I expected. It told the story of Dr. Michael Morbius and how he ended up like he is, I thought it was good at doing that. I can say this is not Leto's best, I feel he could have done better to add to the character, in fact all the acting was a little bland, like nobody was into it. So maybe it could have been better with a different director, sometimes you can feel when a director just doesn't get the best out of the actors, I felt that. With that said, it was still an enjoyable movie for me, and I think non comic book fans with zero expectation will enjoy this even more. Some people were expecting way too much out of this movie and probably wouldn't be happy unless Spider-Man showed up. I mean we are talking Morbius, and I thought this was better than the last Venom which just blew the Carnage appearance. This movie had little to work with and did better.

This was a fine set up movie for Morbius, obviously there is more to come, maybe a movie in alternate universe with an Andrew Garfield Spider-Man and Tom Hardy Venom. I do think this will be the last standalone movie for Morbius, but who knows.","7"
"marioalvarezpineda","Unpopular Opinion","6 April 2022","I loved the movie. I saw the ratings beforehand and thought it would suck and surprise surprise it is mostly just butthurt ""fans"" of Marvel who will hate anything that is not Iron Man and CGI. Jared Leto was born for this role. He played Morbius almost to perfection. The only thing I didn't like about the movie is that it was too short just like Venom. But damned if I didn't come out of this to dust off my old Morbius comic book collections to read again.

Ps: Let's be honest. Reviews today are done by over critical snowflakes who hate everything. We forgot how to just go to a movie and enjoy it without overanalyzing it to death.","10"
"bradendalhouse-75280","Kubrick is trembling in his boots.","4 June 2022","Morbius is simply the greatest film I ever had the pleasure of watching. Everything in the film is so masterfully crafted, so artistically and emotionally powerful, that I truly struggle to bring words to my feelings about the film. We, as a society, know of many classic films, CITIZEN KANE, BEN-HUR, DOCTOR ZHIVAGO, STAR WARS, THE GODFATHER, A CLOCKWORK ORANGE, APOCALYPSE NOW, ANNIE HALL, GOODFELLAS, JAWS, and many more, but Morbius simply outdoes all of those films in every way imaginable. It is simply incredible and breathtaking. The heart-wrenching performances, particularly that of Jared Leto, whose tragic descent from good-willed doctor to Morbius is painful, saddening, and epic to watch. We simply see a man's descent into madness, traveling into the heart of darkness inside us all, and never returning. And that is the core theme of the film. A human story, one which plagues us all. Throughout the film, which should more rightly be described as an adventure, an event, we not only follow and care for cinema's greatest character, but we become him. It would also be a crime against humanity to not mention the secondary character, Sir Matt Smith, whose visual variety and comic dancing masterfully balances a deeply complex film with universal comedy. And the visuals are simply striking. If you do not speak English, Watch Morbius. It is not the dialogue that makes the film so universally human. It is the pure visual storytelling that makes this film so damn beautiful to watch. The many layers of themes, ideas and complexities make Morbius like an onion. Peel it back, and you'll find something new. Not to mention the intricate choice of color representation, as well as the soundtrack. My God. How beautiful. Once the music hits your ears, you, without control, start sobbing at the pure beauty of it. It travels through your ears, yes, but it shakes your whole body, your emotions, your subconscious, and it invites you to join this epic journey. It is warm, comforting, and conveying with so-beautiful-it-hurts emotion that it is here to love you, protect you, please you, YOU. You deserve it. You give yourself to the music and film completely, and your pleasure and joy is insurmountable. Not to mention the realistic dialogue that bounces off the relationships of the characters like tennis balls off a wall. You feel yourself in the room, talking to Michael Morbius, experiencing his pain, joy, and human journey. I can describe the film as long as possible, but it simply could not do it Justice in its purest form. But there is one issue I must address following the film: the harsh, barbaric, and uneducated response from professional ""critics"", as they fancy to call themselves. It simply is uncalled for. No more could one colossally misunderstand a piece of art. We may look at olds and new films from 80 to 1 years ago and critically re-assess them, but Morbius needs no such pampering. Let idiots be idiots. The true intellectual, film-loving thinkers will continue to commune together and discuss this complex, striking and unexpected film while the other fat, blubbery armchair critics complain and make fools of themselves. When the film Morbius is inducted into the National Film Library for being history, aesthetically, and culturally significant and preserved for the rest of culture and time, not only will scholars many decades from now look at these idiotic manbabies as what they are: fools, but they will also study Morbius more so than ever before. I strongly see a new society being built upon the film Morbius (as it would, should, and will be the only surviving piece of culture or art from the first run of humanity), a better society, a complex society. With all of this said, Morbius IS cinema's greatest accomplishment, and I highly doubt that ever changing. Unless, of course, Morbius II: Morbin' Time is made, then a true culture war will be fought between the two films. I, however, will say this: Morbius II will both surpass and respect the original film, build upon its groundbreaking special effects, visuals, writing, cinematography, acting, music, and themes, and introduce many more ideas that will make us, as a society, think. Morbius is the best movie I've ever seen. So beautiful.

For the Morbin lovers, keep on Morbin. We shall continue to Morb despite this hostile movement against us and the man and film we worship: Jared Leto and Morbius.

Great audio, visuals and I actually can appreciate that the story was simple and straight to the point. There's so much more to entertaining than a plot so deep your mind feels like mush after watching. Jared Leto was great like always. It seems there's a group of people that will always put down his work for no reason. Jealousy maybe, I don't know. Morbius falls into a category of movies that aren't necessarily award worthy (the whole Marvel and DC franchises) but it's perfectly fine to put on during an evening with the family. I recommend you give it a watch!","7"

I get now what all the reviews were ranting about. This movie is pretty bad and then all of a sudden over right when it seems to get going! Morbius and Milo are lifelong best friends and within seconds hate and turn on each other, trying to kill one another? Morbius all of a sudden snaps because his friend also took the serum and that was all it took? Things like that just made no sense and were so rushed. I don't know what they were thinking with this movie but it just wasn't done well, the CGI isn't great but it's not terrible either. I don't have any desire to see this again or even a follow up. The two scenes they throw in during the end credits did nothing for me as well, created no excitement and had me lost for a minute.

Probably worth the watch but this is far from the good movie.","3"
"abcreator","MORBIUS CHANGED MY LIFE","20 May 2022","MORBIUS, starring Jared Leto as the titular character of DOCTOR MICHAEL J. MORBIUS aka MORBIUS is a masterpiece of filmmaking. This is the first 11/10 movie to exist, in fact, and if you disagree, you're wrong. It made 10 Morbillion dollars at the Morbox Office, which makes it the highest grossing movie ever of all time. It pleased audiences everywhere with its intricate storytelling, deep t h e m e s , and most of all, the performance of a lifetime from Jared Leto as DOCTOR MICHAEL J. MORBIUS himself.

I watched this movie 837 times in the theater. I quit my job so I could watch this movie more times, but it was worth it for MORBIUS. I think, after seeing it this many times, I am starting to see a little of myself in the protagonist as well. My wife gets mad at me when I tell her I have the powers of MORBIUS, saying doubtful statements such as ""you are not a vampire"" and ""you cannot fly"" and ""I am leaving you and taking the kids"" but I don't care. She doesn't understand. This is the experience of a lifetime. Do yourself a favor and support this movie so we can get a MORBIUS 2 and a INTO THE MORBIVERSE in the future. I personally bought three - one for the Father, the Son, and the Holy MORBIUS.

After you watch this movie, you will be glad you met DOCTOR MICHAEL J. MORBIUS.","10"

Some things were rushed and confusing and I did start to check my watch towards the end cause I was starting to get bored, so I guess there's my criticism. Also, I didn't like the ugly vampire faces.

I've seen some people complaining about the lack of blood and violence and I guess I get that since it's a vampire movie and all, but that's not really my thing, so it didn't bother me.

But I noticed many reviews keep mentioning that morbius in the movie jokes about saying ""i am venom, only joking"" but that is just in the trailer for a joke it's not in the actual movie, so it shows alot of these reviews aren't real, doesn't mean people that did see it didn't hate it but, it does say alot for online mentality of people that don't even bother to watch the film sometimes, it was fine but it's not something i'll likely ever rewatch again despite liking most of letos work usually.","5"
"ChrisBeaken","Morbius","1 April 2022","This was an excruciatingly painful film to get through. From beginning to end the film is constantly riddled with reshoots and obvious studio meddling that denies the film the ability to tell its own unique story. The story that is somewhat told feels rushed an unfinished, never fully taking the time to develop its characters, their motivations, or even the superpowers the film centers upon. It caused many inconsistencies within the plot, focusing on trying to get the point across without doing the work to achieve its goals. Every scene of the film looks chopped up and filmed oddly with camera movements that never rest for one moment to meditate on the actions taking place. The performances are non existent due to the amount of distracting visuals and pretentious story elements that are thrown at the viewers face. The film lacks any flavor or distinct personality, that makes the film feel generic, passionless, and ultimately forgettable. Along with ruining elements of unrelated, better films, this abomination of studio integrity is an experience that should not be given the attention the studio desperately needs.","1"

My family enjoyed it immensely, watching Dr. Morbius struggle with his disorder and then trying to figure out how to live with himself and contain ""the beast within"" after accidentally transforming himself into a form of vampire. In trying to cure his bloodborne illness, he combines his DNA with that of vampire bats and injects himself with the concoction after 100+ failed experiments. He also invents a synthetic blood substitute so he doesn't have to feed off living creatures. So he's a very conscientious vampire. Jared Leto is a great actor, and you can really feel and see his inner conflicts. And oh yeah, when Matt Smith shows up, a man with ZERO moral convictions, things really get interesting. Enjoy!","8"

That being said, this was a solid movie. To me, it's as solid as the first Venom movie was. It's not going to break many records (if any), but it was enjoyable to see a relatively unknown Marvel character come to the big screen. The visuals were more B+, Jared Leto did great, I didn't care for Tyreses character, and the villain was a throw away, but the battles were fun and the story was decent. I liked the Easter eggs and cameos and I'd be happy to see Morbius again in future movies. I gave it a 7/10 and am happy I saw it.","7"

It's a bit cringey at times and the choices made with the cgi weren't great. Plot is mediocre as well, but despite all that it's an enjoyable watch just don't take it all that seriously. If i wanted to take it seriously I would rag on the main enemy being a childhood friend that has a complete 180 personality change. Not only that but while the plot was somewhat interesting it led up to nothing bigger, it was simply friends become vampires then fight.","6"
"hotrobinproductions","Wow what a waste","5 April 2022","Jesus this movie was a chore. Ultimate boredom from beginning to end. There's nothing more to say. It's just a bland generic run of the mill superhero movie. Tries nothing remotely unique with a script and dialogue with such less substance you would rather watch keeping up with the kardashians. The end credit scenes just shows how lazy Sony is. Leaching off the success of the MCU to draw in viewers. I noticed it with venom 1 which was garbage. I wasted my money watching that. I was not about to do it with the sequel so I pirated let there be carnage online and it was definitely an improvement over venom 1... but still a very over the mill superhero movie.... Then this one... just worse if not just as bad as venom 1.... Uninteresting in every angle.

PROS:

it finished...

Jared Leto was okay as the lead role I guess.

Effects were cool to look at,

I appreciate the idea of a dark superhero movie taking a dark execution I'm fine with. I just want a good movie. Look at Joker. A movie about a villain and it's dark as heck... this one I appreciate it even though it doesn't execute it well.

CONS:

script boring,

dialogue extremely bland on delivery,

plot,

EVERYONE LOOKS SO TIRED... and uninteresting performances in every way, the characters look so uninterested in the plot and story. When they do it's a bit cringe. Only actors I liked were Leto and the female. Other than that everyone was just there with a terrible performance

action was repeated in sequences that we saw way too many times already in one movie. Usually you need a variety of the action to make it interesting. Sonic 2 did a better job at making the action watchable than this garbage.

Villain was so bland and predictable, which was one of my biggest problems of venom 1... venom 2 worked on the villain better. But I think Morbius has just as much a bad villain as venom 1 was.

Pretty much everything to make a movie worth to watch is thrown out of the window

Predictability: now usually a movie being predictable can be fine... nothing wrong with it as long as it delivers on a good foundation script, or something of substance, a clear direction... this film however doesn't even have that. And when you have a story and plot that is just predictable with twists that are just so awfully executed you know it's a bad movie

End credit scenes were so desperate. Sony universe needs to end already this is terrible..

This movie I will rank a

TIRED VAMPIRE DUMPSTER-FIRE / 10

P. S ( I like the idea of dark comic book movies, that's not the problem, I liked Joker, V for Vendetta, Watchmen, The Road To Perdition, some aspects of BVS, and SO many more I can name... this movie just felt more bland and generic compared to those)","3"
"Isee-stupid-people","Oh my god","13 September 2022","How good can this be? Science is so easy to understand. I thought gene splicing was very complicated and required dna recombination and then single cell injection. But thanks to morbuis i now understand it can be done en masse by just putting a drop of blood under a microscope. Morbuis if you will, opened up a new era of science which can be done in ones garage. Its so easy his friend with no doctorate training was able to do it. Thank you morbuis.

Moving on with more science. Morbuis taught me how to pronounce Nobel...its noble. I feel so stupid saying wrong for all these years.

I can go on and on but just to summarize i think this is a masterpiece . It should be taught to everyone...not just acting school.

Finally i agree with another comment here. It's too short. I feel like they cut a whole hour of this because they thought people would think its too long. I think 3 hrs is about right for this. Otherwise you miss out here and things move too fast to fully understand the comexities

Acting? What acting...what genius decided to cast al madrigal as cop? Come on man shrimping ain't easy but al madrigal is about as good as it gets...perfect fit

Oh almost forgot. Morbuis solved one of the biggest problems in science- the cost of starting a lab.

Long Review: I grew up reading Marvel Comics including those with Morbius. He was an interesting character. Somewhat like werewolf-by-night, Morbius was a 'monster' but did not want to be.

This movie got a few things right, but too many things wrong. First, vampire bats are nothing like how they're portrayed in this movie. Seriously, did the writers think that people know nothing about vampire bats? (2) How many super-fast, indestructible characters do we need in the Marvel Universe? When a character is this powerful there's absolutely no tension in the action scenes. (3) Morbius transformation into this superbeing is instantaneous. And he already knows how to use his new abilities. (4) There's just nothing to set this movie apart from 95% of the current crop of superhero movies.","6"

I really don't get all the hate for Leto, he embodied Morbius amazingly and was fantastic. The CGI was fantastic, the character transformations were incredible. The only fault I could find is that it was a bit too fast paced but if it was slower people would still complain.

"marauder-02891","It is an introduction movie and for that it is average, but not the worst.","2 April 2022","I went and watched it in the cinema, because i wanted to see why people have so negative reviews about this movie.

I try not to spoil anything.

There is a friendship story, a love story and a hero(?) story in the movie, but the problem with the movie is that all of those things are in it only at a surface level, you get a very basic idea about all of them but that is all.

No detials or not highligthed parts from any of those, and it is a shame because if they would have picked one of the 3 and went with it all the way the movie would be a 8/10.

The CGI is kinda unique, i can understand if people dislike it, but i had no problem with it, also, every superhero movie is just as good as its villain, well, in this case it felt like venom 2 for me, undetialed and too little from the villain to feel anything about him.

The worst thing about the movie is the way it ends, it is too fast and the action is kinda mediocore in it, the movie just ends too fast.

Jared Leto was not bad at all, i dont blame any actors in this movie, i blame the writers and the director because they could not focus on a single direction and because of it the movie feels empty, emotionless.

This kind of film making where they literally push out movies without real meaningful stories are kinds lame, and i understand that it was a sony movie so i am not so surprised about it, but i wanted this movie to be much, much better, but as i said it had the potential in it, the plot was just too unfocused and it killed the story because it lacked the nessessary detials which would have made this to be an above average film.

You can watch this, you will maybe like some parts of it, but that is all, you will not really remember anything two weeks later. Average.

The after credit scenes were not as bad as they claimed they are, they were just making a connection with them so they were fine, also, you dont have to sit through the credits to watch them so it was fine.

I hope i helped, have a nice day.","6"

I loved the movie Jared Leto and Matt Smith did AMAZING! I am sooooo excited to see more. I loved that it wasnt like 2hrs and 30 mins and it just go to the point. I would advise everyone to just see the movie for yourself and make your own judgment. The movie isnt bad. I loved the effects and it was different. I am going to see it again tommorrow!","9"
"rileyyjayy","ALOT BETTER THEN WHAT ITS RATED","5 April 2022","For a Sony production associated with marvel I think it was a great movie , very enjoyable all the way thru , I can't believe how many people have rated this so low, I think those people have too high expectations or rate every marvel movie against endgame and infinity war. It felt a little rushed, but apart from that it was a reallly fun and dark movie from Sony. Wasn't as good as venom but it came close. If it had a better ending I would of rated it 9 out of 10. Jared letto you rocked!!","8"
"mindlessmoviemaster","Really good.","21 May 2022","I went in hearing some bad things about this movie buuuut it was surprisingly good! From the fight scenes to the just the all around story and at the end the Vulture just appears in an empty cell, from multi-verse. Then they have a convo out in the desert and Vulture says I think a bunch of guys like us should join up I think it can do some good. Morbius says-intriguing. This was a good movie all around and only a hour and 30 mins it felt like so much. Watch it!","10"

"imseeg","Kinda silly. And tedious. Another Jared Leto flop.","14 April 2022","When they make a fantasy movie they better get the characters right. Jared Leto though, I cant take seriously. He looks kinda silly. And he is suppose to look menacing and evil.

More bad: lots of mediocre supporting actors. The special effects are looking cheap. And the entire movie is quite tedious to watch, because I simply do not get carried away by these silly looking characters.","4"
"Joshumms","Boring, unoriginal, and stupid","2 April 2022","Morbius is a masterclsss in how to bore an audience.

The action is the simplest mistake that this movie makes, there isn't much of it and it's not very good. It's mostly just super fast flying around clashing around things and you can't tell what's happening and then it randomly goes into slow motion to show you what's happening for about a second.

The story is a very generic anti-hero story, he does experiments, he turns himself into a superhuman of some kind and does evil things, and then becomes the hero in the end. It is the most basic stuff in between that simple structure and it's very bland

The characters are very uninteresting, the cop characters show up sometimes, say some unfunny lines, and pretty much do nothing. The love interest is only there for a little bit and then she pretty much does nothing until they all of a sudden love each other. Michael Morbius is not that interesting, he just does things because the story wants him to and there is little explanation for his actions.

The villain deserves his own category because he is terrible. The first issue is he's just morbius but evil so the fights between him and morbius are pretty boring. His motivations are so stupid, he pretty much goes from the normal friend to a murderer because... he wants Morbius to think his powers aren't a curse??? And people don't know what it's like to be him so he just kills them??? And then at the end we're supposed to feel somewhat bad for him like he made a mistake, no he literally gets powers and the first thing he does is murder a bunch of people for ""fun"" like it's so stupid.

There are some positives though

Jared Leto is actually good in the role and he does a great job with how little he is given

The first action scene I actually liked, the first person shots were cool and the horror elements were different from your normal superhero movie and I liked it.

I liked some of the music in the movie, it was adjacent to a horror movie soundtrack but mixed with a superhero soundtrack.

A lot of the movie may be bland but it's not absolutely horrendous so it's not like it's the worst movie in the world

BUT the stupidest thing is the end credit scenes SPOILERS HERE (although I wouldn't bother caring for spoilers)

Michael Keaton's vulture is somehow teleported to the Sony universe, which literally makes no sense. In No Way Home, all of the people that knew Peter Parker were being transported to the MCU, and by making everyone forget Peter Parker all of the people being transported were sent back to their original universe. So here's the problem, Michael Keaton's vulture is originally from the MCU so he would not just be teleported to the Sony universe. Also when he gets transported there he just assumes spiderman had something to do with it, so he somehow gets his suit and meets up with morbius to kill spiderman I guess. What ever happened to him caring about his family??? The first thing he thinks when teleported to a new universe is to kill spiderman because he might have had something to do with it, not the fact that his family is just gone. Sony is just trying so hard to make a sinister six movie, but it's just not gonna happen if they keep half-assing the movies that are supposed to make you care about a team of people.","3"

"hfreinoso","Sony really need to stop","11 April 2022","Morbius was a movie I was interested in knowing about Michael Morbius's character that I read about in the comics. He was a troubled guy who wanted to make the world better in the comics. And when getting to the film has been delayed for almost two years since July 31, 2020. Unfortunately, however, Morbius, the film was not that. This movie is a complete mess. Hot Garbage. It's poorly made in almost all aspects. The story is disjointed, the basic dialogue, the character depth is barely there, and the superficial relationships. After No Way Home, Sony decided to put their fingerprints all over the movie, and every time they did that, it didn't go that well. If you look at Spider-man 3, The Amazing Spider-Man 2, Venom, Venom: Let there be Carnage, and now this film, again, they want to be like the MCU instead of being their own thing. They want to make the films like the cinematic universe and kid-friendly characters. When it shouldn't be like that, characters like Morbius, Venom, and Carnage are not kid-friendly. These films need to be more adult than just ten years old; the movies like Logan, Deadpool, and Joker are box office successes and amazing films.

Pros: Matt Smith stole the show, he was the best part of the movie, and I understand his motivation to be a villain and wanting to be cured. The visuals were amazing too. And I love the tone; it was by far better than Venom 1 and 2, as I always want the films to be serious when it needs to be.

Cons: Everything else that was in the movie. This is an Avi Arad production, so my expectations were low going into this, and Matt Tolmach and Lucas Foster were also on board to make the stakes of success even lower than ever. It's boring. The writers didn't make the stakes evident, and the story flow was weak. The characters made the fact that we needed to care about these characters, besides Matt Smith's character. The love between Morbius and Bancroft was somewhat forced on me that many people need to have a love interest. However, this is still better than Eddie and Anne in the Venom movies. The ending ends, and it was the most disappointing thing I have ever seen. And the post-credits scenes, the better I forget about that existing, the better.

Overall, Sony needs to stop with these films, and if they make movies without setting up a cinematic universe and without touching the films, these films would be levels like Deadpool, Logan, and Joker. But with this, I won't be watching anything else coming from Sony. Except for Spider-Man Across the Spider-verse Part 1 and 2, I hope Sony doesn't put their nasty fingerprints all over the film. 2/10. Disappointing.","2"
"zahaioan-23927","MORBIUS BEST","15 April 2022","One of the best movies ever written. From the TOTALLY ORIGINAL dialogue to the MIND BLOWING CGI, this is one of the most entertaining movies ever. Jared Leto was such a good actor and he played Morbius like a total pro. This movie was totally NOT CRINGE AND FULL OF AWFUL CLICHES, instead it was original and game-changing. This is the real deal. MORBIUS BEST!!!!!","10"
"afura-78800","Jared Leto pretty good Morbius impression","4 February 2023","Finally marvel is starting making movies about less known marvel characters like Morbius. The movie tells the story of the marvel character Morbius and shows how everything begun with Dr. Michael Morbius who is played by Jared Leto turning into the living vampir Morbius. The movie is a bit short, but that's ok. The only negative thing for me is that the villain in the movie was a little bit boring, otherwise special effects are really nice, story was interesting but a bit too predictable to be honest. Anyway I found it a good introduction into a new marvel character with a lot of potential for further movies. Also Jareds performance was pretty decent.

I am quite surprised about all the bad reviews and the negative criticism. I feel like people are expecting a blockbuster everytime a new marvel movie comes out, this is just spoiled and very unrealistic.

I can't wait to see Morbius interacting with other marvel characters in future marvel movies :)","10"

"The-Sarkologist","An Enjoyable Watch","15 May 2022","Oh dear, this film didn't go down all that well, but then again I can sort of see where the critcism of it does arise. Basically it is the origin story of a Spiderman villian, but they are trying to build a film around this particular villain, but also that a number of critics feel that separating the villain from the context of the superhero that they tend to fight doesn't work. Mind you, I thought the two Venom films worked quite well, and to be honest with you, I actually quite liked this film. In fact, the rather dark nature of the film made me feel that it doesn't really sit all that well in the type of Spiderman films that I have seen.

Anyway, the film is about this doctor, Michael Morbius, who has a rare blood disease which means that his body can't produce blood, so he needs a blood transfusion on a daily basis. He is introduced to a friend who also has the disease and of course they end up becoming besties (or brothers for want of a better word - and also the word that the film happens to use). So, Morbius dedicates his life to finding a cure for this condition, and he comes upon the idea of using the DNA from a vampire bat, which actually backfires and turns him into a vampire.

The rest of the film is basically Morbius coming to terms with the fact that he is now a vampire, but also dealing with his brother, who has since become immesurably wealthy, but has also taken the 'cure' but has decided that because he is now a powerful vampire, he should embrace the power and dominate people, as opposed to Morbius, who doesn't really want to hurt people (and the only people that he did hurt happened to be the thugs that were on the ship where he was conducting his experiments).

Mind you, considering that Morbius is supposed to be a villain, or rather an anti-hero, which is what these films are exploring, you probably can forgive the fact that the film completely trashes the lives of these characters - which is what happens here. A sort of similar thing happened in Venom, but not to the same extent. Then again, Venom was a lot more light hearted, especially with the banter between Venom and Eddy Brock. However, this film is a lot darker, and there is also a suggestion that it might not be the same universe as the Venom universe, if the end credit sequence is anything to go by.

Yeah, this didn't seem to appeal to all that many people, but I personally liked it. It certainly isn't one of the greatest films that I've seen, but personally, it works reasonably well, and I enjoyed it, though I doubt I would be rushing out to watch it again.","6"
"jackbryant-00743","Morbius","20 August 2022","Jared Leto as Doctor Michael Morbius not good. All of Jared Leto's lines are spoken with the same boring tone. Every scene he's just like ""😐"".

Milo (Matt Smith) is the only genuinely good part of it. His facial expressions and line delivery is menacing. When playing Milo he uses his emotions really well.

FBI Agent Rodriguez (Al Madrigal) is portrayed as a comedic character but is just annoying and irritating.

FBI Agent Simon Stroud (Tyreese Gibson) is by far the better FBI Agent out of the two.

Doctor Emil Nicholas (Jared Harris) was an okay character but didn't really do too much in the movie. I understand he is meant to be a father figure/mentor type role to Morbius and Milo, but that's all he is, not a very particularly interesting one either.

Martine Bancroft (Adria Ajorna) is an okay character but similarly to Jared Harris' Character she doesn't do much except be Morbius' Love Interest.

Some of the Vampire to Human and Human to Vampire CGI actually looks quite good. The mist around the characters when they are in Vampire form is okay but looks a bit janky in places.

The first end credit scene doesn't make any sense. Why has Adrian Toomes / Vulture just appeared in some random prison NOT in his universe. Tf.

The second end credit scene is absolutely terrible. The dialogue is awful. None of it makes sense.

This movie leaves you wishing the movie was about Matt Smith's Character. Or even having Matt Smith as the main role.","4"

The acting was fine for this type of film, script was better than expected for a B movie, and the special effects were good - without being over the top.

Everything about this movie was dumb. I never liked the fact that Sony turning Venom and Morbius into PG-13 movies just so they can become part of the MCU instead of making their own cinematic universe.

On Tuesday, the night before she was scheduled to go in, I decided to take her to the theater to try and put her nervous mind at ease. We reluctantly chose to view Morbius, and I say 'reluctantly' because we had heard some previously negative reviews. It began with our full interest, but as the picture went on our interest in finishing the movie waned. Around the 1 hour mark my mom got up and walked out. Thinking maybe she was just going to the restroom I remained seated for an additional 10 minutes. Worried about the woman who gave me life, I then also walked to the lobby. I found my mom walking around spryly, more actively than I had seen in years. She told me she couldn't take anymore torture, and was planning to straight up leave but as she left her knees began to feel years younger. We went back in to finish the movie and by the time the credits rolled not only her knees were better, but her glaucoma had cleared up, the arthritis that had nagged her for decades was gone, and my Dad decided to leave my step-mom for her.

The next day the surgeon, was astounded. He promptly cancelled the surgery and informed my mom she had the knees of someone 3 times her junior. He immediately asked if we had seen Morbius recently, we said ""of course"".

Character doesn't have grief,pain, sorrow, A doctor killing innocents after innocents (?) , Goons are in the protection of a ship (?) , Dr Michael works with one assistant, just one(?) , Horrifically done younger story, unnecessary (?) , Someone edited dark knights score in to this (?) , There's no police wide manhunt for him (?) , Only Two fbi officers are in charge (?) , I could go on but at this point i don't think it deserves more writing & i am writing this review only seeing half of it .

"dmansel","Little to compliment or turn a hopeful eye to","10 April 2022","Morbius, Sony's latest offering in their universe of Spider-related content, finally hits theaters after a number of delays, which one would think would be used to help fine tune the film. Penned by duo Matt Sazama and Burk Sharpless, known for box office grenades like Dracula Untold, The Last Witch Hunter, and Gods of Egypt, Morbius proves yet again that Sony either has zero grasp on storytelling or saw just how well received the schlocky Venom was and has decided to fully lean into nonsense. At the center of the film is the incredibly popular and largely beloved Spider-Man villain Michael Morbius, gifted scientist hell bent on finding a cure for his blood illness. This recklessness leads to increasingly dangerous experiments, the latest of which splices the genes of humans with vampire bats. The disastrous result (it's comics, after all, it wouldn't be comics if science didn't go hilariously wrong) transforms Morbius into a living vampire, giving him abilities beyond his wildest dreams.

Morbius isn't good. It's outright bad. The plotting, the acting, the directing, the visual effects, and the bland score all fail on almost every conceivable level. Outside of Spiderverse, Sony's inability to grasp the concepts behind the characters that inhabit Spider-Man's world is embarrassingly baffling to witness. A decent first act, followed by a sluggish second act to a rushed third act and abrupt ending make watching the movie a jerky ride, to say the least. The end credit scenes, which were scenes from the actual movie (badly) recontextualized to hint at something bigger, don't work within the universe they've set up, within the larger Marvel Cinematic Universe, or even within its own story. Character decisions just as confusing as the directing decisions lead to a movie that Sony seemed content with slapping its name on and letting it ride under the guise of being Spider and MCU-adjacent.

Starring Academy Award winning actor Jared Leto, Morbius is one of the most uninteresting, apathetic, languid performances of his career. When compared to the gusto he put into Paolo Gucci in The House of Gucci, here Leto seems drained of all spirit or interest. To be his first major tentpole movie that he leads himself, the decision to underplay Morbius as a character who gets from A to B simply because the plot demands so is baffling. All of the drowsiness of Leto's performance is overcorrected by Matt Smith. Smith, ready to dial it up to 150 in each scene, steals the attention every time he's on the screen, and not always the best ways. After the second act turn, the somewhat subdued performance cranks into high gear as Smith is unleashed to run circles around a sleepy Leto. Standing in between them attempting to keep the peace is Jared Harris, who, after a 25 year gap from the beginning scenes seems to have not aged a day himself (almost like a vaaaaaaaampiiiiire). Harris does his best with the paltry material he's given as the wisest head in the room that serves to galvanize Leto later in the film.

Also starring Adira Arjona as Marine Bancroft, poor Arjona is saddled with the baggage of Leto's lackadasical performance. Try as she might, there's not much she can contend with, leading to an awful and forced chemistry between the two. Placed sporadiacally throughout the film, whether due to suspect editing or shabby writing, Arjona's Bancroft deserves to be in a much better movie than this. A smart and capable scientist in her own right, one wonders why she joins Morbius in his less than above board plans. It's possible 'love makes a person do funny things' but with the chemistry we see between these two, I find it highly unlikely. Tyrese, winding down his time on the Fast & Furious franchise and ready to hop into another, plays it straight down the middle as FBI Agent Stroud. Stroud's no-nonsense approach makes him distinguishable enough to ensure that he'll return for the inevitable sequel. The only person who seems to be having a ball is comedian Al Madrigal as Stroud's partner Rodriguez. Madrigal comedic delivery and quippy nature bring a fresh air to the otherwise bleakness happening around him.

Directed by Daniel Espinosa, Morbius has put on full display all of the flaws of his craft and technique. Scenes that could have had an inkling of potential, such as any confrontation between Morbius and Milo in the third act, are devoid of any passion between the actors or stakes set for the audience. The pacing, which is applaudable for hitting all the familiar beats and plot points of an origin story, takes a nose dive in the third act as the film's abrupt ending left me confused and baffled as to the decisions made to end the film how it does. Tonally speaking, it seems as if there's time FBI agents Straud and Rodriguez are in a completely different movie than everybody else, and the removal of those two characters seems to do little to change the story presented. Possibly the most frustrating aspect of the endeavor is the amount of subpar visual effects in the film. For a movie that's been pushed back a countless number of times, one would think that would afford the vfx supervisors time to tinker, tighten up, or smooth out any issues, yet thanks largely in part to the CGI, Morbius feels like a movie that was removed from 2003 and reinserted into our current timeline.

But, credit must be given where it's due. The end of the first act action scene on board the tanker Morbius is conducting his experiments is an entertaining watch; a turn from standard comic book fare to a more darker, creepier horror vibe. The freshly turned Morbius ripping through the security guards on the boat makes for a fun watch as Espinosa finds different ways to tease Morbius without fully revealing him as he lurks in the shadows and stalks his prey from multiple angles. A true standout amongst the rest of the haphazardly composed scenes, the tanker sequence is by far the standout piece of the movie, lead by some genuinely good directing and editing.

Overall, when it comes to Morbius, there's little to compliment or turn a hopeful eye to. An incredibly weak story, further hampered by bad writing, hammy acting, shoddy CGI, and milquetoast directing makes the film a rather dull affair. While not the worst superhero movie we've gotten since in the early 2000s boom, it's certainly the worst of Sony's handling of the material and there's little to boast of or prop up in a positive light. Anchored by a lethargic performance from lead Jared Leto, the film lacks any substance that makes its 104-minute runtime worth a trip to go see.","2"
"johnathancary","Basically A Vampire Version Of The Incredible Hulk (2008)","2 April 2022","Felt like Jared Leto absolutely nailed the character. This movie was far more enjoyable than I thought it would be. The CGI and choreography were top notch and I LOVED how smoothly the slow mo scenes were done. I noticed Milo's vampire form had basically the same streaks as MCU's quicksilver. Also, the post credit scene is clearly a sinister six tease. Keaton's vulture was shifted by Dr. Strange's spell into Morbius' universe for a hearing that could lead to him being released.

This movie also spiritually felt like a vampire version of the Incredible Hulk (2008). Loved that movie as well. Detailed list on why this movie is exactly like the incredible hulk (2008):

Protagonists that are both doctors trying to find a cure and end up botching it and permanently transforming themselves.


The typical ""there's a monster inside of me and I want it gone"" trope with the usual Dr. Hyde and Mr. Jekyll theme.


The protagonist's love dynamic is more or less the same. The classic ""I love you but because of this thing inside me I have to leave before it acts out"" trope.


First transformation fight scene involved fodder guys with guns and flashlights in a dimly lit factory with smoke everywhere so you can barely see morbius/hulk. This adds an element of fear and surprise.


The watch connection. In the hulk movie Norton's Banner kept a watch on him 24/7 to monitor his heart rate. In Morbius, Dr Morbius kept a watch on him 24/7 to monitor the time before he would start craving blood.


The protagonists want to commit suicide to rid themselves of the monster inside of them.


Lots Of Chase Scenes.


Hooded protagonist hiding out from people.


LE was constantly after the protagonist.


Main antagonist is an evil copycat of the protagonist that abused the same serum they used in an attempt to replicate their transformation.


Main protagonist frames the main protagonist for damage done and people mix them up.


Morbius literally referenced the hulk at one point. ""You won't like me when I'm hungry"",","9"
"Empifilmes","Sony doesn't learn from its Mistakes","13 April 2022","Morbius displays the worst of modern cinema, money over quality. With a simple, common but interesting plot, the film wastes all its potential because it rushes everything. The characters are really a hit or a miss, some of them make unbelievably bad decisions. The pace is good in the first two acts, however in the final act the movie is shaken by re-recordings which becomes evident as there are scenes out of place. Not to mention the dialogue... The action is weak: strange effects, sloppy editing, terrible choreography and unnecessary slow motions, joined by an unoriginal soundtrack.

Generally performances were good Jared Leto is far from being the movie's problem and Matt Smith is wronged by lack of character development (villain).

Althoug enterteining this film suffers from poor writing, sloppy editing, post production issues and the need to rush everything to promote future projects (same old mistakes). Sony continues to produce failure after failure...","4"

"Johnny-the-Film-Sentinel-2187","One of the movies I've ever seen.","16 April 2022","Morbius is a lax-Marvel film that doesn't have a hell of a lot going for it: especially considering it's meant to be adjacent to the Spider-Man movies even though you wouldn't know that WITHOUT its post-credits teases. They cut out almost all of the shared-universe stuff (I think there was a reference to Venom somewhere) EXCEPT for Michael Keaton's end-of-film appearance. It was only fair to expect this film to feel like it had more connections to a larger world instead of an introverted cliche of a movie What a letdown.

As for the film itself, it tries to be an entertaining piece on its own, but so much of it is either unexplained or poorly explained, like the whole fake-blood logic and the syringe used in the final act. Some of it just DIDN'T make sense: also the character development in this film was lacking because of the pacing focusing on establishing a superhero character as opposed to letting Jared Leto give some life to a dying scientist trying to cure himself and his best friend of their blood disorders. There was a great premise, but it wasn't explored upon properly and was really an excuse to throw Spider-Man's 'vampire guy' onto the big screen simply because Sony still had the rights to Morbius instead of Marvel via Disney.

What does work? Morbius himself doesn't LOOK too bad (his vampire form is okay, and his ears are nicely eerie to look at, especially with those hairs), and Matt Smith makes his hammiest Doctor Who moments look downright subtle, and Jared Harris is always nice to see even when he's underused (like he is here). The film was trying to work. I think Jared Harris' casting was one of the film's biggest missed opportunities, because that guy could read a ham sandwich recipe; and it'd be interesting hearing it in his voice with conviction.

The bad stuff? Well, the CGI was all over the place (looking either very good or very bad), the plotting was too empty for such interesting comic book characters, and Jared Leto himself was wasted as badly as Jared Harris; in fact the great actors they used here simply tried giving gravitas to the stupid script they had to work with.

Morbius tries to work in spite of everything against it, but these characters need clearer direction, less murky CG-action and less sequel-dependent-writing to make these Spider-Man supporting characters interesting.

Morbius gets 1.5/5 stars. This vampire doesn't suck your attention up the way he ought to.","3"
"albaraa-53284","not bad","18 July 2022","The Morbis movie was not the best I've seen and there were mistakes that I didn't like because it was not the best thing that happened which is that the movie was mostly in the lab. Nice, but it ended easily, as if the thing Morbis was fighting was normal, but in the end, the Morbis movie was not the best that Sony offered, and if there was a second part, I hope it was better and they correct the mistakes.","5"
"brooke55","A Fun Superhero Flick with a Dash of Horror","1 April 2022","I am convinced that this movie's rating is being hate-bombed by trolls. Whether it's because people despise Sony or hate Jared Leto, I don't know. What I do know is that this flick was a fun, compelling superhero origin story that kept me entertained.

Sure, it wasn't groundbreaking. It wasn't crammed with shared-universe tie-ins. And it certainly wasn't a masterpiece. But the acting was great, the CGI was dazzling, and the atmosphere was chilling in the best way.

Jared Leto was a great fit for this role, and the character was fleshed out well (even if the supporting characters were a bit lacking in this department.)

Bottom line: don't let the bad reviews fool you. My husband and I enjoyed this movie and give it a thumbs up.","7"

Darlings, that was 6 years ago. Shut up about it. Leto's an incredible actor and his chemistry with Matt Smith is what made Morbius so good. Could the VFX have been better?

Jared Leto is great and the acting in general is awesome.

By far one of Jared Leto's best movies (there's not much competition).

The only thing I can fault is that Micheal Keaton's role was depleted to 2 end credits scenes and that all the links to the MCU has been digitally removed.

This is in my top 10 recommended movies to watch on a weekend.

It is dark and quite scary at times (there are 2 jumpscares around the movie).

The dreadful choppy start with flashbacks after a brief folly into the future No real direction in a story line that is flat out dreadful Maybe cgi that wouldn't look out of place in an early 90's film??? (When will film makers stop using ""bullet time"" or messy graphics to make up for plan awful cinematography) But the sight of Matt Smith reprise his Dr Who role as a vampire is just laughable well I say laughable but that may not be the funniest part of the film that goes to the baffling abilities of the cast to know out of nowhere how and why there super abilities work!

Please please Sony do every film fan a favour and just hand the rights over to Marvel and let them do the right thing by these characters and stop dropping sub par movies to bring the whole brand down to the gutter of this tripe.","2"

Not sure why it is receiving such hate but I can only express my own opinion and don't like to jump on band wagons. There have been some stinkers and in my opinion, this attempt is not one of them. It has its faults, in editing, cgi and child acting, but the story moved along nicely and developed into a entertaining (if predictable) offering.","7"

I can only assume these are reviews written by children or the very young. The film is a solid piece of entertainment, good acting, effects and characters. No it's not up there with End Game but it shouldn't have to be. Still a decent film and worth a watch. The sort is a little formula driven but this doesn't detract from the overall enjoyment. Leto is pretty good as is Smith, both realistically portraying their characters. My review is honest as is the number of stars awarded.","7"

"ieddaddy","I enjoyed it","17 May 2022","I've read some of the comics and seen the cartoons and I'm familiar with morbius and Jared Leto morbius is a good rendition of the character. The movie hits all of morbius traits spot on. This was like a Dracula with a twist but that's how it was in the comics too and that's the whole gimmick with the character. Only thing missing from this movie was Spider-Man and all I kept thinking about was how he would fair against the web slinger. The movie was a bit weird with an opening scene that I still don't know what or when it plays into the story and I can only assume. End credits was dope af. I give the movie a 7.5 and I might watch it again with my kids.","8"

"victorsanchez-69993","Entertaining and excellent visual effects","15 April 2022","Apparently the critics are having the avenger effect on all the movies. They think that the entire superhero movie that will come out can be compared with Avenger and Spiderman no way home that forget the origins and the path that must be followed to reach that level.

The visual effects of the movies were incredible. The story is basic, the plot and the characters could be further developed, but the director preferred to keep everything simple. There are some gaps in the story of the movie. As it progresses they explain it to you but you feel that some details are missing to give it a little more flavor in the climax moments of the movie.

Jared leto was an incredible performance. You can't ask for less from an excellent actor. Despite the bad reviews they have of the famous places, Morbius is a project that well worked can open schemes to the Marvel Cinematic Universe. The Blade vs. Morbius showdown would be unique in the CINEMA.","7"

"martibrj-78181","A good movie with some amazing highlights","9 April 2022","Morbius is one of those movies that is good when it is good amazing when it is amazing and bad when it is bad what I mean by that is there are some parts where it is truly amazing there are some parts when it is good or just okay but when it is bad it is bad very b ad especially during the times where he is riding his journal / diary that drags on forever. However the amazing moments make up for it every time Matt Smith and Jared Leto on screen together it is a amazing scene and they are on screen together quite a lot. There are some story details that drag on and it is kind of a lackluster origin story. On the other hand if you look at it for what it is and admire the amazing action scenes then it is a great movie. Like I said when it is good it is just good when it is amazing it is truly amazing and what it is bad it is very bad.","4"

"danchilton-71955","Snorebius","8 April 2022","Morbius shares a lot in commen with its Sony Spiderman(less)verse cousin Venom in that its messy, unfocused and has clearly been hacked to bits in the editing room. What it doesn't have is the charm of Tom Hardy arguing with himself and doing his impression of Jim Carey in The Mask.

What you get instead is a passable but drab rendition of a mid nineties comic book movie, think way short of a Blade but better than a Spawn. Frustratingly, there are seeds of a much better movie here had the filmmakers invested the time in developing any of the threads they have going on. There is some actually quite gruesome body horror on show (Matt Smith was made for it) and had they leaned into it a bit more we could have had a genuinely unique superhero flick on our hands. There is also an interesting gothic tragedy buried in there but Morbius and best friend Loxias relationship is left pitifully underdeveloped so their parting of ways means nothing to the viewer. The script really needed to spend more time on hammering home their closeness and less on forcing a pointless romance with a female colleague. They may as well of put up some text on screen saying, ""look Morbius is just FRIENDS with another guy OK, there's nothing gay going on there relax.""

The film isn't a complete disaster and Leto does a pretty good job of giving Michael some personality but the absence of any meaningful stakes leads to a fairly boring hour and a half with the whole thing feeling like something Sony wanted to get out the way in their quest for some sort of team up movie in the future.","5"

Now, I did enjoy the first half hour or so which I found quite different, fresh-feeling and appealing. Unfortunately once the science fiction takes over it becomes increasingly trashy and laughable, and it doesn't help that every single action sequence features these flowing CGI effects which just look like what they are - bad CGI, of the type favoured by the likes of The Asylum. Then we get Matt Smith's posturing, Jared Leto seemingly on autopilot, and a by the numbers script which doesn't help much either.","4"
"MarQuilly","Sorry Jared","24 May 2023","Another miss for this otherwise great actor. The story is interesting, but delivery is below average, for high budget and box office movie, which is visible by overuse of CGI. If the screenplay was more focused on troubled dr. Morbius, and let the actor(s) do what they do best, act, that would certainly deliver the whole different movie. With some movies, its better not try to please all the audience, some may be left to adults, and not to cut all the blood and gore so the children can watch it. That way you get sterile CGI movie, but it still wont appeal to kids since they, luckily, still don't know the struggles about major life transformations and decisions which main character needs to endure. There are some ok scenes, and story is interesting, so 5/10.",NA

I know only very little about the Marvel stories, I haven't heard about this character until I saw the trailer a few months ago.

I always liked Adria's and Jared's acting, so I was excited about this movie.

I went to pump up my blood pressure with some good actions. Well, my BP stayed at 90/60. It would have been even lower if I hadn't drank 2 liters of cola in my boredom. And believe me, I'm very easy to please!

I'm sure lots of work went into it, and it's definitely not 1/10. However, as much as I really wanted to enjoy it, after 15 minutes, I could have told that would happen in the next 90 minutes, even with close to 0 knowledge of Marvel characters.

The shirtless scene was nice - lol - I gave an extra star for that. :))

The actors did their bests I guess, the CGI, and the makeups were fine for me, and there were a few great sound effects and cam angle shots as well, but the music lacked of creativity, and I really missed the action, the BLOOD, and exciting wow scenes which would have made me want to watch it again. It won't happen, unfortunately.","5"
"ianmilad","Good beginning, bad ending","3 April 2022","The first half hour of the movie, well, the story starts with a good plot, good reasons why dr. Morbius leads him to do what he does, however, as the movie progresses it gets worse, until he crashes. An exaggerated use of cgi that clashes with the aesthetics of the film, the character development is empty, the basic motivations, the dialogues practically a couple of sentences in one scene, a couple of sentences in another... the beginning of the film, i was enjoying it, but when it was over, I didn't know what to think... I don't know if many scenes were removed in the edition, or because of the problems of the pandemic it was not possible to record everything that was wanted, but this film lacked in many scenes, lack of development of the characters, it lacked a better integration of the logic of how the elements of the film worked... in general it is an entertaining film, but it becomes ridiculous at times. I feel sorry for the final result of this one, because Jared Letto's performance is quite good, but the others are bad, especially the female partner of Dr. Morbius, a basic action, with simplistic motivations and without deep development of these. Honestly, I think it could have been a good movie, but it just wasn't. Maybe in the future the director's cut will come out and we'll see what we deserved, but for now it's just one more of the bunch... I recommend going to see it if there isn't much else to do, and you don't go with a critical attitude, but if you want to see one good movie, better stay home.","6"

"flurry-79022","I wouldn't go as far as to call it bad, but..","3 April 2022","There's just a few things I don't understand about superhero movies, some sort of ""Hollywood rules"" the first one being why does it always need the complete origin story? Think back to the X-Men, what made those movies so great? No origin stories, except for the movies they made that where especially for that. There they where, just being superheroes. Why not do the origin like a short flashback sorta montage like they often do in the comics? Second off you take Venom and Venom 2 even, they're always up to someone with the exact same identical powers. Why? I have no earthly idea. Part of what makes the hero so special is that he has these powers, put him up against any of the million villains Marvel has, make it otherwise challenging for the hero by having a very specific villain with a power thats hard for them to beat and they need to use their wits. If it had been up to me I would have made this another Spider-man movie and set Morbius up against him, it would have made it so much more interesting since Morbius technically isn't a villain but due to his ailment acts like one. Those where always the most amazing Spidey stories. I also feel Morbius as a character just doesn't have what it takes to carry an entire movie, and this is proof of that. Not due to Jared Leto's acting mind you, which was great as always he gave it his absolute best.

For the ridiculous 3 years wait i'd have to say I expected so much more. I wish I could give this movie a rave review but i'm sorry, I just can't.","5"
"dan428","Worth seeing in the theater","2 April 2022","I knew nothing about this movie before going.. so I had no expectations. I thought it was a really fun movie to watch, as a casual fan of Marvel movies. I also saw The Batman recently.. and I actually found Morbius much more enjoyable to watch. Batman was pretty cheesy to me.

So I was pretty shocked afterward to see how poorly rated the movie is. Yes the movie ended too soon.. it felt like it didn't have much of an ending. However I just took that to mean that it's a simple origin story setting up future movies. Admittedly that is a lazy approach but it's better than feeling like the movies being stretched too long with useless filler.. which I find the case with many films.

So if you want to see a really fun movie with exceptional sound and visuals, Morbius fits the bill for me. Just don't expect a masterpiece or a profound story.. it's clearly intended to be the first of many of the character (although given the abysmal ratings maybe that won't happen as they intended)","7"

I feel like marvel(or Sony) is just trying to add more Villains for spider-man to have. The acting is decent. The cgi can get a bit shakey at some points but other than that it is ok. The ""story"" moves very quickly and I felt like I was just thrown into a scenario that I had no background knowledge of. Some good things about this movie though is the final battle.

This feels almost like an unfinished movie or like a script that was based on several different iterations of editing, there were so many details that left me confused and not understanding how/why things were taking place. The plot is more like something that you would see in a VERY early super hero movie where things don't need to make sense, they just need to be surmounting the viewers expectations. I found myself laughing at how absurd parts of the plot were when I was explaining the movie to those who had not seen it.

"gbyzp","Believe the reviews - Don't expect to be WOWED.","11 September 2022","As someone unfamiliar with the Morbius character - I watched this movie with zero expectations and was completely disappointed. I have read reviews knocking people's negative reviews as thinking ""they are filmmakers,"" which misses the point. If the general movie VIEWING public OPINION of those who took the time to write reviews is that the movie is flawed - it is likely that the movie fails to resonate with the masses.

So as an average moviegoer who enjoys a wide variety of films I feel that the storytelling was weak and predictable. It relies heavily on CGI effects that, at times, seem to overwhelm the scenes.

Considering the mid-credits tie-in to the MCU - it will be interesting to see how big a role Morbius will play in future phases considering how unpopular it has been with viewers.","4"

If you didn't see the movie go in and watch it and make up your own mind stop letting people brain wash you without even watching it trust me it's worth it. It's a great action packed marvel movie and entertaining dark marvel fantasy. But on the other hand by far not the best marvel movie.","8"

"dorMancyx","Just Watch the Trailer","2 April 2022","Let's start of with some questions: Does changing a few nucleotides of one DNA really have an impact on the disease? Why is a Nobel Prize winner not under global scrutiny? Why is Milo under Nicholas' custody as a grown man? Why is Martine not afraid of blood suckers? Why is Michael not attracted by Nicholas's blood? How exactly does Michael transform Martine? Why is Milo's envy of Michael not mentioned previously? What does Milo want offer Michael, death or persuasion? Why are vampires not afraid of sunlight or holy water if they are ""Living Vampires""? No Way Home didn't explain this, so why and how is the Vulture sent to Sony universe? Normally when a movie gives me confusion instead of introspection, it's not a good movie. Honestly, I feel bad for Jared Leto, he seems to pay maximum effort on all his characters, but the movie's are simply not appreciated (except for Dallas Buyers Club). Go check this film out if you want to see some cool effects, but be ready to sleep your way through. Lastly, Sony, don't you dare do a sequel.","5"

Michael Keatons cameo at the end teases a Vulture movie which I am thoroughly delighted about. Hopefully more good movies to come from SONY.","6"

"funnycommentor","Just an average Marvel movie","13 December 2022","The plot of the movie was kinda interesting and I decided to watch that movie (even though, I'm not a fan of Marvel movies). The storyline was kinda uninteresting (nothing wow), but it was well-written. The characters were kinda interesting and well-developed. The filming location of the movie was just nice. Of course, it was a really intense movie and there were too many fight scenes, but none of them were epic.. Gladly, that movie had some creepy vibes and Morbiu's design was kinda scary. The CGI were just fine and the effects were okay, nothing really innovative. Overall, it was an average Marvel movie, full of battle scenes and I don't think I would watch that movie ever again.. Last but not least, if they're gonna make a sequel, I don't know if I'm gonna watch it..","6"
"guskeller","Lifeless","1 April 2022","Morbius is wasted space. The entire movie is filler, stalling until the inevitable superpower acquisition and the showdown with the hollow villain. It's baseline superhero shlock, but even its expected plot points are underwhelming because Morbius is disinterested in itself. The characters are boring, the romance is empty, the growth is stagnant, and the final fight is disappointing. Plus, Jared Leto is a complete flatline, providing no charisma or vulnerability to relate to. In every way, Morbius is void of emotional investment, leaving its blatant commercialism to stick out like a sore thumb. Simply put, Morbius is soulless.

Technically, Morbius is less incompetent but still shallow. The sound is adequate and the effects are convincing (although CGI is severely overused), but those are the only positives. The music is a cheap imitation and occasionally awkward. The production design is painfully generic, with a noticeable lack of blood. The inconsistent editing warps the pacing and jumbles action sequences. Also, the imagery is bland, dark, and cluttered, which is unpleasant and confusing. Lastly, Morbius doesn't have direction. There isn't a tone, message, or passion driving this film. It's completely stale and clearly a cash grab. Viewers beware.

"bosporan","Lightweight adaptation of a Marvel Supervillain","30 May 2022","An old fashioned Saturday-matinee, b-list, Gothic horror-flick riddled with vampire tropes built around the classic Jekyll & Hyde story. There is a whiff of Cain and Abel with brotherhood, favourite son and jealousy playing a role, with the package wrapped in a superficial comic book veneer.

On those terms, it is acceptable, but as a $75M blockbuster it fails. Sure the visuals are fabulous with the 'de rigueur' CGI, but the plot is gauche, linear and predictable.

Matt Smith is good as the antagonist and Adria Arjona (hitherto unknown to me) does well, but her part is mostly relegated to damsel in distress.

"bradjb-74783","A movie that should never have been made.","8 June 2022","First and foremost, Hollywood needs to stop casting Jared Leto in superhero movies. He is not a multifaceted actor with the depth to take on such roles.

Morbius as a film was a mess. The characters were bland, the special effects were atrociously poor, the slow motion action scenes were blatantly unnecessary and only added to it's watered down runtime. This could have been a well made movie had it been done by a different director with a more definitive, thought out vision and a better lead actor.

Jared Leto is one of the worst actors to ever live and that is on full display here, his performance in this movie is absolutely absurd, Morbius is a dull mess, from the average special effects to the badly helmed action scenes, to the generic plot and complete lack of emotion, I was completely forgetting the movie as I watched it, and that's not a good thing.

Morbius also has one of the worst post credits scenes I have ever seen and for some reason it's trying to set up its own Spider-Man universe, which is a bad idea.

For starters, the movie set my standards alright as I had more context on the main character throughout his appearances in the Spider-Man comics. There was the filler plot of the antagonist and the pacing of the movie that set my. At the same time there were mentions of the boat scene that were involved in the origin comics that pleased me a bit.

As for the visuals I enjoyed them. From the slow motion to the sonar ability. Few scenes stood out from the occasional wonky edited background. (Pretty normal for action-based film). Like I said before I was satisfied with the visual effects.

All in all it was a pretty average film for Sony. I would definitely watch it again and maybe check out the comics for Morbius. 😉","7"

When Jared Leto said the words ""its morbin time"" I felt myself elevate from the floor in the essence of greatness.

This film was enjoyable l, having no prior knowledge of the character may have been better as some seem to be annoyed with how Morbius was portrayed but it seemed fine to me and Leto was decent throughout

Yes it's a generic story but one that looks like it needs to be told this way and will only get better as more comes through.

I think people are so annoyed at the Marvel/Sony saga they can't just appreciate a decent film when they see one in a stand-alone fashion.

I'm a life-long SF and horror fan, and this movie worked for me both as a superhero movie and as a twist on the vampire genre - so double thumbs up from me! Maybe it strayed too much from the comics for some fans? Maybe some just hate Jared Leto? Maybe some are hating because the internet is too often like that (hating for the fun of it because others are doing the same)?

"Elvis-Del-Valle","A simple movie, but it's the best of Jared Leto","17 March 2023","A movie with good potential, but there was still more to offer. Jared Leto is excellent in his role as Morbius. The story is good regarding the relationship between Morbius and Milo and how their friendship turns into enmity. Although Morbius is usually a villain in the comics, here he is an anti-hero and his development and conflict between his human and vampire sides was fine. The only flaw is that it lacked more content in the plot and more action, since it feels like another vampire movie, although adapted to the most current times and more oriented towards science fiction. A pretty bland movie, but it's just the beginning of Morbius' story in the Marvel Cinematic world. My rating for this movie is 8/10.","8"

It's like Morbius came to the studio himself one day and they just started recording it's as if the movie doesn't have a script and it's just the daily shenanigans of Dr. Michael Morbius. It is easily one of, if not one of the movies of all time. It goes against cinematic norms, and decides that it is going to take a leap of faith and not stick to a script and improvise on the spot and because of that we have a truly morbtacular film. 10000 morbillion out of 10 when he said ""it's morbin' time"" I morbed all over the theater in excitement. The fact Morbius gives its fans their own empty theater, to immerse them in the Morbverse and make you feel like the man himself is morbmazing. I didn't watch Morbius, I listened.

Perhaps the director should not take the full responsibility. The corporation between Disney and Sony is pretty shaky recently, and this might disturb the filmmaking of this movie.

I am not sure if Mobius is a hero or villain, or anti hero. I am not so sure what I watched. I usually stand in the neutral position to write film reviews, but this movie's negativity is too much that I could not find anything positive to write about. I also do mind that if miss any details when I watch movies in the theaters and I rather to hold my piss, but halfway through the film, I was like, nah, I know what is gonna happen, let me take a break and do the number 1 and come back, I am not going to miss anything anyway.","2"

"deepfrieddodo","Not One to Build a Franchise From","5 April 2022","Morbius has a closer kinship to the early 2000s Marvel films than anything released recently, as poor filmmaking decisions surely sink this Sony attempt to latch onto MCU success.

The film actually starts out very promising, immediately into the story with no build up and a childhood backstory summed up in a few minutes. Unfortunately this was a precursor for the rest of the film, which also had no build up, causing the the climax to be over without knowing it's even happened.

Whilst the first half of the film is enjoyable, without being overly engaging, the last 20-30 minutes unravel anything good, as Morbius is given newfound, unexplained powers to conveniently solve his problems. Not even a single power, but in consecutive scenes a new ability pops up so he can move onto the next inconvenience.

The CGI isn't great, and whoever made the decision to add the wisps behind their fast movements, the regular slow-mo, or give the villain the ability to change his face on command, really killed off any seriousness. This film needed that seriousness to be any good.

As a villain, Milo goes from a lovely chap to insistent upon murder in a matter of minutes, and whilst Smith plays him well, there is so little to him as a character. Likewise, Leto doesn't do anything wrong in his performance, it's just not a great character. Morbius is hardly one of the A-listers in the Marvel Comics repertoire, but why make a pretty good horror based villain the hero (yet again)?

It's fairly evident that the producers had no faith in the film, seeing as how the trailer is broken up with references to Spider-Man (who is not incorporated into the film whatsoever) or Keaton as Vulture, who doesn't appear until the post-credit scenes. That is just weak.","5"

The post credit scenes make you leave the theatre wanting more. Awesome experience.","7"
"afb_bellman","Extremely underrated","16 May 2022","Morbius got a bad rap from the beginning of it's of its announcement just for the fact it isn't a Disney mavel movie.

"amichaelsmith","I have to assume the critics were out to tank the film","4 April 2022","It's literally impossible for me to reconcile the film I watched with the reviews I read in advance. I know most critics don't like comic book films but the vitriol directed at Morbius was insane. And the funny thing is that the reality is literally the opposite of what u read. The story is in fact amazing. It's dark, because it's about an anti-hero vampire. So yes, it's heavy. But that's the point. Also, it isn't ""confusing blurry cgi"" it's effective special effects capturing two vampires fighting. It's hard to understand why I have to explain that. Also they even go out of their way to complain about the post credits scenes which are only ""stupid and confusing"" if you are stupid or didn't want watch Spider-Man no way home.

In Short the movie is amazing. The action is awesome. The special effects amazing and they perfectly captured Morbius from the old comics.

The only way u can't enjoy this film is if you are trying to or if you forgot what comic book movies are all about. I'm going back next weekend and can't wait to see it again!","9"

The screenwriters left us with no end in principle, so that we would be speechless (which happened to me too), forever trapped in the abyss of the time continuum in the endless temptation of this film, until we become one with it, until we become ""MORBIUS""!! ! This movie is a typical example of CINEMA, which doesn't need a sequel to satisfy our hunger for more viewing of new scenes. And I liked the song that says ""have s*x"" the most. It's just another added bonus in the level of positivity and genius of this movie, because right now I'm going to have s*x.","4"
"dk777","A Fun Movie That Should Have Been More Brutal","3 January 2023","An interesting and entertaining film with excellent actors.

Expecting another boring ""superhero"" movie, I was pleasantly surprised. The film is first of all fun, the special effects are good, the only complaint is that it is not brutal enough. But that's the problem with PG-13 movies.

The overall impression would have been much better if they had gone one step further and made an R-rated film. Not all stories can work in a PG - 13 environment, some characters are simply not conceived that way and in the end the film turns out to be lukewarm.

Even with all these problems, the movie is fun, and the acting is great. Jared Leto is an excellent choice for the role of Morbius, and the villain is great.

Matt Smith is a fun and interesting villain and shows us what happens when the wrong people get the power.

The only real problems i see that arise is the editing...Like the opening scene.. What purpose does the 25 year flashback give the film. Nothing whatsoever. It feels like it was left in from whatever movie this was supposed to be before it was torn up and put back together. His relationship with his friend that turns evil feels like it was part of this same thing. As though it was left in by accident. Instead of forming a bond with his friend, they meet briefly once but stay in touch and are just the best friends...I guess. I think that is supposed to be the case?

Morbius kills a lot of innocent people but then immediately hates his friend for doing the same thing. It would have been a lot better if it focused on their relationship rather than shoving in a pretty girl and trying to get you to focus on her instead. And thats it. Thats all the movie needed. It feels like venom in this reguard.","6"

"movieman6-413-929510","A vampire movie with hardly any blood does not provide much tension or entertainment","19 April 2022","Morbius is a new action thriller directed by Daniel Espinosa, the director of Life and Safe House. The film is about biochemist Dr. Michael Morbius (Jared Leto). He suffers from a very rare blood disease, for which he is trying to make a medicine to cure himself and others who suffer from the same disease. He thinks he can make the medicine with the blood of vampire bats, but after a self-test with this drug, he turns himself into a living vampire.

With this film, Marvel teamed up with Sony to take their superhero film series to a more mature level, introducing horror creatures like vampires into their series. Unfortunately, she doesn't seem to dare to cross this line with the Marvel film series and really come up with 16+ films. In this vampire movie, for example, hardly any real blood comes out, because the main character chooses to use artificial blue blood. When a vampire is chasing after a human, to drink his blood, these scenes are filmed too moving and too dark. This makes it difficult to follow what happens to the victims until they end up dead on the ground even with no real obvious blood wounds. The blood that you occasionally see on some victims comes across as unrealistic because of the too dark color.

For example, they seem to try to keep the film child-friendly, despite it being sold as a 16+ film in some countries and making it difficult for younger teenagers to watch the film. Other teen vampire movies like even Twilight went more in the horror direction with the blood consumption and vampire actions. The horror moments that appear in the film are mainly standard clichés from horror films, which are on the predictable side due to their familiarity and if not really scary or exciting. The story continues at a rushed pace, jumping from place to place alone so that the story can move forward. The story is also on the predictable side, which allows you as a viewer to predict what is about to come and so you can get ahead of the story. Despite the fast pace, the trite story is still long-winded and so uninteresting. In addition to its own trite story, the film also copies moments from other films such as Batman Begins and almost loses its originality. References that the film makes to other Sony Marvel films also make the film unnecessarily complicated, because it is sometimes difficult to understand in which film series this film is set. The scenes during the credits only make this more chaotic, so that some good previous films from the Marvel series can now also come across as a little less. The visual effects don't look all that believable either. When someone changes into his vampire form, it sometimes seems like a simple snapchat filter or a cheap layer of makeup. When characters use their powers, it resembles scenes from old video games from older game consoles such as the Playstation 2. The fact that the superpowers are further placed around the characters with CGI is also clearly visible, but what the characters do exactly remains unclear. In the end battle it seems like two CGI clouds keep flying against each other until there is a winner. The acting is also nothing special. Despite the lesser script, Jared Leto doesn't even add much uniqueness to the film. In his earlier acting work, he still knew what to do with his film roles, so that you remembered the character played by him after this film. His characters are very repetitive here when, for example, he drinks the artificial blood from blood bags. The rest of the film cast doesn't get much to work with either. Matt Smith manages to steal the movie as the movie's most interesting character, but other great ones like Jared Harris and Michael Keaton actually waste their time and acting talent more in this movie.","3"
"Ronirunning","Love the character, but the story; no","25 July 2022","Compared to some of the reviews, I actually really liked Jared Leto as Morbius. He is an odd character which he plays well, but it also feels like he doesn't get any room to truly act. I also think Morbius himself is actually a really cool character that could have a great story to tell. This is just not it..

This movies suffers from either terrible writing or terrible editing. Probably both. The story starts of rather good but as soon as Morbius is introduced it all just becomes a mess. The Milo story makes absolutely no sense and tyrese Gibson as an FBI agent? That was probably one of the worst ideas ever. And the FBI that just kinda accepts Morbius having a lust for blood? Like it is just a normal day. The action scenes feel rushed, In these scenes you can see how cool Morbius could have been. Actually, everything feels rushed. Maybe this movie and this character just really suffer from not having an R- rating. Maybe then they could have done more with the story.

I hope Leto will get a second chance in a second movie with a WAY better story.

In my opinion they should only have focused on Morbius himself. Maybe like this:

Morbius finds a cure. At first he feels great, even becomes a bit cocky. Starts to enjoy life and starts drinking and finally goes out. Doing things he never could. But then strange things start to happen. Just little things. He wakes up without knowing how he got to his bed ( maybe the alcohol) then the next morning he wakes up with his jacket missing, then he wakes up with blood on his clothes.

Meanwhile you hear about a killing spree on the news. Morbius finds it horrible but doesn't think anything of it. Then his behavior starts to slowly change. He is becoming more agitated and aggressive, ( his alter ego starts to scratch the surface) but people around him just see it as cocky and arrogant. Then one day a little girl is brought into the hospital. She is a survivor of the killer. Her parents are both dead and she won't make it either. Morbius has to threat her and is horrified by what he sees and hears. She looks familiar, but he just dismisses it.

Right before she dies she recognizes something about Morbius that her attacker also had. Maybe a ring or a necklace or something. She starts to scream and then dies in horror. Morbius is horrified by what happened and suddenly starts to get flashbacks.

Then he starts to research her attack and he finds out her parents also look familiar. He starts digging deeper and learns that al the victims look familiar and he starts getting more and more horrific flashbacks.

Eventually he finds out what really happened and is overcome with guild. That's when he needs to learn more about his alter ego and how to control its needs. And eventually fuse with his alter ego for something heroic.

No villain is introduced yet. Morbius is the villain of his own movie.","6"

"hoernkeem","Morbius (2022, Daniel Espinosa) Sony tries to fill out their live action Spiderverse, but this origin story is incredibly basic","12 May 2022","Sony doesn't really have anything on Disney/Marvel's MCU level that they can leverage into a legitimate expanded universe, but what they do have, for the most part, is Spider-Man, and apparently all the characters that exist in the Spider-Man comics. Armed with that information and fresh off the success of both the Tom Holland Spider flicks (which are sort of MCU/Sony hybrids) and 'Venom' Sony is attempting to establish a live action Spider-verse expanded universe. With that Jared Leto takes up the lead role in 'Morbius' who is a vampire and, I believe, a Spider-Man antagonist. I will admit to not having an extreme depth of knowledge in the lore and lineage of Spider-Man's rogues gallery therefore I can only confine my thoughts to what Sony actually put on screen. Daniel Espinosa, who previoiusly directed the film 'Life', was tapped to helm after Sony failed to convince Antoine Fuqua or F. Gary Gray to direct. Jared Leto appears in the lead role with prominent supporting roles going to Matt Smith, Jared Harris and Adria Arjona. This fits solidly into the origin story superhero genre.

We are introduced to a 10 year old Michael Morbius who has an incurable blood disease and is living in a hospital/orphanage in Greece. He goes through friends at such a high rate that he just takes to calling them Milo. The latest Milo, actually Lucien, sticks around a while and becomes Michael's lifelong friend, played as an adult by Matt Smith. The hospital director Nicholas, played by Jared Harris, becomes a proxy father to them both. Michael is brilliant and invents a synthetic blood that changes the world and even wins him a Nobel prize. He is driven on a quest to cure his and thereby his friend Milo's disease. This leads him to some very risky propositions in an effort to push medicine forward before he succumbs. He captures a bunch of very specific vampire bats in Costa Rica and eventually has success splicing their genes along with that of a humans which he thinks will cure him. He uses himself as a guinea pig and the results, as you can plainly see, cause him to become a vampire. He realizes that while this ""cure"" gives him superhuman abilities it comes with a desire for blood. Conveniently the synthetic blood can stop him from feasting on humans, but soon humans around him start dying, drained of blood and he is wondering if his vampire alter ego is taking control. Come to find out his bestie, without the moral qualms of a doctor, has filched this serum and is rampaging as an unabashed bloodsucker loving his new found power, and it is up to Morbius to stop him before it is too late.

This film was widely panned by both fans and critics. I did not hate the general concept and I thought the special effects were decent despite some trashing them. They were much better than I thought they would be. The problem is you're taking an antagonist who is a vampire, which is antithetical to being human and a doctor, and you are devising a way to keep him as the good guy rather than treating him as a bad guy or even as an antihero. Really this film wants him to be a genuine hero attempting to make a lot of right decisions in a situation that is nothing but wrong. Like I said not knowing anything about the character I do not know how the comic book handles any of this, and honestly I don't really care to delve into it so I am uncertain on whether or not he is just a Spider-Man bad guy or an antihero of some sort or some other cross-pollination of these concepts. Here though what they try to do with him fails to some degree. Really, more than the failure of Leto's Morbius, is the complete bungling of the film's antagonist role. Matt Smith is set up as the best friend who caves in to his inner bestial mentality when he takes the serum and becomes a vampire now setting him up at odds with his life long friend. There was a miniscule attempt to set this up, however, it is completely foreseeable from predicable plot standpoint. It was so incredibly basic and lazy storytelling and, to me, it is the movie's greatest flaw. While many call this movie complete trash I would not go that far. I think there is some mild entertainment here to be had, but the movie is still far from good, and while it attempts to set up future films in this Sony Spider-verse world I find it hard to believe, given the generally negative reception, that this character, or at least Leto's version of it, will be featured in any future projects.

"bdo-lara","I didn't get bored","9 October 2022","I expected the worse movie ever. The ending is not very satisfactory and post credit scenes are as lame as they can be. However, I must say I didn't get bored and it is a good movie if that is what you're looking for.

The acting is ok, the effects are a little lame, and there are actions scenes where you don't know what the hell is going on. But again, I wasn't expecting a master piece and it is just fine compared with some Marvel movies. The female lead is a highlight and Leto does a good job. Certainly it can be better, but it is not the horrible film that some critics make it out to be. At least it is not boring and that is 50% of the goal of superhero movie.","6"

"jaspercobar","It's the biggest peace of dog poo","28 June 2023","I'm glad I watched this movie late at night. Because if I watched it in the daytime I would've wasted heaps of time, because there is so much better things that I could've done. I think Morbius is a really bad ass powerful character, but this is a bad way to introduce him. I want to see him in a movie fighting Spider Man or something. Not his boring origin story, and his boring relationship with Milo, and then Milo turning evil. It was very similar to Venom, and I absolutely loved Venom, but I absolutely hated this. It was just Venom with poor cgi and vfx, and bad dialogue, and bad story. If you ignore those things though then you will probably really enjoy the movie. They are hard to ignore though so that's why I hated it.","5"
"ryanpersaud-59415","Better Than I Thought It'd Be, But Still Lame","15 October 2022","The Good: There's a point in Morbius where Matt Smith's character, Milo, completely steals the show. As a huge Doctor Who fan (and a fan of Smith's Doctor) my head canon is that this movie falls the Doctor when he's away from his companions and is indulging in his dark, misanthropic fantasies.

I don't know, it makes every scene funnier to me, and he basically acts like the Doctor by the end of the film, so it's fine. When this movie is actually entertaining and memorable, it's when he's on the screen.

I was genuinely surprised how good he was in this movie; he and Leto have good chemistry and I could buy that they're friends. I also really like the make up and effects in this movie; yes they looked like these guys were wearing foam faces at one point, but it was actually pretty effective.

The Bad: Yeah, this is a bad movie overall. It's not even funny bad, like Venom, although it comes close at times. The script is frankly atrocious, with multiple bad lines and nonsensical plot points. (The whole international waters thing broke my brain) The movie seems to lack enough material for a plot and none of the characters are particularly interesting, least of all Morbius himself.

This film has probably the worst cop duo I've ever seen. Tyrese is really phoning it in and the other guy is almost too eccentric, so much so that he feels out of place at times. The love interest (I honestly forgot her name)

It also has some of the worst action I've ever seen. The filmmakers were clearly unable to film action, so they substituted it for slow mo and weird lines coming from the vampires to mimic speed. You get a really jumbled, unappealing mess that it's hard to make sense of.

And of course, this movie's biggest sin is its bloodlessness. For a film about vampires, it's a sin for this movie to substitute actual red blood for weird black blood that they try and fool us with. There are moments when even a little blood spurting out would just add to the realism (as in, they didn't need to make it an R rated movie).

Leto is fine, but he's also extremely boring and there's not much to say about him, really.

The Ugly: Yes, Morbius isn't a good movie. Is it as bad as the memes make it out? No. I just think the idea of a Morbius film was so ridiculous to Spider-man fans, it prompted this (disproportionate) reaction.

To be fair, the Spidey references in this movie (Venom, the Daily Bugle, Vulture) are frankly embarassing. This movie desperately wants you to remember Spider-man, hoping for enough of a nostalgia hit to fool you into thinking this is a good movie.","4"
"nicorip22","Very bad movie","7 June 2022","I find this movie very bad, not to say a disaster. The plot it has is very basic and everything is resolved very quickly. In addition to all this movie must have the worst villain of all marvel.","2"
"Ni_the_Black_Knight","Outstanding . . . Emotional . . . Timeless","27 December 2022","What is there to say about Morbius? Here are a few things: I have never felt so deeply connected to another character in cinema. Perhaps no one has. From the moment I saw his morbtastic face, I felt as though I had known him my whole life. We grew up together. We laughed together. We cried together. We sung songs of tulips and daisies, arms interlocked, skipping down the streets like a couple of schoolgirls together. Morbius took me on an emotional rollercoaster I will never recover from, and with years of intensive therapy, I'm sure I'll come to forgive him.

The next topic to cover in this masterpiece of a film is the story. It twists, it turns, it twists again, and when you expect a turn, it does just that. It took my bare expectations and it met them with flying colours. Move aside Spielberg, the real moviemakers are in town. Morbius broke all the rules, and then re-wrote them . . . Just to break them a second time, but who can blame him? Morbius follows no rules, bows to no king, follows no Geneva Convention. He just does something, anything, and you respond with: ""alright.""

My final note is on the production as a whole. The effects were so groundbreaking, I forgot I was watching a movie at all. The score gently caressed my mind, enhancing the more emotional or tense moments of the film, but never interfered. The thought put into the background of each of the characters felt as though we were looking into a real scene, with real people doing real things, and when the movie ended, I had absolutely no unanswered questions. I only had one thing in mind: ""it's Morbin' time.""

Truly, Morbius is a movie like no other, and may Morbius live on forever in our hearts. Morbius' legacy will outlast humanity, and as our sun swells into a supermassive red star, swallowing the solar system, there will only be Morbius left, the way it was meant to be.

Total 2.25/10

I recently had the misfortune to watch Morbius. A picture I'd been eagerly awaiting. Even after reading some of the reviews and seeing the IMDb rating, I was hesitant, though not put off. Let me assure you that the rating on IMDb is overinflated. Not only is Morbius a bad movie it's one of the worst big-budget flicks I've seen. And that's so much worse because they had the budget to better it: So, it would appear they didn't care.

The story is simplistic, with terrible structuring and horrendous characterisations and situations. The two PC Plods on the trail of the Vampire Killer don't bat an eyelid or miss a breath when they realise it's an actual Vampire killer. They merely bust out their fang-killing weapons. Stupido. There was a nice touch of having the good guy and the bad guy being childhood chums... but they weren't, because the writers failed to bring in any relationship between the two. They're not even ships passing in the night. The possibilities this should've opened up! And then you have the fact that most of the characters are two-dimensional and lack empathetic traits, making it difficult for the audience to relate. So, in the end, the viewer doesn't give two figs about anyone on the screen.

It then gets worse when the director moves behind the camera. OMG! This film couldn't have looked more amateurish, even if they pulled some random Joe or Jane public off the street and told them to film the movie in the style of an amateur with Parkinson's disease. If you think I'm being harsh, watch the movie - and that would serve you right for not taking my word for it. But the shaky camera and poor composition aren't the worst. No! Coming from Marvel, a company with one of the best rosters of comic book artists, I found it amazing how weak the effects appeared: Moreover, how ridiculous they looked. What the hell is that dusty gunk coming off the vamps when they move? Judging by the colours, it's not just them but their clothing. Evidently, they move so fast that skin and material shed off them in clouds of coloured dust. If that were the case, the vampires would be naked in a few seconds. Sorry, guys and gals, that's not the case - all the fang brigade stay clothed. It's just a nonsensical effect that isn't that effective. And, as for the pacing, one word - Yawnfest. Had the story possessed body and soul and had the actors and actresses received proper direction, the slow pace would've allowed the story and characters growth - but it doesn't, making a tedious tempo, at best.

Next, we get to the cast, and I admit I was gobsmacked at how awful the leading men are in this mess. You'd've thought actors of their calibre would've been...better. Everyone else in this film is more enjoyable than these two - and I didn't enjoy everyone else. I thought Leto's moody sulkiness was depressingly bad enough, and then Smith danced...if you want to call it that. His dancing surpasses dad dancing, which you can laugh at while cringing. With Smith, you just cringe. Smith, at least, tries to instil a character into his portrayal, but it doesn't work. Leto, well, he got paid. His performance is exampled best in the tagged-on ""Teaser Ending"", a constant in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. It's evident from the appalling FX that Leto and Keaton are not on set together, but Morbius' reply to The Vulture is so bad that I can still smell it. Leto doesn't even attempt to sell it.

All in all, I would highly recommend everyone to stay away from this Vampire Turkey. I loved the concept of Morbius and remembered him from the 1970s Marvel Horror Comics, where Blade (A Superbly Better Movie) also made his appearance. And, later, when he fought against and with Spiderman. He was a fave of mine. Sadly, this movie does the character no justice whatsoever. If you want a Marvel vampire fix, watch Blade, even the TV series.

I really thought it was gonna be good, but not the tick of one simple vampire bite. Jared Leto was ehh okay, but not that good as Morbius. Daniel Espinosa is a good director from his previous films, but this movie he made was a little way off, probably cause of Jared if I might add. It should've been Ian Somerhalder that could play the role of Morbius. I think that would be a perfect role for Ian, cause he did an amazing job playing Damon Salvatore from Vampire Diaries. Morbius was not that good like the Venom movies with Tom Hardy. And the problem is that Sony had to go on and spoil the ending post credits! And the CGI effects was pretty messed up and the writing was bad and Matt Smith was pretty funny with his part. What the hell, Sony? Thanks for ruining the film, butt holes!","5"

"xiaoli7377","Completely Forgettable","14 May 2022","Jared Leto. Hollywood's new punching bag? Between his goofy take on the Joker, his terrible Mario brother impression in ""House of Gucci"" and this dud of a movie, I think it's safe to say that he has some work to do if he wants to get back in the game.

The first half hour of this movie is somewhat decent. Nothing great. When Michael Morbius gets his powers, it goes downhill. There's basically no plot to be spoken of. The CGI is terrible. The villain is just not interesting at all, he has no motive other than a new-found god complex. Matt Smith just looks so bad with the CG face effects.

A complete throwaway movie. The best scene is one of the post-credit scenes. Which merely acts as a teaser for more entries into Sony's Spiderverse. Which I'm honestly not too keen on following after this mess.

One saving grace is that the movie is pretty short for a superhero adventure so not too much of your time will be wasted if you want to check it out while channel surfing and it pops up on FXM on a Tuesday night next year.","4"

Jared Leto did a horrible performance, he had no emotional depth whatsoever. Matt Smith was more cringey than ever but was somehow was the best thing about the film. The CGI is horrendous, and this is from the company that made Venom and The Amazing Spiderman films. Although not all perfect films, the CGI normally at least looks fine. But in Morbius, it looks straight up bad and underbudget. The writing is so rushed it makes venom feel less rushed. All the characters relationships all seem super fake and when Matt Smith starts to fight Morbius it comes out of nowhere why he would fight his only friend. Overall this is just a poorly made film on every front. There is nothing enjoyable to come out of this, and I don't recommend watching it.","3"

"jgarrisononline","Maybe I saw a different Morbius?","3 April 2022","No spoilers here. I watched this in Dolby Cinema and WOW!! From start to finish this was very enjoyable for me and my family, and they are not that into the marvel universe like me. This stands on its own as a movie even if you're not invested in the marvel stories. And shout out to Matt Smith who gave such a fantastic performance I think he deserves some kind of award. Jared Leto was also fantastic so I'm really finding it difficult to see what people didn't like about the movie. But I have a few guesses which I will list below.

1. It's way less comical and cheesy than other marvel films (which I loved for a change) and is more on the serious side.

2. This is more of a vampire film than the typical marvel superhero style (which I also loved)!

3. It aims for something completely different than what Marvel usually does and again, I loved that about the movie.

If you're looking for typical goofy marvel banter and don't enjoy the more serious side of comic book movies, this may not be for you. But if you want to see a kick ass vampire origin story with some great acting, then this is for sure a must see! I can't wait to rewatch this as I found it greatly entertaining. If you want to let people who look at their phone every 5 minutes, get up and go to the bathroom 2-3 times during the movie and step out to answer phone calls, then come back in barely knowing what's happened in the movie, if you want THAT kind of person telling you if a movie is good or not, I pray for you. Because no the movie isn't perfect, but it is by far nowhere near the ratings on this site. Matt Smith and Jared Letos performances alone are worth watching. So go see it for yourself and stop letting idiots keep you from enjoying movies!","10"

"ajrepairman","It's disruptive even as background noise","6 July 2022","I tried to watch it. It has the standards you would see of a professionally done film, so I had to give it the benefit of the doubt for as long as possible. But... there were problems.

First problem. The mutation made Jared Leto even uglier. This made it hard for me to watch the screen continuously.

Second problem. The story was extremely predictable. There was this huge focus on charactever development for the first part of the movie (the part I was able to watch). And there was no emotional connection, partially due to the sound effect work, and partially due to being, well, uninteresting.

Third problem. I tried to play with my phone for the rest of the film after becoming bored and kinda grossed out. But the video and sound editing were seemingly disruptive by design. I wasn't completely sure anymore, but the scenes seemed to cut into each other with the audio bleeding over from the next scene before the camera cuts.

Fourth problem. The audio itself was absolutely gnarly. I didn't want to hear it. I'd rather listen to a dog eat pig vomit.

The writing feels very half baked as if the writers didn't finish the story and just went with what was written. Hell, Leto kills the villain in the last like minute of the movie. No kind of calm after. The movie just ends there. It feels like they wanted to do more but were just too lazy to do it. The actual story is incredibly boring and confusing. Scenes just kind of happen with a very thin reasoning for it. The film doesn't truly know what it wants to be. There really aren't any characters here. No one has any sort of character journey or arc. They just do things because the plot tells them to. Matt Smith's goal in the movie is just that he wants to kill people. This isn't established at all in the flashbacks or even in the present day. He just wants to. Speaking of Matt Smith, he is easily my favorite aspect of the movie. Call if Doctor Who Bias but Matt Smith knew what this movie should have been. A goofy comic book movie and he absolutely 100% delivers on that. His presence and performance genuinely made this film so much easier to get through and his performance is truly great even if he has no character. Jared Leto is just kind of there. His performance really isn't good or bad. Not worth doing all of that awful method acting he was doing for this movie. The post credit scene is probably one of if not the worst post credit scenes ever made. It completely character assassinated Michael Keaton's Vulture in the span of 30 seconds and it feels like an afterthought and that they filmed it the day before the movie released. If you were to see this movie, watch it with friends. It's probably more enjoyable that way because you'll most likely being making fun of it the whole time.","2"
"thePopcornExplorer","Hollywood learned nothing?","24 May 2022","It feels I am stuck in the early 2000s when super hero movies where taking off after watching this... What a mess I don't even know where to start, have the writers / director been stuck in the past somehow? I know this was going to be bad but I still wanted to give it a watch, I don't know why I subjected myself to this..

Morbius has every bad thing that you would expect from a super hero movie, the CGI is insanely awful (I mean you can see it in the trailer), no single person on the movie is interesting, plain boring characters that you will make zero connections to. It's filled with clichés, from the over the top villain, the support blend romance interest (?) of the protagonist, the cheesy detectives who make 2 or 3 appearances and have absolutely no relevance to the story whatsoever, the bad attempts at humor with the vampire jokes... Who actually thought that this was a good final product..? I mean considering the good stuff that has been put out lately specially on the super hero genre, how on Earth a big studio with a huge budget makes this atrocity?

Nothing going on makes any sense whatsoever, these kind of movies are pure fantasy but usually there's an attempt even if fictional to make sense of the plot and the fantasy bits, but this is plain and simply ridiculous and are you really that psychotic that you witness someone killing 8 people out of the blue and still wish to protect that person without even questioning it, as a medical doctor?

Also Jared Leto does a very poor job here, I know he has some great acting skills even though he is not one of my favorites but here he seems to struggle to find the character, he seems dark even before the transformation, but then we are suppose to believe that he grows a conscience and had a hard time accepting what he has done... Or maybe the character is very very poorly written..

Either way, putting it short, don't watch, don't support it, I don't know what the end goal was but they failed miserably.","1"
"mbgov","A bad copy of other vampire movies","2 June 2023","First off, if Marvel wants a vampire movie that badly then focus on Blade. If Morbius had stuck to being a vampire movie I might have given it a higher rating. Don't get me wrong I love a good vampire movie but sadly, the more I watched, all I saw was cheap knockoffs of Dracula Untold and the ultimate vampire movie, The Lost Boys. Some scenes were damn near identical. The ONLY thing I liked was Morbius's black trench coat with the purple silk lining. That being said, the end credit scenes were pretty cool and if you watch it on a streaming network, I recommend skipping the entire movie and just watch those instead.","4"

"Stanlee107","Vampire/ blade spin off?!","2 April 2022","It is watchable. It borrows elements from Doctor Strange and Blade. It could have been a huge hit but I would say it is lukewarm at best. When the antagonist Milo (Matt Smith) is more sympathetic than the protagonist Morbius (Jared Leto) then there is something missing or perhaps wrong about this film. The specials effects are decent & I think Marvel films have almost perfected the blueprints for doing this well.

It is better than the Eternals but the bar to achieving that feat is not set that high. Marvel films have set such high standards over the years/past 2 decades that the average films like this sticks out like a sore thumb. Maybe if this was a DC film then people might rave about it more so.. & would be considered a decent attempt from DC films.

Also, the fact Sony made this a PG rating to attract a larger audience may be too its own detriment. It should have been r rated; see how well the blade trilogy did. It is not a vampire film without the blood! What you get without it is poor excuse of a vampire film/franchise aka The Twilight Saga!","5"
"abgkb","Average","12 February 2023","If this movie was released a decade ago, i would give a 8 star. But after watching dozens of movies like Morbious, it will be considered as an average movie. Though it was entertaining but failed to produce a plot which is out of the box.

Dr. Micheal Morbious was born with a rare blood disease which is leading him to death. His mate Milo is also in the same situation as morbious is. So Morbious sacrificed his life to invent the cure of the disease and found a hope with bat gene. But experiment goes wrong and disaster begin to happen. This is the storyline in simple words. Jerad Leto is a genius actor and portrayed Joker in DC Universe. But Morbiuos did not let him utilized his best as there were nothing in the sript for him. But an intriguing situation will come at the end of the movie as Morbious is started to connect with the rest of the Marvel Universe. Hope next movie will portray character Morbious more strongly and will use the best of Leto.","6"
"dhruvrajraulji","Not as bad as most people made it out to be","5 April 2022","So, is Morbius as bad as the critics claim. I would like to differ to that opinion. Yes, you cannot compare it to movies like Black Panther, Avengers or even any Spider-Man MCU movie but it is an entertaining movie. I would say it's better than a lot of those mediocre superhero movies. Yeah the post-credits don't make sense but that's not the movie right. I like the acting by both Matt Smith and Jared Leto, their chemistry is great. Jared Leto gave his all. The acts are not that well differentiated but the fight sequences are great especially the slowed ones, it just feels like an immersive experience. I like the way the powers of vampires are portrayed. The movie feels like a typical superhero movie with a backstory and a proper conclusion. I don't know what the fuss is all about. Though yeah if you expect an avengers level movie you will be disappointed a lot but you know not to expect that it's a low-budget superhero movie. I hope my opinion makes you alteast try you watch that on an ott and not on the cinema. But well let's see what Sony can do.","7"
"CommonSenseCritic","Morbius Common Sense Review","7 July 2023","Wow was this film a disappointing disaster. I enjoy Leto as an actor and thought it was great casting, I'm also a huge fan of the source material due in large part to the 90s/2000s Spider-Man cartoon. Unfortunately, no matter how much I wished this movie to be good, it was really, really bad. A disconnected plot filled with placeholder characters with the depth of a cardboard cutout essentially repelled audiences like garlic to a vampire. There are some interesting story ideas and some of the slow-mo shots are cool, but this film overall was an absolute dud.

What were your thoughts on the film?","3"
"drewvogelaar","Its Morbin Time Baby","11 January 2023","I saw this as soon as it was released. What interested me the most was all the hate it was getting online. I also dislike Jared Leto as an actor, so my expectations were as low as they could be. I'd love to say that the hate wasn't warranted. I'd also like to say that Suicide Squad (2016) wasn't made, but it was. It did become the first film to bomb at the box office twice. So I wasn't the only one who was disappointed. I really tried to remain optimistic about this. I just couldn't take it seriously.

To say this was bad is an understatement. Morbius has a mixture of problems that make it terrible. The acting of Jared Leto as Morbius is something that I've come to expect from him. This is definitely one of his career-worst roles. Leto is known as a ""Method Actor."" Someone who becomes very immersed in his roles. His role in Dallas Buyers Club was amazing. He also isn't a terrible actor by any means. He's just an actor who takes some ridiculous roles. Leto wasn't even the worst part; that was the CGI. The CGI in this is egregiously terrible. For an over 80 million dollar budget, you would expect CGI that doesn't look like 50 bucks. Its lowest point was the fight scenes between Michael and Milo. My final criticism would be of the post-credit scene. Michael Keaton reprises his role of Vulture for the multiple post-credit scenes. I was confused because it doesn't add much to the story and it would have been easier to explain this in a sequel than in a thirty-second post-credit scene. This film wasn't without some merits. It was unintentionally hilarious. Between the acting and CGI, I found myself constantly laughing. Overall a bad film with few redeeming qualities.

"yeqks","Down there with ""Green Lantern"" and ""Supergirl"" with the worst superhero films I've ever ever seen","1 April 2022","Yeah it's just as bad, maybe even worse than everyone's saying. It's a film farted out by Sony as a shameless attempt at starting their own marvel universe by picking an unknown character and quickly dumping out a crappy film to capitalize on the Batman hype. I am being 100% truthful and honest with you this movie had barely any effort put into it at all, it just feels like a complete cashgrab, this is the superhero movie equivalent of a straight to VOD late career Bruce Willis movie.

Okay, let's start with the positives.... uhhhh.... I guess the production design was okay? It wasn't really shot all too poorly, I think? I mean there are indeed some really flat shots and ugly sequences but it's not all bad, and that's where the list of positives end.

Now let me be clear: I hate writing super negative reviews because it feels like I'm bullying the people who worked on this, movies are hard to make and all, but I have next to no sympathy for studio cashgrab movies they had the budget to make it good and took the easy way out, I do feel bad for Jared Leto and Matt Smith, I love Matt, and I want him to be in better stuff, but he's awful in this. I have a really hard time blaming Leto and Smith for their bad performances because it honestly doesn't entirely feel like their fault, rather it feels as though the writers are to blame. The script is dinosaur dung incarnate, I have no idea how someone proof read this and said ""yeah that's good,"" Morbius and Milo have 0 character whatsoever, no defining character traits, no development, no depth, not even a motive, no that's not a joke they have no motive whatsoever. Milo was crippled as a kid and he was bullied as a kid now he wants vampire powers so he can walk and kill people who aren't crippled? I say this as a question because that's what I thought his motive was until it just changed at the middle, he just becomes a bad guy who wants to kill Morbius for some unspoken reason; I assume it's because Morbius didn't give him the serum when he asked for it, but not only is this poorly conveyed to the viewer, but it's such petty drama and makes his character look like a giant child.

Morbius is just a doctor guy I honestly don't know what his goal even is or who he's supposed to be, he has a love interest but the romance is soooo forced, him and his lady friend share 3 scenes together, kiss, and that's it. They have 0 reason to be together at all, and the woman who plays his lady friend was a bad actress as well. There's two detective characters who they keep cutting back to but they're completely pointless, in fact, they just forget about them by the end of the movie. The ""jokes"" in this movie were hilarious, so hilarious in fact, that whenever they said a joke, NOBODY in my theater laughed. I think I heard a guy cough once. And talk about cliche, holy crap this movie follows that marvel formula to a tee, even ending with that same goddamn giant cgi epilepsy fight, but this time it's so unbelievably lame and uninspired, and there's no reason for it to happen at all. The cgi was terrible, it might've been worse than Venom, it feels so tryhardy, like this movie really wants you to think it looks cooler than it actually does. Some really goofy stuff happens in this movie as well but it's so far and few between that it makes it so you can't even watch it in the same way as Venom. Characters will die and it makes no impact at all because they aren't fleshed out in the slightest, and don't get me started on Morbius's powers, he can like glide on wind or something, he can't do it when he needs to fly off a building but he can fly... in front of a train? What? And even though he says he has ""bat sonar"" it's just super hearing, like do the writers even know what sonar is? The ending in this movie was horrible sequel bait nonsense, it was completely unsatisfying and just stupid this whole movie is so stupid and it doesn't even know it.

Do not waste your time or money viewing this piece of trash, it is boring nonsense from start to finish, it not a so bad it's good movie like venom, more of a so pathetic it's dull type of movie.","2"

There is a element that as a stand alone film its ending isn't exactly the best, but this movie at least wasn't designed to be or originally expected to be a stand alone. The ending is a setup for a sequel and universe building. Within that context with these superhero movies all doing that each one is a movie-espisode in a series by a design and at this point anyone not expecting that or kind if wanting that, is watching the wrong genre.","9"
"Coventry","More bat-man than Batman","14 July 2022","When it comes to comic book adaptations, and the Marvel Universe in particular, my 13-year-old son teaches me who's who in the superhero community, what their background stories are, and how the characters link together over different movies/franchises. When I want to teach my 13-year-old son about genuine cinematic landmarks and cult classics, well... he isn't interested.

So, if I understood Junior correctly, Morbius is a supportive character/occasional villain in the Spider-Man comics, but - like Venom and Joker - he received his very own spin-off movie simply because comic book adaptations are hugely popular and profitable. In case of ""Morbius"", it's clearly just to make easy money because the plot is derivative and unoriginal. Since birth, Michael Morbius suffers from a rare but serious blood disease, and he spends his entire youth in a specialized hospital with, as his only friends, companion-in-suffering Milo and Dr. Emil Nicholas. But Michael is also a brilliant and naturally born gifted biochemist and he starts working on unorthodox cures for himself and Milo. He reaches an astounding breakthrough when he mixes his own blood with the DNA of bats, but - surprise - the treatment has monstrous side-effects.

I don't want to sound too skeptical, because my son enjoyed it very much, and probably millions of Marvel/comic book movie fanatics with him, but ""Morbius"" only stands out in pure nothingness. The story is predictable and flat, the characters are bland, the digital effects are pitiable, and the amount of bloodshed/violence is kept to a miserable minimum to make sure a PG-13 rating could be obtained. Sorry, that sounded quite skeptical after all.","3"

"Forsenlol","To be fair, you need to have a very high IQ to understand Morbius (2022)","3 April 2022","I went to watch this masterpiece with my wife Nina and dog Peppah. The humor is extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of theoretical physics most of the jokes will go over a typical viewer's head. There's also Dr Michael's nihilistic outlook, which is deftly woven into his characterisation - Morbius declining the Pulitzer Prize subtly referencing his personal philosophy which draws heavily from Narodnaya Volya literature. The real fans understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of the story, to realise that this is not your everyday Marvel movie, Morbius has a deeper meaning about Life.

Every single second of this 4 hour 2 minute thriller was action packed - there were multiple times throughout the film when I forgot that I wasn't actually sitting alone in a cold and dark theatre.

As a consequence, people who dislike Morbius aren't that smart - of course they wouldn't appreciate, for instance, the subtle nuance in Dr Morbius' existential forehead tattoo ""Damaged"" which itself is a cryptic reference to Dostoevsky's Russian epic The Brothers Karamazov. I'm smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated ""critics"" scratching their heads in confusion as Zack Snyder's genius unfolds itself on their television screens.

The only thing that I can think of that's negative about this film is that there weren't enough cameos from the Marvel Cinematic Universe.

"tkmce2008","Horrendous!","3 April 2022","Morbius is proof that it is time for Sony Pictures to hand over their Marvel properties to Disney. They only have one redeeming factor and that is the animated Spidey movie. Delayed multiple times due to Covid, this superhero film should have opted for a direct to streaming path instead. It would have got many more viewers that way.

Morbius is the story of Michael Morbius, who suffers from a rare blood disease. To find a cure, he captures vampire bats and tries to splice their genes with his. He is successful but the experiment also changes him into a bloodthirsty vampire. Rest of the plot: anyone can put that together with the help of one small detail - Michael has a friend with the same blood disease.

Morbius is an interesting character but neither Jared Leto nor the makers have made a genuine attempt at making something substantial here. Even at 105 minutes, the film takes a toll on you just as Morbius would have if he sucked your blood. Even @venommovie with its pathetic plot is better because it had a very interesting lead pair in Venom & Brock. The film co-stars Matt Smith as Michael's friend turned foe, Adria Arjona, Jared Harris, Al Madrigal, Tyrese Gibson and Michael Keaton, who reprises his role as Adrian Toomes.

There isn't a single thing that is redeemable from this superhero film. The plot is non-existent, the characters are half-baked, the CGI is pathetic and the mid-credit scene doesn't make any sense because it just won't work!!!!

The detectives are puny humans, the screenplay development basically near nil, putting all its valiant efforts in the VFX/CGI section to save the day and in the end, aside the interesting Martine sub-plot put in for a sequel, crashes marvelously, basically counting its viewers' IQ on par with toads'.

The credit is too stupid to even talk about.

So, basically, they made a movie to be watched on the big screen with low-mode night vision cause in the theaters' darkness you would in theory discern something!

"Njinked","Disappointed","2 April 2022","Really looked forward to this movie, especially since it was pushed back almost 2 years because of the pandemic. Was excited to watch this movie, unfortunately it was a pretty big let down. There's not much good to say about it. Special effects, CGI was a huge letdown, the story was no big deal, lots of loopholes. The story was boring, the love interest - all of it just was a huge letdown. If it wasn't for Jared Leto, this movie would already be in and out of the theater or probably would not have even made it to the theater. - sad to say all this cause I really wanted to like it.","4"
"orionhi","Disappointing","23 June 2022","There was no character development at all. You feel no connection anyone in this movie. There is no feeling at all because the movie didn't go step 1, 2, 3. It went 1,5,8. Like during editing the cut some major plot points to add more action but it screwed the movie. Maybe we'll get luck and they'll make 6 more movies like they did Spider-Man and someone will get it right.","2"
"john_c-96391","Fairly faithful to the original character","25 June 2022","I knew, when I saw this, that it would have a lukewarm reception, because of how choppy it is, and how it seems to have an overused plot. The character of Morbius, however, could not have been more perfectly cast. Jared Leto really looks like Dr. Morbius, and his very dry speech works for the character, as well (if you've ever read Morbius, his words are written in a font meant to convey darkness, brooding, and potential evil). And his comic appearances, tend to be choppy in their presentation, as well, because they are trying to convey his 'blackouts'. (Note: I am referring to his early appearances in Spider-Man)

His movements and the overall story arc, follows his origin story very well. And, as it seems he will be facing Spider-Man, if they capitalize on the mid-credit scene, it ought to be really intriguing to see where they take this character. There is really a lot of potential, that I think many movie-goers missed.

"Argyle302","More Like ""MORE BS "", From Disney Marvel","14 September 2022","I agree with what edrddz wrote, ""The movie is Dull. Nothing happens, when it happens, it is dumb and makes no sense. The plot is full of convenience where people are in some place just for happening. For example, the Morbius boat is full of armed guards just to have some action scene there.

Action scenes are short and full of blurred colored effects or dark effects and none of them work.

Uninteresting characters. You have Morbius, a new made vampire that needs to drink human blood to live. You could explore this in so many ways, like trying to drink blood from animals, buying blood from blood bank and making needing people dying because lack of blood packs, leading to ""I will drink blood from bad people"". But they decided that trowing a blurred colored ball is more interesting. Side characters are empty as well.

This movie is so boring that is more enjoyable to do the dishes.""

And my two cents, the CGI was absolutely horrific. Cheesy, pointless CGI throughout the entire movie.","1"
"lisafordeay","It's not terrible nor a masterpiece from Marvel","23 May 2022","Morbius is a 2022 horror styled comic book movie starring Jared Leto,Matt Smith and Tyrese Gibson.

A scientist with an incurable blood disorder named Dr Micheal Morbius (Leto) finds a cure that may help him with his disease. Unfortunately it backfires and causes him to transform into a blood sucking vampire. Meanwhile his brother also gets a hold of the serum and transforms into a vampire too.

Overall it was a decent film with good special effects and cinematography. The only bad thing I spotted was the plot which dragged on and on as if the film was on for 2 and a half hours instead of 104 minutes. Jared Leto is too boring as he bores me to death.

I thought it interesting that there were two environments, one that didn't include ""bat characters"" where there were everyday people, cops and detectives. The behavior of the characters on this side of the line was as expected, not silly or over the top. Then there was the fantastic world of the radically changed two main characters and the action scenes.

My only critical comment was the fighting/flying/clashing scenes, especially toward the end, were often just smudges and mostly imperceptible.

I rate this movie much higher than I would most Marvel movies because of the quality of the overall project.","8"
"normyhaddad-24632","Falls off significantly after the first half","3 April 2022","The first half of the movie looked promising. We had a character with a life-goal who got so close to reaching it, but fell short and possibly gave him a worse life than before. But instead of letting him learn to control himself and turn the curse into something good, that entire built-up arc is completely destroyed and replaced with ye olde good-friend-turn-bad cliche. Not only that, but the final fight was short, made no sense, and anticlimactic. It felt like they took 2 movies, cut them in half, and stuck together the beginning of the first, and ending of the 2nd.","6"
"Animus","This sucks.","9 June 2022","So I watched Morbius out of curiosity, I've never cared much about the character when reading comics but it left me wondering if the writers actively hated the character.

His origin was quick and simple enough, rare condition, needs replacement blood three times a day. Okay it's ludicrous, but whatever sets the premise. Revealing that he's a gigantic douchebag early on doesn't help me sympathize with him. Why is he such a douchebag? Because not only does he refuse a nobel prize (which would have only helped his cause and paid for his research) but he insists on calling Lucien 'Milo' like a jerk, reminding his supposed friend that Lucien is just filling another person's space until he dies and a new Milo comes in. That's cold enough, but worse - EVERYONE calls Lucien 'Milo' for the rest of the movie, including Dr. Nicholas. No wonder Lucien goes the villain route right outta the gate.

So after refusing the Nobel and the million dollar prize, the now desperate Michael Morbius goes the mad science route and conducts illegal experiments in international waters where after nearly 200 failures he creates a 'cure' which goes wrong. Naturally this happens - it's a comic book movie.

Moving on.

For some reason the DNA of vampire bats gives him blood thirst, super strength, speed and a vapor trail... Oh yeah and has super hearing (the really kooky kind that lets him pick out a single voice or even a heartbeat in a city of millions) and can fly along on sound waves... you know... like a bat... The vapor trail thing bothered me from the beginning, it seemed to be associated with sound but in a weird way since it didn't move like sound wave but acted more like smoke. It seems to exist solely to look cool in a trailer.

Lucien/Milo stumbles onto Morbius and sees what he's done to himself and immediately decides 'I want me some of that gruesome and painful looking cure!'. I get that he sees any chance as being better than his current state, but wow. Maybe he should have waited a day or two to see how turning into a blood sucking monster worked out before signing up for the early access?

I won't bother the many many factual errors since that would take too long. Instead I'll complain about how Morbius gripes about not wanting to drink human blood despite the fact that donated blood works just fine as does drinking from the dead (which he does).

Oh and in the end it turns out he can summon bats too, you know because he can yell...

The symbolism is a bit in-your-face, although not Catwoman levels, but still things like all the red/green stuff including Milo murdering Martine on a skylight divided into the colors, and 'staking' Lucien/Milo with the vampire killing syringe in the heart.

Then there was the 'turning' shot at the end which begs the question, how many more of Lucian's victims will be blood crazed vampires by morning? Also can the bitten turn others? If so the city should be 50% vampire in about a week.

If the writers had decided to go with a more supernatural theme instead of trying to make this into mad science horror film, it would have at least made all the powers make a bit more sense or at least seemed less arbitrary.

A few other things that bothered me were the various cribs from other movies. Some were obvious like the line from The Incredible Hulk, the recreation of the mercs/military being stalked from the same movie, and the Batman/Venom joke. While others are less so, such as the notes from 'Dies Irae' to emulate the Batman Begins theme when Morbius steps into the chamber of bats and Lucien/Milo acting like Kiefer Sutherland's David character from the Lost Boys, while dressing like Stanley Ipkiss in the Mask...

Anyway then we get to the post credits - WTF? Why is Toomes in the Sony 'Stuff That is Sort Of Related to the Spider-Verse' now? If it's because he knew Peter Parker is Spider-man then why isn't MJ, Ned, and most of NYC there too? Where did he get a new Vulture suit? The Tinkerer built all his stuff in Homecoming using stolen alien tech which doesn't exist in this reality Toomes had no idea how to build it. Also is he wanting to hunt Spider-man now? Or is he trying to form a Thunderbolts kind of thing with people who morally gray? The Homecoming Vulture was just trying to make money and didn't want unnecessary violence or to call attention to himself.

Something tells me we are unlikely to get any answers from the first Marvel (not MCU) movie to flop twice at the box office.","3"

I honestly have no idea what to say because this movie is so unbelievably forgettable. Every review that hates on this movie has it's reasons and I agree with them.

Jared Leto is meh, everyone else is poor (Including Matt Smith).

Story is poor and unimaginative. The fight scenes are terrible and the powers make little sense and are still boring and not interesting.

"statuskuo","Unnecessary","7 April 2022","It's not so much that it's bad, it's that it was so unnecessary. Take the most cliched trope of any action flick and tie those all together loosely and you have this mess of a flick. It really has no idea what it is, much like the good Doctor. Is he a vampire? Is he human? A Doctor Vampire? I'm certain there are moments in here that need to be flesh out more, but it relies on some really horrific moments of on-the-nose dialogue possible ""We need to get you help?"" ""I am a monster"" ""What did I do?!"" and so forth. It's cringey to see someone like director Daniel Espinosa fall to this level. A guy who has done safer flicks like ""Safe House"" or ""Child 44"" This was maybe too safe.

Now I don't want to blast this flick like others have. You just want more for talents like Jared Leto or Matt Smith. Or even discount Eiza Gonzalez (who will probably be lambasted on this week's released ""Ambulance""). But you can't throw this at the screen and expect people to just go along with it.

Here's the story: Doctor tries to save himself and his buddy by splicing his DNA with a bat's. Apparently bat DNA can process blood the way their human bodies are failing at. Unfortunately the side effect is that they thirst for blood and must maintain that hunger to survive. Duh. Right off the bat (pun intended) a brilliant doctor who doesn't know this is an idiot. The rest is just more painful. As they are now adults and close to dying, they inject themselves with the serum. And the rest writes itself. You know they will have differing views of their new found ""powers"" And, therefore, battle each other out. More stomach churning are the police who tail the doctor yet aren't in disbelief of the events that are in front of them. They act as if this is normal (perhaps in New York it is). The audience won't buy it.

All in all, this was just a blah experience. It's not terrible. Just so very unnecessary.

Worst is when the powers that be give you the end credit cut scene that brace you for another installment. I find it arrogant that we would want another one of these.

This is a very disjointed movie that has no clue where it's going.","4"
"patrickaford","This movie is FINE","4 April 2022","It's okay. Jared Leto and Matt Smith do a great job, the storyline is okay, and the CGI isn't the worst we've seen from marvel. I think the primary issue is that it's came out when Marvel has had their best with Endgame and Spider-Man. The movie does not shine like some others. The build up to the finale was great, the execution could have used another pass through the editor.

"Polotovar","Too short and empty","9 April 2022","It's a shame how Morbius ended up. I was looking forward to it. It started out fine and actually was fine for me all along, it just didn't take long for the end to come and I just stared stupidly, feeling like that was it? It was too short and therefore so empty in my opinion. In my eyes, the same problem as the second Venom. In short, fast paced but ultimately detrimental. The plot doesn't help either and was a bit weak in my opinion. For me, an above average film that I don't recommend. Perhaps only to the biggest Marvel fans.","6"
"r96sk","A quintessential 6/10 flick, for me","19 April 2022","Not even that bad, to be honest.

I had heard murmurs of 'Morbius' being received poorly (as now I see via the average rating!) but didn't know to what degree, which is how I prefer it so I can form my own opinion - which is, I didn't dislike it. Admittedly I have nothing that I like either, but it's a forgettably fine film. In fact, I found it to be the quickest viewing experience of the year so far - the run time absolutely flew by for me.

The cast are a bit up-and-down. Jared Leto has a few moments and overall I'm OK with him in the lead role, meanwhile Matt Smith is more miss than hit but again didn't annoy me or anything like that. Elsewhere, it was pleasant to see Jared Harris and Tyrese Gibson in smaller roles.

The special effects, for the most part, are serviceable in my eyes. I think I also heard that people were questioning why the filmmakers didn't opt for prosthetics and went full blown CG for the faces - I found everything in that area to be fine, it would've been cooler if they mixed it up but if I hadn't heard anything about it I honestly would not have even noted it.

There are some lame lines of dialogue, namely that hunger one, and the credit scenes don't leave any excitement or intrigue behind. Aside from that, I genuinely didn't dislike this. A quintessential 6/10 flick, for me. It is the weakest of the first three SSU films, granted.","6"

First off, the acting is not half bad, especially by Jared Leto. Second, a vampire Marvel character is interesting. I wonder if there could be collaborations with Werewolf By Night.

It should be noted that the plot is neither mind blowing nor bad. It's a cookie cutter plot for an origin story. That's not bad. It's just that the Marvel audience has had two decades experience with origin stories... it might've been better not to be so lazy and to serve up a more unique way to tell the story. I'm not sure that I can point to things that are bad.

The last good Marvel movie was Howard the Duck, and that came out over 40 years ago. But then Morbius came out. My wife didn't want to go see it, but I wouldn't let her drag me down. I divorced her and went to go see the movie. When Morbius said the famous line ""It's Morbin time"" I cried tears of joy and my depression ceased to exist. But seeing it one time wasn't enough. I had to sell my house and my car to buy more tickets to see Morbius. My ex wife tried to stop me, so I shot her in the head so she would leave me alone.

"Tiddles2008","Not As Bad As What It Has Been Made Out To Be","3 April 2023","When I decided to watch Morbius I expected it to be the train wreck that all of the critics made it out to be but soon after I started to watch it, I realized that I was enjoying it. It still felt as if it was extremely rushed and unfinished. There was a massive plot hole that came in the shape of Milo somehow managing to get injected with the serum that made Michael into a vampire. If Michael had to get Martine to inject him then who injected Milo? Michael refuses to do it and I am certain that Martine didn't do it. I enjoy plot twists bun not ones that are completely impossible. The first time that I watched this it took me 2 minutes to figure out why Michael was so upset that Milo had forgotten his walking stick. Movies are meant to foreshadow and not be random and structure-less.","5"

"Phil_H","Painfully Average","27 May 2022","Morbius is not great or good, nor is is terrible. It's simply average as a film. There's nothing inherently wrong with it other than to say I think the script should have marinated in the hands of more capable people for about another year. Having said that...there are worse ways to waste a few hours, so grab a drink and a snack and dive in to the world and just take it for what it is.","5"
"anthonywltrs","Very Disappointing","7 June 2022","I had high hopes for Morbius ever since I first heard news of his movie being in development. This had so much potential to be better than what it turned out to be. Michael Morbius suffering from a debilitating disease that is slowly killing him and his friend, Lucian. He desperately experiments and searches for a cure leading him to test vampire bats before a test on himself goes wrong and becomes a living vampire. Come on! There so much potential and depth this movie had but the writers and director just barely did the bare minimum

The plot is flat. None of the characters are fully developed nor engaging. It just showed surface levels of Morbius's struggle and coming to terms with being a vampire. His friendship turned enemy with Lucian literally had no depth or meaning. Lucian as a character is just awful. There's no personality or depth to him. All he was was a friend turned enemy after stealing Morbius's vampire serum. Cheesy one dimensional villain stuff when it comes to Lucian's goals. There were even moments during the plot it felt very predictable

In all honesty this movie needed two hours to have proper development for not only the plot to flow better but to have Morbius, Lucian and Morbius's love interest to be fleshed out and developed to the point where you had feelings and cared for them

Now comes the part with the mid credit scenes with Michael Keaton as Vulture stumbling into Venom and Morbius's universe after the events of No Way Home with the multiverse and Dr Strange putting it back together again. Although I can see some issues people had like Vulture suddenly getting his suit from out of nowhere and teaming up with Morbius to take on that universe's Spider-Man whoever that will be. Although neither of those characters have ever crossed that Spider-Man, certainly not Vulture as he used to be in the MCU. The scene of him meeting and forming an alliance with Morbius was obviously intended to set up a future Sinister Six movie. Im sure other than that, there's a good reason for Vulture suddenly appearing in that universe which will be revealed in time

Overall, this movie should have been a smash hit and have been so much better than what it turned out to be which was a complete disappointment. What a shame.","3"
"christa_love","Fun to watch.","21 October 2022","The movie did not disappoint. I love comic characters. I did not know much about morbius, so I liked learning his origin story. The plot made sense and there was lots of action. I like the cgi effects. The way the character transformed and flew was very bat like. I also liked the way the bats responded to morbius. The actors were believable. I don't know why the movie has been given low ratings. Wonder Woman 2 and the Eternals were much worse. This is a great movie if you like fantasy. If you wait until the credits run there are two previews...which makes me wish for a sequel. I think you should give it a chance.","7"
"kibblz","Low ratings? I loved this movie!","20 May 2022","Haven't left a review in a very very long time but thought this movie did not deserve the hate and low rating. I almost didn't watch this because of the low ratings. In fact, many movies that have low ratings I ended up loving them so that just shows you to never look at reviews. Although many movies with low ratings do turn out bad but many don't as well.

This movie had a very dark and grey vibe to it, kinda like The Wolfman 2010. The CGI was definitely 10/10, I was very impressed as I love CGI. My favorite parts of the movie was the friend relationship between Michael and Milo change. I was never a fan of Jared Leto but he did a good job on his character.

Yes there's a few question marks in the movie as most do but isn't watching a movie all about being entertained? I was very entertained and wish the movie was longer.

"chris_rowe-881-168820","Marvels bat man","5 April 2022","I genuinely think either people have a thing for the print version or just super strange expectations for marvel films but if this was just a random non marvel movie, guarantee it'd be received better.

Let's be real it's a far more entertaining movie that ten rings or externals, far more entertaining, better music and just a more enjoyable film, also far better than venom 2, which was a mess.

The acting was good, story made sense, didn't love it being bats but obviously makes sense, just think with something as established as Batman this feels kinda strange.

This feels like an origin story for someone they want to rush into a franchise and the ending was kinda sudden and anticlimactic and the mid credit scene was a bit meh!

But overall enjoyable movie! 1 down point except ending is Matt smith! How has this guy continually got such good roles? Such a bland boring actor with such little presence.","7"
"shadowfax73","Enjoyable enough and barely WOLK","16 May 2022","According to the various ratings I've seen, viewers like this movie but critics don't - hardly any critic does. I watched it last night after hearing all the trash talk about it and found it was actually a pretty good film. Both Jared Leto and Matt Smith were excellent and although all that 'puff-of-smoke' stuff was a bit 'WTF??!!', I'm glad I watched it and would encourage others to give it a chance.

Seeing the massive disparity between viewers ratings and critics ratings on Rotten Tomatoes, I can see why the massive gap. No virtual signaling. No laying on diversity with a trowel. Characters gender ignored. Characters sexual preferences ignored. No 'pass-the-bucket' messaging. About the most WOKE-free movie I've seen in ages.

Nice to watch a new movie that doesn't make you want to heave.","7"
"Foutainoflife","Not Understanding All The Hate","20 May 2022","I have a limited comic book knowledge and maybe that keeps me from being overly judgmental. It has issues.

It is filmed in very low lighting. It's a bit overboard with the CGI to the point where it almost becomes visually noisy and undiscernible. I didn't care for the way he looked when he morphed. My last issue was simply, where was the blood? He's a vampire. We should see a bit more blood than we did.

Aside from those things, I didn't find it to be a horrible film. I thought the idea was intriguing. I thought it progressed at a slow but decent pace and although more backstory and character development would have been a big help, I felt we were given enough to understand what was happening. I was okay with it.

Not AMAZING but there are worse movies out there.

I guess people will have to come to their own conclusions with this one.","6"
"Glue2Screen","Been there done that","5 October 2022","Weak story and bad dialogue let the charge in this movie. This origin story could have just been a ten minute flashback within another story.

Pros: the VFX is all right, it has several elements that really emphasize the vampire aspect. The acting from the Jared is pretty decent considering the poorly written script it came from. It's entertaining enough if you're looking for a ringless not too scary vampire movie.

Cons: it's very dull because the story has been done many many times. The plot is very predictable and progresses way too fast. Almost the entire movie is created on convenience to progress the story. The dialogue is super cliché mean and rather cringy. The plot kind of jumps around without really explaining itself but at the same time there are other scenes that is just pure expositions.

Skippable unless really bored...","4"
"ashfordofficial","A vain attempt","15 May 2022","The direction, screenplay, dialogues, performances, editing and a poor attempt to connect it with a larger shared universe, all of these factors and more caused the downfall of this movie. CGI was decent most of the time, but sometimes it gets sloppy and unrealistic. There were a lot of plot holes in this movie throughout its runtime. The sad part is that this film doesn't have an actual story. Stuff just happens without any plot developments or any explanations.

Adria Arjona was fantastic as always. She's just perfect.

How long can Sony make these type of films about Spider-Man villains, without any involvement of the said character. They can't do this forever!","2"
"michelleshaw-56918","Better than expected","14 November 2022","Morbius had such low ratings and bad reviews right from the start. It took me some time before getting around to watching it. But I quite enjoyed it.

It's not brilliant and doesn't have a lot of the same appeal as most other movies based on Marvel comics but it has great story telling and likeable characters.

It probably could have been a little bit longer, taken a little more time with Milo after the transformation.

I thought Jared Leto as Morbius was a great choice. He played the part well.

I did struggle with Matt Smith as Milo, possibly because I've only seen him as Dr Who before this.

Overall it's quite enjoyable.","7"

No complaints.","7"
"c-kelsall","Why didn't I check the rating first?!","5 April 2022","Dear God, what a mess. If I'd seen Morbius had an average rating of 5.2, I wouldn't have touched it with a barge pole. Now it all makes sense. Please, I beg you, don't make the same mistake I did and waste your precious money and time watching this moribund specimen, on the big screen or otherwise. I swear if I had been watching it at home on freeview, I'd have turned over to another channel to watch something else. I haven't been so disappointed by a film of this kind since I saw The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen; yes, it's almost that bad.

There really are no redeeming features to this. The plot is paper thin, character development perfunctory, the effects are not special (just a bit irritating), and it's not even cool. I counted two lines of dialogue which raised a hint of a smile, and it's so predictable. That I can forgive if I'm entertained, but Morbius failed by every measure. The casting wasn't terrible - I've enjoyed work by all the main actors before - but they really had nothing to get their teeth into. The kindest thing I can say is that it was less than 2 hours long, giving me time to write this review when I got home. If someone did away with the director and the script writer, I dare say no one would miss them.","4"
"rajvignesh-60140","An average superhero(villain)","20 November 2022","The story is pretty much simple nothing complication in it and a good screenplay too. The problem is its predictable and nothing new in it. Different approach is the character a mixture of hulk and batman. A good performance by all the characters. I just watched because of marvel like there will be any connection between the characters and movie. Hope this character is not wasted and brings in MCU as rest of the character. Please do check this movie its available in netflix , yet another marvel disappointment. I was expecting something more but it wasnt boring but pretty average one. Please check it out.","7"
"icelandknight","Different Sort of -Vampire Movie-... I'd watch AGAIN... (and have)","14 May 2022","This is a different take on the Vampire genre, and origin story. We sympathize with a person with a deadly illness, that could happen to any of us, trying to fix himself and find the cure for others. Its a very noble and human ideal to want to Live but also have Compassion.

Personally I.d have started the film differently, but history in flashbacks also works, that way you can jump straight to the action at the start (which is what people want these days *sigh*), and leave the background until people are in the thick of the action, in that way, this film feels a BIT -contrived-, but it still works, having the slow bully parts later, so we understand and sympathize with the motivation of the villain: After suffering, one understands the thrill of abusing power against those who deserve punishment, however having -power- corrupts many people. Never lose your Self, just because you can... but, ok, I do love slow burn movies, like -Angel Heart-. With this one, I would have started in the orphanage, and made the rest chronologically make sense... but I.d have made the film a LOT longer. One has to consider its made for today's audience, who are into instant gratification, and greedy for action, as opposed to slow character growth. People don.t have time for that these days, so you get what the majority wants... Hoping for a Directors Cut later, for those who want depth.

I am purposely avoiding any MAIN spoilers, because its a movie that people should see, without too many preconceived ideas, or opinions of others, even though IMDB is made for that. To me it was such a great movie, that I have now seen it more than 5 times. Its like with any film, each time you see it, you motive more stuff. I love that... and I love it.

Small comic reference: I DID see the comics decades ago and sadly, the artist that drew them, originally, had too BLOCK-Y a style for me. That, and how ugly Morbius looked in them, ruined those comics for me. *ahem* the weird thing is that I have an upturned nose, but his was just exaggerated. I wonder if it was by accident, or if it inspired Michael Jackson look, though. Michael would have LOVED Morbius. Hey! His name IS even -Michael- Morbius. Things that make you go -hmmm-. :-D.","9"
"toneku1","6.8 out of 10","2 April 2022","I have always known Morbius as a Spider-Man villain. However, going into this, I knew they were going to change him up. Rightfully so. I get what they were going for. They should have gone with a ""R"" rating. This would have given it the edge this movie needed, without going too far into horror. Instead, they go with Ole faithful ""PG-13"" and it sucks some of the life out of this one. It doesn't take too long for Morbius to become Morbius and the special effects are GREAT. With that being said, there is something missing. A great antagonist. It felt forced, like they HAD to go the way they did. And that makes for a more predictable flick. Which is what it was always gonna be, I just wish they realized that, as well. You don't have to go to the theater to watch this one. You can wait till it hits a streaming service. Not awful, but it could have been ALOT better.","7"
"Nyc_Don_DrKing","Not a bad start, to something promising later on","1 April 2022","Let me get this out the way,this film had the a certain issue which VENOM had when it dropped for me. Now... Pros: *The PLOT was easy to follow straight to the point, you know exactly what Michael is doing & for what reason & why he does what he does, when things go wrong *Theme was just fine for me overall, though it might fall for some, in this department depends on the individual *Characters is both a pro & con for me, you have some who were enjoyable, some you might care less for. Michael, Martine & Emil were the ones I enjoyed more & wanted to see more of in this film *Attention to detail when it came to showing us his abilities was very interesting for me. The hearing, sonar, flight, speed in a manner I personally haven't seen before so that was refreshing. We already seen plenty of super strength.

Cons: *Action ""Venom Effect"" as I call it, there are action scenes in the film lol some looked good once you got use to the speed trail effect during the lighter scenes,but some of the more darker ones ""Venom effect"" you could barely make out at times what is actually transpiring cause it's so dark.

*Villain was just boring this is where the film was falling for me. Just wasn't a overall good villain. Motives you get, but overall Milo just wasn't it. Why not use BLACKOUT maybe or VIC SLAUGHTER who's just a ruthless vampire from Morbius own creation which I thought Milo was suppose sorta at 1st,but fell extremely short..since where diving into the more cosmic side now LILLITH would've been interesting character to use, but enough on that,decent start for a origin see it for yourself, only way to go from here is up.","6"
"mmevanille-53097","Nothing new, but still entertaining.","2 April 2022","I am not a Leto fan, but I think this is probably his finest work as I believe it contrasts with his personality well. That being said the film starts strong but then gets bogged down in the middle.

Its very predictable as hero movies generally are, but I never really felt that invested in the character itself and his journey, unlike Venom or most non-Sony Marvel films. The ethical conflict never had enough depth, and lacked that moral dilemma for the character which would have suited this film perfectly.

People who are into vampirism may enjoy it more than me as its not my jig, but it really doesn't offer anything new besides some cool new CGI, some dark shocking scenes and some half decent performances given the plot was a bit lacking. If you are looking for something to take your mind off the news and to munch some popcorn to, then this is a good timewaster.","7"
"peterfbrand-89486","It was alright.","26 May 2022","Not brilliant like Venon 1, but still watchable. The 2nd end credit scene was a little cringeworthy.

Was Matt Smith playing homage to Lost Boys when he was calling ""Michael"" in the underground scene? Kinda felt that way.

I didn't develop a connection to any of the characters though, which is a shame. Best, lifelong friends pitted against each other, after a the struggles they both went through should have triggered an emotive response and I felt nothing.

"magnussonborski","Suprisingly I enjoy the movie LOL","17 May 2022","Minus : 1. The script is totally screwed up. After so many good and bad Marvel movies, it seems that the scriptwriter hasn't learned a thing. The story line jumps and bumps from one point to another fast enough.

2. The number of characters in this movie are not that much, but somehow the development of the characters is that bad.

3. The story line is pretty basic : a person who turns into monster, and has to fight the villain who gets the benefit from his own formula, so I pretty much can guess how the movie would end.

4. In the credit scene, it is very unclear why Morbius hates spiderman and decides to join with Vulture. They don't explain that throughout the movie.

Plus : 1. The choreograph is fantastic, I love the fighting scenes in this movie.

2. The CGI effects are also incredible, I enjoy it so much : the echo location, the effect when Morbius and Milo moves, the physical changing when they turn into vampiric monsters, etc

3. Matt Smith (Milo) acting is really good.

Overall, it is an Okay movie, with bad script but good choreo & CGI. Still an enjoyable movie for me to watch on weekends or holidays, but maybe for hard fans of Marvel who consider character development is a huge important part of the movies, this movie is a big minus.","6"

"xshanex-54161","Sadly disappointing","31 March 2022","Goodness, I don't even know how to word it.

There were moments I enjoyed, and of course, Leto performed his ass off, but the film itself was almost exhausting at times.

I wanted to love it, and I think that somewhere underneath the CGI ridden, sloppily edited mess is a movie that could've been way more entertaining.

It started off really well and then just lost it's way more and more as it went.

The cgi was waaaaaay too much and often times looked intensely outdated. Eye rolling even.

It wasn't the worst film I've ever seen, but it was super underwhelming and lazily crammed together.

I couldn't say I'd ever tell someone they need to go see this, out of fear they'd want to strangle me. Lol

If I didn't have an affinity for the character from reading comics my whole life, I think i would have absolutely hated it but that love got me through it.

I wish I had better things to say, but it's a pretty mediocre film that deserved to be better. Leto deserves it to be better as well.

The end credits stuff is more entertaining than the actual film. At least they left me with something.

"DoctorStrangest1","Good movie for a relaxed or non-ultra comic fan","9 July 2022","Not sure why this movie got such low reviews. I read a lot of them and simply disagree with many of the hyper-criticisms. The movie is reasonably well paced, acted, and plotted. I think that when rating movies these days, there is a strange split between rating canon and rating the value/experience of the movie on its own merits. I tend toward the latter. As I have aged, I have found that unless I'm solely specifically looking for canon in my movies, I find that enjoying the movie mostly untethered to other expectations tends to lead to the best experience - this is such a movie.

The focus is more on character experiences rather than straight up over-the-top continual fireball/lightning bolt duels that you get with most comic/superhero movies. The special effects were interesting even if totally CGI. For instance, one thing that I liked is the random bullet-time slow speed moments in some of Morbius' fights where the scene looks like something straight out of a comic book action freeze frame. I like the overall ambiance of it and other such creative flare moments that pop up. As for the plot, yah, you can probably tell where the movie's going before it gets there but somehow it still works out to an interesting explorative trip.

Having said that, if you're a HARDCORE comic goer or follower of the specific comic Morbius looking for a movie with ULTRA gore; are completely focused on constant arguments about what is canon and whatnot with the character; are focused on the absolute cutting edge newest of the new special effects (ones that are less than like five minutes old); want 10 plot lines with 10 different random superheroes characters thrown in throughout; ...then this movie might not be for you. However, if you are just a regular movie-goer (or relaxed comic fan) that wants to see a good movie for the evening without unnecessary over the top undue complications and an interesting theme with a logical regular conscious flowing plot line of one main character, ...then definitely give this movie a shot. It's a good night out regardless of any light flaws it might have.","7"

I mean if you got time to kill and would to fill in the void,well by all means check it out sometime but don't except a Black Panther or Avenger's Infinity War type Blockbuster for this film isn't it. Just enjoy it for what it is. I will say this though,Jared Leto makes a better Morbius than a Joker. Maybe Morbius will be better in the sequel that is if Sony and Marvel decide to do another one in the future.","3"

Is this a ""bad"" film? No. But it definitely built up regrettable excitement and expectations. Additionally, I found myself disappointed with the film's representation of the disabled community. There are blogs and research that suggests the worst thing you could do in a fantasy/hero movie is to have a character who's physical disability is ""fixed"" in order to take on powers and abilities.

As I watched this movie, 2 things went through my mind:

1. Why couldn't they make this the first Marvel Halloween-horror adjacent anti-hero film, taken a little more time in the brainstorm tank, and released this in October?

2. Does every Marvel comic need to be a full feature length? This could've been a fantastic series.

OTHER THOUGHTS:

Highlights: Matt Smith actually gave one solid and engaging performance. I really enjoyed him. Additionally, shout out to the special and visual effects-Stunning! There must be a video game in the works! Or at least put Morbius in the next Injustice installment (LOL). I also loved the opening and ending credits colors and music. It just felt cool.

Could've Been Better: The character development for Matt Smith's character lacked. His 0-100 shift made the issues of the story stand out for me. Additionally, the follow through of the themes could've been stronger with a more intentional Act One to guide the rest of the story.","7"
"pal05052003","Generic, uninspired, and not that good despite earnest performances from Jared Leto and Jared Harris","3 April 2022","I had heard of the negative reviews about the movie but decided to give it the benefit of the doubt and tried to enjoy it for what it is: an entertaining escapist movie. Even with a much lower expectation, the movie barely delivers. Somehow its mash up of horror, drama, and superhero action does not add well The trailer promised an interesting character similar to Robert Pattinson's Batman, where the character struggles to find his place, but the movie skips the hero's journey altogether, and does not have any clear theme. Jared Leto is a great actor, but there is not enough material for him to use all his talents. His character's bond with Jared Harris' character is not well developed, and neither is relationship with Matt Harris. His romantic interest, which is supposed to provide a heart to the story seems forced. This is probably due to bad writing. The fight scenes are actually quite good, and different, though too few. If they opted to make the movie darker, and more horror oriented, it could have worked (maybe). Anyway, the movie has soooooo much to improve, and even for an escapist, unintellectually stimulating movie, it is not that fun to watch either.","5"

I felt no emotional involvement and found the characters one dimensional. The FBI agents seemed to be pure window dressing, just going through the motions with the prerequisite, puerile dialogue. If you compare the two most recent ""Super Hero"" films, in this and The Batman. Despite being fundamentally different, The Batman succeeds in every way that this film fails. Meaningful situations and outcomes. Characters that develop over the course of the film. A story that resonates and compels, and numerous high points that excite and engage.","6"

"Anseldog","Should have had more bats and MUCH more bats","9 September 2022","I was dissatisfied that twenty minutes into the movie he hadnt morbed yet nor had he said ""it's morbin' time"" - overall not enough vampire action and unfocused. Story lacked vampire morbin action at crucial moments. Could have used a little more bats. Jared Leto was in it. So was another guy named Jared who, disappointingly, was not a vampire and didn't morb. The bad guy morbed but definitely not as well as Michael morbius. I love the alliteration of M in Michael and M in morbius. It's a shame the movie didn't live up to the name. I liked the part with the bats. Could have been truly something special but alas. Cannot stress enough it needed more bats.","3"
"stacybengochea","Loved This Movie","16 May 2022","Did I see a different movie than most of the other reviewers? I must've because as a 56 year old female, I have a very, very low tolerance for most action and/or based-on-comic movies and I thought it was awesome. Acting was great across the board. Jared Leto was phenomenal as Morbius and Matt Smith, who I've always had a love/hate thing with was outstanding. I thought the script was solid. Do I wish for a bit more explanation, background, and details about a few things? Sure I do, but when don't I? I'm a tough sell, especially with these types of movies. Special effects (CGI) were great; it was an excellent decision for Jared to push hard for CGI over makeup. And it's even more impressive knowing that body doubles weren't used; Jared both gained muscle AND lost a crap ton of weight to look super sickly/frail. My husband and I both thoroughly enjoyed this movie. Can't wait to see what other things ""the few against the many"" can do. Bring it on!","9"
"harberdionne","Do not understand the hate...","22 December 2022","Seen comments on here saying they think the action scenes are ""gibberish"" and that you can't actually see them taking place...first of all, Morbius is completely different to other superheroes that we have seen, on top of that you still see him fight with people regardless. The story is there, I think what people are doing is just watching with extremely high expectations and also are comparing it with other Marvel films. This film is honestly great, the only thing I can say is I don't feel like Matt Smith played a new character. It still felt like he was playing the Doctor from Doctor Who which isn't a bad thing but it was sort of weird.

Overall, it is a great watch and I genuinely have nothing bad to say about this just hate how many fans of Marvel have decided this isn't good enough due to the fact it's not as good as other Marvel films....","10"

"FAJNYFILM","Very good comic adaptation - one of very few","30 May 2022","I have started watching this movie after reading some reviews. Lots of them actually ""ate, digested and threw out"" the movie calling it names. Since I am not big fan of Jared Leto due to his very poor casting (not performance!) I had actually no expectations....

And I was shocked..... surprised and really satisfied.

The film is coherent. Focused on story. On a man fighting his illness, focused on helping others and then focused on fighting or rather utilizing something that got into him.

Very simple scene setup. No extravaganza. Good acting. Nice story telling. Compared to over budget Avengers movies it was like a theater than a movie. And that is why I enjoyed a lot this simple good movie.

Very good acting. Good actors. And story and problems were in main focus without creating some artificial villains.

I enjoyed hero's struggling with his illness and then the unknown and getting new abilities. And scientific mind.

Generally it a very good, simple and coherent story. With promising ending announcing continuation with Vulture.

Good job.","8"

It wasn't original, predictable but doesn't mean it wasn't entertaining. So nest action slow Mo scenes and some random parts that were interesting.

I will say, adding the makeup onto Matt Smith made him look a bit more normal?? Maybe that's just me. Apparently my review is too short, so I'll have to add a bit of an explanation. M. S. Has no eyebrows. Why the makeup folks in every show he's played in don't shade them in a bit has always perplexed me. That with his oddly far-spaced eyes give him an alien look. Shrug.

But I kind of hated the ending. Not going to give it away. I just thought it could have either been wrapped up better, or left on an actual cliff-hanger. As it was: LAME!!!

Thank you for your attention.","7"
"cmox2000","Definitely not bad","20 September 2022","So Sony seems to be stepping up thier Marvel game. Morbius was was well written and acted, Jared Leto was great as the title character and Matt Smith...wow what a performance. This is definitely better than the new MCU woke trash they keep pumping out, proof you don't need to have an agenda to have an entertaining franchise. I look forward to Kraven, El Meurto, Madame Web and the Third Venom. Hoping we get more of this quality filmmaking. It would be incredible to see Holland and Garfield meet up with not only Venom but Morbius and create the Spider Verse that we have been aching for. Definitely worth watching, and the special effects are great.","8"
"11ovz11","Better than most Marvel and DC Character Origin Movies","15 November 2022","Due to the hate this movie got and the negative reviews it received, I pushed watching Morbius till I found it on Netflix one day. And after watching it, I kept questioning the reviewers as to WHY they rated this movie so poorly. Because it is quite decent as a movie and really good for an comic book origin story.

Sure, the story is simple and extremely predictable. And Matt Smith's villain is a bit overdone. However, Jared Leto gives his all to this character to portray all kinds of emotions one has to go through to shoulder a curse. He makes it all realistic despite the CGI fights. Smith too comes up with a charming villain but his could have had more depth. Even the CGI is smooth, in my opinion. The face transitions and body transfigurations were amazing.

If I make two more complains, they would be about the supporting cast, and making the movie not R-rated. The support cast felt less talented compared to the acting of Leto, and came as artificial. And same could be said about the killings where the vampire would slash a human's neck but no blood is splashed out.

But, other than that, the movie is quite alright. When compared to the recent Dr Strange movie, and all of DC movies, the Morbius plot has more direction and purpose, and feels as if executed very well too.

So, my take is, do not judge a movie based on reviews. Watch it for yourself and determine how good or bad it was for yourself.","8"

"captainzoath","Not as bad as I thought, but still weak.","4 April 2022","I had read all of the bad reviews. I didn't really know what to expect. The story had good potential but here comes spoiler alert if you have not seen it. The conflict between Morbius and Milo Seemed to come out of nowhere.

They went from being best friends to mortal enemies in a matter of seconds. And Morbius seems to be able to control his lust after the initial bloodfest while Milo was ready to kill anybody at a second glance- even his lifelong doctor. That seemed Highly unbelievable and very weak for a plot.

The climax - meaning the fight between Morbius and Milo - ended about the same time it started - so it was a bit of a letdown. They were both brothers to the bats - so why did the bats listen to Morbius and attack Milo? It makes no sense. Overall the movie had potential - but it was weak after Milo took the serum. And I guess now the hot female Dr. Is a bloodthirsty vampire. Weak.","5"
"boxder","morbius my beloved <3","29 January 2023","Morbius is an absolutely incredible film that exceeded all of my expectations. The story is incredibly engaging, and the performances by the cast, led by the phenomenal Jared Leto, are nothing short of outstanding. The film tells the story of Dr. Michael Morbius, a brilliant biochemist who, in an attempt to cure a rare blood disease, inadvertently turns himself into a vampire.

The film's special effects are truly breathtaking and the action scenes are expertly choreographed, making for a truly immersive experience. The film also explores themes of identity, redemption, and the consequences of playing God in a very thought-provoking and intelligent way. The characters are all well-developed and relatable, making it easy to become fully invested in their story.

One of the things that makes Morbius so special is how well it fits into the larger Marvel Cinematic Universe. The film features several Easter eggs and surprises that will delight Marvel fans and also sets up exciting possibilities for future films.

In short, Morbius is a must-watch film for anyone who loves the superhero genre. It is a cinematic masterpiece that is expertly directed, written, and acted, and it is sure to leave you on the edge of your seat from start to finish. I highly recommend it!","10"
"p-jonsson","I quite liked this one actually.","16 August 2022","I have to say that I quite liked this movie. A bit surprised since it is a new Marvel movie after all. It is even free of woke bull manure which made me even more surprised.

The ""scientific"" part of Morbius changing his DNA, overnight no less, by means of some serum that he derived from vampire bats is of course utter nonsense but one cannot really complain too much about that since it is straight from the original comic book character.

The story is really simple and not much to write home about but it works in its simplicity. After all, in this kind of movie we really do not need something fancy as long as it is not downright stupid. It only needs to be a vehicle for the action and special effects and for that purpose the story works fine.

I like Morbius. He is intelligent and he doesn't just sink down in some self pity or whining sessions when he finds out that things did not go exactly as planned. Sure, he is not happy about it but at least he does research into his condition and he actually takes the effort to learn what he can do with his new powers.

I also do like the special effects and the action in general. The bad guy was rather predictable and not really very charismatic but he worked fairly okay. I think that most of the actors made a good enough job actually.

If I should complain about anything it was that scene in the beginning where they claimed that vampire bats could ""finish off"" big animals in minutes or something. That not what vampire bats do or how they feed. It is of course utter ignorant bull manure by some idiot script writer and it was really totally unnecessary to soil the movie with such nonsense already in the first scenes. I had hoped that ignorant script writers like that died out together with the last flying rubber Piranha in the early 80's.

Anyway, I quite liked the movie. A lot of movies that I've watched lately have felt bloated and too long for the material. This one I actually felt was too short.","8"

The film was incredible, to put it lightly. I thought I had noticed everything there was to notice on my 10th go, but I wasn't even close. Jared Leto's performance leaves so much up to interpretation, and he truly builds the character presented for is in the MCU(Morbius Cinematic Universe)...","10"
"kevinibbotson","Actually as bad as they said","9 September 2022","I didn't see this in the cinema because I had no interest in it. But it's on Netflix USA now so why not?

Jared Leto continues his decades long run of being truly awful in everything. It's not a joker level of bad in his performance but he's really bad in this.

The cgi is awful, the vampire faces look like a free snapchat filter.

The writing is awful, the plot is awful, the dialogue is awful. Dr Who can't dance. This is a really rare piece of film making in that absolutely no department that was involved in what the audience gets to see did a good job.

Absolutely watch it if you love a good trainwreck of a movie. Avoid if you like good movies.","1"
"abrahamsarath","Unfulfilled","15 September 2022","They want Jared Leto to act and yet they don't want him to be great. That is exactly how I felt after watching the movie.

Do we have a cast that can perform? Yes Do we have a great script for the character? Yes Do we want the viewers to enjoy the origins?

No, we'd rather give them a chopped up story line that may even impact the performance of the movie.

Considering the popularity of morbius and the success that venom has garnered over the years, it's fair for us to ask for a better experience when watching Jared Leto bring Morbius to life.

I highly doubt if someone considered an entire 2 part origin story possibility of the character. Morbius is a heal for the 90's kids. Should have been done better.","6"
"mjlower-28991","Underrated","8 March 2023","When most fans hear the the name of Morbius, in a Marvel universe they probably expect Spider-man to make an appearance.

Sony went a different route and made an origin story for a character, who in the comics is an antihero. Jared Leto gives three dimensions to a character who's only ever been seen in two dimensions.

The story is solid, Michael Morbius has had a debilitating disease since childhood, while being treated for said illness he makes a friend with his bedmate Milo. Milo's family is filthy rich, but Milo is looking to live a full life. (Milo is a nickname by the way)

Morbius goes on to become a doctor and made it his life's work to find a cure for their illness.

However, this doesn't include Morbius. The film was awful. I sat through close to 2 hours of bad acting, poor storyline and bad cgi. At one point the only thing entertaining me was this little moth that was fluttering around me. I can't remember most of the film, and that's also saying something. Sony and Marvel should've honestly done more justice to the film, Morbius is one of my favourite marvel characters and this film just butchered it all. I wouldn't recommend anyone seeing this film. And all of the 10/10 reviews are either paid, or they're delusional when it comes to the film.","1"
"ToddReviewsMovies-69983","Thoroughly entertaining, unfairly criticized","31 March 2022","I'm shocked by the negativity surrounding this movie. This is an engaging, entertaining time. Don't believe the harsh criticism. This movie is a fun, thrilling and at times pretty scary addition to the marvel universe. Jared Leto is surprisingly good in this role and I'm optimistic about how Morbius will be integrated in a larger Spider-Man story. The poor critical appraisals are reminiscent of Venom, which did very well at the box office and has many fans. I actually loved this movie and can't wait for a sequel. I'd wager 90% of the hate being spread on the internet is coming from people who haven't even seen the movie. Overall a fantastic introduction to a fascinating character. The 2 mid-credits scenes were very unexpected and affects the long term box office viability for the SSU. What I do find interesting is the multiverse implications and whether or not Andrew Garfield will be the SSU's Spider-Man, facing off against Tom Hardy's Venom/the sinister 6. The formation of the latter was hinted at in the mid credit scenes of Morbius. While there clearly seems to have been some production/editing/delay issues, it didn't feel like a soulless cash grab, at least to me. There does seem to be a larger payoff that's being built towards, which is cool. Now that a larger Spider-Man story has been alluded to, the interconnectedness of the movies will drive Spider-Man fans to see every release regardless of the criticism, similar to the MCU.","7"
"fieswald","I didn't want to believe reviews so I saw it myself....","5 April 2022","You should believe the reviews.

Unlike the new Batman, where from the very first scene I was hooked and stayed that way through the whole thing, (And it was long. People said it was boring and dragged on, but this felt 100% longer and it was only 103 minutes I believe) with this movie by the half hour mark I was hoping it would end soon.

The beginning absolutely sails through the introductions, with the first scene being a CGI helicopter landing on a CGI ledge with CGI water flowing into a CGI cave. Jared Leto gets out of the helicopter, cuts his hand open and bats fly and attach themselves to him right away.... Then it cuts to him and his friend as children in a hospital a long time ago, and within a single introductory conversation switches between several different locations of them sitting around and doing different things in different times/places having the same conversation. Then it switches to Jared Leto becoming a doctor, and then him working in a hospital, and then him coming up with a cure for his disease, explaining how he's doing it and then the trial is successful and he has a cure! Let me remind you, this is all the very beginning of the movie... 'rushed' isn't even the correct word. At this point the script was nothing but keywords.

I had issues with no one being able to really describe the movie, and now I understand why; there's nothing to talk about. Things just become the way they are with no proper explanation.

A perfect example and probably the only one you'll need: Tyrese Gibson is chasing Leto through a 20-something story building. The center of the building is open so Leto FLIES to the roof of the building, leaving Tyrese on the bottom floor. He gets to the top and almost falls over the edge, and who is up there with him?! TYRESE GIBSON. My husband and I said, maybe he's a vampire too??

No! No he isn't! The movie ends with no purpose to him whatsoever and he is most definitely not a vampire and could not possibly find a bullet-train elevator to reach the top of the building at the same speed as someone who FLEW! (If there is an explanation for this please forgive me)

And then there's the ""best friend forever"" Milo. These two sat in the park together and had one conversation and we're expected to believe they have this unbreakable bond. Jared Leto takes the serum he designed on a ship in the middle of the ocean with many procedures in place to cure himself, (and ends up diving off the ship after he murders everyone and swimming all the way back to his hospital on the mainland like he's also a vampire speed-boat, apparently?) and yet his friend Milo somehow gets ahold of his serum and injects himself with it and becomes super powerful all behind the scenes with absolutely no explanation. From then on he spends the rest of the movie harassing Leto into ""joining him""....to which Leto just keeps trying to ditch him like an annoying younger brother. Either that or they activity try to kill each other multiple times. You know, like best friends always do! Oh well. It doesn't hurt their feelings at all. In fact, nothing much does. Who is Milo anyway? Just some dude with a disease, no matter...

And through all this and without anything to do in the movie, the elderly doctor who helped them as young children remains the same age even though the children grow into men in their mid-thirties. He's also not a vampire, mind you. He just does a lot of Pilates to stay young, probably...

There's so much to talk about. I feel like I need a drink, a nap and something good to watch. So yes, believe the reviews. It is actually not good. But if you enjoy it, please enjoy it without shame.","3"

"mewvttd-41709","Morbius the antihero","11 September 2022","I'm writing this after just having watched Morbius on Netflix. After seeing all the negative reviews about it, on IMDB as well as other social media groups, I decided to set my expectations rather low. Fortunately I was pleasantly surprised with how the movie turned out!

Having grown up with comics where Morbius assisted Dr Strange, trying to stop a dark master from taking over the world, and shows where Morbius steals Peter Parker's formula when Parker is trying to cure his own mutation, I had seen a few different sides of Dr Michael Morbius.

The version in this film, shows a sickly Michael struggling to find a cure for his illness, and for the illnesses of others. A rather noble effort for a doctor. Michael then chooses to go above and beyond in his efforts, and much like Spider-Man's movie Norman Osborne (Willem Dafoe), it goes drastically the wrong direction.

Much like his other appearances, Michael becomes a vampire, feasting on human blood, despite his initial efforts to artificially curb his appetite. Fleeing from police and the stories other true villain, the film takes Michael through a fairly fast paced story arc, from over reaching hero doctor, to misunderstood monster, catching the viewer up in Michaels own hunt for humanity.

The CGI, while at times questionable (the face switching scenes when Michael gets enraged and the Morbius personae starts to emerge. Or during the fight sequences and echo location bits, where they have a weird Matrix meets Daredevil (Ben Affleck) vibe to them. The story line tried to keep on track, but unfortunately falls short on character development. While Michael Morbius is given an ok story line, other supporting characters are not so lucky.

Milo, who began as Lucian in the beginning, is shown as a sick kid that Michael was very rude to in the opening. This somehow led him to idolize Michael after one single incident, and a nicely written letter.

The Doctor in charge of young Michael, and later on, Milo's care isn't given much story arc at all, except ""Hey, I knew Michael was smart so I helped him out"". Aside from a few intercut scenes, he's relagated to a rather unimportant background character.

Dr Bancroft, Michaels friend, colleague, ad live interest. Or is she? All we really know about her is she's worked with Michael closely for years and helped him become what he is.

The detectives, one who's a former serviceman, that artificial blood Michael saved after he was wounded over seas. The other, played by comedian Al Madrigal (I really had to look it up, because originally I thought it was Pablo from ash vs the evil dead), who you may remember from him Maid on drugs comedy skit, seems to be just thrown in for the occasional comedy relief (holy water at the interrogation?).

Over all the movie itself isn't a horrible film. But personally I think it suffers from the fate of Spider-Man 3, trying to cram way to much stuff into a single movie. If you're familiar at all with Michael Morbius, from the comics, cartoons, or anything, give this a go. Just don't expect it to be a cinematic masterpiece and you'll be fine.","7"

The end credit scene hints at a potential sequel and I hope it never sees the light of day.","1"

"NestorTheGreat","What in the Van Hells is this?","7 April 2022","What do you get when you let Sony tell a Marvel story? Hopefully not Morbius! Because morbid is the least of its troubles! How can I compare it to other Superhero films? Let me count the ways!

Firstly it has a jump-in-your-seat scary scene, it's a dark film, and does not project a shred of empathy towards the characters whom are shallow, empty representations of people. Sony is definitely not Marvel as they do not know how to tell a story that is attractive to the audience- not a note of comedy and always using an English actor/accent to play the villain! The action is blurred, and the scenes between are slow and boring! Personally, I'm glad it was a short torture to watch!

All origin stories are drawn out and lack much action, but this story ups the bore, not gore! An unlikeable character that shows no sign of emotion unless pain is given abilities that are not fully categorised throughout the film. Blurry, colourful scenes are supposed to heighten our senses, but really distort them instead! His ears may itch or transform but we are left with quick cuts and unfinished potential as Jared jumps from one ability to the other.

The only clue we are given that it inhabits the same universe as Venom is already in the trailer- and that's all we get! A superhero is supposed to put other's well being above his/her own, but Morbius is as self-centred as Ritchie Rich with no redeemable qualities I could find at all.

The love interest, if you can call it that, is quasi inconsistent and feels totally unbelievable when it does spring up! The villain or antagonist is a cardboard cut out with nothing new to bring to the party! Hopefully the next instalment, if there is one, will develop the character and his abilities more understandably and stick to one genre. If it's horror- make it all horror- don't fall short like this film did, please!","6"

"rockdude-68045","Finally watched it despite the critics","4 June 2022","Kept an open mind heading into this movie. Overall it was okay. It's a movie that felt like it was just checking the right boxes at the minimum while flying through a plot that was really just made to introduce the character and set them up for more movies. However, unlike most movies where you can get immersed into the story this one missed that magic for me. At points I got bored plain and simple but other points I was into it. The special effects in this movie carried it (and I usually am not a huge fan of heavy cgi) and the plot/acting dragged it down. It's mediocre compared to similar movies to say the least but it wasn't like some garbage movie as others would try to make you think. It's like. B- C+ kind of movie.","6"
"FallenEye","From the Studio Bringing Us: More BS.","15 November 2022","Sony's Marvel Universe continues to be a disaster deepening towards a point of no return, as Morbius is another entry that confirms that Sony has absolutely no idea what they are doing. Three movies in and all three are awful, and as long as fans and audiences reward Sony's display of complete incompetence, the studio will never have any cause to change course.

To talk about this movie's action sequences would be a lie on my part, much like Sony's marketing of this movie, as it would suggest that I could make out all that messy and dark blur on the backdrop of blackness, while the casting - not the actors - of this movie is dreadful all around with some characters being quite the definition of pointless, and that could be in part or completely, due to a story so weightless that every character is even less than one dimensional, which can explain how every last one of them disintegrated from memory as soon as the credits started rolling.

However, though the directing, editing, scoring, photography, acting, writing, and marketing of this movie are all elements in contention of the worst Morbius had to offer in offering naught, I found myself not annoyed or disappointed by this movie, as I expected nothing, and it rose to the occasion by being nothing, which is the only form of consistency in this gag of a universe by Sony; all the movies in this universe are a whole lot of nothing. And, with it now basically being MCU canon - deceptively even revealed in the movie's trailer no less, I suppose it could also be a fitting addition in the MCU's mostly horrendous Phase 4, as just another entry worth no more than a single watch, and a permanent dump in the trash.

"catfashionings-94332","The Great Morbing Has Finally Begun!!!","8 July 2023","I would like to thank Jared Leto for this performance personally. It'll fill your trousers 11 out of 10 times boy! Really none of it makes that much sense but it doesn't have to because of the morbing. Leto's character is a brooding edge-lord named Elon Musk and he's kind of a crybaby throughout the film but, he really does pull the morb off with a certain panache that only Jerad's Leto could pull off. I sweat through my drawers by the time the ending rolled around but I soldiered on so I could see the final morbing scene... let me tell you it was worth it. Jerad really get's his morb on during that last scene.

Basically, if you liked Underworld you'll like Morbius... more or less.

Just be careful out there morbing unsupervised kids!!! This ain't no game kidzzz!!","10"
"lacit-18531","It's a good movie, but remember: this is a Sony production, not MCU","2 April 2022","Honestly, I liked this movie. I liked Venom, too. If you want a masterpiece of a movie (meaning a movie with an insanely high budget), go watch Avengers: Endgame or Shang Chi or Spider-Man: No Way Home.

Morbius is entertaining and it has a good story line. Yes, the story goes quickly and you're told everything you need to know within the first quarter, but I appreciated them not drawing it out. I also saw some elements of Dracula Untold in this movie and I thought that was cool.

Ultimately, I don't think you'll be disappointed if you go in knowing that this isn't as big of a production as some of the other movies. Want to be entertained? Here you go. Also, there are two mid-credit scenes (I didn't stay all the way to the end to see if there was a third).","8"
"joepm28","Same tired schtick from all the universes","17 September 2022","Whether its Marvel, DC, Star Wars or whatever universe or multi-verse Hollywood keeps creating, films like ""Morbius"" are just tired and unoriginal.

Run down of the hackneyed plot that is trotted out for ""Morbius"" like so many others: Good guy with super powers, bad guy with other or like super powers. One or the other or both of them are brilliant, tortured, misunderstood, or just plain crazy in some way. Or all of those. Then we get to the preposterous fight scenes which are more about seizure inducing CGI effects than really having anything to do with actual, physical fighting that can harm someone - other than disposable humans that are killed off like gnats with a fly swatter.

Even Jared Leto with his flowing locks and metro-sexual hotness couldn't lift this dog of a movie to above 5 stars. I fast forwarded through the last 1/3, so let that guide you to how unengaging this film was.","3"
"ellielolomg","Are people watching a different film to us?!","3 April 2022","Ok so firstly, we nearly didn't watch this as it had a rating of 4.9 when I checked it.

We went anyway as we love Marvel, and were so confused about the reviews!

Don't get me wrong, it didn't give me chills; but none of the origin stories ever have. Captain America and Thor's origin stories are two origin stories I like way less than this.

It was dark, it had the Sony tint, but in no way was it worthy of a 5!!!

Honestly give this film a watch it was really good and we enjoyed it and can't wait to see how it slots in!","8"
"ACollegeStudent","It's morbin time :D","24 December 2022","Rating: 5.0

It's not godawful it's just very generic and can be predictable. The characters are 2-D at best: Milo was just an ex-runt drunk on power, Bancroft the assistant lover, etc. The presentation was actually pretty good though there was too much slow-mo. The premise is stupid bat blood somehow changing DNA to cure whatever mystery ailment plagued milo and morbius[ and there were some plotholes like Bancroft surviving despite being killed by Morbius (yeah she had a drop of his blood but it shouldn't matter cause he sucked her dry, Morbius not killing himself like he promised and continuing to be a threat to society etc.. The end credits are terrible but overall a forgettable movie.","5"
"timothymwalkerengland","A poor use of some great actors","2 April 2022","Always love seeing Matt Smith, Jared Harris and Al Madrigal but apart from them doing really with very little this was really poor.

I think Mark Kermode was absolutely right. Matt Smith should have been the lead role. I want Al Madrigal in cinema!

It was too dark. The visual effects were a poor spin on The Matrix with disorientating focus reminiscent of the worst Michael Bay styling.

The story was wasn't very interesting. The vampires didn't even look as good as Buffy The Vampire Slayer.

The first maybe ten minutes made a familiar but not unwelcome attempt to ground the transformation with sci-fi detailing but it farcically descended in to fantasy in a way that way really jarring. If it had the humor and fun of a usual Marvel outing maybe this would have been fine but with it's self serious tone it just came off as lazy.

I really don't even think die hard Marvel and comic book fans would be in to this.

It did make want to watch Blade though to take the taste away.","2"
"gymstarjb","Needed more depth","1 April 2022","Certainly not as bad as what some have said. Storyline lacked depth overall - 1st half hour or so seemed great, they set the scene well but then the rest of the film seemed rushed with a basic plot. Not a terrible film but feel a sequel would need to be a lot better as obviously this one has not gone well with a lot of people. Think they could with targeting an older audience with this type of film. Spiderman + the mcu in general appeals to all ages, but this one feels as though its missing a bit of edge to it.","7"
"jacobbriscombe","Decent film with lots to be desired","31 March 2022","Average film at best, the opening 30 mins were actually pretty good but it then just steadily declines in the final two acts. The chemistry between Leto and Smith was nice to see but I just wish their characters were more fleshed out as there is so much lacking in their development. The cinematography was really nice and the overall plot was predictable but not the worst I've seen on the other hand the cgi in this film is awful and completely stopped me from being able to fully submerge in the story. This film had some strong potential for a newcomer in the Sony cinematic franchise but just ultimate falls short. The other main issue is the writing; most characters just make stupid decisions such as the detectives and it's hard to watch whilst trying to suspend disbelief. It doesn't deserve the current rating of 4.6 as believe me I've seen much worse films but it just doesn't hold up compared to the other films in Sony's world.","6"
"gieorge","Overhated for no reason","15 April 2022","It's sad how many people hated the movie before they even watched it. It's sure ain't one of the best superhero movies, but neither is it one of the baddest. It's a simple storyline, but it's still enjoyable. It's a good 7.5 movie !","10"
"scootergresham","A decent introduction to a cool character","6 April 2022","First of all, no this movie wasn't great. But it also wasn't a 1 out of 10 like a ton of people are saying. Of course if you're a die hard comic book/Morbius fan then yeah maybe they messed up because it's hard to get comic book adaptations perfect on the big screen. Putting those few die hard fans aside, I thought the movie provided a good introduction to the character of Morbius. It had a good story of how Michael became the vampire blood draining monster and had good emotion throughout the movie. Especially the scenes with his childhood doctor and best friend Milo. Marvel fans nowadays get caught up in big cameos or surprise appearances, and yes this movie had one in the mid credit scenes, but it was just a fun film to introduce a new character onto the big screen for the first time. I for one am excited to see what they do with Morbius going forward.","6"
"iloveu-22917","Excellent.","1 April 2022","This is the real Batman.👍🏽 Very good and interesting. You may thing they should added more action but this is the first part so the movie contains explanation for every thing.","9"
"jcrobles17","Went in knowing nothing about it and enjoyed it","5 April 2022","Moved fast vs The Batman. Good action and didn't spend too much time on origin.

"ethanhodskins-21069","Enjoyable but rushed","17 May 2022","This could have easily been a three hour movie and I wish it had been. While there are glimpses into Michael's past, they are not highly developed. In fact, I'd venture to say that Michael is post antidotal for 80% or more of the movie. While this direction allows for more action, it's less emotional and less exciting due to the lack of character development. There is no journey between any of main character's childhoods and career. It's more of a flashback per se. I would have liked to have seen more of the struggle in condition and in experimentation. How Michael arrived at his treatment is explained in seconds and is the only trial viewed. Something along the lines of I am Legend would have been nice. All of that aside, the visuals were phenomenal. The stage, costume, and locations were all satisfying. While some have criticized the special effects, the CGI is well executed; though, it isn't ground breaking as it's very similar to the style seen by Nightcrawler in the X-Men franchise or perhaps, Jumper. While the movie is action packed with a few intense moments, it does suffer from a bit of predictability. Overall, it's a decent film thats quite enjoyable for a Friday night flick. I would also say it flirts with an R rating, so don't let the PG13 rating scare you away too far.","7"

I really thought this thing was nice really nice! Like I said I would of done a couple of different things but overall there are zero complaints the thing was really poetically beautiful with the two boys growing up together only to realize how life and societal structure play such a profound role on our outcomes as we see here!

Illumination really outdid themselves with this stellar movie. The minions animation had my eyes glued to the screen. The only other movie that I think beats this movie is Morbius. Morbius saved me from depression. This movie had me laughing and enjoying myself. Morbius has given me a morbid amount of confidence that I think I might try to get a girlfriend. It also makes me want adopt lots of children, so I can sell them and buy more tickets and merch. I only were Morbius merch for clothing. And don't get me started on Jared Letos performance.

"skyfalls","Good movie.","7 September 2022","I thought it was a great movie with a good storyline. I just think it would have been better if it was a rated R movie like Blade but being marvel/disney we don't get to see that sadly. Acting was good and Jared Leto fit the part for Morbius perfectly. If they make a Morbius 2 I'm hoping it will be rated R because the killing scenes and just showing blood on camera is a let down when dealing with a Vampire.

The CGI was rather good when he was flying and slowing down the camera shows how fast he really is moving and his face was really good.

I enjoyed the end when he echo called the bats. That scene was nice to watch with the cgi and him being surrounded by the bats to bring him back.","9"

5.1 is way underrated, this movie is at least 6.8.

"shcoleman","I love Leto and was really looking forward to this movie!","4 April 2022","After I watched it, I kept asking myself who I would say is mainly responsible for how it landed. Unfortunately, I have to say the directing and editing. As the MAIN reason. It was just one cut scene after another. No character development, despite the bleak effort in the beginning. And the effects were only good if a character was standing still. I had to guess what I thought the powers were for the floating color waves based off of my own knowledge of where storytellers go with science fiction most times. And the ending was so quick and effortless that I still didn't care by the time the story got there. And the 2 end credit scenes made no sense in the grand scheme of what Sony has been trying to build alongside Marvel. Yeah, sure you can find a fan theory on some Reddit style waste of time blog but why do I have to keep doing that with this Sony/Marvel crap? I haven't read the comics. But I shouldn't have to read comics to go see a movie. I didn't have to with any other comic book based movie. So that's not a good excuse for me to not understand what the hell they were trying to do here.

But like I said, I absolutely love Jared Leto. And I'm a fan of some gruesome vampire tales. So I was so freaking excited for this movie ever since it was announced. But I walked out of this movie speechless. Mainly disappointed.","5"

"BlueBird84","Worst Marvel movie since the early 2000s","3 April 2022","Shoddy CGI, horrible editing, a boring and laughable script that gives the decent actors in the film nothing to work with. If this had been rated R and leaned further into horror, we might have had something interesting. How do you tell a story about a villainous vampire without showing hardly any blood? How do you give a scientific explanation for why this man can turn into a fanged and clawed monster on a dime, fly, control clouds of bats, and echolocate? His origins in the comic books be darned. At least Suicide Squad (the first attempt) was halfway interesting.

The ties to the MCU are tenuous at best so you won't be missing anything by skipping it.","2"

As a Marvel/Sony fan that have watched every movie they've made I can tell you that it's worth watching.

The movie is decent. It started off pretty strong but got a bit dragged out halfway through. However, I think the ending worked really well. The action scenes are great and visuals looks good too.

I can understand that some people was disappointed because there were a lot of scenes from the trailer that was cut out. From what I saw there was no poster of Spider-Man in there and Michael Keaton was only in the end credit scene.

Worth watching? Yes. Worth a second watch? Probably not.","6"

Unfortunately, there're few in evidence here. The story is a retread that has been do SO many times before - two teenager buddies become adversaries. But there were so many production mistakes here. The wispy special effects when moving was something from over 20 yrs ago. The slo-mo shots mid-scene for no reason. The lousy CG for the faces from the 90s. The waste of the talents of Jared Harris and Matt Smith. And Jared'a wooden delivery. There was so much material to draw from for what ends up as a retread of Darkman!

I agree there were many scenes where graphics were video game like. That being said it isn't Avengers and alien attacks you got to make it visually appealing some how without bombs and fires.

"groundzero-273-397110","Morbius is Marvel's not so cool version of Batman!","2 December 2022","This movie was kinda boring to be honest. Everything about it was a bore. The characters were boring and had no depth. The action was boring, with no real action, only slow motion action where you only pay attention to the terrible and ugly CGI of Morbius ape-face, or the action was sped up as Morbius flies or teleports across the room... It feels very dated... The whole story was very cliche and predictable, with two friends growing up together like brothers, and then one of them becomes the villain and the other one the ""hero"". The final fight between the two was not a fight, and is over before it even starts. Milo's final words was ""Michael, you can't kill me?"" with a sad voice. What?!

The music was also very Batman Begins-like in my opinion. Especially in one scene, when Morbius confronts and embraces the bats in the lab, and it's not just the music. That whole scene felt like a HUGE RIP-OFF of Batman Begins when Bruce Wayne embraces his fear of bats in the Batcave! This was the worst thing about this movie, coming from a big Batman fan! Morbius is Marvel's not so cool version of Batman!

This is the worst Marvel movie I have seen.","2"

But at times this film feels a little weak in aspects compared to the other films we've had some characters were good while some were bad. The Tension of the transformation of Morbius is so amazing and I'll say all the action sequences with Morbius on his own were amazing but the fights between him and the villian were very wonky and at times you couldn't see anything. Overall as it's own movie without any connections feels weird and plays as basically generic Vampire flic which could appeal to either audience but staying for credits expands this universe tremendously and while this isn't a spolier but vulture does show up and whats coming to this universe is going to be massive.","7"

"DanLawson146","Delayed by 2 years but still looks unfinished","7 April 2022","POSITIVES:

1) Jared Leto does a decent job in the lead role, even though he has such a poor script to work with 2) Matt Smith was the highlight of the film for me as the villain, although he does become far too over the top at times 3) The film is mercifully short, so it wasn't too difficult to sit through I suppose 4) I thought the special effects on the echo-location were well done, I'm assuming 99% of the special effects budget was spent on this, since all the other effects look terrible

NEGATIVES:

1) How can you have a film delayed for 2 years that looks like it's been rushed and put together in as short a time as possible? The script and editing are all over the place and most of the special effects are a joke for a mainstream film coming out in 2022. It wouldn't be so bad if I could see there was an artistic vision, but it just happened to not be a vision that worked for me; however the issue here is that there's no artistry or vision at all. It feels like Sony just wanted to get another superhero out with as little effort as possible just to make them some money and allow them to cling to relevancy 2) The film feels far too fast. The editing is so fast, almost to the point where cuts are put together that seem like something is missing in between. Also, nothing is ever stopped and explained at all, E.g. Why is Lucian called Milo for the whole film?? And how does he have so much money to fund all of Michael's research?? I rarely say this about a film, but this could've done with an extra 15 minutes to just give it room to breathe. I mean it literally finishes directly after the final fight scene, no coda? No ending to give a satisfying conclusion to each character arc?

3) The two credits scenes are both terrible and feel so tacked on. They don't even make any sense in the context of the MCU. Between this and the No Way Home credits scene with Venom, it just feels like Sony are desperately trying to be involved in the MCU and Marvel are desperately pushing them away - it's embarrassing.","5"

Then we use the same formula and the same voice in our new character Moon Knight... And let's write a confusing story about dreams and reality. And then let's make another movie about another Spider-Man foe Morbius. But this time, let's have another bad villain (Milo played by Matt Smith), Make our own character a villain, and have a bunch of zombie looking vampires fly around the screen in a blur. Are you kidding me? Well I hope marvel executives are proud of themselves because look what happened..DC took a step forward with ""Joker"" and now ""The Batman"".. which was phenomenal. The last time marvel came out with something good besides avengers endgame was ""the punisher"". (A+). Unbelievable how they abandoned that project along with the defenders. They really had something going there. Check out Nick Cage, Daredevil or Jessica Jones fabulous series. Sorry Morbius... You're going in the wrong direction! GRADE D.","3"

Matt Smith is the best thing in it - I hope he is in the many sequels that are bound to follow. Matt Smith is just the quirky Matt Smith thats been on British TV for years.

Parts of Morbius make no sense. Most of it is just plain silly. But its great fun.

"jdengraver","Meh","6 April 2022","Predictable, paper-thin plot with a virtually non-existent climax. Most likely building up to something bigger and better, but for now, it's just not that great. If you want a cool vampire movie from Marvel Studios, stick to Blade.","4"
"simbiat","Let's hope Blade is better","18 November 2022","Yeah, ""Morbius"" adaptation is not good. There were some good shots during fights, but they were far in-between. I think it fails the same way as Venom 2, but even more.

Venom worked, because Eddie was figuring out his new status quo, the movie was focused on that, it all made sense. Venom 2 tried to expand with Carnage, which did not really fit the atmosphere and the character of Eddie, because... He was not a hero. Which was clear from the get-go, but the movie was trying to show him as a hero. Kind of like ""Black Adam"", too, in fact.

Morbius was worse, because it did not know what it wants from the start. It tried to be ""moody"" and somewhat about moral choices of a vampire, but they did not really go for anything remotely ""psychological"". At the same time, they fail to provide enticing action, even though there are quite a few action scenes. It's like it has an identity crisis.

Considering, that we are supposed to get a new ""Blade"" movie as part of MCU, I think it could be much better to introduce Morbius alongside with Blade, where Blade is hunting him presuming, he is a villain (because of loss of control). You know, kind of like in the Spider-Man TV series from 1990s. Would make much more sense.","5"

The interactions of the characters are mostly robot-like and lack deeper emotions. The dialogues are really bad. The events and the behavior of people are illogical. The fight scenes are garbage. Making this PG-13 is a bad joke, should have been R. The references to MCU movies are forced and cringy. Also, misrepresented. The post credit scene is idiotic.

"danguneratne","Genius","23 April 2022","To everyone who thinks they dislike this movie, you are simply misguided. It's true masterpiece lies in one detail that a lot of people tend to overlook; the release date. This whole movie is an April fools prank and everyone fell for it, it truly is the Citizen Kane of the Sony Pictures Universe of Marvel Characters.","10"
"iamianiman","The shortest and laziest final battle I've witnessed in a long, long time HAHAHA. What was that?!?!","3 April 2022","I knew this character belongs in the Marvel Universe but I never knew him well enough to get my excitement boiling for his standalone film. Morbius had its marketing and scheduling issues; it was delayed for multiple times, and my interest which was already floating on the water becomes less and less.

Morbius has a simple and mostly, a predictable storyline. Aside from Sam Raimi's Spiderman, remember when you saw those old superhero films from the early 00s and you could just taste the cheesiness and how corny those films were made? Morbius is one of those films that should have been made sooo much earlier.

It's a film that is presented in a way like it is made for kids. There isn't anything strong enough to warrant a viewing for adults. Morbius is shallow with story and character developments that aren't well structured, resulting in a lack of depth that would make audience have a hard time comprehending the nature of its story or the motivation of its characters.

As the story flows, if there's one thing I'd like to bring to the table, it's this; why does Morbius get to be the good guy and the antagonist is forced to be THE antagonist? I don't get it. Often the film is devoid of any explanations to find a reasonable motivation for a character's intention or why some characters change abruptly over the course of its incoherent story. It's missing its pieces, confusing audience that there's no justification as to why a character becomes what he/she becomes.

Did Jared Leto give a good performance as Dr Michael Morbius? Mehhh is the first thought that comes to mind. It's not iconic nor is it awful, it's okay but it seems like everything Leto touches now would either be bad, a flop or receive tons of criticisms from viewers.

And I thought the final battle could somehow redeem the already subpar entry. But it didn't, it was in fact, the shortest and laziest final battle I have ever seen in a long, long time. You don't believe me? Time it, time the final battle. It's like the production has been cut out of the budget at the eleventh hour, they had to wrap it the soonest without even giving the film a proper closure 😭.

Now if you ask me, what about the good side of Morbius? Are there any redeemable qualities? Yes. For one, I love how they executed the slo-mo effects. Everytime the film got into slow motion, I thought they were pretty cool and awesome esp during the chase scenes.

There's something about the lighting that also impresses me. The blue & red neon-coloured palette did increase the overall quality look of the film, though I dislike the greenish-blue that was mostly used as the film's central colour.

In terms of storytelling, probably the only thing that kept me interested is the scientific element and terms they threw at the audience. I could tell that they actually did care about Morbius's origin and I was quite engaged with how they discovered the breakthrough that made what Morbius was later.

Verdict: Transported back to the early 00s, Morbius is a superhero film that uses an obsolete formula to tell a story that should have only be told if the materials were fully prepared and ready-to-go. By this point, even an antidote couldn't save Morbius.","3"

"Malarky007","The Matrix was done... 23 Years Ago!","15 May 2022","If you think mas1erbating into a sock is similar to having sex, then maybe, just maybe, you'll find this film amazing.

I was 14 when they released the first Matrix film and it blow everyone's mind away with the slow motion bullet cameras (1200 frames per second or something).

In the years since, they've done it all with that technology.

This film, however, seems to not be aware a thousand or more movies having already been there and done that, and decided to take the viewer on a ""Slow-Mo-ride-of-yourlife-adventure"".... Or something.

I didn't dislike the film. But I was far from impressed.

The script was hollow and really easy to read from the beginning.

The acting was good. The visuals were good. But just boring, I suppose.

Before watching I did find myself chuckling at the posters ""A New Marvel Legend is Born"" it proclaimed... Every time the advert guys print 'Legendary' 'Collectable' 'limited addition' 'Must have'.... It's never for the things that those words are genuinely prescribed to.

Anyway, not a bad film to pass the time and keep up to date with Marvel etc.

"azimkg","Stop hating this movie.","15 May 2022","First of all, in my honest opinion, it's 6,5 / 10.

The only reason I bet 10 is because so many haters aka ""I'm a fan who is in love with a comic version of Morbius"" went all the way to 1/10.

Let's compare this to ""Dr. Strange in the multiverse of madness"" - a movie that felt like a demo reel of a top production agency focused on special effects. The creators behind it tried too hard and absurdly butchered all the superheroes. On top of that, if you want to try to bring horrifying experience, please don't turn it into a silly comedy. All of that got 7.5 on IMDb. Not fair.

""Morbius"" at least had some decent and balanced acting and a storyline. Whole thing together was edited right and felt more like a movie. Yes, different from the comics and maybe not the best one, but not the worst either.

Atrocious acting, Matt Smith doing that English accent that Americans think English accents sound like made me physically sick. And who the hell keeps giving Jared Leto work? He's hilariously bad.

The script is dreadful, the special effects are shocking, and to top it off, they had the nerve to suggest at the end there might be a sequel.

Each Marvel movie takes the viewer to another world, that's sort of the point and if it doesn't take the viewer to another world then the movie at least creates a mythology for the characters to exist within. Morbius neither creates a mythology nor takes viewers to another world. The story itself, about sick dude gets well but at a price, is a worn out tale, and this movie adds nothing new to the concept. Morbius's powers are portrayed as dumb, but that may have been a writing issue.

Venom, and now Morbius both end with massive boring fights with tons of visual trash and clutter surrounding two versions of the same guy crash into each other over and over.

"cheeseirel","Second half was butchered","4 April 2022","The first half is actually very enjoyable, and I was curious to see how the story would go on, but everything stopped making sense after Milo suddenly wanted Morbius dead, without any good reason. I can understand that he wouldn't care for other people's life if it meant that he could be healthy and strong for the first time in his life, but why would he ever go against his best friend? We never see him having a resentment before that point.

""Killing"" two major characters in the span of 5-10 minutes wasn't a great choice either,and Martine only served as a damsel in distress.

The final action sequence wasn't that great, but not because of visual effects, those were great, the problem was that we were very confused on why it was happening in the first place.

Finally, I sincerely hope that the mid and post credits scenes won't lead anywhere, because I am not excited at all to see a Vulture-morbius collaboration, Morbius was good all this movie, why would he attack a guy he doesn't know in another dimension??","6"

"ta-98251","Underwhelming superhero movie and a worse vampire one","3 April 2022","If you looking for any old entertainment, you can find some here but otherwise it's a bottom of the barrel superhero film and an even worse Vampire movie 😩

There are many issue but one of the most potent is the super fast pacing. Things happen so quickly that you don't have any time to take it in and understand what is happening nor do you develop any feelings for the characters. This doesn't even include the 25 year jump that is made at the start of the film.

In keeping with the fast pacing, many things are unexplained or they happen off screen meaning that you have use your imagination to fill in the blanks and try to make sense of what is going on.

The story is basic and predictable yet it still relies on several coincidences and as a result it doesn't feel earned.

You never really get to understand the motivations of the characters. The Villain nor the romance are particularly convincing, largely down to a lack of plot and sufficient explanation. The facial CGI is poor though some of the action scenes had potential with fight scenes reminding of Nightcrawler in the X-Men which was cool.","5"

Some of the scenes were almost direct copies of stuff in that film, but in a film that wasn't quite as good or original. Once we left the theater. I looked up the movie, wondering if I could find similarity.. only to realize it's the same writers.

Which made me wonder did they just chose to use the cliff notes from their superior vampire film, instead of taking the time to create something new.

Now, if you've not seen Dracula Untold, or at least not as many times as I have, maybe this isn't a real issue.. but even without that, it still is a weak use of a really cool character and would have been better in another group of writers hands.","7"

While Matt Smith continues to elevate his acting capabilities and demonstrated just how diverse he can be, funny, attractive, troubled and now eerie. I'd have him lined up for the next James Bond baddie for certain!

Yes there isn't a complex plot but for an introduction to the character I think this was perfect. The short back story gave the characters more depth and helped us empathise with their decisions.

I think this movie should be watched and enjoyed. It has action, humour and as you would expect from a marvel a scientific backbone to the plot.

It's enjoyable and really well acted. I'd be happy to watch this again.","8"

It's by far the worst cinema experience I have had after ""Eternals"" (2021), I wanted to get out mid-way, the story felt all over the place, it seemed like Matt Smith and Jared Leto made the wrong acting choice, and there was zero to none movie marketing, no one knew how to promote this disaster of a film. And the only reasonable moment was the mid credits scene.

Outside of that the flying was pitiful. No blood shown. I dont think he was ever remotely that fast in the comics. And the scene with his wife rising from the dead? Bad to say the least. Funny how none of the people Milo drained seemed to come back...The scene with him dismantling the equipment of the counterfeiters and putting back together to make a blood research lab so hysterical. Funny how Spider-man never showed up either since Morbius first appeared in the Spider-Man title. #101. When Spider-Man had 6 arms...And I don't ever remember artificial blood being in the comic version. I know I know the movies are never like the comics. But if you are going to adapt a comic to the movies then adapt the comic don't change almost everything and just keep the name...","3"

This movie is mediocre at best. The problem is that when you look at the budget, you realize that it could have been a decent movie if only they put the smallest of effort into the script and production, however, they did not.

Every scene feels empty and cliche beyond comprehension. The performances are pretty bad, and the main characters do not have any proper arks. The villain literally does not have any motivation; he's just being horrible only because he can, which begs the question; why did Morbius not realize that his friend is a terrible person before?

Also, Morbius kills 20 guys in the beginning and then pretends that he is still a good guy. We are supposed to be ok with it because the movie literally tell us that they were ""bad guys"", and we're supposed to just accept that.","1"

So the plot is Michael that he has a rare blood disorder try to save his friend and himself mostly.

The show has a scene in the beginning that he tries to connect(?) with the bats and then 25 years earlier in Greece, which is not even in Greece, I am from Greece and I was like "" where is this place?"" Assassin's creed did a better job guys. Anyway after they show us the past we turn back to the present WITHOUT a notice, they didn't even put an effort on that. The movie continues to be problematic and the best part is his friend who wants the cure but Michael told him it's a curse not a solution to the problem, turns evil and he tries to kill Michael and blah blah we don't care, after the fight they movie finish SO BAD that i thought maybe they cutted scenes, unfortunately not.

"paul-wheeldon","Oh Dear","1 April 2022","Dreary and dull, this by the numbers origin story is possibly the worst Sony adaption of a Marvel character yet. Kudos to Matt Smith who does the best with the material on offer.","3"
"jonah_m","Worse than the hype","12 May 2022","I'm not exaggerating when I say that this was one of the worst films I have ever seen in my entire life. To clarify, I'm talking about movies that actually had a budget and were at least attempting to be enjoyed. But when it comes to ""studio"" films this one easily takes the cake as the worst in my book. Why is it so bad? Well let me explain:

1. Characters.

Now let me get this out of the way right now, the acting in this movie is not the problem. No one's winning an Oscar for this thing, but there were also no standout, horrible actors in Morbius. Jared Leto as Michael Morbius was surprisingly mellow, and Matt Smith as the villain was weird, but it worked for what he was clearly trying to do with the character. But unfortunately no amount of Ok acting could save the mess that was these characters. Like, what in the world were the writers thinking??? The character motivations were wildly inconsistent, or downright insane throughout the entire movie! For example: throughout the movie Morbius is constantly talking about how much he values human life and how he doesn't want to kill anyone, and how he'll take his own life to prevent himself from murdering anyone. But guess what... the movie ends and he completely forgets the fact that he said he would kill himself to protect humanity! Seriously, go watch the movie and pay attention, it's clearly said and then never addressed again. It's like the writers refused to ever check their former work, they just wanted to finish the screenplay asap. And don't even get me started on the two agents in the movie. What in the world were they thinking with those two??? Every line they had was either a horribly flat joke, or one of the dumbest sentences in the entire film! I could not stand it whenever they were on the screen, they were just there to push the plot forward and diminish the intelligence of the movie-going audience.

2. Inconsistencies and Dumb Contrivences.

This may seem like nitpicking, but I'd call it bad writing. There were SO MANY inconsistencies in this movie that I started to wonder if they were doing it on purpose. One example is what I mentioned before about Morbius' noble statement of his intent to sacrifice himself, and then never doing that. But I think the most glaring example in my mind was when the two agents were chasing Morbius in a building. There was a giant room with a staircase that went up at least 20 stories, and Morbius used his power of flight to reach the top in seconds. He then immediately walks onto the roof and is about to jump off when out of nowhere one of the agents burst onto the roof!!!! How did he get up there that fast??? The movie very clearly showed how huge the building was and how quickly Morbius was moving, so did the agent use a teleporter? Such a ridiculous moment in the movie, and I promise you these types of things were throughout the entire runtime.

3. Story.

What. A. Horrible. Story. I'm no writer, but I've seen enough movies to know a good story, and this movie seems to be aggressively running away from being good. Why does everyone keep making excuses for Morbius killing the mercenaries that he had hired? Why does Matt Smith's character IMMEDIATELY turn evil with zero motivation and no foreshadowing? Why do Morbius and Bancroft kiss while she's dying when they have had ZERO romantic chemistry the whole time??? (Seriously, there was never even a hint they liked each other, except for the fact that they were both attractive people.) Why does Bancroft aggressively bite Morbius' lip and then lick his blood? Seems like a really weird thing to do during a first kiss. Why do the bats listen to Morbius and not Loxias? Is Morbius drinking real blood now? Because apparently it was on the verge of being useless, so he must have switched over from the fake stuff. If Morbius is drinking real blood now (as the movie explicitly set up to be his only option anymore), then why did he care so much that Loxias was doing the same?

I could keep asking questions, but what's the point? I left Morbius genuinely wondering all of those things, but I don't think the writers were very interested in continuity or things making sense. The story is bad with a capital B, easily the worst part of the movie.

4. Post credit scenes.

What in the world was that??? Seriously, THAT'S the best you can do?!?!? I pray that whoever wrote the two post credits scenes never writes in Hollywood again, and I pray that whoever approved them never holds another job in the film industry. These two scenes are absolute garbage on so many levels! First of all, they are wildly inconsistent with the characters that they're portraying. Adrian Toomes is a man completely driven by his love for his family and his desire to take care of them, but when he suddenly blinks into another universe his only thought is ""I hope the food's better here""???? Huh?!? And then Morbius himself, when he meets up with the Vulture in the desert he is just torally on board with teaming up with this random dude in a flight suit. Since when was Morbius a villain?? He tried to NOT kill the entire movie! Also, this was not as glaring of an issue during the film, but the editing in these two scenes is horrific. It's just a bunch of quick cuts stuffed together, and it comes across as extremely rushed and unsure of itself. Instead of making me excited for the multiversal crossover I was instead left with the feeling that the studio didn't really care about what was happening. If they felt so little confidence in these two characters why should I care about them myself?

In the end, I know some people may disagree with my opnion and say they enjoyed this movie, and that's Ok. I praise anyone who can derive enjoyment from what I cannot, but I myself just could not get into this story no matter how hard I tried. I am usually very forgiving of movie mistakes and inconsistencies, but when it happens this much in one movie I can't ignore it. Overall, Morbius is easily the worst comic book movie of all time (Yes, I've seen Fan4stic) and on top of that, I'd say it's in contention for the worst movie I have ever seen! I hope some people out there can have fun with this movie, but I just can't find any reason to like this pile of garbage.","1"
"rafaelreijonen","I LOVE MORBIUS","12 May 2022","To question why Morbius isnt a 10/10 movie is comical. The fact that it sold one morbillion tickets during the opening weekend says enough. Although some sheeple may not have the required iq to truely understand the deeper messages about the social and economic states of the world.

Tl:dr you are a simpleton if you do not like morbius.","10"
"schummes","I love this movie","5 April 2022","The reaction surrounding Morbius has left me somewhat disillusioned by the notions of subjectivity and giving films their fair shot. Morbius is a film I enjoyed quite a lot and think maintains the spirit of the '90s comic books I grew up reading. I was thoroughly entertained. That's not the consensus, and that's OK.

And to the people eating the movie so negatively without even being aware of the source material and assuming that this is supposed to just be a random vampire flick I can see why you don't understand. Morbius is more then just a vampire. If you were to atleast read a summary of the morbius comics I bet you would change ur reviews.","4"
"pedrock-44102","Serious talk, i don't copy other peoples reviews.","6 June 2022","When it first got announced i doubted whether or not i should watch it since there was a tremendous amount of memes and hate thrown at this movie. I'm gonna review this based on my own personal opinion and why i rated 6/10.

1) The opening scene was unnecessary/could have been better but it was bland and didn't make any sense.

2) The idea of creating a character that rely on blood is overly exaggerated and so cliche.

3) Morbius, or i should say Dr. Michael Morbius is the protagonist here and so the name ""Morbius"" can't be used for other people like Milo who took the serum and turned to be like him... meaning the title of the movie is a bit off.

4) Medically this movie is misleading and all in all inaccurate. The idea of injecting or merging human DNA with bat DNA doesn't turn you into a superhuman being with ultra sense of hearing.

Everything about him made sense, he has super strength, he has ultrasonic hearing, he is fast, he is addicted to blood, the bats could communicate with him.....and he could fly 😊 As an origin story, I totally enjoyed it. Maybe the story could have been abit richer, fuller like Iron Man, Spiderman etc but it was a well spent 1hr 40min.

Acting was on point esp from Michael (Jared) and Lucian. Annnnd I think the sound was awesome. Try listening with surround sound on, everywhere was vibrating with those echoes and ultrasonic waves.","6"

It's just going through the motions and it has nothing interesting or memorable about it. It feels like a film made by 200 people in a factory, nothing is done very bad but it lacks heart and vision. It doesn't have a style, a world worth staying in or characters worth caring for. It's not so bad it's good it's just bland and dull.","3"
"TxMike","Origin story for Morbius, a Spiderman comics villain.","28 July 2022","This is the first movie which features Morbius which in some issues of Spiderman comics is a villain. Jared Leto is in the lead role as Michael Morbius, born with a degenerative illness but now a Medical Doctor looking for a cure, for himself and his boyhood friend Milo. It involves bats and the risk is that he will turn into a Vampire.

Here Morbius is written as a more complex character, with one foot figuratively in place as a good man seeking a way to use his newfound powers for good, while the evil side fights for supremacy.

All in all this is a well made movie and Leto, one of the best, does the role justice. The soundtrack is a killer, in certain scenes the low bass is reproduced by the subwoofer so I could feel it as well as hear it.

Most of the first 80% of the movie is interesting and tells a good story. There is about 10 minutes near the end which I can only describe as sensory overload, with flying fights and special effects, and we only tolerated the movie during those sequences. But overall we found it to be suitably entertaining, not worthy of some of the really harsh reviews here on the IMDb.

"lewismugarura","Don't take what people say...have at it","2 April 2022","Firstly yes I am a fan of the MCU franchise but this is quite separate from that down to the teams that created this film. That being said, Morbius is a decent movie, understand the harsh criticisms are because people associate this with the MCU thus the bar is set so high.

Otherwise if you liked the likes of Venom I don't see how you can't fail to enjoy this. Yes there's some incoherence and the fact that a vampire movie can have such little if not any blood..but looking beyond that and seeing this for what it is...the birth of the flawed anti-hero that is Morbius.","6"
"jacobpiszar","A decent premise that fails in the past third of the film.","8 April 2022","Morbius is a rushed film that feels like a step backwards for comic book films. With an almost late 90s to early 2000s feel, Morbius is rushed and disjointed. The movie starts well enough and set up a fun story, the last third of this movie is where the film falls flat with an abrupt ending and a terrible final battle. Morbius himself is an interesting enough character that I wouldn't mind seeing him pop up in later films, but as for this one it's pretty meh.","6"

"thesar-2","Less is Definitely Morbius","30 June 2022","Oh, BOY! I hope they bring back Blade to put this demon down.

I just HAD to see if it was as bad as everyone said it was and how bad the trailers looked. Whelp, majority rules - this SUCKED.

This movie was completely and utterly unfinished. There were many spots where things just abruptly happened to the point where the character is suddenly out of character. ""Oh! I guess *he's* a bad guy now"" or ""So the justice system works in seconds and not months to years?""

Another Dr. Who's strange is so desperate to cure his and his blood-brother's blood disease, he resorts to making himself an instant enemy of Blade. And then stuff happens, most of what you'd expect and many WTH moments.

This reminded me a lot of Hancock and Fant4stic Four (2015) whereas the first half is like ""eh, it's not as bas as everyone says it is"" and the second...oh, this movie needs an exorcism. Especially the end and end credit scenes.

I think I liked Jared Leto in one or two movies, namely Dallas Buyers Club. But ever since then, I cannot stand him. He reminds me a lot of Adrien Brody. They both seem so incredibly arrogant, pretentious and completely unapproachable.

Now, that all said, he wasn't terrible here. Just..boring. He looked SOO bored. Matt Smith seemed to be the only one in the movie who looked like he was having fun. Despite all that HORRRIBLE CGI they splashed on him.

Don't even get me started on the terrible CGI. It already looked terrible in the trailers and I always had hope they'd clean it up before the movie's release. Nope. And worse, these people had TWO YEARS since the first trailer dropped. They had plenty of time to Sonic the Hedgehog this bad baby up.

There's a scene in the trailer and movie with the ""good"" doctor flying. Well, here, he'll have PLENTY of large enough plot holes to soar right through.

Final Thoughts: These desperate attempts and films of Sony to hang onto the Spidey-verse are so bad. I'm not sure which is worse: Venom 1-2, this or The Amazing Spider-Man 1-2. Sony, just stop. PLEASE STOP.

The plot is so predictable, you can just watch the first few minutes, and the last few minutes, and still wouldn't have missed much. Flat, unrelatable characters with even flatter motivations. Trope-driven: best friends turned enemies... magic, miracle muscles... bullied kid becomes the villain... incredibly beautiful, intelligent, caring, love interest with immaculate make-up... dying mentor with parting words... dying love interest with parting words... useless police officers... final city battle in the city during the night... GAH, who wrote this, 10 year-olds in a treehouse?

All that dramatic hand cutting just to collect bats? How did normal vampire bats through a medical, scientific method create mystical abilities that defy biology and physics?

A film like this ample opportunity to be Dark and edgy but you had to Disney it up . Bring back adult films .","3"

"darklianempiremedia","Morbius 2022","2 June 2022","Morbius is fun and entertaining. Great script and awesome special effects. I'll bet the haters out there didn't even see it. This movie has it all, if your looking for a marvel movie with a dash of horror. Jared Leto is really good and it's nice to see him try a different type of role and I think it works. The movie story moves fast which I think is good. While the script has some funny dialogue that adds to the comedic side of the movie. Morbius should get a part 2. I'd like to see where the story and characters lead. I think Sony does a great job making their Marvel movies feel like their own. Morbius feels and looks like a Morbius movie. The screen is filled bold clear coloration which is unique to itself. It would be a shame to not develop another installment with the list of Sony marvel characters. Morbius is in the world of Venom and the Andrew Garfield Spider-Man, I'm just saying. The lineup looks good to me. Trolls are the dredge of society.","9"
"henry8-3","Morbius","5 November 2022","2 Childhood pals grow up with an incurable blood disease. One of them, Morbius (Jared Leto) finds a possible cure in the blood of vampire bats with inevitable consequences. Because of this, Morbius refuses to share his secret with his mate, Matt Smith, who in turn, decides that that is not good enough.

Not as awful as many would have you believe, it is nevertheless a pretty dumb movie which merely involves some early experimentation with blood, lots of angst and an endless battle between Leto and Smith - that's it. The 2 leads are fine but pretty typical of this type of thing with Leto clearly taking it all very seriously, the cops, Gibson and Madrigal make an occasional and pleasant diversion from the main story and the effects are, whilst as expected, rather more inventive and beautiful than usual. Passes the time.","5"

You don't wanna see me when I'm hungry"" - The foodie in me whenever I need my junk food.

Jokes aside, I liked Morbius. Contrary to popular beliefs, I found it to be somewhat decent, neither great nor terrible. Perhaps it is because I had gone in with little to no expectations. Almost everyone despised it, showing their discontent with Sony for whatever they had brought to the table. While I do understand why they might be so upset, I still believe Morbius got an unfair amount of harsh criticism and in some cases for no significant reasons.

Now don't get the wrong idea, I'm not here to play the devil's advocate; matter of fact, I too feel the inconsistencies of the writing to be bothersome. Especially, in terms of the overall characterization. That friendship between Michael and Milo was an indispensable piece of the plot, as the entire story is kind of based on that exact dynamic. While it is also true that they both had their fair share of screentime to demonstrate their newly gained powers (I just loved it whenever Morbius uses 'Echolocation') but these same characters, never got the chance to flourish as their normal selves, as human beings; and for a comic book movie, that is a major drawback I reckon.

The same goes for the characters of Martine Bancroft and Dr. Nicholas as well. I don't know how much importance they hold in the actual stories as I haven't read the comics nor do I have substantial knowledge about the Lore or about any of these characters for that matter, but one thing is for certain, these two characters shared the same fate as our primary figures.

Efficient yet unmemorable!","5"
"Reviews_of_the_Dead","Some Promise Here, but Falls Short","12 April 2022","This is a movie that I was intrigued by. I knew of this character from the Marvel comics. This would have been when I was in elementary school when I was collecting Spider-Man ones. If memory serves, he would be facing off against a villain named Kane and Morbius made an appearance. I completely forgot about this until I saw a bit of the trailer for this movie. It did interest me, knowing that we were getting a comic book movie that was shifting into the horror genre. The synopsis then for this movie is biochemist Michael Morbius (Jared Leto) tries to cure himself of a rare blood disease, but he inadvertently infects himself with a form of vampirism instead.

For this movie, we start in South America. I believe it is Costa Rica. The area had the Spanish name for death, but since I saw this in the theater, I didn't write it down. We get to meet our doctor here of Morbius as he is leading a team. He has this high-tech trap and he is trying to capture a special type of bat to this area. We learn these are ones can kill larger animals. I like that we are introduced here that Morbius has a physical ailment that he needs to walk with crutches.

We then shift 25 years into the past. We are in a hospital in Greece. Michael is a boy. The doctor that is trying to help him is Emil Nicholas (Jared Harris). Another boy is brought in and Michael goes about calling him Milo, due to them not staying there long. His real name is Loxias Crown. The two of them hit it off. They both have a genetic disorder that causes them to need what the young Michael calls an 'oil change' three times a day. We also see that Michael is brilliant as he saves Milo's life, much to the amazement of Dr. Nicholas.

In the present, Morbius is a brilliant biochemist. He won an award for his research in Sweden. We also see that he doesn't care about things like this though, to the point where he offends them. Working with him at a special hospital that also houses his laboratory is Martine Bancroft (Adria Arjona). She reveals that she knows his password and found his research. It is not only unethical, but illegal. He is using bat DNA to try to fix his own genetics. His experiment works in a lab mouse, so he is going to use it on himself.

I should also point out here that Milo has moved to New York City as well. The two of them spend time together where Dr. Nicholas is helping him. Milo is helping to fund Morbius' experiments in hopes he can save them both.

Things then take a turn when the experiment works. There is a side effect that turns Morbius into a vampire. He has bat like features when he is the creature. Morbius contains his hunger with a synthetic blood he created. The problem is that the more he uses it, the less it staves off the hunger. He is against the clock. There is another complication when Milo gets his hands on this experiment as well. Milo doesn't have the same self-control that his friend does. Two federal agents are also on to them, Simon Stroud (Tyrese Gibson) and Rodriguez (Al Madrigal). This puts the city at risk as Morbius tries to save himself and his friend before it is too late.

That is where I'm going to leave my recap here. I might have spoiled something here if you aren't familiar with Morbius and his foes. What I will say is that the movie reveals this early on. I don't think it ruins the movie knowing this information either. When I was watching this, I knew that having Smith in this role of Milo that he would be important. Since I'm not up on the lore of Morbius, I wasn't sure who his villain would be. One of the bright spots is what the movie does with the emotional aspect for that. It isn't anything new though, especially for these types of movies. I am forgiving and can go with it as this is a common concept for comic book adaptations.

For the positives, I was glad to see another try doing a comic book adaptation in the horror vein. Morbius is a vampire. From what I remember, he's an anti-hero as well. I didn't delve too much into him and I still don't know a lot. We are getting an origin story here for the most part. He can't control his abilities or his thirst. This is strategic that the first people he attacks are shady characters. I did like what they do with this experiment. They go out into international waters on a vessel. He also has mercenaries who aren't the nicest people protecting him. Using characters like this here is strategic as we don't like or connect with them.

I did want to shift slightly as the ship they're on is called Murnau. This is a reference to F. W. Murnau who directed the vampire film, Nosferatu. Without even realizing this, I wore my shirt from this classic. If I do have a negative though with all of this, they are tame with the horror elements. Part of this is going for that PG-13 rating. I'm not going to complain too much, but they could have gone darker.

Since I've already brought up negatives, that is where I'll go next. I'm not sure what their plan is with this movie. The villain of Morbius and how that plays out feels like it should be a sequel. I'm sure they didn't know if this would do well and from what I'm hearing, this movie isn't, so I'm not sure if we will get this character back. It almost feels like this movie should have had Morbius being more of anti-hero. Have the authorities coming after him and focus on him as a character. The villain we have here feels forced and bit a rushed.

I won't go into details about this, but I also don't necessarily like that they are pushing this into the Marvel Cinematic Universe. I can't blame them. There is so much money there. I don't mind the idea of Morbius being a part of it. What I will go back to though is that maybe give him a movie where we truly get to learn about him. I've heard rumors that Marvel is going to do their own Blade movie. I would have liked to see them go into a darker side of the MCU first before bringing him in with other super-heroes or villains. MCU is all about the long game and this being in conjunction with them just feels like Columbia is forcing to get that payday.

That should be enough for the story so I'll go over to the acting. I thought our four leads are solid. Leto brings a bit of snark to Morbius that I appreciate it. If anything, we get that in the beginning and it goes away from it as the movie progresses. I wanted more of him personally. Smith is good as Milo. I like the change in his character as well. We feel it there from the beginning, he just needs the strength. Arjona is good as the voice of reason for Morbius. He ignores though, of course. I liked Harris, but he's another one that I wanted more of. He is such a solid actor. Gibson is fine along with Madrigal. It is interesting that the former isn't playing the comedic role where his counterpart is. Different from what I'm used to for sure. Other than that, the rest of the cast was fine for rounding this out for what was needed.

This will then take me to the effects, cinematography and the soundtrack. For the former, this is a CGI fest. I like the look of Morbius. His vampire is bat-like. There are also vibes of Nosferatu there. I would have liked a bit more practical effects as this all seemed to be CGI. The use of the bat sonar stuff is fine. Again, this was done with computers. I get why, but I don't love it overall. The cinematography was also fine. They go a bit too far with some of it, but they're also doing it to showcase Morbius' abilities. Other than that, the soundtrack fit the movie for what was needed.

In conclusion here, this is a movie that I came in with low expectations. Trying to combine horror elements with a comic book film interests me, but I still have not seen one that does it well since something like Blade 2. Morbius is an interesting character so that does keep me invested a bit. The acting here is solid enough, but I wanted more of Leto and Harris. Doing a bit more with practical effects would help, but they use more CGI. The cinematography left a bit to be desired. This feels more like they're doing an origin story for Batman; I did want to say that. Despite my expectations, this movie was disappointing. I'd say this is over average. It is serviceable, but they could do more.

Great cinematography but I think I'm tired of the once i turn into a super human I must protect mankind or I must be absolutely evil , that's played out. Not to mention a tan of Connie moments Mxm. Sloppy editing and no real story. The pacing felt weird, personally I think it should've been a R-rated action horror movie.

Just ridiculous. I'm convinced Hollywood knows how simple minded people are. Jared Leto was great, nothing wrong there, the concept was fine, nothing ground breaking but it was fine, the real problem was everything else.

"Special-K88","does next to nothing with the source material","14 July 2022","Michael Morbius is one of the few against the many, a sickly child with a rare blood disease that hinders his motor skills. But fast forward to the present where he's an ambitious experimental scientist in the Big Apple, one who pushes an ethical boundary and ends up turning himself into a vampiric abomination. Leto has no real fun with this role as he seriously underplays the drive and obsessiveness of Morbius, but there's barely a character, hardly a story, and once the hook is revealed it becomes pretty generic, plus the Matrix-inspired echolocation effects really suck. Might work for fans of the vampire genre, but Wesley Snipes already did this kind of thing better back in the 90s; it's not a good sign when the (expected) easter eggs are more intriguing than anything else that happens in the rest of the movie. **",NA

"questl-18592","Nope","27 July 2022","How in the hell did this actually make it to theaters like this? Lets break this down.

Story. Yeah, there's a story but it's about the most tired, boring, cookie-cutter of a story ever. It lays everything out in the first few minutes and then the rest of the movie is just walking the well-known road to the predictable ending.

Character work. There really isn't any. Yes, there is the whole, ""This is is them when they're sick. He gets superhumanly better, this is what he is now,"" thing but again it just feels tired. The Morbius character has some of the most ill-defined, nonsensical powers ever. Sure, I get that he's basically the Marvel Dracula but come on you have got to do something to explain this dude.

The real kicker though? I can deal with a movie with a dumb plot and dumber characters. Honestly, that's most action movies. Those at least look cool though, usually. Fury Road is a pretty blah story and a fairly one-dimensional protagonist (Max, not Furiosa) but it's such a visual and technical spectical we love it. Morbius, on the other hand, was straight-up painful to watch at times. The big showdown at the end especially looked like it was rendered on Windows 98 Paint like one of those terrible old haunted house games where you had to click around and solve little puzzles to get out. It isn't just the end though, the whole way through there's this really... What is this effect their putting on Morbius? At times it seems like its supposed to be a visualization of sound for echolocation but then at other times it feels like they just had left over Carnage software and thought it would look cool if Morb was leaping around with weird tendrils behind him. Its such a cacophony of obnoxious nonsense that it ruins any chance of these action seens being remotely enjoyable.","2"

"Gibson-H","The worst film of the year so far","21 April 2022","Morbius is directed by Daniel Espinosa.

It stars Jared Leto, Matt Smith, Adria Arjona, Jared Harris, Tyrese Gibson and Al Madrigal.

In this new marvel film, ""Doctor Michael Morbius"" and his friend ""Loxias Crown"" are suffering from a rare blood disease. With time running out, Michael finds what he thinks is a cure but It ultimately inserts a living vampire into his body which has an urge to consume blood. Michael must find a way to live with the vampire while also trying to help ""Loxias"" from inserting his own vampire.

So, this has been released 2 years after It's original release date and no one was really asking for it. But I love the marvel universe so of course I was going to see this. I wasn't really excited but I like to give every film I see a fair chance. I don't think many will be surprised when I say this film was bad. Really bad.

The positives

The performances are overall very good. Jared Leto does well as Morbius. He doesn't play anything special but he's very good with what he's given. Matt Smith as Loxias Crown was really over the top and I loved It. The movie hopes you take his character seriously but you can't because Matt Smith is just not giving a damn and playing the character how he wants to. He was really entertaining and quite charming. Adria Arjona was ok as-well. I didn't really care for her characters romance with Michael but her performance is really good. I like the design of Morbius In this film. It looks creepy and Is quite faithful to the design in the comics. The makeup artists did a very good job with the design. There was one good horror scene. It had a good build up but the ending of that scene was so cliché.

The negatives

This movie is so predictable. It's cliche and your bored until the post credits. After watching the first five minutes of the film, I knew exactly what was going to happen but I still watched just to give the film a chance. The villain's motivation has been used countless times in film and I'm getting bored of it. After, Loxias gets the vampire, I checked out because i knew exactly what would happen. Bu Matt Smith is loving his time, he's so over the top. Another big problem with the film was It's trailer. A' lot of things that were in the trailer were not in the film. Remember seeing that Spider-Man painting on the wall. Well I hope you had zero hope of it appearing in the film because It never shows up. Remember seeing Adrian Toomes In the trailer. Well prepared to be disappointed as he's in the film for about a minute. I hate when studios oversell things with their trailers. They tricked you into thinking that Vulture would be in the movie for a good period of time and they tricked you into thinking that Spider-Man could appear. It's so offensive to your audience. The action In this film Is so boring. They kept doing that slow-Mo then fast sort of editing. It was good back when the film ""300"" came out but It's being milked to death and I just want to see something new with the editing. The action scenes are CGI cluster bombs. Some of the CGI is so bad. You can see green screen outlines around the actors and the digital models flop around like they have no muscle and bone. The character's have so little development as-well. Some are underused such Morbius's mentor and Martine Bancroft. This film is pretty much here to set up future films. Not to tell a compelling story. I really hope Sony Improves on there Marvel universe because I'm starting to want Spider-Man properties to go back to Marvel.

Conclusion

Morbius Is terrible. Some good performances, one scary scene and a good character design. But with a misleading trailer, terrible action, terrible characters, atrocious CGI and no attempt to create a compelling story. Morbius Is predictable and has so many cliché's that you forget about this film after 5 minutes of seeing it.

"bostonboy-57498","Morbius","2 April 2022","Just got home from seeing it, Honestly Jared Leto was good in it, The special effects are top notch, but other than that the movie was ok at best. If you're not a huge Comic Book fan maybe wait till this one comes out on Blu Ray.","6"
"SPZMaxinema","While there were some good elements, it made me laugh too.","12 August 2022","Some sequences in the movie were actually pretty well done, and I was reasonably entertained the entire time. In particular, the scene with the nurse running down the hallway and the twist with Michael not being the one who murdered her and instead Milo becoming transformed and turned evil as well was good concerning the story. And I also liked how Michael handled himself becoming his new alter-ego with discovering his powers and abilities in his lab, his weakness, running from the police, etc.

However, while I liked seeing Michael Keaton again as the vulture, it felt very forced and shoe-horned in at the last moment, and how did he make his wings again without the alien tech from the other Universe where he got his other technology from in Spider-Man: Homecoming?? Also I did not buy the romance between Michael and the other doctor/coworker and her also transforming into a vampire woman, did not buy it for one second. And how she got knocked out on the boat out of nowhere just by a shove just made me think ""oh man, how stupid was that?"" It also felt very rushed, shallow, and stale in many scenes and the kid actors couldn't really act convincingly which is normally the case. Sometimes the CGI worked and sometimes it didn't, and overall I'd say it's a pretty bad movie for blatantly bad things but not all terrible! Worth a watch whether you end up hating it or not, but I'm for sure glad I rented it instead of bought it.","6"

"pc95","Another Dirt Poor Comic Adaption.","9 July 2022","Rightfully panned as a flop, director Daniel Espinosa, has an awful script and story to work with and fails to rise above the absurd amount of cliches and poor editing in this turkey. It lacks transition in story arcs and even managed to score poorly in effects, as well subpar dialog. The 2nd half of the movie in particular was abysmal with cliched uninvolving action scenes. The actors seem up to the task but the direction and script fail. There seems to be a love affair with Spiderman-type jumping and flying cinematography that get badly worn out and overused. The movie concept in Morbius has more potential but the execution is flubbed. In the hands of better filmmakers and a better story - it might've been good. Probably not even worth a watch. 4/10.","4"
"stefanbjj","Between the politically correct movies Shang Chi and Wakanda, I choose Morbius.","7 February 2023","Venom and Morbius come with a new and very fresh direction and they don't care about the rules at all. Even if they have smaller budgets, they break out of the pattern of their richer relatives and do something that their rich relatives haven't done for a long time, since they started following an agenda: they offer us an alternative, a new direction to turn our imaginations towards . When a star disappoints you, see Wakanda and everything that Marvel has been doing for several years, it leaves a bitter taste. When a challenger surprises you, well... Morbius is a cursive film, without gaps and that does its job. It doesn't bother me at all with feminist nonsense or estrogenic nonsense with which it needs to justify big earnings in a distant part of the world.

The first 30-40 minutes was messy. I still don't understand how the beginning scene ties to the rest of the movie. If you can hold on for a bit, the movie can be entertaining. Some said it was worse than Venom. I strongly disagree. The CGI could have been better. I agree with other reviewers that an R rating is more appropriate for this type of movie.","6"

"sergelamarche","Marvellous vampire","27 December 2022","A marvel movie is a marvel movie. Expect super-powers and incredible survival skills and uncrushable bones.

It begins rather awkwardly with the pair having deadly diseases. The search for a cure is not too badly done with a few lines and lab equipments that are accurate. Where it obviously goes over the top is when the needle gives extraordinary super-powers. As if a poke from a radioactive spider can give spider super-powers. Oh, makes sense in the spiderman universe... haha!

In any case, Morbius (a nice swear word for me now) has a vampire nut case to solve for two. I'd say the film is a mongrel made with DNA of dracula, spiderman, neo, flash, superman, and a real molecular geneticist.","6"
"Horror_Flick_Fanatic","Far from perfect, but not a turd","17 May 2022","I was expecting a turd based on reviews and box office numbers I heard in the news, but it really isn't bad at all for a comic book film. I felt this movie would have benefitted greatly if the producers targeted an R-rating and added some blood and gore. But between the studio bean counters looking for maximum revenue of a PG rated film and an elitist communities of comic book gatekeepers ready to condemn a film that doesn't fit their pedantic canon, these films have a hard time.

The core of the story isn't unique once you strip away the marvel universe. It has some of its basis in the Old Testament. Even the names of the two main characters indicate as such. Dr. Michael Morbius like Michael the Archangel and Milo/Lucien like Lucifer battle each other, one good and the other bad.

Unlike the biblical stories, this story doesn't really show why Lucien became evil with his new power. We don't see what made him go to the dark side. Both were loved and taken care for by Dr. Emil Nicholas. Both men were adopted brothers. So the crucial part missing with this film is what caused the separation? In this film, both men actually save each other's lives at different points in the film. So what broke that brotherly bond to cause Milo/Lucien go astray?

The other part that bugged me is why were there mercenary thugs on the ship where Morbius was working with Martine? Who paid those guys to be on that ship and why were they concerned with what Morbius and Martine were doing? See, that wasn't explained either.

The acting performances by all of the actors are great. Hey, these Brits know their art and they are all wonderful actors. Jared Leto pulled his weight too. The special effects were good too, although I've seen some of these effects before like the X-Men Nightcrawler played by Alan Cumming.

The film isn't a turd. I really think they should have aimed for that R-rating and patched up the plot holes with regards to Lucien's descend into murder and evil. I just think two men who grew up as two boys together would try to save each other first before going nuclear on each other.

This character also begs what would happen if Morbius and Blade crossed paths. If Marvel rebooted Blade and then made a film with Morbius and Blade, that would be a film worth watching.","6"

The special effects were supposed to be created that way, so what's all of the negativity for when it comes to how it was shown on the screen. Jared Leto is fantastic in this movie and any movie for that matter. I enjoyed the usual Marvel twist after the end credits.","7"

I honestly enjoyed this more than the usual Marvel action movies as it was different and less predictable in a dark kind of way.

Some peoples ratings on here shouldn't be allowed!

To rate such a decent movie as low as 3 is shocking and should be removed.

You can't rate it purely by benchmarking it to other movies. Sure look at all the very bad movies out there, low budget, u know poor actors etc, maybe they should get a 3 but not this high end movie with decent actors!","8"
"ImTheNobody","Terrible story telling for a great villain","3 April 2022","After watching this movie, I was so disappointed. Morbius is a cool character with an interesting backstory, personality, so on. The beginning was pretty solid, but it dropped for the rest of the movie. The middle has absolutely nothing happening in it, and the climax was a confusing battle. The fight scene in the climax was very confusing due to not knowing what is going on, just a bunch of rubble flying around on the screen. Overall, this is a terrible movie, though it had potential, it flopped after the first 20-30 minutes.","1"
"joicseth","so f---ing boriiiiiiing","3 November 2022","Morbed so hard until like the first 4 minutes- the pacing is so weird. Nothing freaking happens until the very end.

Also why did the chick turn into a morb as well at the end??? There was zero precedent for this and it's not explained at all. The post credit scenes are.. confusing.

The only things getting this movie to a 3 are Matt Smith's amazing acting (even though his lines are garbage, he did his best) and that one scene where Mr. Morb and Milo are strolling and talking and it's actually funny. Please don't watch this.","3"

"Anurag-Shetty","Sony's Spider-Man Universe needs a Spider-Man.","21 June 2022","Morbius tells the story of biochemist Dr. Michael Morbius(Jared Leto). Morbius tries to find a revolutionary cure for a rare & fatal blood disease. However, he accidentally infects himself with something far more sinister.

Morbius is an unremarkable movie at its worst & a stupidly entertaining film, at its best. Director Daniel Espinosa has given us a satisfactory origin story. However, Morbius is not an iconic character like Venom or Spider-Man. The audience won't really care what happens to this character unless the movie is flawless, which this definitely isn't. Sony really needs to introduce a Spider-Man into their villain universe. Even next year's Kraven the Hunter(2023) movie, has to have Spidey. The drawback of Venom(2018) & Venom: Let There Be Carnage(2021) was the absence of the beloved wallcrawler. Since Tom Holland's Peter Parker/Spider-Man is in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, Sony's Spider-Man Universe should bring back Andrew Garfield's Peter Parker/Spider-Man after the monstrous hit that was Spider-Man: No Way Home(2021). The action set pieces are just about passable. The visual effects are laugh-worthy. Not a big fan of Morbius' vampire face. The mid-credits scene teases a future that may or may not happen, which is very frustrating. The scene is also so forced & out of place. Jared Leto is great as Dr. Michael Morbius. Matt Smith is the star of the show as Milo. Smith gives us a scene-stealing & spectacular performance. You can tell that Matt Smith is having the time of his life. Smith's performance is the highlight of the film. Adria Arjona is superb as Martine Bancroft. Jared Harris is brilliant as Dr. Emil Nicholas. Tyrese Gibson & Al Madrigal are effective as Agent Simon Stroud & Agent Rodriguez, respectively. Morbius is not worth a watch. However, watch it if you have a lot of time to kill. Please do better, Sony!","6"
"tpcatoz-90650","Sub par","3 April 2022","I'll be straight to the point. If you're expecting a ""good"" movie you will surely be disappointed. This is a subpar comic book movie and towards the bottom of all the comic book movies.","4"
"Vivekmaru45","Average vampire film, inferior to the Blade series of movies.","18 May 2022","I only watched this because of an episode of Spiderman 1994 animated series entitled Morbius(season two, episode 19). The movie relies largely on C. G. I. Effects to captivate the audience. The background sound effects are decent for a film of this type and the photography is too. The actors in the film are just about okay. I didn't find an actor I liked in this movie - too many stereotypes.

The film concerns a boy with a terminal blood illness who grows up to become a research scientist in order to find a cure for his illness. However the cure he discovers has a horrifying and irreversible side-effect.

The movie is somewhat similar to the cartoon episode/comic book character. Like many movies of this type, this one will get a sequel film. The movie has a very boring plot and it is directed badly. The script could have been better if the director had the good sense to change it. The special effects in the movie are nothing short of ridiculous and many in the audience are sure to guffaw.

Overall I would call this movie a bitter disappointment and would only recommend this movie to diehard fans of Spiderman, Blade and Morbius.","5"
"W011y4m5","Can I smell burning?","28 February 2023","The movies I've sat through in service of supporting Matt Smith's career... Wow. The television series he stars in are usually iconic but his agent consistently does him so dirty when it comes to choosing characters to play in feature-length projects. Additional shout-out to Karen Gillan who also set him up, allegedly encouraging him to take the role of ""Milo"" - which is funny, considering he steals ""Morbius"" with his performance as the narrative's antagonist, apparently being led by personality vacuum & Hollywood A-lister, Jared Leto.

In truth though, this is low-key camp & I'm living for the crappiness of it. Released in 2022 but giving Halle Berry's ""Catwoman"" vibes. Terrible - undoubtedly - & one of the most poorly constructed films I've ever witnessed (with awe inspiringly terrible direction - giving no sense of time progression or geography) but on the other hand, it's so bad, it's good.

They act like they know more about movie making than they really do. The movie was great, if you're expecting something typical of a vampire movie that's completely on you, because that isn't the kind of ""vampire"" Morbius is. Film critics and other people's opinions don't matter any, if you like it then they were wrong, and guess what, they usually are, film critics are the worst people to trust.

This is reasonably fast paced, Jared Leto is more than acceptable in the lead role, the overarching narrative is solid and the VFX are better than most recent Marvel movies. I suspect this film suffered from the lack of a recognisable protagonist combined with the fact that is totally humorless, isn't a tie-in to a broader narrative, and frankly would have benefited greatly from being R rated given it's dark subject matter. Anyway I personally thought it was better than any other recent superhero movie but to each his own.","8"

"kellerdimitri","Why Morbius is underrated","25 June 2022","To be fair, you have to have a very high IQ to understand Morbius. The humour is extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of theoretical physics most of the jokes will go over a typical viewer's head. There's also Morbius's nihilistic outlook, which is deftly woven into his characterisation- his personal philosophy draws heavily from Vampire literature, for instance. The fans understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of these jokes, to realise that they're not just funny- they say something deep about LIFE. As a consequence people who dislike Morbius truly ARE idiots- of course they wouldn't appreciate, for instance, the humour in Morbius's existential catchphrase ""I am Morbius,"" which itself is a cryptic reference to Turgenev's Russian epic Fathers and Sons. I'm smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as Daniel Espinosa's genius wit unfolds itself on their television screens. What fools.. how I pity them. 😂 And yes, by the way, i DO have a Morbius tattoo. And no, you cannot see it. It's for the ladies' eyes only- and even then they have to demonstrate that they're within 5 morbIQ points of my own (preferably lower) beforehand. Nothin personnel kid 😎","1"

Leto tries controlling his discovery, but will Smith be as responsible (ya think?!).

"susb12932108","A suprisingly good movie!","11 January 2023","I watched this movie out of morbid curiosity. After all that hate and ridicule, the memes and the jokes, I was expecting something like The Room. I thought it was going to be one of those instant cult classics: So bad it becomes remembered in movie history.

Turns out, the movie is not bad at all. I was literally looking for the part that must have generated all that hate and couldn't figure it out. And I am usually a pretty harsh critic.

This movie isn't a great master piece, the biggest issue being that you won't care much about the characters. The CGI is fine and the directing is fine and the writing is fine. As for the acting, I can't really tell: The main character doesn't show much personality, but I can't tell if that's on purpose or if it's bad acting on Leto's part. (There is a reason the character might be closed off emotionally.)

Still, the movie is better than 90% of the Marvel junk that Disney is putting out. The Guardians of the Galaxy was an amazing movie, but its sequel was some of the dumbest writing I've ever seen. Yet it has 7.6 rating? I can only assume this is about loyalty to the characters. Similarly, ""Spider-Man: No Way Home"" deserves a 5.5 with its sloppy writing, sloppy conflict creation and sloppy conflict solution. Yet it has an 8.2 currently, most likely because of the familiar faces they bring in around the second half of the movie.

All in all Morbius was an enjoyable movie and a fun way of creating a vampire super hero. It won't leave you with any profound impression, but it is better than most of the super hero movies out there.","7"
"gregthegreggreg","Vampires Suck","10 April 2022","Potential Spoilers Ahead

Okay no, Vampires don't suck. It's just that this specific vampire movie isn't very good.

It's a shame too as I was curious about how this would turn out. Dr. Michael Morbius isn't a very well known character within the Spider-man universe but as Iron Man and Guardians of the Galaxy proved, great movies can turn previously unknown characters into icons. Taking away the comic book connection, a movie where a doctor slowly becomes a vampire and has to reconcile his human side with his growing desire for blood could have made for a good character study mixed with violent action...even if it was PG-13.

Unfortunately we didn't get that movie. What we got was a boring and predictable mess that squanders any potential the story had. Reviews of Morbius have universally described it as one of the worst comic book movies to have been released in recent times. Yes, it's bad but it just feels so forgettable that it doesn't seem worth raging over. In some ways, that might be worse than a movie that is so bad it's maddening.

Maybe that's why the characters-whatever it be Morbius or any of the side characters-feel stale. They feel like they're just there to make the plot happen instead of providing any sort of engagement. As a result, any sort of emotional engagement to them is about as lifeless as Morbius's victims. For example, an important character that has emotional attachment to Morbius is killed. It's supposed to be an emotional moment but since the script doesn't allow the audience to get to know that character, it feels hollow and forced.

As for the acting, I do feel sorry for Jared Leto here. He has been in a lot of good movies (Fight Club, Requiem for a Dream, American Psycho, Dallas Buyers Club) but between this and Suicide Squad, he may have just cemented his reputation as comic book movie poison. It's not that he's awful as Morbius, he's just doing the wrong performance for the wrong movie. Throughout the film, he goes for a very dry and subdued performance that doesn't change (except for a couple of scenes). That might have worked in a different movie but here, it comes across as robotic and as a result, he is unfortunately uninteresting compared to the main villain.

Speaking of the villain, Matt Smith plays him and to his credit, he really looks like he's having a lot of fun. Whenever he shows up on screen, he provides the movie with at least some burst of needed energy. There's even a couple of moments that reminded me of his role as the 11th Doctor. It's unfortunate that the character Smith plays is badly written. He starts out as an important ally to Morbius before abruptly turning evil and deciding to murder everyone as well as toy with Morbius. The movie does try to explain what might have sent him down such a dark path through flashbacks and interactions with Morbius but it's not explained in a way that could give this character any nuance.

But what really drags the movie is the story and the action scenes. A lot of people that I've heard said the story was confusing. While I didn't have that problem, the main flaw for me (and for many others I'm sure) was that once the story was at a certain point, you could tell exactly how things were going to unfold. The movie as a whole feels like a gigantic conveyor belt of cliches and scenes stolen from other superhero movies. There's a scene where Morbius steps inside a chamber filled with CGI bats and he raises up his hand to touch them to signify he's beginning to get in touch with his vampire side, but the scene overall feels like it was ripped off from Batman Begins. As for the other cliches...

Does our protagonist have a heartfelt talk with his love interest on a rooftop (and later kisses her)? Yes Is the father-figure/mentor killed off to increase the drama? Yes Is the protagonist warned/warns other people that the dangerous power that now exists can't be controlled? Yes Is the love interest attacked/murdered to motivate the protagonist? Yes Is the villain what the hero (or anti-hero) might become if he loses all morality? Yes Does the villain want the hero to embrace his monstrous side and join him? Yes Is there a chaotic fight scene at the climax where you can barely tell what's happening? Yes Does the main character fly off at the end, leaving the city and home he loves to explore his abilities? Yes

Really if you've seen any superhero movie (or any blockbuster) you've seen Morbius.

As for the fight scenes, they feel like something from the early 2000s and not in a good way. Everything Jared Leto leaps into air, he ends up looking like a bad special effect from a video game which is made even worse as almost every time he jumps or punches someone, smoke and air particles constantly fill the screen and the camera goes into slow motion only to speed up again. Coupled with the frenetic speed the camera moves at during those scenes, the movie's action is reduced to an incoherent mess with bad effects.

Bottom line, Morbius is a good idea ruined by uninteresting characters, a stupid story, and really awful action. It really does feel like what would happen if you took a bad early 2000s superhero movie and mixed it with a bad 2010s superhero movie. While not as unforgivably bad as 2004's Catwoman and 2015's Fantastic Four, it doesn't even have the ""So awful, it's hilarious"" curiosity of something like Batman and Robin. Meaning that this movie is one of those bad, forgettable movies that probably won't be remembered. I really do hope that Jared Leto pulls a Ryan Reynolds and gets to be in a good superhero movie because until he does, he will be seen as the actor unlucky enough to be in a bad DC movie and a bad Marvel movie.

I just hope he has burnt enough bridges by now that he is unemployable. The movie actually COULD have been ok without him but honestly there's so much against it that I doubt it. Disney really have ruined a lot of IPs.","1"

"2pac_bigfoot","""Morbius"" could've been great, but it lacks direction","4 April 2022","I went and saw ""Morbius"" in theaters today despite the less than mediocre reviews. The movie had a great amount of potential yet lacked in execution. The plot and effects were subpar, but I still found enjoyment in the world the movie takes place in and the drive morbius has for finding a cure to his disease. Despite being a marvel villain origin movie, it lacks the feel of one. ""Morbius"" is more of a light take on the thriller genre. I feel that ""Morbius"" needed a better sense of direction or purpose as it could be all over the place at times. I feel the movie came to a quick conclusion not letting many events develop into what could've been. Overall seeing this movie was a decent experience, but not a memorable one. I didn't feel any sort of attachment towards any of the characters as I don't think they had a very strong presence or importance. ""Morbius"" is not a movie I would necessarily recommend to anyone that isn't interested in the movie.

"JoshuaMercott","Disjointed But Enjoyable","20 May 2022","It was strangely exciting and suspenseful to watch ""Morbius"". Daniel Espinosa did crafty work on direction for this Marvel title. Story and screenplay by Matt Sazama and Burk Sharpless added to the strengths of this film - some witty and meaningful dialogues.

The team made interesting use of creative license. I was not too fond of the pacing, it felt a bit rushed and disjointed. But, right from the start, they kept the tension taut and the storyline going. Many a scene relied on familiar tropes, though, which served to weaken the film's storytelling value.

Jon Ekstrand's musical scoring ensured that the movie's 'nightmare quotient' stayed on point. Oliver Wood's cinematography made it feel at once realistic and immersive. Pietro Scalia's editing was good.

Production design by Stefania Cella was noteworthy. The art direction and set decoration crews did great work. Cindy Evans pulled rabbits out of the costume design hat - or should I say, bats. Some great VFX work in ""Morbius' worth appreciating.

They captured a few emotional 'origin story' elements and 'dark gothic' vibes in this movie. The film centred around Dr. Michael Morbius, played by Jared Leto. He brought a good sense of gravitas to his role, and not a small amount of urgency to his character's motives.

Playing Milo was Matt Smith, who was great. Martine Bancroft was played by Adria Arjona who was quite good. Dr. Emil Nicholas, played by Jared Harris, was memorable. Agent Simon Stroud, played by Tyrese Gibson was good. Agent Rodriguez, played by Al Madrigal, was noteworthy. Adrian Toomes, cameod by Michael Keaton, was a treat - Toomes is The Vulture from the comic books.

The story was quite straightforward, especially to fans of the comics created by Roy Thomas. Granted, his stories were much darker, which is why I found it odd that Marvel, not DC, originally got their hands on it.

Speaking of, I believe ""Morbius"" did not enjoy too much success partly because it released just after ""The Batman"", and few titles can compare to that Matt Reeves masterpiece imo.

I particularly liked the idea of 'artificial blood' used in ""Morbius"". However, given the ongoing covid-19 pandemic, it was hard to accept anyone experimenting on bats for whatever reason. Looks like 'real life' and 'reel life' both produce negative outcomes when people mess with those mammals. The underlying subtext of the movie was not appropriate either - one must exploit other living things for Science's gain, one must take that so-called risk.

It was also somewhat strange that they let a doctor practice medicine though he himself was disabled. I'm not sure if such a thing is permitted in real life, but the character trait was needed for Dr. Morbius, I guess. He was also incredibly OP, which was not quite bat-like.

""Morbius"" 2022 was certainly over-hyped but it was not as bad as some critics and online opinions will have you believe, though. It had several memorable moments, noteworthy performances, great CGI (those lens splatters), amazing stunt choreography, and thrilling action sequences.

However, a handful of scenes came across as disjointed or abrupt. The pace was too 'hop, skip, and jump'. I kinda liked the movie, but I believe it could've been better if they took it along a darker track and relied less on tropes, stereotypes, and clichés.

The final fight scene had some great moments, and both post-credits scenes held promise. A distinct ""Spider-Man"" bridge was formed, so here's hoping they give us a crossover.","6"
"tscharadin","Everything I hoped for in a Marvel movie","22 September 2022","I thoroughly enjoyed the story, character development, and action scenes! These are the kinds of movies I get to watch when the wife is not home. For this, it fits the bill perfectly.

The FX of Morbius were amazing throughout. The implied strength of nature that was put on display were truly impressive. It reminded me of Spider-Man. It's possible that some reviewers missed the full story if they weren't paying attention to how Morbius developed his powers. I didn't feel like any portrayal of the movie was too outlandish to be possible in a world stage like that of a marvel comic book.

The other aspect that I wasn't prepared for was how thrilling/scary some scenes were! Like Spider-Man, the protagonist has internal conflict, and their way through the internal conflict is thrilling and filled with ties to the natural strengths of nature.

My only gripe is the set feels noticeably low budget in several scenes of the movie especially toward the end scenes.","9"
"BrunoRatesTheMovies","""I am Venom""","24 July 2022","This followed a very similar template to the first Venom movie. Even had a few references thrown in so we know we are in the same Universe, although those lines are well and turkey shattered now. Visually, it the underworld movies. Basically, it wasn't very original and worth the online flogging. Had some really cool effects but that's all. Just like the Venom movies, I've was very confused as what their powers actually are.","2"
"argento100","An absolute horrible unoriginal boring movie.","13 June 2022","Absolutely bland, boring, clichéd, poorly acted hogwash, generic story, botched special effects, a convulsion of fart CGI, and ridiculous action scenes, not to mention the idiocy of the idea of powers from bats.

I slept through half the movie and had to watch it in 3 more chunks afterward to finish it.

A disgust

As always, Jaret Leto is nothing more than a cute publicity girls herder, a narcissistic egomaniac with the delusions of a great artist who is worse than Bruce Willis when he doesn't feel like it.","3"

"radhrh","Were they trying to make a bad movie?","22 May 2022","You'd think given the cost and number of people involved in making a movie that someone at some point would say ""Hold on a minute, guys.

"Dodge-Zombie","Decidedly average.","22 June 2022","I think one of the biggest issues with this movie is the extreme over use of CGI. I've always prefer practical effects and would of liked to of seen some old school style here but it didn't happen.

Jared Leto seemed to put very little into his character compared to his other characters in other movies. I'm not a fan of Matt Smith so his performance didn't impress me.

I have watched this movie twice and enjoyed it more the second time.

Ultimately it's not a patch on any of the other SSU movies and may of been better received had ""Spiderman No Way Home"" not boosted everyones expectations.","5"

Another great addition to the film was matt Smith, who every moment he was on screen, the film became instantly better. The film was completely ridiculous, with a very confusing plot. I can't think of a single reason that is film is worth watching for.","4"
"eprissel","WTF SONY","18 May 2022","Morbius is another example that Sony has no idea how to handle a superhero movie without better people involved. The writing is broken (things just happen with no explanation or no purpose), the editing is awful where you can tell that scenes are missing (Matt smith just becomes a vampire and a murderous psychopath off screen), the visual effects look like the early 2000s superhero movies, the action is atrocious (ruined by bad cgi, horrible camera work, and no sense of tension), the acting is terrible (Jared Leto and tyrese Gibson look bored, jarred Harris is wasted, and Matt smith just overacts but not in a fun way), the music is either generic or rips off batman begins, for a vampire movie it is surprisingly tame and censored (either no blood or color corrected to look black instead of red even in broad light), and the post credits scenes are the worst in history that make no sense with how vulture would be teleported to the Sony verse, where he got his suit, how he found Morbius, why he would find Morbius interesting, why Morbius would be interested in anything vulture says to him? Just a waste of everything, I'll stick with the mcu and Sony can just die with this horrible hunk of crap.","1"
"rbod","Enjoyed the subway","11 October 2022","As a native of New York City and formerly a very frequent visitor to London I got a kick out of using the underground to be the NYC subway. Almost every classic element of London's underground was included-long tunnels, vaulted tunnels, banks of escalators, escalator lobbies, side passages leading on to platforms, the platforms themselves, not one of these bearing any similarity to New York. It was interesting, though, that not one, but two of the actors shared the first name Jared.

Aside from that, boring as hell. Bad acting, no character development. I couldn't wait for it to end. When it did finally end, the suggested continuation was presented, as it should, because virtually nothing happened in this film.

NOT To Be Continued, in my opinion.","3"
"zpfpm","Main character or sidekicks","5 May 2022","Morbius is definitely a movie that shows the darker side of the marvel industries. It explained fully the background and the origin of the character itself as well as the connections between marvel and him.

This movie had some ""okay"" action sequences but everything else is non existent. Jared Leto is a cool guy but it was just an underwhelming movie when there was no action, I got so bored I decided to leave the TV on to go take a quick shower and come back hoping it would be over when I was done. And it was. I'm sure I didn't miss anything special. When the trailer for this movie dropped I was expecting something good but after the first day of reviews I already knew this movie wouldn't be enjoyable.","6"

"jdring2007","feels like a compacted story that should've been R but is still enjoyable","3 August 2022","Though I'm not knowledgeable of the source material, the trailer hyped me up and suffice it to say the end product is in fact a little disappointing. Is it one of the worst movies ever made? Absolutely not. Is it one of the worst big budget movies to come out in the last 5 years? Not even. Relax, people. I'm not sure what this flick ever did to have such a high pedestal to be knocked from but ultimately it's just a straightforward popcorn flick. The action is solid and fun, the effects really cool and awesome to witness in 4k. My only gripe in that department is that it should've easily been rated R, so it loses a lot of punch there. The sonar scenes and effects were awesome, the pacing great, but ultimately there was no big finale or explosive climax. Jared Leto and Matt Smith were great; other characters were passable at best. A high 6 from me.","6"

"sanchezdelarubiapablo","THE TWISTED GENIUS OF DOCTOR MICHAEL MORBIUS","10 April 2022","Nowadays, I can count three different targets in the audience that goes to watch a Marvel movie. Those who are interested mainly in the Disney ones, those who are interested mainly in the Sony ones, and finally, those who are interested just in having a good time at the theater. This review is for the second and the third group of people. Mainly for the third one.

I am a superhero comic book reader since I was a kid, specially a Spider-Man and Venom enthusiast. There are many things I can breakdown from this movie, but first and foremost, I have to thank Sony for bringing this character I fell in loved with in the Animated show from the 90's to life for the first time.

The movie starts giving us an idea about who Michael Morbius is. And that is a science genius. How do I know? Not just because they wanted to give him the Nobel prize, or because he fixed Milo's machine when it was about to collapse in a second. It's because he is a risky guy. He takes the risk and success. He is so sure about his premises and goes all-in with them. He takes the risks because he is going to die soon and his intelligence is the only thing that he has left. That is something that the woman that works with him everyday feels attractive. So attractive that she is all commited to a man who can barely walk. How do I know it is attractive for her? Because it is for me.

But before his experiment went wrong, Michael made another mistake. As a child. He decided to put himself in a place that didn't really belong to him. He renamed Lucien. He put himself on top of him. And Lucien allowed it. Because of one thing. Michael promised him results. So then it came the disappointment. Lucien put all his faith in Michael blindly with all his will and resources just to get disappointed. So he couldn't tolerate it. And he embraced the experiment regardless it was mistaken.

I guess the whole movie is about this. A friendship. Idolizing friends and being disappointed by them. With this, there are many other subtleties that makes total sense within the movie.

About the director, he delivers a poweful job, with psichodelic themes, a bit of horror sometimes and quite shocking results.

Jared Leto does fantastic with him and the CGI vampire providing Jeykill and Hyde thrilling moments. Matt Smith is superb. Adria fits perfectly and Jared Harris is such a moving character.

At the end of the day, all I can say is, this is a beyond satisfyed customer talking and that I feel ashamed of that evil mob in the internet ingniting the social media recently... What a nuisance.","8"
"HappyDonut","Totally Morbulent, Dude!","16 June 2022","I have watched some of the best movies of all time but I'm here to say that this was definitely a movie.

Jared Leto gives the best performance since his last movie which is saying something.

Oscar talk may seem a little premature given how recently this movie came out but if it were to win every category it would not surprise people who would be unsusceptible to being surprised by such events.

Is this the greatest 2 hours in cinema history? All I can say is that it is most definitely cinema history and it absolutely runs for 2 hours, so, you be the judge.

Greatness is so rarely achieved in cinema and just like those rare, great movies, this is a movie too.","10"

"darkreignn","Unremarkable, but watchable","16 April 2022","""Morbius"" isn't an awful film - it's just one that feels like it should've been released in 2004. And in fact, if you told me that this movie was actually filmed in 2004 and was delayed 18 years, finally being released in 2022, I'd believe you. In every way, ""Morbius"" is unremarkable; after watching, my basic thought process was: ""Well, that was certainly a movie."" If ""standard and generic superhero film"" had a definition, ""Morbius"" would be it. This is just a flat, emotionless, corporate produced product that has only one thing in mind: the almighty dollar. The thing is, it wasn't unentertaining!

While ""Morbius"" is forgettable in almost every way, it can serve as a quick, if unfulfilling, cinematic adventure. Yes, this movie is sanitized in order to maintain a PG-13 rating; yes, you can sense the studio meddling that results in a choppy, borderline incomprehensible plot; and yes, you better believe that the direction is as safe and sterile as grandma's home cooking. But if you put that aside (and drink copious amounts of alcohol before and during this cinematic experience), there is some fun to be had here.

Jared Leto is actually great in the role of Michael Morbius; where I find him to be a great actor who is constantly overacting, in here he is quite restrained. While I have no idea why he decided to play a vampire antihero as restrained as he did, I must say I appreciated it simply because I found it unexpected. Did anyone overact in this movie? Oh, you better believe it! Matt Smith's Milo chews up the scenery, spits it out, and gnaws on it again in an unrestrained performance, complete with a minute long dance sequence. It's just so ridiculous, but it's a lot of fun.

""Morbius,"" of course, has some vampire action in it - you know, something for the kids. And when I say for the kids, I mean that literally - ""Morbius"" is the most bloodless vampire movie you've ever seen, but it's not all bad. The action is sterile, but it's fun to look at with its distinct visual flair that only Daniel Espinosa could bring to the table (that's just a joke - literally any other director could've filmed these action scenes, but with that said, they were still cool to watch). There's slicing, dicing, and sucking (get your head out of the gutter, pervert), but all of it is without the slightest hint of blood or gore. Is that disappointing? Of course. But does it ruin the action scenes? Not at all.

Okay - I don't want to write anymore! So I'll end by saying that ""Morbius"" is the most ehhh superhero movie I've ever seen. There's nothing remarkable about it, but there's also nothing overly negative in it. Everything about this film is supremely generic, but it is also very watchable. If you have 90 minutes to kill and are in the mood to watch some vampire violence, you could do a whole lot worse.","6"

Jared Leto's previous performance being featured in ""The Suicide Squad"" may not have been the most outstanding but I assure you Jared's use of humour, drama, and athleticism makes up for all of his past films (great or not). I give this movie a solid 10/10 for it's diverse yet immense storyline, scenery, and composition. The kids had their fun with ""The Batman"" but it's the real man's turn now.","10"
"Paragon240","Not as bad as reviews say but come on... we expect more.","25 June 2022","Not as bad as everyone is saying, but it missed its opportunity by about 20 years. I think it could have done a little better if this had been released in the Blade, Fantastic Four, and X-Men movie era in the early 2000s. Still, we have seen too many comic origin stories that success takes more than just seeing a hero gain powers and fight a villain with the same powers in a flurry of mediocre CGI. If you saw, Bloodshot, the quality of effects, writing, and directing are incredibly similar.

Overall : Sadly a run-of-the-mill superhero origin movie with nothing special to make me care.","5"
"tydoobyreid","OH.MY.GOSH.... THIS SUCKED","2 April 2022","The first hour and ten minutes of this film is top tier sony spider-man content!! It's absolutely fantastic. If the Film was just that, i would give it a 8/10.

But unfortunately the last 35 minutes to this film is utter garbage. The biggest pile of trash i've ever seen.

Matt Smith as Milo is a fantastic casting and he does a great job as the villain! The whole reveal that he also became a vampire is fantastic and i love all of it.

Jared Leto does a great job and in better companies hands i think he can do a great job with the character of Morbius. I HOPE we see his return to this character.

The rest of the cast is also fantastic and i thought those choices were great

another fantastic thing about this film was its visual affects! All the way the powers look to us was fantastic and i love the use of echo location

but i really thought that the action was sub par here. It was fine, but it was a lot of slow motion or too fast moving camera's to know what was going on

i also thought that we had an ending to this film set up, and they completely disregarded what was set up and the film just ended after Milo was killed.

Michael Keaton was a huge disappointment in the film and i'm not excited whatsoever for the sinister six set up.

The post credit scenes (there are two) are garbage and the script was awful in them.

All in all, there are bits and pieces that you can enjoy about the film but i would never watch this film again.","3"
"katiemayr","What's not to like?","1 April 2022","Not sure I understand the low scores for this one. It isn't mind blowing however it was entertaining. Great performances from Jared Leto and Matt Smith. More of a character piece than an action packed movie which I liked. Good use of effects and an entertaining story line.","8"
"jaysanchu07","Sony Massacres Yet Another Marvel Character","17 June 2022","Here is another blunder from Sony who continues to massacre Marvel characters for a shot of relevance. Morbius is so badly acted, that the absence of character development feels like a treat, just to unsee Jared Leto and Tyrese Gibson's bland scenes and dumb expressions. Story-wise, there were zero points to peak curiosity nor intrigue. Writers takes the fall for a very basic and formulaic plot that leaves one bored and blank faced. Further worsened by a forsaken & uninspired script, the film is further rendered without substance. Heres a line with Leto referring to bats: ""They would tear anyone else apart, but they welcomed me, like a brother"". What the actual Freak.

For superhero films however, weak storylines and forgettable characters can rather be forgivable through jaw dropping action sequences. Unfortunately, Morbius fails miserably, to deliver here as well. Visually, the film holds the title of most unimpressive scenes to date. The action was uninspired and the effects were messy, juggling between and the use of slow-mo and blurring speed that fails to excite. Also, Morbius' echolocation abilities was overused & made over complex, to the point of annoyance.

Unfortunately, the entire Morbius experience was laughable. It is a pathetic attempt to introduce a new storyline for the sake of expanding Sony's Spiderman Universe. Sony needs to start caring about reviews otherwise, STOP and let Marvel do its thing.","4"

You know the one. They could have saved a ton of money on CGI and used that person as a stand-in. In fact that would have been more interesting.

I also didn't know that you can inherit Nightcrawler's teleporting smoke abilities from injecting bat essence. And the smoke color coordinates with your outfits. Good to know.

Yeah, for an origin story it is bad. Very very very nonsensically bad.

The MCU is beyond the saturation point and the well has run dry. This was braindead generic garbage.","3"

The film is watchable, but that's all. The film abounds with meaningless scenes, unexplained holes in the story, the plot unfolds too quickly and does not agree with the time frame of the film. I have the impression that in there have material for two separate films and not one, it's somehow too crumpled. I have to admit that the visual effects and sound are excellent, the acting is good. In fact, in my opinion, this film is held back becouse of the story, which in itself is boring and non-defining, somehow uninteresting. This is a watchable film, but unfortunately nothing more.","4"

"dilipbts","Morbius","1 June 2022","Entertaining and very atmospheric, Morbius manages to serve up yet another helping of campy superhero indulgence despite many little flaws. I'll start off with the problems I had with this film- that mainly being its blatant editing and CGI. I know many people say this about a lot of superhero films, but coming from a horror lovers perspective- as well as fitting the atmospheric and tone Life director Daniel Espinosa seemed to pair within it- this movie really should have been rated R. It feels like Sony really did censor and edit this one as much as they could have, with the blood and violence being as limited as possible. It takes away from the experience as a whole, one moment in particular where a man acts like his throat is cut open but there is LITERALLY NOTHING THERE. Unsurprisingly, as with the case with a lot of films like this, the CGI can be a bit overused at times. For the most part I liked the look of vampire blood hungry Morbius taken on by Jared Leto- but other similar CGI and at times that CGI itself can feel a bit too ugly and forced for comfort. The fight scenes towards the end in particular are also overdone with CGI, and I just really wish Sony would have let the people working on this film give some life to the project instead of worrying about its box office gross. I know i've complained a lot so far, but in terms of a film- I oddly did enjoy this one for the most part. Sure it's messy, Matt Smith's character is a bit over the top and it has some formulaic moments- but it is a very entertaining film. Leto and Arjona give their all to their performances and it has a lot of cool ideas and concepts that are interesting to see fleshed out on screen- particularly with Morbius in particular as he begins to learn how to control himself. There's a lot of humanity hidden beneath the surface in this film though, even with some formulaic moments, there's a lot of depth and heart put into the titular character and it really allows you to empathize both with the film's story as well as Leto on screen. In the end, I enjoyed Morbius- it is far from perfect but it was a solid superhero endeavor and I'm curious to see what they may do with this character next.","6"

"nightringer-76840","Matt Smith Got the Jackpot","21 May 2022","Both Jared Leto and Matt Smith can do a coin toss and played each other character like a maestro. Matt Smith got the jackpot playing Milo the main villain, in which he is clearly having a blast playing.

Jared Leto played the main hero as a mild manner vampire doctor, weird balance of character but very common in American's comic book. Unfortunately, the main hero in comic books movie is usually very replaceable by any other actor.

The weak point of the movie is the story flow. I felt like watching a cartoon movie. The director didn't take too risky storylines and developed further. Morbius is a very risky character but highly potential to break the tradition, but they took the safer route and that's how Morbius became less impressive and less memorable.

Hopefully, they can expand their characters better, if there's a next film in the series for Sinister Six.","6"
"mattstone137","""Has to Do with Spider-Man I Think.""","25 August 2022","At long last the pandemic seems to be winding down. Millions dead, billions affected, but the end is quickly approaching. People the world over will hopefully be able to return to normalcy, with only memories of these last two horrible years. Cinemas might be invigorated as well, as theatergoers enjoy one of the most important benefits of going to theaters in a post-pandemic world: they won't have to sit through the insufferable trailer for Morbius anymore. The healing process can begin.

The film follows Dr. Michael Morbius as he searches to cure the vague disease he's been afflicted with since childhood. During the search, he's accidently transformed into a vampire-like creature, with sonar capabilities, superhuman strength, and the obligatory taste for human blood. He must keep this secret from the world while learning to control his power and just maybe reverse his condition, a woefully similar plot to 2005's critical darling, Fantastic Four. Morbius must also fight his arch-nemesis Spider-Man, but Sony doesn't own those rights, so they'll be skipping that for now.

The first few minutes of Morbius set the context and framing for the rest of the film. In other words, Morbius quicky lets viewers know that it's utterly worthless. Everything in and about the film is fascinatingly bland, totally incapable of leaving even the faintest imprint in the mind. The film is made by Sony Pictures, which is the only signal one needs to know the boredom they're in for when purchasing a ticket.

Even by their horrific standards, Morbius lacks a modicum of creativity, charm, wit, novelty, intrigue, engagement, interest, or integrity; it's a film made solely to retain the scraps of rights the studio has to the Spider-Man IP while setting up future disappointments within the shared universe. I'm shocked to find that ""Matt Sazama"" and ""Burk Sharpless"" are not an elaborate pseudonym for a poorly built A. I. designed to write screenplays in a manner conducive to affordability and irrelevance.

The flaws here are substantial, but accountability begins with the script. The weirdest thing about Morbius is that nothing is egregiously infuriating or miscalculated. Such problems would require boldness or calculation. Instead, the entire film is hollowed out, an empty egg, a wisp of air. No care is taken to establish anything; no effort is made to energize character interactions or structural mystery. Morbius simply begins, plays out exactly as one would expect, then ends, having never feigned a single idea, misdirection, or clever visual. It's shockingly, impressively lazy.

The same could be said for the direction. Daniel Espinosa is at the helm after directing Safe House, Child 44, and Life. It's impossible to discern how much of the blame for Morbius lies at his feet, though it's probably not much, if any. His prior films aren't world beaters, but they seem like competent and reasonably passionate affairs, nice looking celestial bodies trying to escape the black hole of derivative futility that is Morbius. It's safe to assume that even if Espinosa had greater ambitions for the film, the sheep in wolves' clothing staffing Sony Pictures would have relentlessly mutilated his vision.

The only saving grace of the film are the performances. Adria Arjona and Jared Harris are decent as Morbius' colleagues, giving the material some reasonably effective credence. Tyrese Gibson and Al Madrigal are horrendous in their short time as cops, but Matt Smith has fun with his role as the doctor's best friend. He suffers from the same condition as Morbius until he's given the same treatment, and watching his turn from feeble, black-lung-pa Zoolander to hyperconfident, charismatic ham is quite enjoyable. Even Jared Leto is somewhat engaging, playing the material straight and putting in work as a tortured, conflicted soul.

Every other facet of the film is impossibly bland and forgettable. In a time when every American studio is desperately trying to establish their own multi-film storyline, Sony Pictures is next to the most laughable and inept, respectable only next to Universal's Dark Universe miscarriage. Executives don't appear remotely competent, sometimes not even human; they're caricatures, parodies of parodies of parodies, drunkenly beholden to market research and desperate to stay hip with a target demographic they either don't understand or actively disdain. They've made the film they deserve.

There is not one single, solitary surprise, thrill, or emotional stake within Morbius. Project is corporatized into oblivion. Formula is slavishly adhered to. Characterizations washed and sterilized. Editing rushed, hopelessly confused. Signs of passion, or merit for existence, undetectable. Music - effects - focus - craftsmanship; absent. Hopes of a cinematic universe up, ticket sales down. Ask again later.","2"

"vipapag","I see negative reviews but where are the arguments?","17 July 2022","I think that Morbius is attacked for no reason at all. Personally, I have watched plenty of Marvel films lately and I consider Morbius to be one of the best of them, alongside with Deadpool. This is so because: 1) There is a backstory. We see the two main characters as children in Greece.

2) There is character development.

3) There is great chemistry among the actors.

4) The soundtrack really fits.

5) The issue of chronic illness is discussed.

I see that some people have complained about the CGI, but I don't see why this is a problem. If it is easy to understand when CGI effects are used, then this means that the director doesn't want to deceive the audience, which I find to be good. On the contrary, I don't see many people complaining about CGI in Thor: Love and Thunder, when they made Portman look muscular.

Overall, I think that Morbius is a decent movie.","8"

The flying in the subway has a certain wishfulness about it but to move a human body in a way that could cause flying is of course just complete fantasy, to then claim they can fly in the sky is just taking it to ludicrous levels.

So Marvel wanted a vampire, Marvel normally makes a believable super hero or super villain, this time they did a bad job. & im a huge fan of marvel movies and TV shows.

"jmunter-11815","It's not good","5 April 2022","The nicest thing I have to say about this movie is at least Green Lantern was worse

This movie was kind of doomed to fail from the start, which is why I originally had no plans to see it. But then the reviews were in and I had to see it for myself, and I was honestly let down it wasn't worse to be honest. Don't get me wrong, it's not good but it's not ""so bad it's good.""

There actually were objectively good things about this made me feel like people were just being too harsh on the movie at first. Jared Leto was honestly pretty good in the role of Michael Morbius. Not ground breaking, but if this movie was a lot better he would fit right in. A lot of the characters were actually somewhat interesting to follow and the science was honestly kind of fascinating at times. Also some of the cinematography was cool to look at, and some shots stick out to me as legitimately solid

But then the movie kept going....and what else can I say? The cgi was unforgivable, the story got bland and boring, a lot of the dialogue is pretty stupid, and the action starts out decent but slowly declines as the movie progresses. You can even tel a lot of what they probably wanted to show was dulled down because it needed to be PG-13, which venom also suffered from but this was even worse. You can even see Morbius slash an enemy in the neck, and you hear the sound effects of blood spewing but their neck is pretty much bone dry

There's also one scene specifically I thought was REALLY stupid, and it was the exact moment I shifted from ""This movie isn't THAT bad at all"" to ""Ok no, this movie is kinda garbage."" Then the movie goes from stupid, to boring, back to stupid, and finishes extremely anti climactically. I went from probably being able to defend this movie to wishing I spent my money watching The Batman again

Speaking of Batman, yeah there's so many things straight up stolen from other movies! There's a shot straight out of both Batman Begins and the usual suspects. Want something to look forward to, try to spot them when you see it

So in the end, I expected much worse than what I saw, but it would be a disservice to call this movie even passable. Fine moments here and there, but select enjoyable elements while everything else is making the movie unbearable does not a good movie make. And normally I close out my reviews working in a line from either the trailer or the movie (For example I closed out my review of The Batman with ""I thought Uncharted would be my favorite movie of 2022, but the truth was unmasked in front of me,"") but honestly I got nothing. This movie was so forgettable I can't even conjure up a single memorable line other than ""I am Venom."" Whatever, this movie's bad.","4"

I would not recommend it as a film to rush and go see or to spend money to go see.

Understandably it is an origin story to introduce Dr Morbius to us in cinematic terms but it falls to short in what felt like a very basic story and script.

The CGI was complete overkill so much so that in action scenes you are basically looking at nothing but a blur on the screen. I also found the overall appearance of Dr Morbius in his vampire form to be so very unrealistic that it detracted from the film itself as I sat through scenes thinking to myself about how bad the CGI was, yes he becomes a monster but this looked like CGI from 10yrs ago.","2"

The endless use of cliche camera work (please stop the shaky camera work and matrix bullet scenes!), cinematographic tropes and Instagram style filters haphazardly and sporadically used between cut scenes. Not to mention what appears to be a movie shot on 40 year old technicolor stock film...

Secondly the editing! Like who edited this? The flow and transitions are amateurish at best! Add to this a pretty unsynchronized soundtrack and you end up with a horrible mess of a ""film""?

The only thing that pains me is seeing Jared Leto, who I think is a great actor, having gambled on the wrong project... yet again.

Jared Leto, Matt Smith and Jared Harris are remarkable actors, but with out a plot with a good script there is nothing for them to do. All I can say it this movie should never have been made.

There are not many great expectations that we can expect from Morbius. Sony's project in developing the Spider-Man universe is far from perfect. Morbius is one of the films that can be judged as a failure in terms of the story and acting shown. Morbius became like a forced movie. The storyline that doesn't flow even seems stiff. The story presented is so simple. Arguably, the story also refers to inconsistencies in the course of the film. So is the undeveloped, sucky and boring dialogue. Not yet with dialogue containing comedic elements that become a sucky and unimportant chatter. The development of the characters depicted is too fast. There is no room for growth in understanding the personal problems that bring.

It's unfortunate that actors like Jared Leto have to play in a movie that we can say is a bad movie, even though Jared played well. Two not-so-good FBI agents. Bad. Two FBI options made funny but not funny. Imposing unnecessary comedic elements. It is precisely that cuteness that comes with seeing Tyrese Gibson perform seriously. What's worse?? The fight scene is also a pity. It doesn't look wow or amaze us. In fact, we are presented with ordinary fight scenes. Only the visual effect is indeed a bit pleasing to the eye. Vulture's appearance in the film's final credits doesn't affect anything on the film. It's confusing instead. Very clear = this movie is very forced. Eliminates superhero elements. Salute to Jared Leto.","6"

The film also benefits from a Marvel budget and therefore has great special effects, in fact the special effects for Morbius and the movement and vampire parts are absolutely incredible.

The story itself while not brilliant or something out of legend is not bad either. It sets up the characters and movie pretty well. For someone like me whose first time it was learning about the character Morbius I didn't feel stranded or anything, instead I was introduced slowly to the character.

All in all a good origin movie for Morbius and sets him up to take part in the wider Marvel Cinematic Universe. Though the ending was a bit confusing and left me trying to understand the post credit scenes.

A solid 7/10 from me for a decent origin movie, could have been better but was pretty good as it was. Would recommend watching it if you're a Marvel/Superhero-villain movie fan or just want to see the origin of one Dr, Michael Morbius!","7"
"apiwat-91182","Not a scary movie.","15 May 2022","A movie about vampires should be scary, bloody and entertaining, sadly this rendition is not. All British cast for the main characters and I keep thinking of doctor Who and not vampires. Too much reliance on special effects and no real scary plot or action as if it's made for children.","5"
"phoenixinvictus","This is so bad it makes the Hulk look good","17 June 2022","In the opening credits the CGI is so bad that it might have been a cartoon. The only actor who seemed like he was having fun was Matt Smith who I almost thought he was going to say 'I'm the Doctor'. The subway scene in where Matt Smith is running against Jared Leto is laughable. This will not age well.","3"

"aimaxs","It's not a garbage superhero movie. To me, it's an okay","3 April 2022","I don't understand why this movie gets hated. But yes. That way The story is pretty simple, predictable but for me the horror scene is great, Round opponent, good CGI, the visuals really surprised me. I'm ready enjoy it. Maybe many can't accept this film because of its storyline easy. Yes! I'm angry why so many scenes in the trailer don't come in included in this movie? 60% of the scenes in the movie trailer are not dimmed (a) Can last 2 hours more. That invites anger That fan. They use Spider-Man to do it movie promotion is. The part that disappointed me was the last credit scene. Why? Just why? 'Turn off continues (5) So my rating for this film is 7/o *. It's fun. A fun popcorn movie. If you digest the movie Venom: Let There Be Carnage means you can digest nied movies.","10"

"vnblu","Slow moving story...","9 April 2022","There was so much un-needed material in this movie. Plot holes, and ""I wonder why?s"" abound. The special effects in this movie were great, but the art of telling the story just isn't there. I think the director had a problem turning an idea into a movie. All the elements are there...it just starts off so slow that you are nearly sleeping when things get good. If they took the first half of the movie, and threw it away.... and then added a little story to the last half, this movie could have been great, but I feel like they fell short. It was an ""ok"" movie, but nowhere near the film it should have been. It is a shame when there are really great actors, but the construction of the movie plays like a collection of trailers from different movies. There was too much character building, and I think he movie loses some of its' audience early on because of it. Just tell he story for crying out loud! Is it a superhero movie? A buddy movie? A love story? A spy movie? Pick a genre and stick with it. This was a bad screenplay for a great idea. I loved the comic book as a kid, but if I had seen the movie before reading the comic book... I wouldn't have purchased the comic book.","4"
"frosierootbeer","Morbius is the movie ever","30 May 2022","Morbius is certainly one of the movies ever made. The actors are acting and the plot is there.

Cause realistically if u rate this a 1-4 then what u rate mockbuster movies?

Then theirs levels of different quality to mockbuster movies so rating a 1 better be someone filming on their own camcorder with a budget of $10k or less.

Rating a 5 would be like the lowest a movie like this should bd rated minimum.

I liked it and the story made sense, great CGI, alright acting and for the people saying the morbius actor was bad... i dont know what you expected but some of u must not know who Morbius is cause alot of u expected some very Lex Luthor like Joker type of character lol but Morbius is more of Marvels Blade type of character whois quiet, reserved, conflicted,","7"

"balthesaur","Standard Marvel formula","18 June 2022","'Morbius', stars Jared Leto as the title character - a doctor and scientist with a rare genetic blood disorder that makes it incredibly difficult to walk. Together with his partner, Milo (Matt Smith) and fellow doctor, Martine Bancroft (Adria Arjona), they will attempt to cure his ailment by combining human DNA with that of a vampire bat.

Even though this film is made in association with Marvel, it is not in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, which means don't expect to see Thor or Captain America anytime soon. Morbius does, however, have some callbacks to other Sony-owned Marvel films, including Venom and Spider-Man.

Fairly standard Marvel fare otherwise. Direction and script are what you would expect from these films. The special effects are really neat as well, but - unlike that of 'Blade' (1998) - features no graphic blood sequences and, instead, focuses on the blurry bullet-time speed of the characters' movements.

Worth a once over, especially if this is going to be part of a grander scheme of films.","6"

"AJ9441","Succeeded in being terrifying, lacking in every other department","3 April 2022","Morbius was not as bad as a lot of other reviewers will have you think, nor is it anything that stands out. Let's start with the good:
The movie was dark and terrifying. Really encapsulated the horror movie meets superhero vibe well.


Some good performances by Leto and Smith.


The bad:
The character development was so shoddily done. As an audience member you never connect with any character and as a result don't really care what happens to them.


The motivations of the characters are rushed. Martine learns the truth about Morbius and 5 minutes later she is making out with him.


We never find out why Morbius turns down the Nobel prize.


There seems to be no arc of how Morbius and Milo learn to control their powers.


Why can Morbius control the bats but Milo can't? Seems not to make much sense.


Overall a decent way to waste a few hours but definitely not worth a rewatch.","5"

It's a movie for those that want a bit more oomph...a film with fortitude and quality effects.

Jared Leto's acting is beyond the calibre of any Marvel character I've seen thus far. The same goes for Matt Smith. They aced in their selection. The beauty of Adria Arjona is spellbinding too. Thanks Marvel.

"devinandjoe","More Blood Please!!!","3 April 2022","Yeah Morbius is a basic, paint by numbers semi-superhero movie. It doesn't spend a lot of time developing its characters other than the one that matters. What I enjoyed about Morbius is its pacing. Sure it could of added another 30 minutes of boring pointless dialogue in an effort to do this. But that's not necessary. It generally skips over the why and moves the plot along. Its action sequences look good. It could of done a better job of utilizing Vampire tropes but I understand it's restricted by its parental rating to maximize putting butts in seats. I would have preferred more blood and supernatural realistic violence. But it wasn't trying to be a horror movie unfortunately. So no it's not going to win any awards for the best SH movie of all time but it accomplishes the goal of introducing Doctor Michael Morbius into Sony's Spider-Verse.","7"

"Entertainmentsparadise","Serves as the guinea pig","10 May 2022","I have to admit that reading reviews before watching this film really clouded my judgment. This is not to say this movie was good, but it is also not to say it was horrible.

Let me point out the good because you have all heard the bad by now.

I felt like I was watching a video game. The action scenes display how multiple senses are being used; the colors for visuals, the cinematic sounds vibrated the theater for feel, and the immersive sounds all intertwine whenever there is a fight. The film highlights action shots that resemble most video game cut scenes that pride themselves on close combat.

The cosmetics weren't bad yall lol you saw the previews. We know how this man was gonna look. From sicko to health, I believe the film did an excellent job of making Morbius look hideous and ridiculous; okay, maybe I'm getting carried away. The ending credit scenes may not be on point with your super marvel fan or the comics, but this is the Marvel cinematic universe; none of these films will resemble the comics bar for bar word for word; shoutout to Soulja Boy. So I'm actually intrigued by this multiverse setup.

Now the questionable, the film doesn't set up the antihero too well. Although Moribus is a dark character, I wasn't convinced by his murderous side, nor was I convinced of his heroic side. Was there a heroic side?

Two points to note are the similarities to other superhero films.

1. When iron man learns how to maneuver, his suit looks much similar to Moribus figuring himself out in the lab with less trial and error.

2. Morbius's antagonist or villain is another Moribus, which resembles the first installment of 'Venom' ( they used a corny venom joke).

This takes away from the authenticity; I understand this is an origin story. Unfortunately, with this new wave for Marvel characters in the cinematic universe/Sony included, no one truly knows these characters, so origin stories are hit or miss. Just think how confused people were with 'Eternals'.

The bad... there are no vital elements other than action scenes in this film. The film flirts with thrill and horror, but it is clear that it is out of its lane. No genuine love interest or appeal to emotions.

It is just a melodic approach to telling a dark story with the light still on. This is not Motel 6.

I understand how this can be a disappointment, especially with the delays. I did doze off toward the end, especially with a mediocre finish.

Verdict: Moribus seems rushed but ultimately serves as the guinea pig for marvel stepping outside its lane. Is the movie bad? If you consider all the hype and elements outside that doesn't meet marvels standards, then yes. Is it worth the watch? Not in theaters, but I would always suggest you watch these films and shows to know what's happening, even if it is confusing and not up to par with your usual standards.","2"

"miaalike","The movie that escaped Nicholas Cage's portfolio","17 May 2022","It is watchable, especially because they kept it clean on the horror side (elements suggested instead of shown). But it feels put together with a lower budget than it needed, or outsourced to some inexperienced team, while the attention of the producers, special effects crew and director was caught with something else...

Not a Jared Leto fan, the guy built himself a weird persona, but I don't mind that, just that I don't know his capabilities. But Matt Smith could definitely have carried its role deeper, so could Adria Arjuna. They did not, because sometjing was amiss about the whole movie.

It could have been more, but it was less, like a TV movie or one of the bad Nicholas Cage movies.","5"

He becomes a vampire and calls himself morbius. He is way better than iron man, spiderman, thor, hulk, and captain america combined. Another favourite part of mine is when he says i am venom. I also like the scene where he goes to the skeld and votes out the impostor and wins. Then he goes to mcdonalds to get the among us happy meal and rap battles against sonic.exe. Then morbius assembles the avengers but now they are awesome because morbius is leading it now. Overall 10/10 best movie ever.","10"

Some nice cgi and decent acting. You shouldn't be too demanding though, but in my opinion it's better than some other Marvel movies like Venom. I don't know everything about multiverses, but I like superhero movies because of the classic dilemma of how to stay 'human' meanwhile being different, and how to keep a stand towards things like temptation. Luckely for me the good always wins, so that keeps my hope alive about the future of mankind.","7"
"Cal_Bane","Bad movie, however, Matt Smith","20 October 2022","Matt Smith is a talented actor (and a man that I find visually and audibly appealing) he carries this movie by playing a character with little depth and wasted potential - but there is that one dancing scene and the fangs low-key had me foaming at the mouth.

Bad, boring, weak watch, inaccurate and a little bit insulting to the comics. But hell, Matt Smith is in it... and his hair (and body) look great.

Would never watch again, pretty trash (and I love monster looking vamps - none of that twilight rubbish - and abs that don't sparkle)

And I was right..the premise was good, but a terrible amateur script was unbearable. Where do all the bats come from in the end? A hastily packed garbage bag of incoherent script is what this is, and the immediate creation of good vs bad polarity is so amateur. They should've also let the movie breathe, make it longer to 2 hours at least. The redeeming aspect is the special effects.

"carlwilkessob","Easy watching enjoyable but messy","28 June 2022","I don't agree with the reviews of this movie

Ppl were expecting a marvel comic movie but it is ultimately a vampire movie.

Exceptional cast and easy enough plot to follow but feels a little rushed in an effort to bring about the sinister six storyline.

The reviews have probably ensured this won't get a sequel which will probably result in a rushed sinister six universe and become messy like the rushed dceu. Everything the mcu got right about building their universe, Sony seem hellbent on unpicking

Clearly building towards a SS showdown with Spider-Man but the question is which spiderman ?

Not likely Holland as vulture has fought and lost to him and having been pulled to a different universe it leaves Andrew or tobey and I think likely Andrew sue to Tobeys age and the fan clamour for an Amazing Spider-Man 3

So although this film had its flaws it could set up something spectacular

But as it went on the characters and plot were SO predictable and BORING. The lines were boring, the costumes were boring, the cgi was actually pretty cool, but everything else was so boring! Now usually a good soundtrack redeems a movie, but this one didn't! Ugh! Anyway I fell asleep in the last 20 minutes and missed the whole climax of the movie but I could have guessed what happened it was that predictable so no big deal. The post credit scene saved the movie, although a little confusing.. fits the theme though! If you liked Twilight or ""What Is It Like To Be a Bat?"" by Nagel you'll enjoy this slightly more.","5"

There was not a single thing that was wrong with this movie. Who eves says it was bad clearly doesnt know what a good movie is.","10"
"Eric_Cubed","It Is Very Confusing To Me","21 June 2022","It is very, very hard to understand. The producers spend millions upon millions of dollars. They are businesspersons. They are not visionaries. They are not artists. They are investors who hedge bets based on the advice from people with extensive experience and doctorates-entire thinktanks that are paid millions of dollars to make sure that the investors are taking the smallest, most negligible risk possible. How then and why do massive failures happen? Let us think of Kevin Costner. Just because he pulled Dances with Wolves out of his puckering arsehole, everyone was absolutely convinced that Water World, Wyatt Earp, and The Postman would be the next greatest, best, and biggest money-making movie ever. I cannot help to wonder, after these three, if they had made one more. Fields of Dream Corn, for example. I never thought it would happen again. But then they did it. They created Morphius, a film that hit all the right categories but did not realize that whole is always more than the sum of the parts. There is no problem with the acting. There is no problem with the cinematography. There is no problem with the special effects. There is no problem with the basic storyline. The directing is above average and more than enough gets the job done. The producers smiled at themselves and congratulated the thinktank for doing such a superb and supremely awesome job, and I am sure they salivated as they confidently waited for their project to pay off. But the movie was horrible, and it was the one of the greatest failures in cinematic history. Why? It was because the machine, and the cogs that make up the machine, had not heart, for this is who they are, and like Morphius's nemesis in the movie, who they have become.","4"
"glazebrooklaird","Morbius sucks way more than just blood","5 June 2022","I almost wanted to do what the movie did and not give any reasons for my claims/ actions but I can understand how that doesn't make anything interesting. That's the main issue with this movie, there is almost no motive for anything that happens. It is tough to say why somebody's best friend would kill their care taker and their partner. I feel like those things should have a justification but they don't. This movie also had a 3rd grader describe a cool fight scene and then pumped a bunch of money into it so it looks clean. Watch this movie and ask yourself why we should care about Mikey's maiden, or why the bad guy does bad things. This movie is pretty much a trailer for a longer, worse film.","3"
"PaxD75","Great new character, terrible plot.","1 June 2022","I found the Morbius character a compelling new addition to the MCU. The plot, not so much. It wasn't just generic and lifeless... it made no sense.

Morbius makes serum and becomes a vampire. Kills nearly everyone on boat. We're suppose to be fine with this but we never developed hatred for the bad guys because they were never developed in any way.

Now his best friend for life takes serum. He also kills but in his case, his killing is evil. Also, he wants to both force Morbius to accept his new powers and to kill his lifelong friend almost immediately. Why try to kill him?

The rest is predictable storytelling: They fight, Morbius wins, the end.

There were only 3 interesting things to come out of this film: (1) Morbius, (2) Michael Keaton (closing credit scene) and (3) The Bug Guy (?) at the end (the 2nd closing credit scene).

I would see a Morbius part two because I think (I hope) they got the really bad character intro out of the way and the closing credit scenes promise more interesting storylines.","6"
"nassema-27785","The beginning of something...","2 April 2022","It's a good origin story, but the story was a bit too fast and generic. Hopefully the next one can step it up a notch. Otherwise great action and cgi. Viewers who liked Venom will surely like this one too.","6"

"amhousel","I don't get all the bad reviews...","2 April 2022","To be sure, it wasn't perfect, the story felt rushed & a bit too fast paced, could've been told a bit better if it was just a touch slower imo.

But all these bad reviews?! I don't get it It delivered exactly what I was hoping for, an intimidating anti-hero ""Jekyll & Hyde"" story. Leto killed it, Matt smith was excellent & the cinematography was very very good.

It has horror movie vibes but maintains comic book reminiscence by limiting jump scares & fully exposing us to ""the monster"" from very early in the movie.

We have a lovable character utterly distraught by his haunting vampire alter ego & Leto captures this perfectly!!

The one thing I really can't say enough about is that normally with ""scary monster"" movies, the reveal is the most scary part, this was not like that, we knew our main character, we knew what he looked like & what he was capable of very early on, but he never stopped being intimidating & keeping us on the edge of our seats for his next scene.

I loved this movie, it isnt perfect, but it is solid & I'm planning on going to see it again.","8"
"jremigio2001","Morbius The Living Vampire","1 April 2022","This is about Dr Michael Morbius who injects himself with vampirism serum to turn himself into the living vampire. This movie should have been rated higher because it's not your run of the mill superhero film. This takes place into two different universes the Sony-Marvel and MCU. I'm guessing the score rating should get higher as more critics start to see this. This looks like comes after Spider-Man Homecoming and Spider-Man No Way Home. Matt Smith plays Lucien a vampire. Both Lucien and Morbius take the serum to save their lives. Morbius prevents Lucien to get the serum as he warns him. Morbius was asleep when Lucien took the serum inside Horizon Labs. Morbius fights Lucien and Martine played by Adria Arjona is the assistant was kill by Lucien and Morbius revives her turning her into a vampire. Adrian Toomes appears in mid credit scene for the reshoots that is transported to Sony-Marvelverse recruiting Michael Morbius to fight Spider-Man. But Tom Holland Spider-Man is not in this universe. There were references to Vlad Dracula the Lord of Vampires. And vampirism. Will see what happens next?","6"
"ginge_mickey","Wouldn't avoid a sequel","23 June 2022","One problem with Morbius is that there isnt much of a narrative until the second half of the film. The origin story is so so and you aren't given much reason to Invest in Michael Morbius the man.

Matt Smith and Jared Leto flatter to deceive throughout although Smith comes into his own towards the end. He has one particularly memorable scene which I'm not sure is brilliant or laughable.

A lot of the aspects of Morbius under deliver, particularly in there not being enough meat on the bones of the romance story.

Morbius does succeed in setting the character up for further movies and it isn't so disappointing that I would avoid a sequel.

Of course the mid credit scenes and linked universes are interesting although the casual multi verse mixing does need to be handled delicately as it does have the potential to undermine previous stories.","3"

"duggies70","A Casio watch!","27 June 2022","He's rejecting the Nobel Prize (I think you get $10,000 for that), working in a lab where money is no object, and living with great means; it doesn't make sense.

Seeing Jared Leto in his emaciated state reminds me of the line in the movie Splash, where the Bloomingdale's associates comments how lucky a girl is because she's anorexic. Leto really risked his health by doing that. Who knew eating people could make you so buff.

Why the heck does the whole ships crew have guns, especially rifles in a confined space; it makes no sense.

Tyrese Gibson, I loved him in Legion, does a very nice job. He has such a terrific voice. Cops asking questions concerning a capital crime without Miranda and an attorney, no way; it doesn't make sense.

The CGI is very good, but, these guys are bouncing around the subway slamming into walls, breaking through glass! Clothes never get torn? It doesn't make sense.

Adria Arjona, is as beautiful an actress as there is.

EMT's leaving stuff on the street, who knew in a couple hours you could turn a funny money print shop into a medical lab in a couple hours (with no tools), a drop of Dr. Bancroft's blood from opening cat food nearly overwhelmed Morbius but seeing his friend Dr. Nicholas' didn't , Morbius can control the bats and Milo can't, none of this makes sense to me.

"rogier-86785","Just Enough Darkness","8 November 2022","Right off the bat (pun intended) Morbius is definitely the odd one out in the MCU. The concept as a cross between hero and villain, human and vamp works better than I expected it to on film. Yet the chosen story holds it back.

The film starts out a lot stronger than it finishes, with the main culprit being a deeply clichéd bad guy and the predictability this brings. The villain's arc is just not believable and feels out of character. It also doesn't explore the very cool idea of a human-bat hybrid enough, throwing us into an action-packed ride that doesn't go as deep as it should have.

There is a hint of missed opportunity to the film because of this. Yet the art direction is well done, moody and dark, and the chemistry between Jared Leto and Adria Arjona works well too. All in all it's a strange addition to the Marvel Universe, very different in tone and feel, that works on a conceptual level but is let down by an unoriginal script in practice.

It'll entertain, even intruige, just keep expectations in check. And there will probably not be new films for this title, but I would like to see Morbius return in some form to the MCU.

He's strange. But feels cool to fit him in.","6"

It's tightly edited so it keeps moving along well but the overall story is weak and completely oredictable. You know Milo will be the bad guy, that Martine will be killed and resurrected as a vampire. The looping in of Keaton's Vulture is rushed and has no explanation or point.

Morbius is a sad figure or should generate pathos on the part of the viewer. This doesn't. There's little to make one care about the character. The FBI agents are there like traffic cones but with less impact.

For all the hype it's underwhelming.","3"

Morbius is another typical sony cash grab movie where you can tell there was no real passion or love for the characters. The story is kinda meh, the special effects are reaaaaally overdone and poor. You can barely tell whats happening during fight scenes because everything is just blurry CGI quick-cuts with the occasional slow-mo shot.

I really feel bad for jared leto, who will now have been screwed on both sides of the comic book world (dc with the joker and now marvel with morbius) and through no fault of his own. He makes a good effort with the morbius character and hes obviously a decent actor who deserves a better writer director for these sorts of movies.

"djonair","A Mess and Disappointing","5 April 2022","The film is a mess and disappointing.

I wasn't a fan of both Venom films but they were better made than Morbius is. Venom and Morbius are Spiderman villains in the comic books. However, the studio wants to make these Spiderman villain into anti-heroes in their own movies teasing the fans hoping to see these characters interact with Spiderman or fight him in a later film. Morbius reminded me of the movie Wolf starring Jack Nicholson. That film was better than this one. Morbius was supposed to come out summer of 2020 and was moved as many times as Top Gun 2 was moved. And in that time period, the studio couldn't correct any mistakes with this film? I understand why fan feel mislead by the movie.

In all the trailers there are scenes involving mentions of Spiderman, Spiderverse, and MCU and those scenes are not in the actual film. Fans feel duped. I hate when studios use deleted scenes in trailers.

There are 2 bonus scenes in the middle of the end credits and those scenes show a connection to Spiderman, Spiderverse, and MCU. One of those scenes, the 2nd one has a flaw to it. It is possible that Dr. Strange 2 or another Marvel film could explain or correct the flaw in that 2nd end credit scene.

Jared Leto is very good in the film. That is the only positive about the film. The film is predictable. The special effects are horrible. The editing in the film is sloppy and choppy. The film needed a new director, a new editor, a new script, and new special effects team.","1"
"stan_gee","Morbius The Real Batman or Is He????","18 May 2022","Giving this trash a 6 star rating is me being kind ... It really SUCK in script, content, and the action, sci-fi part. It did however have some pretty awesome special effects, beyond that, it had no plot to speak of. To say this is entertaining would be a stretch. The ending sucked beyond being sucked. Yet they have plans to make more of this dribble. Why don't IMDb send these reviews to the morons who made this waste of time, maybe by reading these, they'll learn how to make a better movie. What Columbia Pictures and Marvel should do is sell the serum to DC Comics to improve their Batboy, or is Batman, it's hard to keep up there haven't been a Batman since Michael Keaton.

The movie tries hard to a good one buts fells way short of its target by miles. Jared Leto, Matt Smith and Adria Arjona tries their level best to drag this lack lustre movie till its very end but it sinks as it progresses. The action sequences where mediocre with most ripped off from nightcrawler sequences making the audience question whether it is a nightcrawler solo movie.

The only good part of the movie is its opening sequence which tries hard to be serious and dark but gets butchered by Sony's cuts. However, Hallway sequence, Morbius rise and return sequences where worth goosebumps as they stood out among the whole movie.

Both the mid credits and post credits are lame which felt like usual Sony money grabbing tactics.

In the end, Morbius never had the weights to become a solo movie. It would have made better impact as a Spiderman solo parallel villain origin storyline.","5"

At worse, it's a poorly written, edited, and directed movie. Some of filmmaking mistakes are consistent with what you'd get from college students. The movie was rushed, the dialog idiotic at times, the scene continuity editing amateurish. The main star is neither a convincing protagonist or antagonist. The movie seemed disjointed. The construction of the characters and their motivations was inept.

"maysaif","Snobby reviews are misleading","1 April 2022","So I went into this movie with low expectations thinking it wouldn't be great & I wouldn't like it because I happened to glance at some of the reviews & ratings here right before I saw the movie.

Now that I've seen it, I swear I'm convinced that some reviewers here are either so snobby and elitist or they're just plain cynical and/or didn't actually watch the movie and just assumed it was bad because it's a comic book movie that Jared Leto is in.

'Cause the truth is it was so good! Not perfect, but waaay better than what those low ratings, negative reviewers will have you think. I mean just because something doesn't turn out the way you wanted it to be, doesn't mean it's not good. So please grow up and stop with the negativity.

This movie was entertaining, the way that Morbius and his movement & powers are depicted is so cool. Yeah the plot is predictable but it's an origin story movie, it's supposed to be simple and predictable, it's only an intro to the character, so be patient. Jared Leto did wonderfully with the character. His performance felt so natural & unforced. The character suits him pretty well. The CGi was good, the fight/action scenes were smooth and captivating. Yes, it would've been even cooler to see a darker R-rated version of the story, but again, that doesn't make it bad. And it was still fairly dark for a PG-13 movie too.

In a way, I'm glad I went into this thinking it would be bad 'cause it was a pleasant surprise for me that I thoroughly enjoyed it.

So don't listen to anyone and go see it and judge for yourself because some ratings and reviewes are not always reliable, they tend to be too negative these days. And keep in mind that some of them might rate it down just 'cause they don't like Jared Leto or another actor in it. Or they're unfairly judging the whole movie based on the mid-credit scenes which have nothing to do with the plot of the movie. Or just 'cause they wanna complain, since that's everyone's favorite pass time lately.

For starters, the pivotal and critical lynch pin of the entire backstory: Rare blood disease... And They don't even say *what* it is. /facepalm.

Then it goes to ""bats of anti-coagulants""... *IN THEIR SALIVA!* Which they fail to mention. So... how the flying f' would drooling an anti-coagulant fix your *blood* disorder? I no world would that make any sense.

Then his genetic serum (which would take weeks or months to have any affect) is near instant... and he magically has *much* more body mass... instantly.

None, and I mean *none* of his powers make any sense from gene-alteration. Bats don't fly with magic... they have friggen wings. They are quite squishy... not made of diamonds...

All they had to do is say ""we used a bit of magic to modify the gene serum"" and hand wave the rest. But... nope. Too lazy to even do that.

"JayDeeezy","Not Bad, Just MCU Phase 1-level","19 June 2022","I almost didn't watch this film because of the reviews but I'm glad I did. That said, I'm glad I rented it instead of paying theater price for it. This is not a bad movie like the reviewers would lead you to believe, it just lands among average quality during our current age of superhero films.

The plot is pretty basic origin-story stuff and it plays out in a predictable way. However I found the relationship between Morbius and the antagonist to be surprisingly compelling amidst - slightly better than the ""I'm bad because I'm just bad"" antagonists of MCU phase 1. Yes, there's lots of CGI but I found the PG-13 level of action to be enjoyable nonetheless. I was not expecting a gorefest, nor should anyone - this needs to be a broadly marketable franchise. Jared Leto also gives a good performance with what simplicity he's given because well...he's a good actor.

I will say that the tie-in to the Sony Spiderverse is a complete afterthought. The credits scenes were weak and stupid.

All in all, it's a pretty average superhero flick that has good production value. I personally think Venom is only one point above this because of the surprising rom-com element between Venom and Eddie which was unique. I think the bigger question is not ""why was Morbius bad?"" but ""why was Morbius made?"". The answer is Sony wants that superhero money with its property so it is hitting copy-paste from MCU. So, I don't really expect anything groundbreaking. If it does happen, it'll be a nice surprise.","5"
"nizarsalim","An Under Intermidiate Movie When it Comes to its Level","7 April 2022","In Morbius, Leto's and Smith's performances, action sequences, CGI and sound effects, and the theme of the story can all be praised. But regarding the flaws, the flaws in Morbius are the messy plot and the unorganized story telling, soundtrack, superficial story, many deleted scenes which were shown in the trailers, but were not in the movie at all, and the very unclear and ununderstood two mid credits scenes. Also, when the movie ended, I felt that it needed more before its ending to fully complete the ""picture"" it wanted to deliver. So concerning the score, I give Morbius 6 out of 10.","6"

"mattclap28","Has Marvel Gone Backwards.","5 April 2022","Off the bat (pun intended) this is not the best offering of the Marvel franchise. Marvel should just do these films on their own with no collaboration. Unfortunately here Sony has made the CGI pretty ordinary and with the budget they had it had to deliver better.

Micheal Morbius (Leto) is a biochemist determined to help himself, friend Milo (Smith) and many others from a debilitating rare blood disease. What was thought to save will have everlasting consequences.

The acting is ok seeing Jared Leto kept it very low key and lets face it he's playing a vampire. One can only hope Marvel learns from this and the next instalment with Vulture is much better.","5"

If I compare it with the spiderman movies with Tom Holland, this is way way superior. Spiderman movies have terrible story line and bad acting, it's a soap opera for teenagers.

The acting in this movie is quite ok, and the story is also fine. Simple but gives what is promised, a superhero movie with lots of action and an easy to follow story. It's an easy movie to eat popcorn and have a good time.

First off, good job to jared leto. Good acting there! Ok.. to the film.

I have no idea why everybody is so harsh on it. It deserves at least a 7 out of 10. Story wise, it is not the most original but it is not that bad. Jared and Matt are pretty good in portraying their roles. The fight effect or the sf4 brush effects as claimed by some critic is actually pretty good.

All i want to say is, give it a chance and watch it. It is not the best film out there but it is pretty ok and don't deserve all these poor reviews.","8"

I thought Jared Leto did fine playing the role, and his acting was fine. The script is awful. The opening scene makes no damn sense, and it goes downhill from there. The motivation of the bad guy makes no sense. There is zero physical chemistry between the co-stars for the obligatory romance angle. Same with the typical pair of cop buddies that bumble around with zero personality. The final boss fight was laughable it was so lame. Then THE END. No real conclusion to anything. It wasn't so terrible i turned it off, but It truly sucked, and not in a good vampire way sucked. Sad because I always thought Morbius was a cool comic book character. Another Sony stinker.","4"

Failed opportunities and no character development.

The cops make no sense either. It's a constant switch between trying to crack bad jokes at unfitting moments and being ""super"" serious.

Other than that, boring action due to trying to be PG friendly in an inherently R rated story.

I sometimes just sit and think about it for hours and actually feel myself in deep, really deep in myself. This film got me out of a depression and it has been really supportive ever since.

"FilmChamp20","Nothing is explained.","22 May 2022","The visuals are cool and the acting is good for the most part, but that's about it. Nothing is explained on anything. It just all happens and we're expected to just believe it. There isn't much of a bond formed with the characters to even care about them. Everything moves quickly without giving you time to digest the story or get into it. Just felt like a movie created to show various movie effects or special effects. This just wasn't a good movie or character introduction of Morbius.

His powers are never explained, he just gets them. Takes some blood from a bat and makes some sort concoction, injects it into a mouse and the mouse passes out. Then it comes back to life and it's ""Michael it worked"". Then Michael takes it and suddenly gets supernatural powers and superhuman abilities. Just like that. No explanation or any sort of logical reason explaining how, he just now has inhuman abilities. They just happen. He can suddenly fly, have super human strength, move superhumanly fast, dodge bullets, climb walls, have a sonar sense, hear from far away, and becomes a creepy looking creature occasionally without much of a transformation, just phases in and out of the vampire like monster form. All that from injecting himself with his randomly made bat blood and whatever mixture. And it happens in a matter of seconds. Guess I can just go mess with bat blood and get the same powers. Bats must have some secret mystical power within their DNA that Michael Morbius unlocks. Wish I knew.

The story continues that way, as in, just stuff keeps happening without explanation. Just a bunch of events and suddenly it's the end leaving thinking ""what the hell was all that?"" If someone asked you to tell them what Morbius is, even after watching this, you'd have no idea. Just he becomes a vampire of sorts, but not a technical vampire. *Shrugs* I don't know.

I really tried with this movie. I knew the bad rating and have seen all the rants on it. But I still wanted to just try for myself. This movie isn't good. Just a spectacle or display of movie special effects with no reason behind them.

If you're looking for Morbius from the comics or looking for a good superhero film, or even a fun vampire movie, look elsewhere. You won't find it in this movie.","5"

If you watch the trailers and the movie you will notice things in the trailers were not in the movie. Sony clearly changed aspects of the film for the final cut. This leads to one of the biggest issues in the movie.

The scene to scene editing is terrible. This movie feels like there are parts missing between scene transitions. It is a simple movie to follow but it feels very disjointed. Then you have the piss poor writing where things just happen to the benefit of the characters making a series of coincidences that feel absurd.

There are some after credits scenes that show Sony is just trying to milk this Marvel stuff for all its worth. An ending scene that makes absolutely no sense based upon what happened in the movie.

If you watched this just as some action/horror flick on a Sunday afternoon you'd think it was decent. Its worst mistake comes in the form of trying to associate itself with the MCU and people automatically set the bar so high with that. If you're curious give it a watch and I doubt you'll think you wasted that much of your life, doubt you'll watch it again but don't believe the reviews which doomed it to a 17 percent on RT.

Alot of people are saying make it R rated(18 in the uk) but that would not of saved it the entire script and characters needed changing.

"vinifernandes","Stop ruining comic book characters, SONY!","18 July 2022","It is so sad that every single Jared Leto's participation on a super hero or comic book based movie, is a total disaster.

Morbius is certainly the most embarrassing one.

The terrible CGI, the superficial screenplay and bad written plot, makes this movie one of the worst superhero film's ever.

The character of Morbius is not even developed onto his own motives and regarding his transition. Everything is fast paced and badly explained.

Somehow they managed to destroy what could be an interesting approach towards an anti-hero story.

Also the direction (full of slow motion features, on unnecessary scenes), choice of soundtrack, and again, CGI, is bad... so bad.

Finally, despite all of these bad things, the worst thing of this movie is the ""villain"", which is horribly portrayed by Matt Smith (as Milo), and his interaction with the other characters.

Overall, it was a bad experience, and somewhat annoying. However, it was nice to see Tyrese Gibson on a superhero movie, and it sucks that he won't get to work on another one because of this film.","3"

Leto is a great actor but seems to be put in movies with bad writers and directors. The fight scenes seem more like 2000s matrix reloaded CGI.

"gelmcchristop","Decent script, but a messy production","11 June 2022","Frankly, the story of Morbius is surprisingly well written. Everything beyond the base concept of a man turning into a vampire is actually coherent, the intentions of each character are clear as day, and the story unfolds in quite a suspenseful way, unlike so many other superhero movies. So at the end of the day, the script is easy to follow and leaves you with something to think about.

The directing and cinematography on the other hand are evidently rushed. The camera is often jumping around the set aimlessly, which clearly points to lack of organization rather than a less skilled director/editor (some action sequences for example worked wonders in conveying visual information in seriously quick cuts). And while some of the sets are true works of art, others are totally confusing, with flashy colors serving no real purpose. The vfx work was good but uninspired and rather cartoonish, which again points towards carelessness on the production's side.

And of course Marvel had to butcher the otherwise rather emotional ending for the sake of shoving the movie in their collection of blockbusters. Unless they start putting real effort into their productions, the craze with their movies will eventually die out, leaving behind nothing but a pile of flashy and meaningless footage.","6"

The powers were cool, the villain was good, there was a lot of CGI but that's already expected.

Also kudos to Matt Smith who did a great job as the villain, his performance was better than Leto's, and I'm not defending his character, this is just me praising him, he made me feel bad for this character in a few moments of the movie, there was a particular scene with Jared Harris where I feel like he just wanted someone to be happy that he was cured, that he wasn't going to die anymore, but unfortunately he became a murderer, and he didn't felt bad at all about this so that makes his friends reactions understandable.

"KissMyAss31193","If someone where to tell you ""Morbius is bad""...","14 May 2022","...if anything, they'd actually be understating the immense lack of quality this movie provides.

Morbius directly follows in the footsteps of Suicide Squad (2016), being just as bad, just as incomprehensible and just as pointless.

If you can show me someone who loves this movie unironically, I'll show you a liar.

The only people who wouldn't find this movie to be utter trash, are people who are either 10 years old, or people who have only seen 10 movies in their entire life.

Nobody, not even drunk people could find genuine enjoyment in this flaming pile of excrement. And I would know, because I tried.

Jared Leto sucks. Not just in the movie. Although, It's not even possible to relay any kind of interesting performances, considering the script was clearly written by a brain-damaged duck.

If you have ever farted, you have already created greater dialogue than can be found in Morbius, and you should consider working for Sony.

The story is incredibly simplistic, yet presented in the most convoluted way possible. Like any other 13 year old boy, Jared Leto experiments on himself to cure his desire to become a real man. He succeeds in creating a bat-juice that cures his debilitating disease and also turns him into a vampire with super strength and other superpowers and stuff. As expected his best buddy boy, who's also suffered from a debilitating disease, ceases the opportunity and turns himself into a vampire as well.

So they fight. And Jared Leto wins.

But why is Jared Leto involved with this at all? Wasn't ruining one comic book character enough for him. Is he going to destroy them all?

Sony really outright refuses to learn from other studios mistakes. The only times Sony has released something somewhat comprehensible, was all projects where the actual artists had most of the actual control. Like ""Once Upon A Time In Hollywood"", which was also produced and distributed by Sony.

This movie however, feels like everyone showed up on set with a white flag. Surrendering under the stupendous pressure of the studio, and making a deliberate and debilitating choice not to give a single fu**.

It's way too dark and ugly to look at. Just mostly black, blue and green, but mostly black. It sounds like a toilet. There was an instance where the played the exact same sound effect 3 times in a row. Not to mention the instantly forgettable score and inappropriate soundtrack choices. Just amazing.

If you are an aspiring filmmaker, I recommend watching this movie as a pitch perfect example, on how not to make a good or even passable film.

"Grey2black","Anemic vampire","16 June 2022","I would've never thought that anyone could mess up a Morbius movie. Not only fail miserably but make it so predictable.

And the story... It almost seemed we were back in the 40s and 50s. It is way past time writers learn they can't just act as if the people watching these movies know nothing about genetics and science. In the 80s and the 90s a movie like this might have been successful, but not in these times.

Even Marvel phase 3, had the common sense to try to give better explanations for the powers of the characters. How they even tried to connect the super soldier serum, all the way from the Wakanda heart shape flower, to Captain America, to the Hulk. How even Carol Danvers needed the exotic energies of the Tesseract Cube to have the powers she had. With Spider-Man they just said it was a spider and left everything else in the air, trying to avoid saying that a simple radioactive spider gave Peter Parker those powers.

In this movie we have Michael Morbius trying to find a cure for his genetic disease, using the genes of vampires bats. He creates a genetic cocktail, and immediately he becomes not only something else but something else with powers.

It would've helped this movie a lot, if Michael either found bats that had developed in a cave with exotic minerals or energies in it, or if Michael had discovered a new form of radiation that had amazing mutagenic properties. The essential to help sell the idea that adding bat genes could have such an effect on a person. They could've even given it a supernatural touch if they wanted to.

Instead the movie immediately goes to full on vampiric mode, and if that wasn't bad enough, the movie not at all surprisingly enough without any explanation gradually removes Michael option for surviving without having to feed on the blood of people. A completely foreseeable move that didn't came as a surprise at all.

If anything this movie fails completely really because of that. It's too predictable. Of all the things they could've done, that would've opened several other options for sequels they went with the worst possible story.

Performances from the cast was okay at best, and almost unwatchable at times. And the only thing salvageable are the mediocre special effects.

Even I could've written a better story for Morbius, than what Matt Sazama and Burk Sharpeless did.

Just another wasted opportunity. And a movie to fade away from memory as a bad dream.","3"

"therealljessemac","CGI Does not solve problems !","17 July 2022","Morbius is a Marvel super hero movie Morbius deals with genetic engineering. Jared Leto plays Michael Morbius a paraplegic whom seeks to find the cure for his disabilities using unorthodox methods he becomes able to walk again. His boyhood friend Loxias Crown ( Matt Smith ) whom they both had the same defects also frees himself from the shackles of physical disability through the taking of the serum. The genesis of this movie starts off well but towards its climax we are thrown off the cliff making the storyline seem like a a speed car getting crashed. Adria Arjona as Martine Bancroft is just there to occupy cinema role as a female character her relationship with Michael Morbius is just in need of explanation.

The problem with Morbius is like unlike other Marvel movies is seems to have an already common theme of vampirism and like The Punisher ( 2004 ) that came before it which dealt with vigilantism and revenge both common themes in blockbuster movies it did not have the maximum effect on movie goers. Another disaster with this movie is the screenplay that seems to be rushed or would one suggest that this movie was hastily edited and put out for consumption with the hope that some unnecessary visual effects would do the magic.","1"

I hate when people, professionals or not, rip apart these movies. I approach every movie on its own context and content. I also happen to be a rabid Marvel silver and bronze age fanatic. The vast wealth of creativity, original ideas, and leveraging of old ones is unmatched in history! (IMO) But in movies and television, with a few unexpected exceptions, there was nothing but abysmal, ridiculous, and embarrassing productions of these stories. Until the mid 2000s when they started making a serious effort.

Is this a perfect, blockbuster movie?

No. It has some definite weaknesses. Some things that do not honor the source material. And, as seeds to happen a lot, too much corporate editing and control.

I am not a fan of the source material, vampires, or Jared Leto. But I look at the story, the scripting, the acting and the composition. And I think this is a very underrated film. And very entertaining. No, it's not as good as any of the spider-man movies. Or even the 1st Venom movie (also under-rated at the time). But worth the watch. And it might surprise you.","7"
"jdrendinell10","Overall disappointment","3 April 2022","I'm not sure what Sony is doing, but this suffered the same issues as Venom: Get an A list actor and then just hope for the best. Poor pacing, nonexistent dialogue, and hollow character development doomed this thing from the start through the final moments. It's almost as if the writers started writing an origin story, realized they ran out of time, cut a bunch of it, and hastily put together a (very) quick climax with zero payoff or emotional stakes. Leto did as well as he (or anybody) could with what he was given (same with Hardy), but the poor guy can't seem to catch a break when it comes to comic book movies.

"Galop_Inferno","Bad but not utter garbage","20 April 2022","We all know the strange, pathetic tale of the Morbius movie by now so I won't reiterate but from the mind of someone who works at a movie theater and therefore has had no escape from the ads: it's not complete garbage. I know coming from a guy who's seen nearly 5k movies and has an incredibly strange take on things that statement may be a surprise but let me break it down.

The opening and end credits aesthetic is great and I love its neon-y vibe. However, it's not enough to save the rest of the mid-2000s Marvel Studios feel, like I'm watching the 2005 Fantastic Four again... or the Silver Surfer movie... or Fant4stic.

The past few years has given everyone a chance to realize where they stand between Jared Leto as an actor. There are those who will support him to the end of time, and there are sane people. His infamous approach of ""method acting"" has been a hot topic, from sending his co-stars dead things on Suicide Squad to (and this is just my assumption) peeing on everything to mark his territory on House of Gucci. On Morbius, it's been revealed that he walked with crutches everywhere and held up everyone's time. Even as someone who calls themself an actor, I gotta say, that's a pretty trash thing to do.

As Morbius is set in the same universe as the Venom movies, the width of said universe is still a mystery. Here, we discover that the X-Men are a thing, as Jared Harris (as Morbius' childhood caretaker) says that he could send the kid to a ""gifted school upstate"" after mini Morb fixes an expensive machine with a ballpoint pen.

Having seen a number of Leto's films over the years (10, to be exact), I can't help but wonder what his ""method"" was for each role. If he really did go live on the streets and get addicted to drugs for Requiem for a Dream, then at least the CGI for his super soldier chest is good. As for the vamp face (which looks straight out of season 1 Buffy), that chunk of budget must've been part of Leto's salary.

Matt Smith is Milo, Morb's ""brother"", brother in quotes as they grew up in the same hospital, and, once he's stolen Morb's cure for their unspecified missing DNA disease, he becomes a scenery scarfing fairy who dances more randomly yet less cringefully than Spider-Man 3.

The writing leaves A LOT to be desired but this is to be expected from the scribes of The Lost Witch Hunter and Gods of Egypt. Director Daniel Espinosa, I've only seen Life and that was fine if not forgettable. Morbius feels less like a contemporary Marvel movie and more as if it were made in 2006, got stuck in a time capsule and was unearthed in 2019 to try to touch up before releasing it to the masses after No Way Home. Is it bad? Yes. Is it fun to riff? Oh, most definitely.","4"

"cookiefudge","Really not that bad","16 September 2022","This movie definitely has problems, but it's nowhere near as bad as some other Marvel titles. Venom 2, X-Men Dark Phoenix, and Fantastic Four are movies I can remember being absolutely terrible. Morbius is just fine. It doesn't really deserve the hate and memes it gets when stuff like Thor Love & Thunder and the character assassination of the Loki show are praised.

I think a large issue with it is that it was too short. I didn't really care about any of the characters or their relationships. They weren't developed enough or really given enough time to be developed. There was no explanation behind Milo's motives either. Though, this movie has a surprisingly decent cast, and they all did pretty good with the material they were given.

I think the fight scenes could've been cool, but they went by really quickly and were a bit hard to make out. The ending fight was pretty anti-climactic also, though not as bad as the one with Carnage in Venom 2. The dialogue left a bit to be desired but it wasn't terrible. The only scene in the entire movie that made me visibly cringe was the dance scene with Milo. Why...","5"
"Hey_Harry","Morbius - Not terrible but still a painfully mediocre entry in the Marvel franchise","14 April 2022","Like the previous two installments of Marvel's ""Venom"", ""Morbius "" is yet another take on the dark superhero genre but throws in the vampire genre for good measure. Unfortunately, while ""Venom"" was at least a decently entertaining movie, ""Morbius"" is a huge letdown.

The biggest problems with ""Morbius"" is that it's too rushed and suffers from an incredibly lacklustre script. Jared Leto is not a bad fit for the character of Dr. Michael Morbius, a terminally ill man who transforms into a vampiric beast upon injecting himself with an experimental serum designed to cure his life-threatening condition. The serum ends up granting him bat-like superpowers including increased strength, speed and echolocation but the downside is that he must feed on artificial (and eventually human) blood to sustain himself. However, while the concept of Morbius's character is interesting, Leto's efforts are mostly wasted due to an incoherent script. Due to the film's poor writing and characterization, you never sympathize much with Morbius's plight or the tragedy surrounding his relationships with any of the film's supportive characters. Morbius's motivations are all over the place in the film. For example, in contrast with Marvel's Doctor Strange, the movie seems to forget sometimes that Morbius is supposed to be a doctor who's dedicated to saving lives and instead, the movie fails to make him into a compelling hero (or antihero) with no clear motivation. Even Matt Smith's role as the evil vampire antagonist feels wasted due to bad scriptwriting. Matt Smith's charisma could've easily made him an excellent homage to Deacon Frost from Marvel's ""Blade"" who's one of the best vampire antagonists depicted on film. On that note, the film also lacks the seductive, nocturnal atmosphere of urban vampire flicks such as ""Blade"" or"" Underworld."" The movie never properly dwells on the nocturnal setting that makes urban vampire films and the vampire life in general so captivating and alluring.

Overall, the movie isn't terrible but nothing in the film really stands out either. Frankly, the whole film is a painfully mediocre experience whose sole purpose apparently was to introduce Morbius's character to the Spiderman multiverse. That said, I still think Jared Leto is a good fit for the role of Morbius and I still think there's a lot of potential to his character but hopefully his next film appearance is followed by a much better script.","6"

Lots of things that could of been added but never were and moments of bad writing such as the Morbius character on the run in hiding yet goes to a cafe with his hood down for patrons/staff to be able to see who he is. At times the pacing felt rushed. The story felt stereotypical/predictable 20 minutes... 2 best friends close like brothers, one becomes bad and has to be stopped by the good one.

I'm convinced that this movie is a setup for Sony's Spider-Man Universe (SSU) Sinister Six and possibly The Amazing Spider-Man 3 which is long overdue.","5"
"ayameofazuma","its too rushed","17 September 2022","Not knowing anything about Morbius or his story, this movie is just very rushed! I thought the plot of this movie sounded interesting, but I had no idea it was even Marvel until I pressed play. I don't read comics so I'm unfamiliar with Marvel characters besides the ones that everyone knows. When I looked Morbius up, a quick skim of his story didn't seem to match this movie at all. It was interesting, but in no means a good movie. The story is just too rushed and the final fight was rushed. Why didn't they make this movie longer? A lot of movies are over two hours long anymore. This would have given a little more time for story, character development and explanations. I think this whole movie was rushed just to set up a sequel that would further explain anything in this first movie.","5"
"michaelschuddinck","Less money on CGI, more on a decent script","20 April 2022","Well clearly not all Marvel movies will be massive hits. Morbius is one of the first massive flaws for me, where it doesn't even hit to be half as scary as it presents to be. The constant CGI is too much (was there even one shot without?), and the script was weak and predictable. There was nothing new to tell here, and it was all just ticking by and nearing the end, where the big ""good guy""/""bad guy"" battle happens. At least Venom has a point of bringing something new-ish. Being a ""bad person"" character and make it in a sort of charming way (although Deadpool was the first one to hit that off and Venom 2 was pretty awful)... that been said, to start of a proper series of this character, it flawed massively, and I'm not even slightly interested in a sequel (although that's what they hoped for clearly).

Jared Leto is not bad as an actor, he is amazing in Mr. Nobody, sure he is eccentric, But not to a level he can't act. Why It's okay for Christian Bale goes deep into his character(s), but it's a no-no for Jared Leto? Likely, he doesn't care, he has an Oscar.

The script was not up to par, but no surprise there, because it was re-written many times. The concept was okay, and the added a little suspense in the middle was good (fooled me). Not being critical, Leto had no chemistry with either supporting actors. He was too focus to be Morbius, perhaps. The special effects were original and nice.

Without any special, interesting or minimally acceptable point, the film can't be enough to be an ""okay"". Sony wanted to score with another success, embarking with Venom (which even, it's not great things), but Morbius managed to be even worse in all points that Venom was ""okay"".

"kirkj-52187","Morbius: The Best Film Ever","28 May 2022","Morbius is set in the Morbground, a realm where morbsters were banished after war broke out with humans, in the year 201X. The Morbground is sealed from the surface by a magic morbarrier with a singular gap at Mount Morbbott. A human child falls into the Morbground from Mount Morbbott and encounters Morbey, a sentient Morb who teaches the player the game's mechanics and encourages them to raise their ""LV"", or ""LOVE"", by gaining ""EXP"" through killing morbsters. When Morbey attempts to kill the human, the human is rescued by Morbiel, a morberly goat-like morbster, who teaches the human how to survive conflict in the Morbground without killing. She intends to adopt the human, wanting to protect them from Morbgore, the king of the Morbground.

The human eventually leaves Morbiel to search for Morbgore's castle, which contains the morbarrier to the surface world. They encounter several morbsters, such as the skeletons Morbs and Morbyrus, two morbrothers who act as sentries for the Morbdin forest; Morbdyne, the head of the morbal guard; Morbys, the kingdom's royal scientist; and Morbaton, a robotic television host Morbys created. Most of the morbsters are fought, with the human choosing whether to kill them or to spare and possibly befriend the morbster. During their travels, the human learns that many years ago, Morbriel (NOT MORBIEL), the son of Morbgore and Morbiel, befriended the first child who fell into the Morbground and was adopted by Morbgore and Morbiel. When the child abruptly died, Morbriel returned the body to the surface. The humans then attacked and killed Morbriel, causing Morbgore to declare war. In the present day, Morbgore has already collected six human souls, of which he needs one more to break the magic morbbarrier.

The game's ending depends on how the player handles encounters with morbsters. If the player is on their first playthrough without killing (or killed some but not all morbsters) the human arrives at Morbgore's castle and learns that a morbster's soul is also needed to cross the barrier, forcing them to fight Morbgore. Morbs stops the human before their confrontation, revealing that the human's ""LOVE"" is an acronym for ""level of violence"" and ""EXP"" for ""execution points"". Morbs judges the human based on their accumulated ""LOVE"" and ""EXP"". The human then fights Morbgore, but Morbey interrupts, killing Morbgore and stealing the human souls. With the aid of the rebellious souls, the human defeats Morbey, falls unconscious, and awakens on the human side of the morbarrier. They then receive a phone call from Morbs, detailing the state of the Morbground after the human's departure. This ending is known colloquially among fans as the ""Morbal"" ending.

If the player kills no morbsters after completing a ""Morbal"" ending, they can complete the ""Morbifist"" route. Morbey is revealed to be a reincarnation of Morbriel accidentally created by Morbys's experiments. During the fight with Morbgore, Morbiel interrupts the battle and is joined by the other morbsters the human befriended. Morbey ambushes the group, absorbing the souls of all the humans and morbsters in order to take an older Morbriel's form. The human connects with their friends during the ensuing fight, eventually defeating him. Morbriel reverts to his child form, destroys the morbarrier, and expresses remorse to the others before leaving. The human falls unconscious and is awoken to see their friends surrounding them, with the knowledge of the human's name: Morbisk. The morbsters reintegrate with the humans on the surface, while Morbisk has the option of accepting Morbiel as their adoptive mother.

A third ending known as the ""No Morbcy"" or ""Morbocide"" ending ensues if the player kills all the morbsters. When Morbisk reaches Morbgore's castle, Morbs attempts and fails to stop Morbisk. Morbey kills Morbgore in an attempt to gain morbcy, but he is killed by Morbisk. Morba, the first fallen child, then appears and destroys the universe. To enable further replays of the game, Morbisk must give their soul to Morba to restore the universe, which will permanently alter all subsequent Morbifist routes.","10"

But this really is an unimaginative cut and paste blockbuster storyline. As far as plot is concerned it's a predictable snooze fest. And there is no progression from the early character of the villain to the later stage as Morbius's nemesis. He's just suddenly a bad guy. Sony, really? Have you not ever watched a Marvel movie? It's a well directed, beautiful looking movie but as empty inside as a vampire's soul.","2"
"edwardunc","Comparable to Venom","1 April 2022","Your feelings about Venom will likely be similar to your feelings about Morbius. It is by no means a masterpiece, and the proximity of its release to The Batman (2022) certainly didn't do it any favors. If you go in with low expectations you will likely enjoy the film. There are some non-sensical moments and the movie feels a bit rushed, but overall it's a decent rendition of one of the less popular Marvel characters.

Jared Leto gives a very solid performance as Dr Michael Morbius, and after some so-so superhero films Sony has released lately I'm glad to say this one is a pleasant surprise. The story is very solid and I'm glad to see where they take this character in the future. To quote the great Dr Michael Morbius (marvel legend), ""It's morbin time.""","10"
"pinemaples","Morbius is not a complete trainwreck, but it's definitely not ""good"" either. Just fine.","7 April 2022","Despite the 1-hour, 44-minute runtime, Morbius feels short and incredibly small-scale. Not a lot seems to happen, and by the end it feels really anti-climactic. It's overall just really weak. Most of the dialogue feels like a placeholder for them to come it and rewrite it later for a final draft that never happened. On the whole, it felt unfinished, and like the first part of a series. Out of all MCU movies and MCU-tangential movies (like Venom and Let There Be Carnage) so far, I'd say this one was the weakest.

All that said, I didn't hate it. I didn't particularly like it that much, either, but I wouldn't be opposed to a rewatch later down the line. Even considering my complaints, I'd be lying if I said I didn't still have a good time watching it.","6"
"courtneypedersen","Choppy Editing","26 May 2022","I enjoyed Morbius despite its very obvious editing flaws. First of all, I agree with the widespread opinion regarding the mid-credit scenes. They're very definitely confusing and felt like they were added because that's the ""thing to do"". They didn't really add anything and didn't leave me excited for the possibility of an upcoming movie.

Second of all, what was the point of the very first scene? The movie opens to Morbius going to a bat cave, cutting his hand and letting the bats (I assume because you can't truly see) drink his blood. I thought we would revisit this scene at some later point in the movie, I figured it would contribute to his transformation but it didn't. It had no effect on the movie whatsoever.

That right there was this movie's whole issue. Scenes that had no effect on the story were added while the majority of the movie had holes in the storytelling. It was almost like they took out scenes that they didn't think were important but they had a major role in the flow of the story. This movie is barely an hour and 45 minutes long but they could have easily added an additional 30 or 45 minutes to help with the flow of the story and Morbius' origin.

Instead, we're left with a choppy film that feels very much thrown together at the last minute. With all the delays this movie had, you would think they would've taken the extra time to perfect it but it's obvious that wasn't done. On the plus side, IF the Morbius character gets a sequel they have nowhere to go but up. But, for the love of good movies, find a different director or editor or something! Someone who actually knows how to tell a good, smooth story.

One more thing. Being a Whovian, I absolutely enjoyed Matt Smith as Milo. He was my favorite part of this whole movie and I loved seeing his quirkiness play into his role as a villain.","6"

"athorpe-95303","its not that bad lol","10 June 2022","Ok. Hear me out. This movie is actually not that bad. Sure, the acting and character interaction leaves much to be desired. Sure, the plot holes are numerous and large. Sure, the audio/score is virtually nonexistent. But it's still pretty cool. The concept's cool, the characters are pretty interesting, and its best feature is its simplicity. It's really easy to understand what's going on. Still though, not as good as pretty much any other modern superhero movie. Besides thor 1 and 2 ofc. 68/100. Prolly will watch again, it's not that bad.

"terrel-nicholas","Fire the director and writers","24 September 2022","Would have been a good movie if the director and writers were fired and it was allowed to be rated R. And they wonder why people don't want to go to the theaters to watch a poorly made movie for $15. This movie would have been nothing without Matt Smith and Jared Leto to hold up the story line. The inconsistencies and poor writing permeate the story extremely well. It's a shame the character and plot development weren't given the same care. I'm pretty sure there were additional scenes but just didn't make the cut for whatever reason. One of the best parts of the movie was after the credits rolled.","1"
"pd-19490","This was pretty bad all around","1 August 2022","I watched this on a plane recently and lost interest after about 30 minutes. I did finish it but that's only because there wasn't anything else on and it wasn't so horrible that I couldn't finish it. The special effects were pretty cheesy, the story and characters were rushed and not interesting, and the acting was not great. I was surprised by the acting as well, especially from Leto because he's usually really good but everyone seemed to be phoning it in.","3"
"hutomo_gates","Boring","30 March 2022","Some scenes can be potential and should be developed for the plot but the execution feel rushed. That's what makes this movies's duration is kind of short and even boring. Jared Leto's acting is quite helping this movie. For the others looks quite descent. Maybe because they don't get much portion for thier roles. For CGI, They did great things for the fighting scenes but for special effects on actors faces looks basic. I quite love the scores, especially Michael Morbius's theme. Rating is also big influence for some scenes in this movie. With PG-13, some scenes seems lost lot of atmosphere. Morbius should be depicted as scary and sadistic. In this movie, he depicted as less than in the comic. As happened in the previous two Venom movies.

Overall this movie is ""light"" and just an filler movie for another Sony's big project in the future. I don't know what they plan next but Morbius is part of their plan. Let's hope Sony learns something and fix its for their next movies. I'm not recommend this movies but if you are fan of Morbius and Sony Cinematic Universe, you can watch it.","6"

It's not a good movie by any means, but it does have some cool fight scenes and horror aspects that boost it from a 4 to a 5. Matt Smith's villain is really interesting and his performance was probably the best part of the entire movie. But the story was so out of place, and some of the scenes felt so rushed and the CGI could use some work here and there. And obviously the worst part was cutting out the Spider-Man references and putting Adrian Toomes's scenes all in the Post-Credits. I stayed for the Post Credits Scenes, and they were just stupid. Overall, I would wait to rent Morbius at home, or wait until it's on streaming, because overall, it's not good.","5"

Morbius as a character is a little bland, but Leto had this quiet sarcasm that I actually really liked. I liked the actress for the love interest, although their relationship in the movie was silly. Matt Smith is just phenomenal though, he definitely makes the movie.

"sesa-77478","Worst screenplay of the 20th century","21 September 2022","This movie was excessively bad. The screenplay is extremely choppy and rushed. Im not even halfway through the movie and I dont know if I will make it through. Only reason to watch this is to see an overpowered Jared Leto jump across large distances. Feels like a 10 hour movie that was cut down to whatever the run time is. If youre thinking about watching this, you will get more pleasure from watching the ""Everything wrong with"" youtube video than the actual movie. Not sure if I needed to read a comic or something before this but there are so many plotholes that will never be filled. Honestly do not watch this you will gain nothing.","2"

The ultra-exaggerated features, the transition from science experiment to paranormal experiment, it simply has no sense.

Jared's performance is good, but the character he played and the way he was supposed to play it, is just ridiculous.

The effects are good, but again, exaggerated. I don't know what I'm watching. A supernatural horror movie with a bad script and bad lines? What with the joke ""holy water? Really?! - What?! I'm not taking any chances. It's triple blessed."" This is ultra cringe.

I really liked Morbius from the animated series when I was a kid. I'm an adult now, and was expecting something interesting.

It's hard to make the story of Morbius with a realist touch, but this is way too far from anything realistic, that would have any sense.

"rtbradford","Much too rushed","14 May 2022","This movie was worse than a network movie of the week. Yes, it was fun and light hearted and didn't take itself too seriously, but the story was way, way too rushed. Möbius' transition from upstanding scientist to vampire happens in a few scenes. His friend's transition occurs even faster. Instead of showing who people are and showing the way they relate to each other, we're just told. And no one seems to have any trouble believing in vampires - as if they're just a common everyday hazard. Yes, I know it's a comic book story and all, but compared to other recent flicks, this one seems cheap and shallow. Even Marvel's streaming TV series are much better made with much richer storylines.","6"

This needed to be so much bolder, eclipse the exciting action of Blade or Underworld but this has none of that character development or depth.

Not sure why this movie is getting so much hate but I actually saw it. I had fun watching it. Action was easy to follow along. Leto, Arjona and Matt Smith were great. I'm surprised how little of Tyrese was actually in this. I thought his part would be bigger. This movie gave me The Incredible Hulk vibes but just with vampires.

"strassermarlies","Not good, not bad","31 May 2022","Since the trailer came out, I was interested in this movie, because I like vampire stories. Jared Leto is a decent actor and he is easy on the eye. Who doesn't like looking at THAT face? The movie was sure not bad, but the spark was missing. They obviously tried to make a nice movie, with nice characters and a nice plot. Maybe that was the problem: it was too nice. Venom sure was on another level. Like others said, don't make those movies for children. Give us something more. We don't want a Disney movie. The characters had potential at first, but at the end they seemed shallow and uninteresting. I liked the police guys! Seeing Morbius work with them would have been interesting. But no. I don't know the comics, so I have no idea where this is leading to. But I feel they wasted the potential. It's just another superhero film with a superhero plot: strange experiment leads to superhuman powers, superhero has to learn to control them, a love interest is introduced, a villain appears, we have a fight - THE END.

Why.","5"
"tonyum","An overall awful experience, but for its many bad qualities, it does what few bad movies manage to accomplish","25 February 2023","So today, I've decided to take a look at Morbius (2022), a film that is known for many things, including it increasing the widespread of one of the most quoted ""they didn't say that in the actual movie"" lines ever in recent years (""It's Morbin' Time""), it opening up the floodgates to a huge cesspool of memes that included posts related to said quoted line, and, as a result of the popularity of these two instances in social media, the studio rereleasing it the same year it first premiered, which then ultimately led to it becoming one of the first movies to bomb twice in the box-office.

But Morbius's contributions to current-day society isn't the only thing that makes it beyond fascinating. As a movie on its own, Morbius delivers a terrible experience, and yet somehow, it manages to reach a special kind of bad, one that's rarely ever seen in cinema: that being that ""it's so bad, it's somehow good, though only really partially good, as it still has some qualities that make it bad"".

The film's first problem, and it's actually quite easy to notice it, is the editing, with many scenes being interrupted by new scenes set in different locations and the characters doing other things that they previously were, only for these new scenes to suddenly end and then they cut back to the original scene we were watching, almost as if the additional scenes that were spliced in the original scenes should've been placed some time else in the movie; other scenes play as normal, only for the film to cut to a black screen, only for it to resume playing the scene; and some other scenes (specifically the ones that film the characters walking behind the camera) seem very obviously trimmed out, given that the character that's behind the camera is in one part of the background, and then on the second shot, he or she is in another part of the background, with no smooth transitions in between.

The bad editing is also accompanied by pretty poor cinematography, with the film oftenly relying on Shaky Cam shots that really have no reason to be shot in Shaky Cam, mediocre designs for the two main vampires (especially Morbius himself, who looks like he's from a PlayStation 3 game), underdeveloped and uninteresting, though fortunately not unlikable or annoying, characters (with the exception of Michael and Milo, but that's for later), and terrible acting from the lead actor Jared Leto, who sounds very uninterested and bored throughout the movie and shows little emotion in his face beyond surprise or just a normal-feeling expression.

The film also tries to do a twist villain in the form of Milo (Michael Morbius's (the lead character, by the way) childhood friend and Matt Smith's character), however it doesn't really work, as after they play the prologue (which depicts Michael and Milo meeting in a nursery home and becoming friends, and after Michael leaves the nursery home to study in New York, Milo receives a letter from Michael, until the wind blows the letter away from the nursery home and ends up in the hands of a bunch of bullies who were walking by, to which Milo tries to get the letter from them but ends up being picked on for being handicapped), they pretty much establish that Milo is someone who was harassed and picked on as a child, and wants to get cured immediately from his condition, so he will inevitably use some of Michael's formula, which cures the blood disease he and Michael have, to cure his condition and avenge society for the way they treated him, becoming both a villain and an evil-er Living Vampire character (due to the side-effects of the formula) than Morbius in the process. While not all of these predictions came true in the end, most of them did, which subsequently makes this twist very predictable and for Milo's villain act to be generally weak (though, if I've learned anything from the 2018 Venom movie is that the Sony Spider-Man Universe isn't really good at writing villains, so this isn't the first time this has happened to a film that takes place in this universe).

And finally, let's talk about the two fairly infamous post-credits scenes, which show Adrian Toomes (AKA The Vulture), played by Michael Keaton, being released from a jail cell he spawned into and then joining Morbius, presumably leading to the Sinister Six movie. You may be asking ""Why would Keaton's Vulture there if he's from the Marvel Cinematic Universe?"" Because of something Spider-Man did, specifically Doctor Strange's botched spell from Spider Man: No Way Home. However, this whole scene doesn't really make much sense if you really think about it, as Strange's spell from No Way Home brought everyone who knew Peter Parker's secret identity into the MCU, so why would Toomes be kicked out of the MCU and into the Sony Spider-Verse when he should remain in the MCU because of the spell? More importantly, Toomes accuses Spider-Man of bringing him over to the SSV, and asks Morbius to join him so they could both take him down, but how does Toomes know Spider-Man screwed up the multiverses? And how does Morbius know who Spidey is when he's never made an appearance in the movie? One last thing that's also really confusing: Where did Toomes get his vulture suit he's seen wearing at the post-credits in this universe? In the Marvel Cinematic Universe, his suit was made out of alien technology left over from the invasion of New York in The Avengers, but this never happened in this universe, so how did he get it here?

While most of these flaws are somewhat problematic, I can't say I didn't have a good time watching it either, as it does have some redeeming qualities, most notably Matt Smith's performance as Milo, who brings a ton of energy and charisma to the picture in contrast to Jared Leto's rather dull performance.

On the topic of Milo, while he is a poorly written twist-villain, both him and Michael Morbius himself are decently developed characters, with a good amount of depth, personality and overall decent chemistry, at least compared to everyone else in the movie.

However, I think where Morbius really shines at is the fact that, while it still delivers a bad experience, some aspects of it are so bad, they're good, such as the aforementioned bad editing, poor cinematography, bland secondary characters, bad acting from the lead actor, and bad vampire designs, and even some aspects I didn't mention such as the laughably terrible dialogue, which sounds like something you'd expect to hear in an elementary school play rather than a 167.5 million dollar film released in theaters in 2022.

So overall, while Morbius is an overall awful experience, with terrible editing, poor cinematography, bad vampire designs, boring side characters and bad acting and I would most definitely not recommend it to any Marvel fan, comic book fan or even any casual viewers, I think a lot of its duds help it step to the level of being so bad, it's entertaining, though with a predictable twist and confusing post credits, it doesn't really live up to the same level of entertainment as other ""so bad, it's good"" movies, like The Room (2003) or Plan 9 From Outer Space (1959). However, even with it not quite scratching the surface for the category, I would still recommend it to anyone who's a huge fan of ""so bad, it's good"" movies just for it having some things that make a terrible film truly deserving of such a title, along with it having a couple of positives, like Matt Smith's great performance and how well-developed the characters of Michael and Milo are.","3"

However, after my eldest child recommended it, I decided to give it a chance. To my surprise, it was similar to any other standard superhero movie with some silly moments, but it provided an enjoyable experience to share with your people.

The plot centers around two boys who have been battling serious illnesses from a young age. Despite their challenges, one of them becomes a Nobel Prize-winning medical researcher who is determined to find a cure for their condition.

If you're a fan of superhero movies, then you'll definitely appreciate this one. And if, like me, you're not particularly drawn to the genre, you'll still find it tolerable and not necessarily worse than others.","7"

Character designs were nice, and the monsters convincingly threatening. Some of the final plot elements were entirely too predictable and didn't come across clever, even remotely.

"faidai","Sony missed a trick - again.","7 November 2022","I've been looking forward to this ever since they announced it was going to be an R-rating. Two years later & it's been downgraded to a tween film with probably as much on the cutting room floor as made it to the screen. To say that pisses me off would be putting it mildly. The film felt like giant bites(!) had been taken out of it, to the detriment of action & storyline. It's about time that film makers should be left alone to do just that. If the director had been told from the start that he was making a film for virtually prepubescent kids, he would either have changed his approach or walked away from the project altogether.

Not everything can be blamed on TPTB, however. There*has* to be a better way of depicting vampires without making them look like influencers before the blending! About as subtle as a bag of rocks to the head. It was particularly bad in Morbius, given that prosthetics have moved on apace since Bela Lugosi's day. Maybe they should look at films like ""Dracula, the Untold Story"" to see how menace can be achieved without reliance on purely black & white slap.

So far I've whinged about the shortcomings, but there were some pluses. Jared Leto was a pleasing mix of angst & fury &, if he's allowed, he could develope into a proper hero/villain. The action was frenetic & frequent, despite the choppiness that the studio forced on it by indiscriminate editing. So I'm not losing hope for the sequel. Just get in a new makeup dept & for the sake of everyone let it be a true R-rating.","7"
"s-lock","Stupidly nonsensical, yet somehow still boringly cliched","12 April 2022","OK You don't expect Hamlet going into a Marvel movie, and to be fair some of the set pieces work really well. Matt Smith strikes the right balance as the foil, ands for once Jared Leto is also reasonably understated, wisely relying on the effects and makeup to do the donkeywork. That about wraps up the good news.

Where to begin with the bad? I think the pseudo-science. Oh the pseudo-science. I get that there has to be a certain amount of gibberish and fudging for the origin story to work, but it seems like the writer only heard about DNA third hand from somebody describing a particularly dodgy episode of CSI.

I found myself constantly thinking (and quite possibly muttering) ""no they can't"", ""no it doesn't"" or ""no it wouldn't"" throughout the first third or so of the movie. The very first line uttered was ""vampire bats are tiny but they can take down an animal 10 times their size"". No they can't. And upon delivering this pearl of ""wisdom"" our hero cuts open his hand and thrusts it into the mouth of a cave full of them, which immediately awakens these apparently literal vampire bats and brings them flying out in exactly the kind of a feeding frenzy that they absolutely do not do, like some sort of flying piranhas.

The plot, once it gets going, oscillates between tired rehashes of age-old cliches and things that make no sense whatsoever, sometimes both at once. For example (*spoiler alert*) when his best friend inevitably becomes an inexplicably malevolent version of Morbius, there is also no explanation of how this was achieved without the same harrowing series of experiments and gradual changes under controlled laboratory conditions that Morbius underwent. When the clichéd pair of sick children living in the hospital undergoing gruelling daily treatment (and of course being bullied by healthy children for no apparent reason) grow to manhood, it's never explained how the pair of them survived even though it's explicitly stated that many others before them died. When Smith as the newly powered bad guy picks a fight in a bar by chatting up a Tough Guy's girl and insulting him, it's never explained how the Tough Guys in New York still haven't learned by now that every freak that does this has super powers, since at least 1986 when Jeff Goldlum did it in the remake of The Fly.

So yeah, no.","1"

"keithsealy","Watchable, but not a good movie","21 April 2022","Unlike many people, I don't have a problem with the acting. The problem I think lies in the writing, and by extension, the directing.

One important aspect of a good movie is that the characters changes over the course of the movie. They learn something, or become a better (or worse) person through the events of the story. Consider Thor, he learns to take responsibility. Or, Iron Man, he comes to realize the harm his weapons cause and so becomes a hero to fight his former customers.

There is no such ""lesson"" learned in Morbius. The Morbius at the end of this move is the essentially same person as he was at the start. Yes, he has become a vampire, but his vampirism doesn't fundamentally change his character. The same is true of every character in the movie. There is one moment in the movie where he loses control, but for the rest of the movie the 'struggle' against the beast within is largely is only implied.

This would have been a MUCH better movie if the villain was the beast within, and if Morbius cannot at first resist his urges, and then the movie is him overcoming them and finding an outlet for them. Instead, they keep Morbius fundamentally ""good"" and introduce another villain for him to battle. The end result is ultimately unsatisfying.","6"

I thought the Martine and Michael romance could've been given more care but also Michael and Milo's relationship. We could have seen more of them and how they got to where they were presently.

It's mostly crass, predictable and dull... but it's better than Venom.

I know, ""better than Venom"" is a very low bar. But I actually did watch Morbius all the way through. Venom (and its sequel) just had me fast forwarding chunks of it.

Although, I liked Leto as Morbius, far better than his joker performance, I think the character should've been developed more and had a better plot. The fight scenes with Milo were very hard to watch, I found myself a few times closing my eyes because of the difficulty to make out what was happening. And then the ending with Morbius meeting Vulture, he doesn't even know who Spider-Man is...very rushed and under developed set up for the sinister six.

The story seemed out of place with too many holes. Could have made better choices in several areas of the movie.

The biggest was probably the too earlier of a reveal of what Morbius was underneath. They should have done it classic. Show him struggle after the serum but come out of it like the experiment was a success. Having him discover his powers along the way and possibly might want to use them for good until the artificial blood didnt work and the beast inside started to take over. Having Matt Smith all of a sudden know where the serum was in the lab when he was only in there a short amount of time and didnt really understand what was going on.

That was the biggest problem. Too rushed and missed opportunities with character development and story. The SFX in the movie werent great, they should have come up with better way of showing his powers that must make it a trailing blur. Needed to stretch it out and make better decisions, could have been a good one.

Gave it a 5 because I have seen worse. They can maybe reinvent the character when the Blade movie comes around.","5"

"zebastianz","Better than the most marvel rubbish","6 April 2022","This film was a positive surprise. I don't usually watch superhero movies anymore because they always follow the same stupid plot. That's pretty much the case here, of course (weak protagonist gets a superpower and has to fight against suddenly empowered opponents), but there's more focus on character consideration than just a silly chain of boss fights like in all of them other Marvel films. The dark atmosphere suits the subject very well, the actors do a very good job for acting in a film for simple minds. Unfortunately, the characters all remain linear and one-dimensional, as we know it from American action films. Nevertheless, I am grateful to the production that, for once, it did without the umpteenth minute-long final fight and it was refreshingly short. Technically, everything also fitted very well into the overall picture. The special effects are only slightly exaggerated, and the craftsmanship is very good - this also applies to the director's work.","8"

"quiqueperique","It is not as bad. It is just mediocre","3 April 2022","Like many I wasn't expecting much from this, but I do belive everything deserves a chance and I thought this might surprise me. Well, it is not the worst I have seen but it is definetely not good.

The problem in my opinon is this movie lacks heart and spirit. It feels like it doesn't know where it wants to go. I didn't relate to any character or their motivations.

Everything felt kind of rushed and disconnected. Like we see the addoptive father in two scenes at the beggining, I even forgot about him, then reappears at the end only to die in the most cliché wey possible. I didn't feel It.

I didn't get the end with the girlfriend being now a vampire. Didn't she needed to be injected? I guess they never fully explained how the whole thing work, or if they did, I definetely missed It.

I tried to give this a chance but it ended up being as I expected, just bland.

It is not so terrible, it is watchable at least but it is not memorable.","5"

"tesheca","Great movie and Effects","11 September 2022","I'm 45 years old. Yes , a Jared Leto fan- however that didn't have a bearing on this rating. It's a good movie, good graphics and effects. Storyline was good also. The only con was that just when you think it ends, some scenes are embedded in between credits. Not sure why there's such a low rating on this site.

Basically, a self created vampire who has no control of his urges or strength. He morphs usually when hungry for what he calls ""red"", aka Blood. His childhood best friend steals the formula and also becomes a vampire. He seems to have more control over himself but he is a Renegade. No concern for others.","10"
"simsalabeem","Its morbin time! ;)","16 June 2022","Ouff.. how do I start with such a bad movie.

Everything is off with this movie.. from the over usage of CGI to bad story to plot holes to bad acting.

It was like Jared Leto didn't wanna be there, which I completely understand. That is why I give it 2 stars instead of 1 star.

No spoiler, but when he moves it becomes a smoke of the same color whatever his clothes are... what where they thinking with that. 🤣 Its not even tracers... its literally a smoke.. so its not because of he moves so fast... well I have no idea what they were trying to show.

Besides that, it had a lot corny dialogues.

And the story was lame, like they were trying too much without thinking.

He is expert of everything and yet, there is nothing to back this up.

One example is, he is this extraordinary scientist who develops this cure.. but you dont even get to know what disease its for or how he comes up with the cure.

Everything just happens without any explanation (no spoiler because he is a biochemist and biologist in the comic)","2"

Michael Morbius manager his illnes of a rare blood disorder. And it's evident that no CGI. Was actually used in the film. All of it is real. Spoiler alerta, but one of my favorite scenes is when the character does a funny dance. Definetly the most underrated movies of all time.","10"
"polathou","A cinematic masterpiece","20 May 2023","Allow me to expound upon the subject of my preferences and provide a comprehensive analysis of the statement pertaining to my utmost admiration for the cinematic masterpiece known as ""Morbius."" This statement signifies a deeply rooted appreciation and affinity for the aforementioned film, which stems from a multitude of factors that collectively contribute to its elevated status within my personal hierarchy of cinematic experiences. ""Morbius,"" directed by a talented filmmaker, encompasses a captivating narrative that seamlessly interweaves various thematic elements, including but not limited to introspection, morality, transformation, and the eternal struggle between good and evil.

The film's visual aesthetics, meticulously crafted through a harmonious synthesis of cinematography, production design, and visual effects, transport the viewer to a mesmerizing realm wherein the boundaries of reality and fiction merge. The auditory dimension of ""Morbius"" further enhances its impact, as a meticulously composed score, encompassing a symphony of emotions, resonates deeply within the recesses of the human psyche, effectively engendering a multisensory experience that transcends mere celluloid.

Furthermore, the film's impeccable casting, featuring highly accomplished actors who bring their characters to life with an unparalleled level of nuance, complexity, and depth, serves as a testament to the artistic prowess and collaborative genius behind the production. The performances in ""Morbius"" not only capture the essence of the characters but also elicit a profound emotional response within the audience, evoking empathy, admiration, and a heightened sense of connection.

In essence, my proclamation that ""Morbius"" reigns supreme as my favorite film exemplifies a profound appreciation for the harmonious convergence of various artistic disciplines, the exploration of profound thematic concepts, and the indelible impact it has left upon my cinematic sensibilities. This accolade stands as a testament to the film's undeniable craftsmanship, its ability to elicit a myriad of emotions, and its enduring resonance within the annals of cinema as a transcendent and enduring masterpiece.","10"
"zarcos-01818","With great power comes great responsibility...","26 December 2022","That line may work here, as the movie turns out to present a hero and a vilain, both coming from similar backgrounds, and both having to carry the same curse. The former assumes responsibility, and the latter uses it to exact revenge.

The movie is generally well constructed, although it feels somewhat rushed. We don't feel a strong connection between the characters. Neither with the love relationship nor with friendship. Maybe it's the choice of the cast, maybe it's something else.

The special effects work well enough and they translate well the newly acquired powers.

All in all, it's an entertaining movie for a night watch, but falls short on character interaction and development.","6"

Sad that it was delayed so much, since it would have been much better if it came out before the Spiderman and avenger movies, i think the close downs of the theatres might be the reason behind it.

It's not as perfect as the avenger og spiderman movies., but as it might sound, mostly thanks to Leto's general gravitas and a supervillain (Matt Smith from ""The Crown"") thoroughly enjoying his own personal discoveries.","10"

The Bad: the writing was terrible. Whoever wrote this script should quit and go back to washing windows or whatever will prevent them from ever punishing an audience again with their lack of talent.

I definitely expected worse while watching the movie based on the amount of people saying it sucked but it wasn't as bad as i had prepared myself for. I know that people are quick to blame the acting or actors for a terrible movie but tryst that in this case it was the writers.","6"

No, let's go straight to character A: suicide and character B: serial but also mass murder. And character B is the one you root for, since he (Matt Smith) is the only one who has fun and is likeable.

Generic I'm-a-doctor female character is only there as a soundboard/girlfriend/fridge girl. Five steps back in that regard.

The whole advertisement for the movie was a bold faced lie, no connections to Marvel, it's another Sony desaster they knew was too bad to stand on its own.

"Sam56800","Forgettable","23 May 2022","Cliched writing and storyline. Over-simplified scenes, characters, animal behaviour, depiction of science, and everything else. Characters are hastily introduced, dialogue fails to capture any emotion or depth, tries too hard to induce emotion by including random quips of ""woke"" culture, and the overall progression of the movie fails to capture attention. The only upside is it's not a CGI-fest like recent MCU movies where the entire film is removed from any semblance of reality, with time travel, teleportation, alternate realities, and outlandish characters all around.","2"

"Vises","Honest review of Morbius","27 May 2022","Finally got around to this... everything wrong about this film could be summed up very easily and there's no one else to point the finger at but Sony... they just don't know what they're doing.

The failings of Morbius do not lie with the cast. In fact, the movie was pretty well cast imo. Tyrese seemed unnecessary. Too recognizable an actor to have such a small role; a bit distracting.

The treatment of the material and the approval of such a thin script are the major issues. Leto has been on the receiving end of some stick for not being bankable as a comic-adapted actor but Zack Synder's Justice League proved that his Joker is pretty awesome in its own way, and The Suicide Squad [Director's Cut] may support that if it sees the light of day 🤞🏼(c'mon HBOMax)

First off, the setting of the movie should have remained in Europe. The Americanization of the majority of the film - especially the climax - was too glossy and cliche. Matt Smith's wardrobe was laughable. The CGI, while at times stunning, was overdone and very choppy.

For the palette of the Marvel-cinema-fan, a less grotesque version of Morbius' vampire may have gone over better and also more digestible to the average movie goer.

There is a very important rule in making commercial vampire fare: either go for the romantic or go for broke a la Blade (1998). Morbius tried to straddle both visions and ended up a mess. It didn't appeal to the romantic in me neither the horror fan. A more weighted score may also have added some much needed texture.

The runtime was also woefully short and motivations and gravitas were lacking throughout. But I guess for those who paid to see it, the runtime was a blessing.

Leto is too good of an actor to be saddled with such garbage. I hope that another director, with a more patient and evolved sensibility can right this franchise and resuscitate it because I would definitely love to see more of Leto in the role but Sony needs to smarten the f#%* up.

"violet_toni","Has Marvel lost the plot","29 May 2022","I was excited about a Morbius movie as he's one of the most interesting characters. I could see the potential and hoped this would be a gateway to bring Blade into the Marvel universe finally (instead we only get a hint in post credit scenes in Eternals) and while there were moments that were almost brilliant (the hand breaking scene), nothing was fully formed. Character development was wishy washy and some characters seemed quite pointless. Jared Leto always seems a bit self satisfied usually to give a truly engaging performance but I actually think he was perfect for the role of Morbius (if a little too pretty) and as much as I adore Matt Smith, he seemed terribly miscast as the villain. All in all, I didn't hate it and it's not the worst comic book movie I've seen (prize goes to Wonder Woman 1984) but it could have been so much better with a more rounded script and a better villain (if they kept to the character of Hunger e.g)","4"

I cannot believe that superhero movies have returned to their terrible ways. This equation can only get you so far, and with all these negative aspects I think it might be the worse thing I have watched along with Venom. These funny one off cops or detectives are becoming tiresome as well.

I sincerely suggest movies like this should be targeted for the adult audience, since 2 vampires killing people on will needs some kind of adult-worthy content. Everything feels flat when people try to take out the content to replace it with cringeworthy pg-13 content. Especially that dance scene was absolute garbage.

Ii. How Bancroft revived? Was she infected from Milo or Morbius?

Iii. How the Morbius could use the bat army against Milo? As both were having the same bat gene in them. Why Milo could not control the bats like Morbius did?

"imdb-211","The Allure of a Modern-Day Seagal Movie","28 May 2022","Look, I think we all know that you don't visit the cinema to watch this movie in the same way you visit the Louvre to look at the Mona Lisa. This is more akin to a trip to the station to check out the train wreck. You watch a flick with Jared Leto for the same reason you watch a modern-day Steven Seagal flick: you want to see just how terribly he did - and if you get some entertainment out of the whole charade, that's a bonus.

Leto mumbles and shuffles his way through this movie with his usual utter ineptitude, and looks very pretty for the camera, so if you came here to see Jared Leto play Jared Leto while pretending to be a method actor playing a vampire, you'll get exactly what you want out of this.

Fortunately, there are also some genuinely good actors in this movie. Seeing Matt Smith ham it up is a pure joy, and the weird special effects barely detract from that. Adria Arjona deserves more recognition for carrying much of the film (as well as dragging a seemingly half asleep Leto through all the scenes they share).

I wish there was more of a plot and more world building, and I wish Smith had more screen time, but I also wish they'd cast an actual actor to play Morbius, and written a screenplay that had something - anything! - to do with the comic books, and had special effects that don't look like a mid-tier Netflix show. Obviously, we don't always get what we wish for.

Is this a good movie? Of course not. Was I entertained throughout its 100 minutes? Yes. And that's, to be honest, more than I expected.","6"

Scenes felt like they were being dragged out and they just wouldn't get to the point. Marvel gave the opportunity to Sony Pictures and yet they couldn't deliver what fans were looking for. The worst part is probably how they tried introducing Morbius into MCU by having Vulture somehow ending up in his universe. It doesn't make sense at all and yet I blame Marvel for giving that type of freedom to the writers.","4"
"shadowwalkerrock","If you like plots driven by weak mechanisms/coincidence..","5 April 2022","Without spoiling anything I'll say the entire plot of the movie is driven by repeated complete coincidences, as in this couldn't have happened without the most absolutely perfect coincidences occurring.

Plus the entire 3rd act completely negates what was done as a protective move in the 2nd act.

Also this movie is almost an exact clone of Venom 2 with minor different details that obviously go with the different characters ;but if you break it down to the basics they're the same movies and Morbius also feels like it was cut short with essentially 30 minute acts that feel super rushed (despite the years they put into making this movie).

This movie feels like it was forced in order to setup The Sinister Six where Sony can cash in on Spiderman's involvement.

I prefer dark superhero movies over any others ;but this didn't provide any entertainment value or offer anything new to the conversation except vampires.","5"

"matthewgp-55689","I've never Morbid HARDER in my life","12 June 2022","By far the GREATEST Morbius film of all time This film has singlehandedly changed my life. Now I truly understand why this film earned $17.3 Morbillion day of release. Jared Leto' was not playing Morbius, Morbius was playing him, the writing was the most writing I've ever had the honor if witnessing, the moment Dr. Micheal Morbius said ""it's Morbin time"" I was both shook AND in tears. Truly I've been touched by the glory that is Micheal Morbius and the power of the Morbius Sweep.

At this point Morbius isn't a movie. It's a lifestyle. Ever since my first viewing I've seen Morbius 47 times and plan to buy this film so I can see it more than ever before.

This film is must watch, show it to your friends, show it to your grandparents, show it to you parents, your kids, your pets, any living being. Not just for them but for yourself.","10"

That way The story is pretty simple, predictable but for me the horror scene is great, Round opponent, good CGI, the visuals really surprised me. I'm ready enjoy it. Maybe many can't accept this film because of its storyline easy. Yes! I'm angry why so many scenes in the trailer don't come in included in this movie? 60% of the scenes in the movie trailer are not dimmed (a) Can last 2 hours more. That invites anger That fan. They use Spider-Man to do it movie promotion is. The part that disappointed me was the last credit scene. Why? Just why? 'Turn off continues (5) So my rating for this film is 7/o *. It's fun. A fun popcorn movie. If you digest the movie Venom: Let There Be Carnage means you can digest nied movies. This movie is not garbage. It's an okay 👍🏻","10"
"mbramsaur","Morbius","2 April 2022","Get ready for another Sony film focused on a complicated villain who's also a good guy.

This film had some good aspects, such as great visuals, some decent action, a lot of suspense, heart-pounding sound effects, and a great performance by Jared Leto and the rest of the cast.

The overall film was okay, it reminded me a lot of the blade films, but it was much better. Because it actually had a decent story: Dr Morbius spends his entire life to find a cure for his rare illness that he and his best friend have, but when he finally finds the cure with the help of certain bats, he also finds a horrible curse. He has to consume blood every few hours, but of course, he doesn't want to kill anyone at the same time. But the other side of him can't help but to hunt and kill and consume blood.

I'd give this film a 5 because it wasn't good but it wasn't bad, it had some good qualities, but it seemed like a typical storyline about a guy who turns into a vampire, but still, it's the best vampire film I've seen.","5"
"noahmoon","So breathtakingly bad that one of my friends fell asleep watching it.","17 April 2022","The acting was good, as was the premise, and the effects would have been bearable if the story was good, but the writing failed everyone involved in the film's production. Those writers (if they can even be called writers) should be fired.

The story was lackluster, and the plot was predictable; so predictable that I could predict all of the ""twists"" from around the twenty minute mark. The character development was unbearably bad; why did Milo turn out the way he did? He was never really shown to be jealous or violent in the beginning, save for a single scene. I would put a spoiler warning, but viewers will be able to deduce what I've said after watching the first three minutes anyway.

This film could have been really good. The cast seemed right and the actors looked to have given it their all, but those brainless idiots who wrote the film let down the entire company. Without good writing, a film can't even be ok, and this was downright dogwater.

Would not recommend watching, though if you need a good sleep it would be advisable to sit in the cinema. After about five minutes, you will literally be in a coma.","1"

"leqesai","A middling Sony superhero movie","5 June 2022","It should come as no surprise to anyone that movies produced by Sony are middling, at best. Morbius is no exception. The premise is solid but there isn't a whole lot Sony can do with the character given its limited pool of Marvel properties.

Morbius is a film that should have come out 5 years later. Similar to Venom, one of the key players in the Morbius mythos is not present (Spiderman). So what we're left with is an origin story to a character that exists in the same universe as Venom but without Spiderman. We're also presented with a villain that, as far as I know, doesn't exist in the comics. Whereas fans of Spiderman were elated to see multiple universes come together in No Way Home, Morbius feels incredibly isolated.

Sony simply can't produce quality super hero movies, it seems. Morbius tries hard to be violent and action-packed but has issues with pacing, motivation and relevance.

On the up side, Jared Leto does a fine job as Morbius. They kept the design fairly consistent with the comics but as I've already mentioned isolated the character without the appropriate pool of Marvel side characters to work with.

The runtime is short enough that you can watch Morbius without losing much of your day and it isn't bad enough to avoid. Morbius is just expectedly disappointing coming from Sony.

If you set your expectations low and avoid the troll reviews you may enjoy Morbius. Just know it, like Venom, appears to be too isolated to engage with the greater Marvel story arcs and characters.","6"
"Brian_Ergo","Underwhelming...","6 April 2022","I give this movie a 6 because it was entertaining, although it was very underwhelming compared to what I was hoping for this movie. I went to see it hoping to see a grounded take on the anti-hero, but it was another generic popcorn flick by Sony, in the same style of their Venom films of course.

I liked Jared Leto's performance and he was a cool character, but it wasn't an original approach to the story. I actually was expecting some Spider-Man connections and references to whatever universe, and The Vulture being part of more scenes in the movie, but most of it was just cut or added to the mid-credits scene.

Still, it's not a bad movie per se, just a mindless and generic film of the bunch from Sony. I would recommend to anyone who likes dark-toned movies or vampire stuff, just don't expect a solid film.","6"

You're in hiding but the only thing you do to disguise yourself is put your hood up which you then take it down in a public café?

The police seem too useless and there is no way Morbius would have been charged for murder based on the evidence they had. No-one seemed to mention his super powers despite seeing them, they were just ignored and Morbius was treated like a normal suspect.

The plot was really predictable from the outset and the film just suddenly seemed to end quite abruptly. A really disappointing watch!","4"

For me the movie was pretty bad. I don't need my narrative spoon fed, and dialogue that echoes the action is boring. The special effects were good, but I was sorry to see A listers like Matt Smith and Mr. Leto add this mess to their portfolios. No problem with the acting, just the script.

Mostly I think Morbius will become a cult fav for Leto fans. It's so predictable and superficial I see no other value.","2"

The only really good performance here was by Jared Harris. There's no chemistry between any of the cast. It's a good story, but it's terribly told, and the pacing is all wrong. The only genuinely good thing about this film was the special effects.

"gaxiola_fk","Barely interesting.","7 April 2022","Morbius I was barely interested in this film when it finally came out. I think that Morbius is a barely entertaining movie, the characters are quickly developed to get to the climax and there are no reasons for the main villain to be bad, actually, there's no build for Milo, he's bad because reasons. Not to mention that this is a movie about a villain itself, so this make me wonder if producing solo movies for them is as integrating as combining them with spider-man. This solo villains have no porpuse in their world and there's no real challenge for their feats. I had some issues with the last vampire transformation and how it happened too. I don't recommend this to my biutyful gf.","5"

I think Marvel should give it a rest now. Halfway through the movie there was no identifiable villain and it was obvious who the villain was going to be and how the plot was going to unfold.

There has been many excellent vampire movies and each had its own flavour. From Interview with a Vampire, Vampires, Blade, Dracula the 2020 remake, Underworld, each of these were classics. In a way I think that they wanted to create a comic feel to the movie and failed dismally to transport us to a place where we can be entertained.","2"

"morbiusfan2023","Morbius (2022) is the greatest movie ever created.","22 October 2022","After due consideration, I have determined that Morbius (2022) is an important film, perhaps the most important film of the 21st century. What writers Burl Sharpless and Matt Samaza (the creative masterminds who penned the widely misunderstood Gods of Egypt (2016) and the vastly underrated Dracula Untold (2014)) have done here is nothing short of commendable. Director Daniel Espinosa (who also helmed sci-fi gem Life (2017)) brilliantly brings this material to life with his artful direction; the brooding and dark cinematography brilliantly conveys the theme of bats, and is at times reminiscent of the work of Argentõ. Samaza and Sharpless also made the brilliant decision to keep the length at a brisk and efficacious 1h 44m, as they trust the viewer to be intelligent enough to fill in the gaping holes in the plot (after all nothing is as terrifying as ones own imagination). This provides time for far more necessary scenes such as when the villain (brilliantly brought to life by Matt Smith) dances while putting in a well fitted suit; I found this scene in particular to be a wonderful demonstration of milo's carefully executed character growth from a harmless cripple to eccentric vampire with the disposition of a true thespian of the silent era. Jared Leto gives perhaps his most brilliant performance since Chapter 27 (2007) as Dr. Michael Morbius. I also greatly admired the parallels Samaza and Sharpless drew between the Morbius and Nieztche's concept of the Übermensch (certainty a rarity for superhero fanfares). I also picked up hints of Cain and Abel in Morbius and Milo's relationship (after all, is this not a biblical story at heart?). Unfortunately, I cannot delve further into the story so as not to rotten the experience of those uninitiated to Morbius (2022), but needless to say the atypical structure of the second half can only be compared to the works of new wave directors like Godard and Truffaut. I implore any and all to seek out Morbius(2022). Although Morbius (2022) seems to have completely flown over most critics heads, Audiences are responding to the film in a way not scene since before the pandemic, and I personally have complete faith that Morbius will become a cult classic in the coming years.","10"
"christenmestre","Best DC film after BM Begins series","22 July 2023","IDK why this movie has gotten such terrible reviews, the action starts right away and yet you feel you know the characters well enough to care about them. The Morbius character is deeply complex as is his struggle. He is written as a villain, but creates such empathy with viewers that it's difficult putting him in that category.

I used to be a 3-D animator and the special effects in this film are phenomenal especially the transitions between Jared Leto's real face and the 3-D Morbius face.

Jared Leto doesn't disappoint in his portrayal nor the lengths he went with his drastic IRL weight loss and bill up for this role. He did a great job with the dialogue provided.

I've watched this 3 times now and will watch it again before I would ever watch most of the other DC movies (with the exception of the first Wonder Woman movie). I couldn't even get past minute 15 of Aquaman and that one rated much higher by critics than this one... baffling.","10"

The shadow effects when fighting just blur the stunts
All the stupid moves and dancing by Matt Smith / Mylo are just embarrassing
""I would of prepared a dinner"" what a rubbish line. No one would ever have said that hivenbthe situation. Just there to shoehorn in the following stupid line
Who's been feeding the bats while the labs been cordoned off by the police?


Who cuts themselves when they're opening a can these days?? Leto nearly turns into a vampire when she spills a drop of blood 10 feet away but not when Nicholas is covered in claret right in front of him...
The two cops are shocking. Terrible characters and just not funny
Terrible dialogue throughout

It is pretty predictable, though, but I don't mind being correct in my assumptions of what's going to happen next! :) The special FX are cool, IMHO, especially the fight scenes in slo-mo! All in all, it's a pretty good movie, it's not too long, and it leaves room for a second movie like pretty much ALL Marvel flicks, which is intriguing to me, so I would watch if they do proceed with this dark ""Super Hero"" in a second movie. My way of looking at it is to take all of these movie reviews with a grain of salt; watch the movie and judge for yourself! :)","9"

"johndwagnerii","Forgettable","2 April 2022","This is the kind of movie where if you left to go to the bathroom at any point during the movie, you wouldn't have missed anything important.

This was a very basic comic book movie with a very shallow plot and not even that great of a concept.","3"
"jburrough-19517","Fun movie","7 July 2022","Morbius wasn't acknowledged as an accomplishment like the other popular comics. However, I like how Sony had the guts to put this film together. One of my favorite Marvel movies. The F/X were great if not overdone, and Leto was perfect in the lead role. I hope Marvel does Morbius justice by creating a Part 2 with Spider-Man as the lead nemesis and Morbius the overtone being Morbius fighting his eternal battle betweeen good and bad. Would be an interesting follow-up to the intro. Great job!,,","8"
"lowerycc","Great movie about research gone wrong","16 April 2022","I really liked this movie. Jared Leto was great. Science gone wrong can still be a good thing unless it falls into the wrong hands like Morbius' friend. The once victim becomes a true monster.","10"
"john_carlton02","Morbiusly dull and plodding","15 May 2022","Even Matt Smith couldn't save this exceedingly boring origin story. There were no real surprises and the plot was pretty easy to guess. The SFX were pretty good, and managed to get Morbius' vampire look in what I thought was a comic accurate way. Ultimately, the viewer is left empty and wondering what else their time could have been better spent on.

The only REMOTELY interesting was the post-credits teaser for presumably the next ""divorced from the MCU"" (ala Spider-Man: No Way Home) Spider-Man movie.","3"
"njkingshott","Awful, clunky and fast","31 March 2022","Everything in this film goes quick. Nothing seems to be really explained and the acting is just poor. No connection with anyone really. Only redemming factor is Jared Leto puts in an okay performance.","1"
